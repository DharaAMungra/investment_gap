# investment_gap
For the project we have used dataset from the website "https://federalreporter.nih.gov/". I have downloaded all the project data (both the cost related and the abstract related) and this dataset is further used for the creation of category based database and the analysis

Folder "Category data extraction" contains jupyter notebook "investment gaps files processing" that contains code to retrieve and merge cost related and abstract data for each of the project for each of the category. Files obtained from this jupyter notebook are also present in the folder.

Folder "Dataset" contains the jupyter notebook "Remove Duplicates" that removes the project with zero funding and are duplicates. All the csv file corresposnding to this are also present in the folder. These are the files which are used for the final analysis.

Folder "Analysis" contains the notebook presenting the analysis done for each category.
