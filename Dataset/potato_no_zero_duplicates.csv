This project will provide basic information on insect mycoses and lead to incorporation of fungi as tools in pest management. Fungi used in this way will provide safe, effective biological alternatives to synthetic chemical insecticides. Laboratory research will be focused on factors that affect fungal viability, infectivity and insect susceptibility. We will also study fungal strain differentiation to facilitate identification of isolates recovered from test plots and evaluate the probability and consequences of strain recombination in vivo and in vitro. In studies of greenhouse crops, we will determine effectiveness of fungi against aphids on a variety of bedding and potted flowering plants of commercial importance in the Northeast. We will determine the effectiveness of commercially available and novel fungal strains and evaluate the suitability of integrating fungi with other biocontrol agents for more effective control. In field studies with the Colorado potato beetle on potatoes, we will investigate alternative application schemes for fungi and determine the efficacy of interactions of fungi with other pest control methods. We will use this field system as a model to evaluate the impact of inundative releases of a fungal biocontrol agent on indigenous conspecific strains. Findings will aid in assessing risks associated with this approach to microbial control.

This knowledge is critical to the development of effective and sustainable control strategies, and obtaining this knowledge has become more imperative due to recent events. The emergence of new pathotypes of the golden potato cyst nematode (GN, Globodera rostochiensis), has raised new concerns about the ability of scientists and regulatory agencies to detect the nematode and about the continued effectiveness of current quarantine and management strategies. Similarly, national surveys of Potato virus Y (PVY) in seed potato production areas indicate an increase in the genetic diversity of PVY and emergence of necrotic forms of the virus. All of these findings are restricting interstate and international movement of potatoes. Over the next 5 years we will focus on the following objectives: Objective 1: Improved detection and characterization of emerging pathotypes of the GN and emerging strains of PVY. Sub-objective 1.A. Develop molecular markers that differentiate pathotypes of the GN based on divergence in nematode parasitism gene sequences.Sub-objective 1.B. Determine the geographic and genetic distribution of PVY strains affecting the U.S. potato crop and develop improved diagnostic assays.Objective 2: Identification and characterization of genes regulating the pathogenicity and transmission of viruses and nematodes affecting potato, and viruses affecting small grains.  Sub-objective 2.A. Identify and characterize nematode parasitism genes. Sub-objective 2.B. Identify and characterize aphid and virus genes regulating virus transmission.  Objective 3: Development of industry and consumer acceptable potato genotypes that express novel or improved resistance to virus and nematode pathogens.Approach:Genetic diversity and diagnostic studies will identify differences in nematode parasitism genes that may be involved in pathogenicity or virulence/avirulence of the nematode. This information will be used to develop molecular diagnostic tools that will distinguish these two pathotypes. Serological, biological, and molecular characteristics of PVY isolates representative of each state, potato variety and production area will be used to group virus isolates and develop improved diagnostic assays to detect the strains of the virus that are potentially the most economically damaging in terms of yield and trade.  Functional studies of pathogenicity and transmission genes will focus on secretory proteins encoded by parasitism genes expressed within the nematodeÆs esophageal gland cells known to be the principal molecular signals regulating both pathogenicity and virulence/avirulence of the nematode; as well as on aphid genes expressed in gut and salivary tissues whose products interact with specific domains on the two virus structural proteins. Genomic and proteomic based technologies will be employed to identify and characterize nematode and aphid proteins, and determine their functional role in the host-parasite/pathogen interaction. The development of nematode resistant potato varieties will focus on conventional breeding practices to transfer known nematode resistance genes to new germplasm with improved horticultural traits. Transgenic technologies will be used to isolate potato genes required by viral pathogens for replication, modify these potato genes and re-introduce them into accepted potato varieties so the altered forms no longer support virus replication."

Over the next 5 years we will focus on the following objectives: Objective 1: Use P. syringae pv. syringae B728a genomic expression chips to identify and characterize genes regulated by the gacS/gacA two-component regulatory system. Sub-objective 1.A. Use genomic expression chips to identify the members of the gacA/gacS transcriptome that are regulated under a variety of growth conditions. Sub-objective 1.B. Functional genomic analysis of gacS/gacA regulated genes.Objective 2: Develop and analyze transgenic plants expressing a viral protein that may inhibit Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) transmission by thrips.Sub-objective 2.A. Develop real-time RT-PCR methodologies to quantitate TSWV  replication in host plants and the thrips vector. Sub-objective 2.b. Construct and characterize transgenic tomato plants expressing the TSWV glycoprotein GN-S.Approach:For Objective 1: Bacterial growth conditions that will be analyzed include varying pH, iron availability and liquid vs. solid media. These growth conditions are all known to affect the growth of bacteria on plants. High quality RNA will be prepared using standard bacterial protocols. RNAs will be used to probe commercially available genomic expression arrays containing oligo DNA markers for all 3,840 genes within the B728a genome. Reproducibility will be ensured by having standardized hybridization protocols performed by the vendor, with the chip data processed by the SY using proprietary software. Changes in gene expression will be confirmed using real-time RT-PCR. Genes that show differential expression under the various growth conditions will be mutated and their effect on plant virulence determined.For Objective 2: All three TSWV RNA contain very similar but not identical sequences at their ends. We will use these end sequences to design primers that are specific to either the genomic RNA (contained in the viral particle) or anti-genomicRNA (necessary for replication) to produce cDNA specific to that RNA. We will determine the amounts of viral message RNA species by using random hexamers to generate cDNA. The viral RNA within each cDNA will be quantitated by real-time PCR using our standard protocols. The amount of each RNA species will be determined by using a standard curve consisting of a dilution series of cloned viral DNA of known concentration. As a preliminary to the analsysis of TSWV, we will determine the relative amounts of genomic, anti-genomic, and viral mRNAs expressed by the maize pathogen Maize fine streak virus. MFSV is a mono-partite negative-sense virus that contains only a single RNA genome and avoids the complexity of distinquishing three RNA genomes containing related sequences as is the case with TSWV.We have shown that feeding thrips a modified form of the TSWV glycoprotein GN (designated GN-S) dramatically inhibits the acquisition of the virus and the ability of the thrips to transmit the virus. This most likely is due to the saturation of viral binding sites within the thrips guts by GN-S thus preventing viral binding and transport of the TSWV virion through the intestinal lining. We will express the GN-S protein in potato and other hosts to establish that this protein can inhibit the acquisition and transmission of TSWV when expressed within the plant. The GN-S ORF will be cloned into an Agrobacterium vector. This construct will be either transiently expressed using an Agro launching technique or transformed into a susceptible host. Plants will be analyzed for GN-S gene expression using real-time RT-PCR and GN-S protein expression by western blot. Thrips will be fed on transiently expressing leaf discs or transformed plants showing a high level of expression of the GN-S protein for a two hour acquisition period and then moved to TSWV infected hosts. Acquisition of TSWV by thrips will be analyzed using real-time RT-PCR and transmission of TSWV to host plants will be quantitated using a leaf disc or green house assay."

The research project had three specific objectives.Objective 1 was to determine if mice that lack a subpopulation of T lymphocytes known as TCR&gamma;&delta;+ T cells, are more sensitive to food allergens than mice with an intact TCR&gamma;&delta;+ T cell population. The rationale for this objective was that the increased susceptibility would allow the induction of food allergy without the use of (mucosal) adjuvants and enhance the ability to discriminate between allergic and non-allergic foods. Mice with a genetically determined deficiency in TCR&gamma;&delta;+ T cells and mice treated with anti-TCR&gamma;&delta;+ antibodies were used and compared with wild-type mice.Objective 2 was to determine if oral administration of food proteins to mice can discriminate between allergenic and non-allergenic proteins. To address this objective, three genetically different strains of mice were compared for the ability to generate IgE antibodies following oral administration of known food allergens (peanut protein and ovalbumin), but not following feeding of non-allergenic proteins (spinach and potato protein).Objective 3 was to identify early biomarkers of food allergenicity in mice that shorten the exposure protocol and increase the sensitivity of the mouse model. This work was done by analysis of global gene expression in the spleen and duodenum using microarrays following oral administration of known food allergens in comparison with the appropriate controls."

Rao (Iowa State University), Jeff Coller (Case Western Reserve University), William J. Lucas (University of California, Davis)Plants perceive outside signals that activate pathways to control their defenses and growth. The length of daylight or photoperiod is a key signal that regulates growth processes like flowering in many plants and tuber formation in potato. Tuber formation in potato involves the transport of a light-activated signal from the leaf to the underground organ, the potato tuber. The overall scientific objective of this project is to study the range of signals that are responsible for controlling tuber formation. Signals involved in this process include both proteins and RNA. Two research goals will be addressed in this project: 1) To identify and characterize RNAs of potato that are transported from the leaf to the underground tuber and 2) To identify proteins that work with the RNAs to facilitate this transport. Several approaches will be undertaken to implement these research goals, including the systematic characterization of the network of RNAs and proteins present in this transport system. Proteins and RNAs will be identified and tested for their function in this signaling system. The primary goal of this project is to understand how this collection of signals regulates tuber formation. The utility of this research activity is that the information generated by these experiments will have direct applications for enhancing crop productivity. The broader scientific impacts resulting from this research activity are inherent in the enhancement of our understanding of how plants use light signals to control their growth and, for agronomic crops, to affect their yield. A significant component of this project is the educational and outreach features. The educational component will be implemented through the Summer Internship program that will provide high school and undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate in plant biology projects. As a component of outreach training, summer internships for high school biology teachers will also be offered. These teachers will work with project leaders on the Iowa State, UC-Davis, or Case Western Reserve campuses to learn more about plant biology. By targeting high school teachers who may teach up to 100 students a year, the influence of this program will be greatly expanded and will fulfill a primary mission of NSF; to communicate to society the significance of the outcomes of current research in plant biology. The international component of this project will expand the breadth of training available through this initiative and enhance global awareness of the scientific challenges addressed in this research. This project includes ample opportunities for participation by women and underrepresented groups in laboratory research. Project outcomes will be made available to the scientific community through a project website, which will be accessible via http://www.hort.iastate.edu/research/research-detail.php?id=1148."

At the Tuskegee University (TU) and many institutions of higher education integration of bioinformatics and computational skills into the biology undergraduate curricula is an enterprise still in its infancy. This project advances that enterprise through development of a two-course sequence and five modules on bioinformatics and computing. These emphasize computational thinking and skills, provide students with hands-on experiences and a collaborative learning environment based on case studies and team projects, and rely on new learning enhancement software tools, instructional materials and lab manuals developed specifically for this project. Case study examples include identifying the alleles and paralogs of disease resistance genes in the sweet potato genome and mutation probablility and frequency during aging in the yeast.Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project lies in its initiative to develop materials and methods for teaching computational thinking to students in life sciences, its effort to develop comprehensive computer laboratory exercises that offer hands-on learning experience for the targeted student pool, and a case-study course design that challenges students to solve interesting problems in a collaborative learning environment. The project is designed to: promote excitement about computing in the minds of students in the life sciences; lead to student growth through interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary experiences; encourage students to apply computation in their individual research projects; and cultivate student interest in pursuing research careers.  Broader Impacts: The newly developed modules, instructional materials and educational software tools are impacting more than 100 students per year at TU, a historically black college.  The courses developed are being offered as science electives to students in the Department of Computer Science and to bioinformatics concentrators in the Department of Chemistry. The broader impacts of this project include student experiences, curricula improvement, faculty development, and the potential for adoption and adaptation by other institutions of the material and the way it is being integrated into courses. The activities are also increasing faculty collaboration among the departments of Biology, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. In addition, the modular nature of the developed teaching materials is facilitating their dissemination outside of TU, thus enhancing the curricula at other institutions. The reliance on R, an open-source cross-platform computing environment, and other open-source software is contributing to the broader impacts of this project. Dissemination of the generated teaching materials is being facilitated by a dedicated website http://bioinformatics.org/ctls/ (Computational Thinking in Life Sciences), developed and maintained by the PI."

Through participation in the international Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium (PGSC), it will generate Genome Survey Sequences and a draft sequence of chromosome VI. This sequence, along with other potato genome sequence generated by the PGSC, will be annotated for genes and other features, and made available through a web-based portal for scientists to enable scientists to further their work on potato biology and production. Under-represented undergraduates will be trained through a project specific internship program. The general public will be educated in genomics through an educational exhibit in collaboration with the US Botanical Garden that demonstrates challenges in potato and agricultural production and how science, including genomics, can meet these challenges. Access to project outcomesSequence data from this project will be made available to the public through Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html) and the project website (accessible through http://www.tigr.org/plantProjects.shtml) and annotation data will be made available through the project website."

It is part of a comprehensive, integrated structural analysis of the filamentous plant viruses, aimed at explaining the processes of viral infection, dissemination, and host interactions, and understanding the relationships among these important viruses. The viruses to be studied include members of the potexvirus, potyvirus, and closterovirus groups. The potexviruses are of great significance as models for fundamental virology and cell biology; they have enormous potential in biotechnology, and they are of considerable importance for the damage they cause in agriculture. The potyviruses are responsible for half the viral crop damage in the world, and are of interest because of their close relationship to the animal rhinoviruses (responsible for such diverse conditions as the common cold, polio, and foot-and-mouth disease). The closteroviruses are also of major agricultural significance. To utilize the full potential of the flexible filamentous viruses as models and in biotechnology, and to combat their effects in agriculture, knowledge of three-dimensional structures in atomic detail is required. Apart from this group's preliminary results, there are no three-dimensional structures known for any flexible filamentous virus. Virus structures to be determined will include the most important of the potexviruses, potato virus X, as well as the potyviruses soybean mosaic virus and wheat streak mosaic virus and the closterovirus beet yellows virus. Structures will be determined by cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray fiber diffraction; models derived from cryo-electron microscopy will be used as starting points for more detailed analysis using fiber diffraction data. Fiber diffraction specimen preparation methods developed in this laboratory have greatly improved the quality of data from potexviruses and potyviruses; before this project began, no useful diffraction data had been obtained from potyviruses. Broader impacts will be through the integration of research and education, and through the application of this research to new developments in crop protection and plant biotechnology, particularly in the production of pharmacologically useful products. This laboratory has a strong program of involvement of undergraduates and K-12 teachers in research, and the project activities will include undergraduates, graduate students, and K-12 teachers and students."

One branch of the plant immune system is mediated through disease resistance genes.  The most common type of disease resistance genes encode what are known as NB-LRR proteins.  Plant genomes encode hundreds of different NB-LRR proteins which specifically recognize different pathogens.  Central to elucidating how NB-LRR proteins have evolved to recognize different pathogens is the understanding of how this recognition takes place at a molecular level.  The investigators have identified a protein known as RanGAP2 that interacts with two potato NB-LRR proteins known as Rx and Gpa2.  The RanGAP2 protein appears to mediate recognition by Rx and Gpa2 of a virus and a nematode, respectively.  The project will study how RanGAP2 interacts with both the NB-LRR proteins and the pathogens using molecular biology, biochemistry and genetics.  The RanGAP2 protein is also involved in numerous other cellular functions and the investigators will investigate whether these functions are related to its role in plant defense.  The latter has important implications for understanding plant defense responses as well as having broader impacts in comparative immunological studies geared toward formulating general principles regarding the evolution of pathogen detection systems.  For example, animals possess proteins, known as NACHT-LRRs that show striking structural and functional similarities with plant NB-LRR proteins.  This project will contribute to the training of two post-doctoral associates and one graduate student.  Broader impacts also include participating in biology teacher training and curriculum development workshops and providing research experiences for up to six high school or undergraduate students."

Their major chemical constituents are waxes that provide waterproofing and either of two insoluble structural support polymers, cutin (for aerial organs) and suberin (at internal locations and in wound tissue).  This project aims to understand how the monomer units of the biopolymers are covalently linked together and to cell-wall polysaccharides, how the mechanical properties of the cuticular surface change in response to stress conditions, and how suberin or related materials are involved in textural hardening of potato tissues.  Several biophysical approaches will be taken to these problems.  (1) Oligomeric fragments of lime fruit cutin and suberized potato wound periderm will be produced by chemical and enzymatic means, separated chromatographically, and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS).  (2) NMR experiments on solvent-swelled samples will be used to develop and apply methodologies to identify polymer chain structures, cross-links, and cell-wall linkages in lime fruit cutin, potato wound periderm, suberized green cotton, and hardened potato tissues.  (3) The impact of abrasion, chilling injury, and foliar delivery of pesticides on cuticular mechanical properties and molecular flexibility will be assessed using rheometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and solid-state NMR.  (4) The biosynthesis of hard polymeric substances deposited in potato tubers that have 'hard-to-cook syndrome' will be studied using texture analysis and NMR spectroscopy. The overall objectives of this project include understanding how the monomer units of the protective cutin and suberin biopolymers are linked together and to supporting cell-wall matrices, how environmental stresses such as wind abrasion and temperature shock alter the mechanical properties of the cuticular membrane, how fruit cuticles interact with aqueous detergents used in application of agrochemicals, and how suberin or related polyphenols are synthesized during the hardening process that degrades potato texture.  Ultimately, this research should have both agricultural and economic impact, aiding in the design of essential crop protection strategies.  More broadly, the microstructural and molecular insights developed from this work may assist the development of synthetic waterproofing materials for industrial or cosmetic use.  Finally, this project will serve to introduce methods such as solid-state NMR and AFM to the community of plant scientists."

Successful potato production in large part depends on grower ability to control Colorado potato beetle. Imidacloprid and, to a smaller degree, other neonicotionids serve as a foundation of beetle control on commercial farms. These insecticides combine relatively low mammalian toxicity, high efficiency against target pests, and affordable price. Loss of their availability for controlling the Colorado potato beetle is likely to be a serious problem even when alternative chemistries still suppress resistant populations. First, development of new insecticides is increasingly expensive, which affects their market price paid by growers. Secondly, available alternatives may be less convenient and more environmentally damaging than the failed insecticides they have to replace. Third, a threat of insecticide failure due to resistance development increases the already high real and perceived risks of potato farming. Recommendations on resistance management are commonly developed based on studies of as little as one resistant strain, often selected under laboratory conditions. Although such an approach is often valid, resistance mechanisms may be diverse even within a relatively limited geographic area. Therefore, information obtained in one location will not necessarily apply to other locations where resistance becomes a problem. In other cases, recommendations are made based on mathematic models. Again, this could be a valuable approach given that an appropriate model is selected. However, model assumptions cannot be taken for granted and should be verified using experimental techniques. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a management plan for preventing imidacloprid resistance in the Colorado potato beetle populations that can be customized for effective use in a variety of geographic locations. Most Colorado potato beetle populations are still highly susceptible to imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids. Taking a proactive approach at this point in time will help preserving efficiency of this class of chemicals. Development of effective plans to manage imidacloprid resistance would greatly benefit a wide variety of stakeholders. However, it will not be possible without a thorough understanding of the system in question, including its physiological, ecological, genetic, and behavioral aspects. All scientists involved in the project have been investigating various aspects of imidacloprid resistance in the Colorado potato beetle for the past eight years. In the proposed study, we suggest combining our efforts to ?put different pieces of a big puzzle together? and obtain a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. This would allow developing a resistance management plan that will be based on a solid scientific foundation and apply to variety of potato-growing areas."

The geographic boundaries of the Interior roughly conform to the boundaries of the Tanana Chiefs Conference, (TCC), a non-profit tribal consortium of 42 tribal communities in Interior Alaska. Of these communities, eight are accessible by road, the rest can be reached only by air, and seasonally, boat or snow machine. Villages range in size from 60 residents to more than 500. Thirty percent of the people live below the poverty level, with some villages reporting as high as 65% of the population below the poverty level. Traditional foods such as moose, salmon, waterfowl, wild berries and greens are important components of many villagers' diets, along with potatoes, carrots and turnips grown in family plots. Increasingly, however, processed foods high in carbohydrates and low in nutritional value are replacing these healthy foods. Even though importing food by small plane is very expensive, so too is gathering wild food; with gasoline averaging $6.00/gallon, many families cannot afford to do so. Purpose: Despite significant need for community food project implementation, this program is virtually unknown in this region. To address this, the CES has designed a training and technical assistance project that will help Interior Alaska villages plan fundable community food projects (CFP). During the three-year award period, the CES will 1) disseminate information on food security, community food projects and the community food projects competitive grants program (CFPCGP) through a variety of outreach methods, 2) provide assistance to tribal staff in identifying workable and sustainable components for CFP, and 3) provide workshops and technical assistance designed to help tribal staff build capacity by demystifying proposal components, guidelines and requirements, developing accurate budgets, and overcoming the obstacles of electronic submission in a region without high-speed connectivity. Anticipated project outcomes are: Short-term: 1) Increased community understanding of food security, how to evaluate it, and how to improve food self-sufficiency, 2) Food security becomes a focus topic for more tribal councils; tribal staff supported in efforts to create and implement community food projects. Mid-term: 1) Some tribal governments undertake action to reduce reliance on food imports & federal subsidies by developing community food projects, 2)Increase in tribal governments submitting CFPCGP proposals. Long-term: 10 Tribal consortia and organizations promote food self sufficiency and its importance to local tribal control, 2) CFP concepts continue to be integrated into communities, whether or not they receive formal CFP funding."

Beta-Cryptoxanthin has not received much attention as a vitamin A (VA) source because it has only half the VA activity of beta-carotene (BC). However, CX is well-absorbed from its primary food sources. Because CX exists in high concentrations in commonly consumed foods, and is better absorbed than BC, it may be an important dietary source of VA. Infants are born with low body stores of VA. They rely on dietary VA to build stores after birth. The World Health Organization recommends that infants be breastfed for the first 6 months of life. However in areas where VA deficiency is endemic, breastmilk VA concentrations are inadequate. Lactating women cannot be routinely supplemented with high-doses of VA to improve the VA content of their breastmilk because VA causes birth defects. Small daily amounts of dietary VA can maintain adequate milk VA throughout lactation. Pro Vitamin A (PVA) carotenoids pose no known health risks to lactating women or infants. Because dietary CX may have greater VA activity than BC, supplementation with foods rich in CX maybe an efficacious dietary intervention for improving breastmilk VA. We will measure the impact of daily supplementation with food sources of CX or BC on the plasma and breastmilk concentrations of CX, BC and VA in Bangladeshi women with marginal VA status. Briefly, breastfeeding women will be assigned to receive a VA supplement, 6 d/week, for 3 weeks, as either 1) tangerines (containing 6 mg CX), 2) orange sweet potatoes retinyl (containing 6 mg BC), 3) 6 mg pure BC, 4) 0.5 mg pure retinyl palmitate, and 5) 0 mg RE as a low VA fruit (apple). Breastmilk and plasma samples will be collected weekly for measurement of CX, BC, and VA. Test foods will be provided as daily snacks between meals, twice per day. Information on dietary VA intake and morbidity will be obtained; and plasma indicators of inflammation and infection will be measured. The change in plasma and breast milk concentrations of CX, BC and VA will be calculated. We expect that the VA response in breastmilk will be greater in women who receive dietary sources of CX than in those who receive BC. We also expect that the apparent absorption (plasma response) of CX will be greater than the apparent absorption of BC. This study will provide important new information on 1) the relative absorption of CX and BC, 2) the relative transfer of CX and BC to breastmilk, and 3) the relative VA potential of CX and BC (breastmilk retinol responses). This will let us evaluate whether Tangerines are a good source of VA."

We propose to build expertise in plant breeding combined with research on enhancement of potato germplasm for tuber calcium uptake. By understanding the genetics of tuber calcium uptake, we will improve tuber quality of cultivated potatoes. This will be achieved by the evaluation and enhancement of wild potato germplasm. Tuber internal quality is a major limiting factor for the US potato industry. Breeders invest time and money in producing advanced selections which, in the end, often fail because of tuber internal defects, tuber bruising or storage quality issues. Processors pay a bonus to the growers for better tuber quality and penalize growers for poor quality. Thus, there is a strong commercial incentive to produce tubers with good internal quality as well as a low incidence of bruising. Calcium deficiency is pervasive among fruit and tuber crops including potatoes because calcium moves with water in the xylem and very little water moves to these organs. Cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers generally have low tuber calcium levels. An increase in tuber calcium has been demonstrated to reduce bruise susceptibility, storage rot and the incidence of internal defects such as internal brown spot and hollow heart. The objective of the proposed study is to investigate the potential of developing new potato cultivars with enhanced tuber calcium (improved tuber internal quality). By screening the U.S. potato collection, we have identified wild potato species that are suitable candidates for genetically enhancing tuber calcium of cultivated potatoes and for mapping tuber calcium accumulation ability. We also have hybrids between wild and cultivated germplasm that provide an opportunity to understand the association between tuber calcium/tuber quality and molecular markers. In recent decades, conventional plant breeding has fallen into the shadow of its younger cousin, genetic engineering. University and extramural resources directed toward applied research programs have decreased. The net result of this reduction is apparent as training programs in plant breeding have undergone a steady decline. The teaching component of this project teams the University of Wisconsin (UW)-Madison Plant Breeding and Plant Genetics Graduate Program with the UW-Stevens Point (UWSP) undergraduate Biology department. First, we will offer a one-credit course at UWSP at the end of the spring semester. Second, we will expose students who have completed the course to a hands-on plant breeding research experience. Four companies including Pioneer, Harris Moran, Seminis and Monsanto have agreed to provide paid internships. Third, we will provide students with a forum to interact with other plant breeding researchers. The UW-Madison potato breeding program has an ongoing interaction with the potato growers. The proposed project will build upon these ongoing extension activities to foster the transfer of science- based knowledge to producers and consumers about the importance of mineral nutrition to potato quality."

Genetically stable transplastomic crops can be obtained only by selection for antibiotic resistance genes. Associated yield penalty and consumer opposition dictates that the marker gene is removed from future transplastomic crops. We developed a two-stage protocol for the removal of marker genes using site-specific recombinases. First we transform the plastid genome with marker genes flanked with site-specific recombinase target sites. When transformation of the plastid genome is accomplished, we introduce the gene of a site-specific recombinase into the nucleus. This nuclear gene encodes a plastid-targeted recombinase that efficiently excises the plastid marker gene. While the plastid marker gene is efficiently excised, the recombinase gene is introduced into the nucleus and has to be segregated away in the seed progeny. We now test the feasibility of plastid marker excision by direct export of the Cre recombinase enzyme from Agrobacterium into chloroplasts. When the recombinase enzyme rather than its gene is transferred from Agrobacterium to the plants cell, there is no opportunity for the incorporation of recombinase gene in the nucleus. Direct export of proteins for marker gene excision will facilitate the applications of plastid transformation in vegetatively propagated crops (potato, apple trees) in which seed propagation is incompatible with variety preservation."

In Wisconsin we have developed the foundation for biointensive IPM education. We are now proposing to develop specific educational tools which will enable growers to integrate biointensive IPM strategies into existing production systems. Wisconsin fruit and vegetable growers are particularly vulnerable to FQPA since risk calculations are higher for crops that are consumed directly rather than as processed products. The processing sector has undergone rapid consolidation in the past decade, leaving only two locally-owned processors in the state. Other than on-farm processing, apple growers have no processing options. Also, given the small acreage of fruit and vegetable crops as compared to grains or pasture in Wisconsin, they represent a small market and hence there is little incentive for agrochemical companies to pursue registration of pesticide alternatives, which requires costly risk assessment studies. . The overall momentum of the eco-potato and eco-fruit projects has been extremely strong as many things have been accomplished such as the continuation of the marketing effort, enhancements of the Collaboration standards, improvements of resistance management protocols, database implementation, grant coordination and expansion of the use and development of educational tools for growers. We have worked with numerous faculty, industry representatives, potato and other commodity organizations, and environmental organizations to export the agricultural model for targeted and industry-wide change. In Wisconsin, this work is expanding to other vegetable crops, such as carrots, peppers, beans and peas. Furthermore, we have enhanced the ecological portions of the Collaboration by working with national and local environmental organizations and expanding our research with University of Wisconsin faculty by involving their expertise, research and education into the project. We need to maintain this strength while exporting the model of industry-wide agricultural changes through the use of policy and communication efforts. The University of Wisconsin is an appropriate site for this project because of the proven capacity to complete this project; the talent of its faculty, staff and students; its long history of commitment to outreach; and the vulnerability of Wisconsin growers to further restrictions on pesticide use. The UW is able to play a unique coordinating role between state and federal agencies, non-profit organizations, and private businesses to attain the project objectives."

In Mississippi, sweet potato is a major horticultural crop valued at $49 million, which makes Mississippi the third in the U.S. Current cultivars are bred for fresh consumption. Efforts are being made to expand the utility of sweet potato. This will provide great opportunities for small farmers with enormous economic promise in Mississippi. However, viral infection is one of the main factors limiting the release of the full potential of sweet potato production. Viral infections can result in 30-50% yield reduction. Among sweet potato viruses in the U.S., Sweet potato leaf is considered to be the most detrimental to production. The incidence of SPLCV in the U.S. has dramatically expanded in recent years including Mississippi. SPLCV infection reportedly resulted in 25-30% yield losses to the cultivar `Beauregard' which accounts for about 80% of the U.S. production. Sweet potato viral diseases are the most difficult to control because of the lack of effective viral resistant varieties, cultural practices, and virus-killer chemicals. The advanced knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of plant-virus interactions has led to the development of novel techniques to develop cultivars that are resistant to viruses. Biotechnology provides the opportunity to translate these emerging technologies to applicable products such as viral resistant varieties. We propose to explore new technologies to develop viral resistant sweet potato varieties to address this crucial issue in Mississippi and the southern U.S. Indeed, engineering viral resistance has been achieved in papaya which has saved the U.S. papaya industry. Currently, engineered viral resistant papayas represent 53% of the U.S. production. The major impacts of the proposed project are summarized as follows: (1) the availability of viral resistant sweet potato varieties developed in this project will significantly increase its marketable yield and the income of small farmers in Mississippi and the southern U.S.; (2) it will circumvent the drawbacks, e.g., high cost and inconvenience of virus-tested `seeds' that have to be purchased annually; (3) it will make sweet potato production less dependent on pesticides which will reduce the production costs and health risks to farmers as well as to consumers; (4) the technology used in sweet potato can be explored to engineer viral resistance in other economically important crops transformable; (5) wide extension of disease resistant crop varieties will help to sustain an environmentally-friendly and sustainable agricultural system and promote responsible environmental stewardship; (6) the success of this project will enhance the reputation of ASU and will steer a wave to attract bright high school students who want to study agricultural sciences and strengthen ASU's outreach and extension programs; (7) it will enhance ASU's educational and research capacity; and (8) our positive results will benefit scientists, extension agents, and educational institutions, nationally and internationally."

Our goal is to create a dynamic and innovative North Central breeding effort that will effectively target our regions needs of improved varieties, make efficient use of limited resources, prioritize traits of focus and complement efforts in the Pacific Northwest, Northeast and Southwest. The proposed North Central potato breeding project is critical to variety development efforts in the North Central region and compliment industry supported efforts having similar goals. Since the formalization of the North Central Breeding Project in 2001, a cooperative infrastructure has evolved that builds upon our breadth of expertise and diversity in potato research. From this we have developed an integrated potato breeding effort that refocuses the resources and personnel to more efficiently breed improved varieties that will create economic opportunities for our region and US potato growers, processors and fresh market distributors. Concurrently, potato utilization and consumer purchasing has been changing. Moreover, consumer issues, emerging pests and stresses have added urgency to the need for improved varieties. To drive this effort to build an integrated North Central Breeding Project, the PIs have met biannually at the NCCC84 and PAA meetings to dialogue about the project, then formulate, improve, and refine project objectives, devise breeding strategies, develop cooperative trait testing, maximize use of resources, discuss advanced germplasm evaluation and trait evaluation. Breeding efforts in the North Central region focus on this regions needs but a significant component will overlap with national needs."

The resulting forecasts will be delivered through web-based systems and will be available to growers on a daily update basis. Risk forecasts can improve crop quality while at the same time reducing fungicide use by allowing growers to improve the timing of fungicide applications. Our goals in reducing fungicide use are of increasing product quality, limiting expenditures, and reducing the amount of chemical released to the environment. We will examine and quantify the accuracy, economic and environmental impacts, and usability of crop disease risk forecasts at both the synoptic and mesoscale (different weather forecasting scales) in the various regions of the U.S. By selecting three very different crop species (peanut, barley, potato) each heavily dependent upon fungicide sprays for the prevention, avoidance, and management of disease in various regions of the country (southeast, northern Great Plains, Great Lakes region), we plan to capture the overall potential of such forecasting systems for widespread use in the U.S. New technologies in the form of improved National Weather Service forecasts (since 2004) and access to high performance computer workflows give us the opportunity to exploit these advances funded through large government technology grants (the LEAD project alone cost $11.5 million) for the benefit of both major and minor agricultural commodity groups. The ultimate goal of any forecast system is reduction of uncertainty that can negatively influence decision making by users. In the case of disease risk forecasting for agriculture, decisions by the target group of users can negatively impact our food supply, environment, and economy by increasing use of pesticides. Increasing accessibility to forecast information through free, thoroughly tested forecast services in the web environment has the potential to dramatically decrease uncertainty in a variety of crop systems. In this project we examine three crops in three regions of the country, but the implications of the project's results are much more far reaching. Many crop diseases have similar meteorological triggers based on temperature and moisture requirements that may be mined from available forecasts. For a number of years, growers, stakeholders , commodity associations, crop consultants and land grant specialists have been requesting disease risk prediction models for all the major crops in the U.S. through Pest Management Strategic Plans. The public availability of weather forecasts and the improved infrastructure to promote the use of these forecasts make this the time to examine usefulness of forecasting as a national priority in agriculture."

While the source of the introduction of G. pallida in Idaho is unknown, the potential impact of this nematode on the potato based agricultural economy in southern Idaho is significant. Research on the development of methodology to prevent the spread of this nematode outside of the currently infested fields and the potential eradication of G. pallida from the invested fields is needed. This project proposes to investigate chemical and biological approaches to controlling G. pallida. The first objective of the project is to develop laboratory methods for the production of G. pallida juveniles and cysts for laboratory and greenhouse studies on eradication methods for G. pallida. Without a consistent supply of nematodes and cysts it will be difficult to rapidly develop control strategies. As part of this objective, laboratory methods will be developed to evaluate potential chemical and biological compounds for their effect on nematode survival and cyst viability. A third part of this objective is to evaluate laboratory methods to pre-screen potential trap species for G. pallida to maximize efforts in the greenhouse and field to identify plant species that can be used to eliminate G. pallida cysts from invested fields. The second objective is to identify microbial, fungal and plant biocontrol agents that could be deployed in the field to reduce or eliminate G. pallida nematodes and cysts. The microbial and fungal biocontrol agents will be isolated from field collected cysts that show little or no hatching of juveniles. Plant level biocontol control will be approached by evaluating trap plants and potato genotypes that may carry resistance to G. pallida that could be deployed in infested fields to reduce the cyst level by inducing hatching while not supporting reproduction of G. pallida. By combining several approaches to control G. pallida it is anticipated that a management plan for G. pallida infested field will be developed that will lead to the elimination of G. pallida from Idaho potato production fields and minimize the economic impact of this nematode on the potato production based agricultural economy of the western United States."

Oomycetes include both important pathogens of plants and animals, and also include species that are saprophytes. The last several years have seen a rapid expansion in genome data available for oomycetes, and in the number of researchers interested in oomycetes. However, tools for functional genomics are still very limited or inefficient, with few genes having been subjected to gene silencing or related methods for elucidating function. Therefore, to facilitate the scientific community's ability to exploit the genome data, this project aims to expand the toolkit for functional studies of oomycete genes. The work will use the potato late blight pathogen PHYTOPHTHORA INFESTANS as a model, although the tools developed should be useful throughout all oomycetes. We will optimize methods for gene silencing, develop novel methods based on custom zinc finger proteins for silencing and mutating genes, optimize performance of an inducible promoter system which allows genes to be turned on and off at will, facilitate studies of protein function by developing a suite of vectors for expressing genes fused to fluorescent markers, and to tags for tandem affinity purification experiments. Training will also be provided to researchers and students interested in oomycete transformation and biology. In the long-term, such work will help the research community achieve its long-term goals, which include revealing novel aspects of the biology of oomycetes and developing new methods for controlling oomycete diseases, for example by identifying targets for inhibitors or host-based resistance."

P. INFESTANS is also an experimentally tractable model for other oomycetes, which infect virtually all crops. Most oomycetes rely on spores for their dissemination from plant to plant; such spores are easily transported by wind or water, for example. Spores are also the structures that are used to form the infective hyphae that breach the cell walls (the outer defenses) of plant hosts. Consequently, understanding how PHYTOPHTHORA spores form and germinate is a high priority in plant pathology. The planned research will take two directions to study the biology of spores in P. INFESTANS. The first path involves studying how genes are activated at important developmental transitions such as spore formation and spore germination. At such stages, hundreds of genes are turned on, presumably in response to the activation of DNA-binding regulatory proteins known as transcription factors. By studying the regions of the spore-specific genes that are necessary for expression, it should be possible to identify the relevant regulatory proteins (transcription factors). Later, studies of the transcription factors should identify the cellular or environmental factors that trigger the development or germination of the spores. A second line of research will focus on the cellular roles of other proteins that play roles in spores, such as a protein known as CDC14. Related proteins in other species are proved to be important regulators, and in P. INFESTANS the CDC14 gene was shown to be essential for sporulation based on mutation (gene silencing) studies. By learning where in the cells and tissues of P. INFESTANS the CDC14 protein resides, and identifying the proteins that CDC14 binds in the cell, it will be possible to learn more about how it regulates spore behavior. This research will have important benefits to agriculture. For example, if proteins are identified that regulate sporulation, germination, or other stages in the disease cycle, then chemical inhibitors of those proteins may be identified. If a small chemical produced by oomycete or plant cells are found to activate the regulatory protein, then it may be possible to develop plants that break down that metabolite. Such plants should be effective at arresting the disease cycle during a potential epidemic, for example by suppressing the formation or germination of the spores."

The research will be based at the Food Innovation Center (FIC) which is a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency facility housing scientists from Oregon State University (OSU) as well as public service professionals from the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA). The FIC provides food manufacturers and marketing entrepreneurs throughout the Northwest with an integrated and accessible set of research, education, and support activities and resources. A guiding principle for research selection is its applicability to Northwest food products and market situation. While there are many issues facing Northwest food businesses, there is a great demand on the FIC to assist market entrepreneurs and existing businesses in bringing new or improved products to market and to assess the value of products as a whole in their packaging, credence, and quality aspects as well as for the fundamental product itself. A new thrust for the Multicommodity research team will be to develop and test new products by which new market entrants will be able to self-assess their product's potential on a number of facets. Eventually this will include assessment of product concept, including flavor, packaging, price and competitive assessment, production cost, and business model. Initial studies of two or three aspects will take place during the grant period. Value-added processing or further manufacturing and marketing of agricultural-based products also offer considerable potential for expansion, economic growth and job creation. The research activities undertaken in this project will aid entrepreneurial efforts in the region's food industry through market and business analysis and education in tandem with scientific and technological assistance in food processing, marketing, and distribution. To achieve this goal research will either address specific issues or questions in marketing and business that currently face food businesses, or be designed to evaluate and develop strategies and techniques that will enhance the success of existing food business and entrants. Planned project activities take advantage of the breadth of scientific expertise of the OSU staff. An example of this is a project on colored table potatoes. This study will utilize food technology instruments to measure the level of raw and cooked potato characteristics in hand with consumer studies by the sensory scientists to measure consumer response to the characteristic levels in terms of sensory characteristics and willingness to purchase. The data gathered will then be evaluated by economists and food scientists to develop an improved method for evaluating new varieties. In conjunction with this activity cooking methods to maximize consumer desirability of colored varieties, in terms of nutritional quality, taste and appearance will be developed. Development on new products for consumers will be undertaken. This project was developed with input and additional support from industry."

One of the most important signals is light. Length of daylight or photoperiod is a key signal that regulates flowering, dormancy and tuberization. Tuber formation in potato involves the delivery of a light signal from the light-receiving organ, the leaf, to an underground organ growing in the dark, the stolon. This proposal outlines a plan to investigate the role of StBEL5, a transcription factor that regulates tuber formation, in a leaf to stolon signaling pathway that involves the long-distance transport of select, full-length messenger RNAs. Despite the seeming complexity of this system, over-expression of StBEL5 alone consistently produces plants that exhibit enhanced tuber yields. The primary goal of this proposal is to further elucidate the signaling pathway from source to target that regulates tuber formation. We will address three hypotheses in this study: 1) proteins bind to the BEL5 RNA to regulate its movement and expression, 2) sequences in the BEL5 RNA mediate its photoperiod-activated movement and expression, and 3) activation of the BEL5 gene in stolons is a key component of the system. This study will increase our understanding of the initiation of the major underground storage organ of potato, the fourth most important food crop in the world and establish this system as a valuable model for investigating the mechanisms of long-distance mRNA movement. Results from this study can readily lead to a strategy for enhancing the yield of potato tubers under field situations."

Colorado potato beetles are notorious for evolving resistance to insecticides. When populations become resistant to insecticides growers use more frequent and more highly concentrated sprays, with higher economic and environmental costs, so managing the evolution of resistance is highly desirable. Resistance to insecticides often incurs costs to the insects themselves, which may be weaker in other ways. Colorado potato beetles resistant to imidacloprid lay fewer eggs, can't walk as fast, take longer to hatch, and have lower overwinter survival. If resistant beetles are less able to fly long distances and locate newly planted fields, that trade-off can be used to manage resistance evolution. This project measures whether resistance to two commonly used insecticides entails a cost to the insects in terms of movement, and at what spatial scale those costs are present. We will measure movement costs in the field, looking at resistance in spring-colonizing beetles at emergence and at increasing distances from the emergence site. We will carry out laboratory studies using a flight mill, a device where tethered beetles fly in circles, to see if resistant and susceptible beetles differ in their flight range, and we will measure whether beetles colonizing continuously planted fields are more resistant than those colonizing newly planted fields that were rotated away from potato the previous year. Rotated fields must attract beetles from longer distances and if there are movement costs they will attract less resistant beetles. The results of this study will be resistance management plants that identify the optimum distances for planting new potato fields from last year's potato fields that will reduce the resistance of colonists and reduce the amount of insecticide needed to control beetle populations. The results will also help manage resistance in other species for which resistance costs can be identified."

Before establishment of the Reservation in 1855, the tribes gained subsistence from a tribal system of hunting, fishing, & harvesting. The quest for food began in early spring with the bitterroot harvest, followed by gatherings of camas bulbs, tree moss, onions, Indian potatoes, Indian carrots, & medicinal plants; summer brought berry harvests. Hunting was a summer & fall activity; fishing happened year-round. All hunting & harvesting were communal activities; while the men concentrated on hunting, the women dried meat and prepared hides for robes & buckskins. After 1855, the subsistence lifestyle was replaced by limited movement & surplus commodity foods high in refined carbohydrates & fat. Considerable evidence exists for the negative impact of acculturation (especially in terms of diet & activity levels) for indigenous peoples, demonstrating the need for special emphasis on diet & lifestyle to reverse these impacts. The emphasis of this proposal is to mobilize the community toward healthier lifestyles that reflect the principles of ancestral diets & activity levels. It is well documented that type II diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease are rampant in American Indian communities. The Flathead Reservation is no exception. IHS Data for the Flathead Tribal Clinic indicates that overweight & obesity continue to be major health issues on the Reservation. The data show the average BMI of WIC mothers is above what qualifies as overweight & suggests 25-36% of children ages 2-5 are at risk for or already are overweight. These statistics also highlight the socio-familial factor of obesity risk: overweight parents are more likely to raise overweight children. Because these diseases are linked to a sedentary lifestyle & diets high in fats & refined carbohydrates, we intend to expand group opportunities for education in healthy diets & lifestyles. We aim to increase healthier dietary choices; increase regular exercise in daily lifestyles; & produce curriculum & training aides for on-going learning & resale. To meet these goals & mobilize the community toward healthier lifestyles, we will produce 13 healthy-cooking shows (RezChef) & 13 fitness shows (RezMove) filmed before live audiences allowing us to disseminate nutrition & fitness information directly to our target population. When finished, the RezChef & RezMove DVDs will be part of a curriculum guide. We will market these guides to institutional cooks, teachers, & health departments on other reservations. The curriculum guides will also be available to Flathead Reservation residents free of charge. We believe our project will succeed at mobilizing the community toward healthier lifestyles through better dietary choices & increased physical activity."

Before the time of the Reservation, the tribes gained subsistence from a tribal system of hunting, fishing, & harvesting. The quest for food began in early spring with the bitterroot harvest, followed by gatherings of camas bulbs, tree moss, onions, Indian potatoes, Indian carrots, & medicinal plants; summer brought berry harvests. Hunting was a summer & fall activity; fishing happened year-round. All hunting & harvesting were communal activities; while the men concentrated on hunting, the women dried meat and prepared hides for robes & buckskins. After establishment of the Reservation, the subsistence lifestyle was replaced by limited movement & surplus commodity foods high in refined carbohydrates & fat. Considerable evidence exists for the negative impact of acculturation (especially in terms of diet & activity levels) for indigenous peoples, demonstrating the need for special emphasis on diet & lifestyle to reverse these impacts. This proposal is designed to do just that. It has been demonstrated that dietary behaviors & sedentary lifestyles are critical factors in the increasing rates of both obesity & type II diabetes, but that maintaining a balance of energy intake & expenditure is protective against developing these diseases. IHS Data for the Flathead Tribal Clinic indicates that overweight & obesity continue to be major health issues on the Reservation. The data show the average BMI of WIC mothers is above what qualifies as overweight & suggests 25-36% of children ages 2-5 are at risk for or already are overweight. These statistics also highlight the socio-familial factor of obesity risk: overweight parents are more likely to raise overweight children. Programs such as the DPP lack efficacy in native communities because they are seen as coming from the dominant culture. We believe that a more successful strategy for native communities is one that draws on the motivational desire of native peoples to honor traditional values & culture. The emphasis of this proposal is to mobilize the community toward healthier lifestyles that reflect the principles of ancestral diets & activity levels. This approach asks our community members to take a Traditional Living Challenge (TLC) to learn how they can live a lifestyle more closely emulating that of our ancestors. The integration of the Ancestors Choice (AC) social marketing/education campaign into the TLC will support our community in making this shift back to ancestral wisdom. We will offer classes & workshops in what it means to take the TLC, including dietary & other healthy lifestyle. We will offer an immersion experience in traditional diet and activities through a TLC encampment that incorporates the principles & recipes of AC. Since both TLC & AC have demonstrated a positive response in the community with indications of growing interest, these projects deserve further development. We believe the environmental supports that honor the healthier foods & lifestyles of our tribal ancestors will appeal to the population & make healthy habits easier to keep."

Sweet potato farmers in the Mid-South, including the States of Arkansas and Mississippi face similar problems of severe drought summer conditions requiring them to incur additional irrigation expenditures. Drought conditions are most detrimental on poor rural limited-resource farmers that cannot afford irrigation facilities, and most of the sweet potato farmers in the Mid South are limited-resource farmers. Therefore, high input costs such as irrigation costs limit the capacity of rural farmers in meaningful agribusiness. The major objective of the project is to select drought tolerant sweet potato lines through research in plant-water relations. The selected lines or varieties will be very useful in any future breeding program aimed at developing new sweet potato germplasm with high yield and drought tolerance characteristics. The hypothesis is that planting drought tolerant sweet potato will increase profitability to farmers in the mid-South U.S. by reducing irrigation and associated production overhead costs. Our efforts will lead to profitable sweet potato agribusiness and enhance agricultural sustainability."

Potyviruses regularly attack potato, wheat, and many fruit and vegetable crops. The most efficient way to control potyviruses is by genetic resistance. A more expensive and less environmentally sustainable way is to spray pesticides to control the aphids that transmit potyviruses. But viruses often evolve to overcome the resistance. A better understanding of how viruses work is necessary to identify resistance targets in the viral genome. Using bioinformatics methods we discovered a tiny new gene (called pipo) that is present in all sequenced potyvirus genomes. Pipo overlaps with the large polyprotein gene that was thought to be the only gene in the potyvirus genome. We also showed that the pipo gene is essential for the virus to infect plants. Discovery of pipo is revolutionary because it reveals new coding capacity and potential gene function that has been ignored in all previous research on viruses of the Potyviridae. In soybean mosaic virus, pipo is located in a portion of the genome known to determine whether the virus is susceptible to a host resistance gene. Thus, it is possible that pipo determines whether viruses like soybean mosaic can infect normally resistant soybean plants. Our research will determine this possibility. Also, because pipo overlaps with another gene, the mechanism by which the protein encoded by pipo is expressed (made by the host protein synthesis machinery) must be novel. We will investigate this mechanism of gene expression and it should shed fundamental new light on possibilities for protein synthesis control in plants. Finally, we will determine the role that pipo has in the virus replication process, be it multiplication of the viral genome, moving the virus from cell to cell, or overcoming the RNA-mediated innate immune response known in all plants. The OUTCOME/IMPACT of this research will be new knowledge that may guide (1) virologists in engineering improved virus vectors for expressing foreign genes or knocking out host genes, (2) plant breeders in screening for durable resistance to potyviruses, and (3) molecular biologists in understanding the mechanisms of protein synthesis in plants."

Streptomycetes are masters of secondary metabolism and plant pathogenic species are no exception. The novel metabolite thaxtomin is required for pathogenicity in scab-causing species and functions to suppress cellulose synthesis in expanding cell walls. The goal of the project is to evaluate other secondary metabolites produced by S. scabies 87.22, including siderophores, toxins and signaling molecules, for their roles in host-pathogen interaction. We will use a genome mining approach in which 1) secondary metabolite pathways are predicted using bioinformatics and comparative genomic strategies; 2) The metabolome of wild type and pathway mutants are compared to identify differentially produced metabolites; and 3) structures of pathway-specific metabolites are characterized using cutting edge analytical technologies. Pathway mutants will be comprehensively evaluated for deficiencies in virulence on potato, and mutants producing interesting phenotypes will be complemented and subjected to functional analysis, including monitoring colonization with GFP-labeled strains.

The University of Maine Cooperative Extension's Potato Integrated Pest Management program impacts nearly 60,000 acres of potatoes. The program employs 18 program aides, maintains nearly 150 specialized insect traps, coordinates a statewide network of electronic weather stations, and surveys 100 potato fields on a weekly basis for weeds, insects, and diseases. The data produced helps IPM scientists track potential pest outbreaks and helps provide growers with current information on specific and timely treatments in order to minimize the number of pesticide applications and maximize potato yield. In 1993, Maine potato crop losses due to potato late blight were estimated to be between 16 and 20 million dollars. Additional monies were requested and received from USDA via a Congressional earmark, to expand and enhance the University of Maine Cooperative Extension Potato Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program. As a result of these funds, a highly intensive multifaceted, ongoing Potato IPM program was developed and implemented in the state of Maine. This program has also had a positive impact on other potato producing areas. As a result of the early snow cover in the fall of 2007, it is expected that volunteer potatoes may be an issue during the 2008 growing season. These potato plants, will potentially serve as excellent inoculum source for the late blight organism. This potential inoculum source, combined with the past discovery of fungicide resistance of the late blight organism, and the confirmed presence of the US-8 late blight strain have the potential to create a serious situation for the Maine Potato Industry in the 2008 crop year."

Feral hog populations are spreading across the United States with little resistance from the private and public sector, causing considerable damage in their wake. We are suggesting control by a means not currently used in the United States, but has been shown and analyzed elsewhere to be the most cost-effective means of control-baiting with a lethal toxicant. Although feral hogs are protected as a game species in some states, their damage is well-known by those who are in direct contact with them: farmers, ranchers, federal and state wildlife managers, forest managers, city and county municipalities, and other private organizations and citizens. Damage has occurred in agriculture and silviculture and feral hogs represent a means of disease transmission to livestock. Physical damage includes rooting of pastures, forests, vineyards; consumption of crops (milo, corn, wheat, rice, peanuts, and potatoes, etc.); land erosion; and preying upon calves, lambs, and kids. More recently, as the populations increase at an alarming rate, concern has shifted to disease transmission. Feral hogs harbor diseases and parasites that can be transferred to livestock including: foot and mouth disease, pseudorabies, cholera, trichinosis, African swine fever, brucellosis, leptospirosis, salmonellosis, anthrax, ticks, fleas, lice, and various flukes and worms. Many of these diseases could be used in bioterrorism attacks and greatly threaten the livestock industry as a whole. Upon live-capture, tests will be initiated to determine a viable bait formulation that can be tested in the field and in the future be available to consumers as a market bait. The bait will add another tool and technology to a growing problem by supplying the public and private sectors with a cost-effective solution."

Over the next 5 years we will focus on the following three objectives: Objective 1: Strategically expand and improve collections of priority potato and carrot genetic resources and associated information. Sub-objective 1.A. When feasible, strategically acquire via at least three field expeditions for either potato (Solanum) or carrot (Daucus) genetic diversity (especially wild relatives of these crops) currently underrepresented in the U. S. National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS). Sub-objective 1.B. Identify and establish contacts in Latin America, Europe and Asia who may enable acquisition of Solanum and Daucus species, especially wild relatives of potato and carrot. Sub-objective 1.C. In cooperation with USDA/ARS collaborators at the USDA/ARS North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station in Ames, IA, survey existing U.S. domestic collections of Daucus, identify material that would fill gaps in NPGS collections, and begin acquiring and characterizing them. Objective 2: Elucidate the systematic relationships and assess the amount and apportionment of genetic diversity in priority specialty crops of potato, tomato, carrots, and their wild relatives. Sub-objective 2.A. Generate classical and practical morphological descriptions of up to 50 key taxonomic traits for each crop and their wild relatives, analyze them for their value as phylogenetic and/or systematic characters, and incorporate this taxonomic evidence into GRIN. Sub-objective 2.B. Develop and apply new and appropriate DNA markers for phylogenetic and genetic analyses of potato, tomato, and/or carrot genetic resources, and incorporate resultant characterization data into GRIN and/or other databases, such as SolGenes (for potato and tomato), GenBank, or on-line repositories of aligned DNA sequences of peer-reviewed scientific journals. Sub-objective 2.C. In cooperation with USDA/ARS, university, and international collaborators, synthesize and integrate the preceding data and other lines of systematic evidence into monographic treatments and systematic revisions of the preceding taxa. Objective 3: Building on earlier tests of taxonomic prediction, critically assess the utility of taxonomic classifications and/or ecogeographical information as tools for planning and conducting effective, efficient, and comprehensive assessments of the intrinsic horticultural merit of potato genetic resources. Sub-objective 3.A. In collaboration with ARS Madison and Wisconsin collaborators, evaluate 150 accessions of 50 different species for host-plant resistance for Alternaria early blight, Colorado Beetle, potato virus Y, and potato late blight. Sub-objective 3.B. Drawing on the preceding new data and other lines of evidence, assess the ability of systematic/ecogeographic factors to help crop breeders effectively choose the optimal new genetic resources to incorporate into a  breeding program.Approach:For objective 1, the PI has obtained a list of current germplasm holdings of Daucus and is actively planning germplasm collecting expeditions. Through GRIN, he obtained accepted taxonomic names for carrot and associated taxonomic information. For Solanum, he will collect in Peru as a priority country if permits can be obtained. He will discuss collection needs with personnel from the National Germplasm Resources Laboratory, and seek collecting permits. He will attend the annual meetings of the Root and Bulb Crop Germplasm Committee to present a collecting plan and seek their concordance and support, and submit collecting proposals to the U.S. Germplasm Laboratory and conduct collecting expeditions based on available permits and funding. Based on current collecting needs and potential collaborations carrot expeditions are planned for Pakistan, Tunisia, and the United States. He will obtain locality data from herbarium and genebank curators. He will survey taxonomic treatments of carrot and floras worldwide and visit key herbaria to assess collection needs.For objective 2, the PI will gather information about species boundaries of carrot from taxonomic treatments. Morphological studies will be conducted at the Ames germplasm station using species-specific morphological characters, and the data will be analyzed with standard multivariate techniques. For interspecific relationships, DNA phylogenies will be generated for a subset (50) of wild and cultivated potato and all available (12) carrot species. In addition, outgroups identified as possibly congeneric with Daucus will be examined using COSII (nuclear DNA) markers, and be examined with standard cladistic techniques. While COSII genes will be explored as new markers, plastid rpoC1 intron and rpl16 intron sequences, and plastid matK coding sequences also will be examined. The PI will write a taxonomic monograph of the wild potato species from the Southern Cone of South America and will write taxonomic treatments of Solanum series Conicibaccata and the Solanum series Piurana group.For objective 3, associations will be made of potato taxonomy to the potato diseases late blight, Colorado potato beetle, and potato virus Y Disease resistance data will then be associated to taxonomic variables by nonparametric methods based on rank scores using the MannûWhitney test when comparisons between two groups are made and the KruskalûWallis test when comparisons among more than two groups are made. Post hoc pairwise comparisons following a significant KruskalûWallis test will be performed using the MannûWhitney test with an appropriate Bonferroni correction. To determine the relative contributions of species, accessions, and individual plants of days to infection or insect pressure, a linear model will be fit with random effects of species and accession. These statistical tests for associations of disease and biogeography are standard. To test the question of whether geographic provenance of samples is a predictor of disease resistance, we will analyze biogeographic variables using spatial autocorrelation, followed by a regression analysis against possible predictors using MoranÆs I."

In particular, to isolate transcriptional control elements and polyadenylation signals from plum and apple.3)Refine down-regulation technologies to improve general applications to metabolic regulation as well as improve design characteristics of pathogen-resistance transgenes.Approach:Available EST, microarray and genomic DNA databases will serve as bioinformatics data sources to identify potato gene families, and specific family members, with requisite expression profiles to serve as sources of valuable transcriptional control elements.  Putative elements will be isolated from a BAC library, assembled into marker-gene fusions, and function characterized in transgenic potatoes.	Polyubiquitin genes from apple and plum will serve as sources of transcriptional control elements for direction of commercial levels of transgene expression in these fruit trees. Appropriate polyubiquitin genes for these control sequences will be identified using EST databases to identify specific, highly constitutively transcribed family members. The molecular source of elements will include both BAC libraries and PCR-amplification.  Putative promoter elements will be fused to standard marker and delivered to collaborators at the USDA/ARS Appalachian Fruit Research Station for introduction and characterization in apple.	Glycoalkaloids will be reduced in potatoes by suppression of both branches of the SGA pathway using small inverted hairpin structures of double stranded RNA-generating constructs. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) will be produced by these constructs specific for both the Sgt1 and Sgt2 gene family members responsible for the initial steps in each of the two SGA biosynthetic branches, resulting in gene inactivation. Suppression constructs will be tested for efficacy via standard genetic transformation, but will ultimately be adapted for intragenic transformation and eventual commercial application. Transgenic potato tubers producing siRNAs will be evaluated for transgene expression and SGA accumulation.  Replacing 5325-21420-003-00D (08/2008).  BL-1, certification 5/17/07."

This will be achieved by accomplishing these four objectives:Objective 1: Conserve and regenerate priority crops, crop varieties, native species, and other NPGS genetic resources adapted to circumpolar and other high latitude regions efficiently and effectively, and distribute samples and associated information worldwide.Objective 2: Strategically expand the genetic diversity in genebank collections and improve associated information for priority genetic resources of crops, crop varieties, and native plant genetic resources adapted to circumpolar and other high latitude regions.Objective 3: Strategically characterize (ôgenotypeö) and evaluate (ôphenotypeö) priority Rheum, Deschampsia, and other selected genetic resources for molecular markers, morphological descriptors, and key agronomic or horticultural traits.Objective 4: Elucidate the effects of key associated insects and pathogens on selected crops, crop varieties, and native plant genetic resources adapted to circumpolar and other high latitude regions.Approach:Agricultural development in circumpolar regions depends upon the availability of a broad genetic base of plant cultivars adapted to long day, short season and cool climate conditions. The biological properties of most high latitude native plant species and crop species are poorly understood, especially in plant hardiness zones not found in the conterminous U.S. Characterizations of germplasm and subsequent documentation of data are critical for germplasm management, utilization and the development of new crops for northern latitudes. There is a need for increased research to improve management of arctic/subarctic germplasm and to understand disease etiologies, host-pathogen interactions, and disease vector relationships. The USDA/ARS/NPGS is responsible for maintaining a diverse collection of plant genetic material in USA. The Subarctic Agricultural Research Unit is the primary U.S. location for preservation of plant germplasm important as food, feed, medicine, land reclamation, and site remediation in arctic/subarctic zones. This project is the only ARS, plant genetic resource conservation unit in the circumpolar region. The germplasm collection in Palmer maintains over 600 accessions. Research projects on targeted plant species include, but are not limited to Rheum, Carex, Juncus, Calamagrostis, Deschampsia, and Angelica spp. Other species such as potato, lupine, clover, black medic, barley, currant, strawberry, and other fruits are or will be studied on the Palmer site to help other NPGS units. Primary goals are: 1. To conserve and regenerate priority crops, crop varieties, native species, and other NPGS genetic resources adapted to circumpolar and high latitude regions, and distribute samples and associated information worldwide. 2. To strategically expand the genetic diversity in genebank collections, and improve associated information for priority genetic resources of crops, crop varieties, and native plant genetic resources adapted to circumpolar and other high latitude regions. 3. To strategically characterize and evaluate priority Rheum, Deschampsia, and other selected genetic resources for molecular markers, morphological descriptors, and key agronomic or horticultural traits. 4.

Assessing sustainability and the basic interactions among system components are multifaceted tasks that require long-term studies integrating a multidisciplinary approach to understand system constraints and also provide data needed to support evaluation of impacts of specialty crops by system modelers. Improved cropping systems will be developed that reduce erosion, reclaim excess N, build organic matter, and suppress pests and improve soil and environmental quality and economic viability. Application of conservation tillage to specialty cropping systems will be investigated to evaluate improving environmental, biological and economic sustainability.  With the expansion of the bioenergy industry in the U.S. and state and regional mandates for biofuel blending have made biofuels a high priority issue for the USDA. The expansion of the biofuel industry on potato and other specialty crop production will be investigated. The projected growth of the ethanol and biodiesel industries in the PNW will produce large quantities of organic-based co-products. These co-products are much greater than what can be utilized locally as a source of animal feed, so alternative value added uses will be investigated. The use of these co-products could be used to offset the high costs of nutritional and pest control requirements of potato and specialty crops. The demand for organic produce continues to expand and is of increasing interest to PNW growers.  Managing weeds and providing adequate nutrients are the two major production issues for organic producers.  Economical and environmentally friendly solutions are needed for organic producers to increase production efficiency by management of weeds and nutrients. Formerly 5354-21660-001-00D (8.08)."

New varieties are needed which are also resistant to diseases and insects and have excellent storage potential to maintain quality. This multidisciplinary regional research project helps farmers address these needs. Specifically, we propose to provide farmers new potato varieties to solve production problems and meet consumers changing needs. These varieties will have improved yields, enhanced fresh market, processing or value-added traits, and better pest resistance resulting in reduced chemical inputs."

Chemical pesticides are not very effective at controlling these pests becuase they cannot reach the pests. Entomopathogenic nematodes are effective at killing soil-dwelling insects and do not cause injury to sweet potatoes. Therefore there is potential that sweet potato insects can be more effectively controlled by nematodes than by current pest management strategies. This project will evaluate several nematode species in the laboratory for their potential to control key pests of sweet potato. Those which prove to be most promising will be field tested under a variety of production practices to evaluate the compatibility and effectiveness of these biological control agents under current production practices.

We will use leading high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to identify DNA variation in genes of high value traits such as carbohydrate, sugar and vitamin content (important consumer and processor traits). We will support centralized facilities for characterizing the DNA sequence variation in relevant potato and tomato lines and breeding populations. In addition, we will support a centralized database that the breeders will use to curate and share information. Concurrently, we will also provide workshops for the breeders to learn how to integrate these new techniques and the database in their breeding efforts. We established a network of cooperating breeding programs to collect standardized data on relevant varieties, parental lines, and wild species that are broadly useful in breeding and to the scientific community. These resources will ultimately be used by breeders to develop improved varieties. Through partnerships with the Solanaceae Genomics Network and Michigan State University, we will enhance access and availability of breeder friendly analysis tools. A small grants program will leverage the DNA sequence variation characterization tools for additional genetic mapping of agronomic, disease/insect resistance and quality traits that will ultimately impact the environment positively and nutritionally enhance the consumer products (potatoes, tomatoes and processed products). Outreach efforts will consist of integrated education and extension, through developing curricula for graduate students, offering a breeder practicum, and developing a community of learning for extension specialists via the eXtension web portal to extend our impact to the national level. Continuous assessment by a designated evaluator will be used to improve effectiveness of our education and extension efforts."

The importance of potatoes as a staple food is clear: potato is the world's 3rd-largest food crop and the leading vegetable crop in the United States, with annual per capita consumption of about 126 pounds (NPC 2006; NPC 2007). In recent years, demand for specialty potatoes has risen sharply in developed countries and the United States, in particular. Due to their health benefiting properties, specialty or colored potatoes are an important delivery mechanism for bioactive compounds through popular and palatable means. Colored potatoes are rich in anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactive plant compounds, such as carotenoids, and anthocyanins. For producers and consumers to more fully benefit from these properties, it is essential to elucidate the specific mechanisms of action of these protective foods and also understand the effects of post-harvest storage and processing methods on the biological activity of the functional compounds found in specialty potatoes. To address the above need for research, we propose to determine the effect of post-harvest treatments (fresh vs. stored potato) and processing methods (baking vs. frying) on the content, composition, and bioavailability of specialty potato carotenoids and anthocyanins. We will also determine the extent to which raw and processed potato carotenoids and anthocyanins differ in their alteration of colonic, mesenteric, systemic oxidative stress, and/or inflammation (inflammation can lead to oxidative stress), lipid metabolism and food intake via hunger, and satiety hormones. To answer these research questions we will utilize samples collected from pigs provided with high-fat diet for two months followed by high-fat diets containing either fresh, baked or fried potatoes for 6 weeks. Research findings will be communicated through a variety of mechanisms that results in greater technology and knowledge transfer to stakeholders including potato producers and processors. Findings from this multidisciplinary/multi-institutional integrated research project and our prior experience (screened 320 specialty potato selections; identified top five, stable across location and season) will enable us to convey accurate and meaningful information on means of preserving and/or enhancing carotenoid and anthocyanin content to producers and industry partners from several states, including the major potato production regions of Idaho, Oregon, California, Colorado, North Dakota, Minnesota, Texas, and Washington."

However, information about the health benefits must spread widely through a society if people are going to adopt the new food.  Social networks are especially important in African economies because other institutions are weak; these networks are an important pathway for information diffusion.  This doctoral dissertation measures the effects of social networks on decisions to purchase the new variety of sweet potato.  Research methods include a direct household survey of 500 households and field experiments using dictator and trust games to measure the effects of altruism and trust on network diffusion effects.This project contributes to the growing area of network economics by providing a direct measurement of the effects of a specific social network on information diffusion.

Over 400 species of plants are susceptible to this pathogen.  Currently, there are no adequate resistance strategies against Sclerotinia diseases (culturally or chemically) and breeding for resistance to this fungus has not been successful.  Annual losses of crops from diseases caused by S. sclerotiorum in the U.S. are in the multimillion dollar range.  The fact that Sclerotinia is aggressive, broad in its host range, poorly controlled and causes significant economical damage, coupled with the lack of resistant cultivars necessitates the development of alternative control strategies.  A molecular based mechanistic approach will be used in this project to understand why the fungus is so successful; in particular the project will examine the roles that reactive oxygen species and oxalic acid play as key modulators of fungal disease.  The project is supported by recent observations that demonstrated that fungal secreted oxalate induces a programmed cell death in the plant host and recapitulates S. sclerotiorum disease symptoms.  Similarly oxalic acid induces increased reactive oxygen species levels in the plant which correlate with, and are necessary for, programmed cell death and disease.   Results from these studies will provide information for alternative disease control strategies based on interference with these key fungal pathogenicity determinants.Broader Impact     The experiments described in this project offer broad and comprehensive training for students encompassing a number of fields. Current approaches include microbiology, plant pathology, plant biology, high throughput gene silencing screens, molecular biology and genetics. The mechanisms underlying fungal induced plant disease are both fundamental and of practical importance. This is particularly noteworthy since food safety, food contamination and food security are critically important issues nationally and internationally. This is compounded by  Sclerotinia diseases since control measures (genetic and chemical) are largely ineffective. This research program will provide a unique and interdisciplinary training opportunity for a graduate student, postdoctoral fellows, and undergraduate students to participate in a critical area of stress signalling and cell death regulation, while conceptually addressing broader conceptual ideas as to how this particular group of important plant pathogens achieves pathogenic success.  The project also supports summer research activities for students from Hispanic Serving Institutions and a Land Grant University in Texas."

Currently, 14 taxonomic classes of heterokont algae are recognized, and they include over 100,000 described species (as many as one million total species has been estimated by experts).  Common members include brown seaweeds (e.g., kelp) and the diatoms.  Remarkably, despite two centuries of light microscopic study, 50 years of electron microscopic study, and 20 years of molecular investigations, the phylogenetic relationships among the 14 classes remains unknown. DNA sequences of seven nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genes from 270 heterokont algal species and 30 nonalgal relatives will be obtained and, entire chloroplast genomes from 30 species will be sequenced. The genome sequences will provide important new data for understanding chloroplasts and their origin(s), especially since knowledge in this field is greatly biased toward land plants. Algae serve as the base of the food chain for all organisms that dwell in the ocean and account for approximately half of the global photosynthesis, and therefore they provide approximately 50% of the oxygen we breathe.  Members of the heterokont algae vary in morphology from simple unicells to highly complex seaweeds. Brown algae are the principal elements of seaweed beds and these macroalgae have high economic values as food and biomass resources.  A number of heterokont algae are harmful to marine life. For example, some algae produce toxins that when concentrated in shellfish kill humans, while other species of heterokonts are well-known fish killers. Conversely, other heterokonts serve as a human food source, they are used in industrial processes and they have found new recognition in the nanotechnology industry. The closest relatives to the heterokont algae are the pseudofungi, which include many plant pathogens, such as the fungus that caused the Irish potato famine, and various molds and mildews. Graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds will be supported and trained in a wide diversity of fields, including evolution, genomics, molecular biology, computational biology, and plant biology. The research will be integrated with K-12 educators, public museums and parks using already established programs at several of the participating institutions.

Many of these pathogens can deliver proteins into the cytoplasm of their host cells to disable host immunity; these proteins are called effectors. The mechanism by which these proteins enter host cells is poorly understood. The investigators have shown that oomycete and fungal effector proteins can enter host cells without the aid of any pathogen-encoded machinery, but instead rely on short amino acid sequences in the N-termini called RXLR motifs. The investigators have discovered that the RXLR motifs can bind a class of membrane lipids called phosphoinositides. In this project, the investigators will test whether binding of the effectors to phosphoinositides is actually responsible for transferring the effectors into host cells. They will identify which host phosphoinositides are utilized by the effectors, and they will characterize the mechanism of binding. Finally they will test whether it is possible to block effector entry and so prevent disease. An extremely wide range of the most destructive plant pathogens, including those causing wheat rust, rice blast, grape powdery mildew and potato late blight depend on effectors. Understanding effector entry and determining how to block it would provide an entirely new approach to treating this broad class of diseases. Treatment of animal diseases caused by fungi, oomycetes and some parasites may also be treatable by this approach. This project will train two graduate students and provide summer research opportunities for multi-cultural undergraduate students."

This project investigates whether self-incompatibility, the ability of some plants to selectively prevent fertilization by their own pollen, affects the probability of formation or extinction of species. It combines greenhouse and field studies with mathematical modeling to investigate (a) the genetics underlying the complex mechanism of self-incompatibility in the agriculturally important plant family Solanaceae, (b) the conditions under which this mechanism is likely to be beneficial or detrimental within species, and (c) develop methods to investigate the effects of self-incompatibility on rates of formation and extinction of species from the study of groups that are incompletely sampled, a common problem in biology.The plant family studied contains potato, tomato, eggplant, tobacco, and many other cultivated and wild species selected to lose self- incompatibility. Understanding the basis of evolutionary success or failure of self-fertilizing plants will have implications for the development of seed banks, conservation priorities, and invasive species management. Finally, the mathematical methods developed will be applicable to studies of a wide variety of other traits and organisms."

Mueller and Joyce Van Eck (Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research), Stephen M. Stack (Colorado State University) The plant family Solanaceae includes tomato, pepper, potato and eggplant and is the most important vegetable family worldwide in terms of both economic value and volume of production. Tomato is also an important model system for studying fruit biology and plant responses to disease with discoveries impacting the production of many other crops. Recent advances in DNA sequencing have made it feasible to sequence the entire genome of an organism and an international consortium of 10 countries has initiated sequencing of tomato as a reference genome for the Solanaceae family of crops. This project represents the US contribution to the tomato genome sequencing effort and specifically encompasses creation of: 1) a low resolution DNA sequence of the entire tomato genome based on state-of-the-art sequencing technologies, 2) high quality DNA sequence of two of the twelve tomato chromosomes (chromosomes 1 and 10) to complement the remaining 10 chromosome sequences being created by our international partners, and 3) creation and enhancement of electronic web-based resources to allow characterization, analysis and delivery of the tomato genome sequence to researchers who will exploit it for biological discovery in tomato and additional crop species important as sources of food, fiber and energy. Availability of a tomato genome sequence will facilitate research and discovery leading to a broader understanding of plant biology, biodiversity and domestication and will impact agricultural improvement efforts directed toward crop sustainability, productivity and quality of tomato and related species.This project encompasses the US contribution to the international tomato genome sequencing effort. Public access to a reference genome sequence for tomato and related vegetable crops (potato, pepper, eggplant) will support and accelerate research activities focused on both basic understanding of plant biology and development of crop varieties with improved yield, performance, quality and sustainability, thus enhancing US and world food security. In addition to the impact of the resulting science, the project will also provide education and training opportunities. Specifically, four Ph.D. scientists (postdoctoral), two graduate students, approximately 20 undergraduate students and 17 computer programmers, research technicians and other professionals will receive training and employment under this project. The project will provide public outreach activities including presentations to K - 12th graders at schools in the vicinity of the participating research laboratories and summer research internship opportunities for ten undergraduate students in addition to those mentioned above. The project partners with ongoing USDA-funded research to convert output of the tomato genome sequencing effort into tools to assist crop breeding in addition to the development of web-based tools for their presentation to interested members of the research community and the general public. Information developed through this project will be deposited in the NCBI public DNA sequence database (GenBank), published in peer-reviewed journals and presented through the Solanaceae Genomics Network database (www.sgn.cornell.edu) that this project will support and expand."

However, gene function and the relationship between the genes and their influence on organisms can be quite complex, depending on other genes in the genome, the environment, and even from which parent the gene is inherited.

The evolutionary and developmental consequences of imprinting will be examined in tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) with a combination of controlled greenhouse crosses and studies of gene expression levels. In addition to discovering imprinted regions of the genome that influence seed weight, this research also will identify other complex genetic influences on seed traits.Imprinted genes are common in diverse organisms, including humans, but little is known about the evolutionary and developmental consequences of this phenomenon.   Imprinting is important in human health as some genetic diseases are due to mis-expression of imprinting.  Additionally imprinting is often a barrier to hybridization and crop improvement especially in the genus Solanum (tomatoes, potatoes and their relatives)."

Cell-to-cell trafficking of RNA is a recently discovered mechanism that controls gene regulation, viral infection, cellular antiviral responses, and cell-to-cell communication. This project investigates how an RNA produced in a cell is selected for transport into neighboring cells and even to distant organs in a plant, a basic mechanistic question of fundamental importance to understand trafficking regulation for all RNAs. Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) infection will be used as a simple experimental model to test the hypothesis that an RNA has distinct structural motifs to interact with cellular factors to potentiate trafficking across successive cellular boundaries from the plant surface to the centrally located vascular tissue for long-distance transport. Specifically, the project will (1) analyze a series of trafficking-defective mutants of PSTVd to identify the RNA motifs mediating trafficking through different cellular boundaries, (2) test the predicted three-dimensional structural model of a trafficking motif through extensive mutational analyses, and (3) determine the role of a plant protein in PSTVd trafficking. Results from the project will provide groundbreaking insights about how an infectious RNA has evolved distinct structural elements to use cellular machinery to establish infection, and help develop a conceptual framework to study the mechanisms of RNA trafficking underlying many biological processes. This project will include training of undergraduate and graduate students. This training will expose students to cutting-edge cross-disciplinary research approaches to study fundamental biological problems. The project will also enhance science education for elementary/middle/high school students and secondary school teachers, including traditionally underrepresented groups."

Late blight disease results in multi-billion dollar yield losses and the application of millions of tons of fungicides each year. Chemical-dependent potato farming carries high production and environmental costs. One of the most economical and environmentally sound ways to reduce fungicide usage is deployment of late blight resistance genes. We have a long research history of working with RB, a foliar late blight resistance gene from a wild potato species. As we move towards large-scale deployment of the RB gene in India and other parts of the world, its impact on both foliar and tuber late blight disease must be considered.This project utilizes &ldquo;next generation,&rdquo; high-throughput RNA sequencing to identify plant genes involved in resistance to late blight in foliage and tubers. Our research will enhance basic understanding in the plant sciences and will assist researchers in developing specific deployment strategies for RB in a no- or reduced-fungicide production setting.This project encompasses a series of experiments aimed at testing the following hypotheses:     Hypothesis 1: Different organs of potato (e.g., foliage vs. tubers) use the same or similar defense mechanisms against the late blight pathogen P. infestans.     Hypothesis 2: Differences in disease phenotypes in different organs within the same genotype are due to differences in timing of defense initiation.     Hypothesis 3: High resistance gene transcript levels lead to earlier initiation of defense mechanisms in all plant organs."

This research will show what type of damage is caused to potato aphids after they feed on resistant plants. We seek to answer how plant defenses impact insect pests. In this process, we will develop potato aphid transcript sequence resources and made them available to the scientific community. In addition, we will develop a high-throughput gene silencing approach for piercing-sucking insects that abolishes the function of individual genes to understand their roles.

The goal of this project is to use protein microarray-based technology to determine the function of 1440 oomycete effectors in a high throughput manner. The knowledge gained from the project will help to determine how these pathogens cause devastating diseases in plants. O?mycete pathogens are highly destructive and very difficult to control with traditional genetic resistance strategies or with pesticides.

All known plants serve as a food source for at least some of the estimated one million or more known insect herbivores. Almost 20% of all agricultural output is lost to herbivory, either during the growth of crops or in the course of transport and storage. However, most plants can recognize insect damage and respond by mounting effective defense responses. In many cases, these include the increased production of toxic or deterrent chemicals. Unlike chewing insects such as caterpillars, aphids insert slender stylets into plants to feed from the phloem sap, and thereby do relatively little overt damage to plant tissue. Nevertheless, plants can recognize aphid feeding and initiate defense responses. One way in which plants may recognize aphid infestation is through the detection of salivary proteins that are continuously injected into the plant during aphid feeding. Among the many aphids that can infest agricultural crops, the green peach aphid is one of the most widely distributed and destructive species. This insect infests hundreds of plant species, including many important crop plants. In the United States, the green peach aphid is a pest of major field crops such as potato, sugar beet, sunflower, and tobacco. Additionally, it infests numerous vegetables and ornamental plants. Agricultural damage caused by the green peach aphid results primarily from the fact that this pest is able to transmit more than one hundred destructive crop plant viruses. The proposed research is directed at studying the interaction of the green peach aphid with its host plants, with a particular emphasis on identifying aphid salivary proteins that are necessary for successful aphid feeding, or which are recognized by the plants to mount defense responses. To gain a better understanding of what makes the green peach aphid such a successful pest, its genome will be sequenced in the early stages of the project. All DNA sequence data will be placed in public databases to make them available to other researchers. Aphid salivary proteins will be identified from dissected aphid salivary glands. Genes encoding these salivary gland proteins will be cloned and studied by expression in plants. Plant responses to specific proteins will be identified and it will be determined whether the expression of particular aphid salivary proteins leads to increased or decreased aphid resistance. Biochemical assays of plants will help to identify specific functions of aphid salivary proteins. Such functional analysis of aphid salivary proteins may lead to new and improved pest control strategies. In particular, it may be possible to trigger natural plant defenses more rapidly, or otherwise counteract the mechanisms that aphids use to successfully feed from the plant phloem."

Management activities designed to reduce these threats depend on timely, accurate and user-friendly information, including models and other decision support tools, regarding the timing and severity of specific pests. Pest and plant disease models used as IPM and biosecurity decision aids require accurate, site-specific weather data. Weather-dependent models now exist for many high-value crops grown in the Western USA and for crop biosecurity support for response to threatening and invasive species. Effective delivery and interpretation of these models requires an approach both area-wide and geographical, yet terrain-aware forecast maps as visualization tools are not yet available. In previous work, we developed integrated state-of-the-art on-line tools and service protocols for producing site-specific (2 km resolution) weather and pest model forecasts with associated quantified error and uncertainty rates. We now will supplement these efforts with hi-resolution, automated maps that are readily adaptable to a wide degree of pest models and situations, using near-real-time PRISM climate mapping, mesoscale weather forecast models, and improved downscaling algorithms for pest risk and decision support. These will support different sized regions and resolutions as specified by end-users of the information. We will develop implementation and web-based delivery programs, including mapped and animated model predictions, linked to site-based plant pest and disease models, and outbreak tracking systems, on both area- and region-wide spatial scales, using the IPM PIPE (pest information platform for extension and education) as a model. We will engage small groups of producer stakeholders in several crops across three states and two government national biosecurity programs in order to incorporate stakeholder innovations and measure adoption of the approach. Thorough assessment of technology transfer success will be integrated within the project. This effort will enhance existing systems and create support for underserved areas. Specific regions and commodities involved in these developments include South Central Washington, for potato and hop, NW Oregon for wine grapes, hop, and grass seed, and Sacramento and Napa CA for wine grapes.

We will use a combination of bioinformatics and functional studies to identify regulatory genes which are important for pathogenicity in S. scabies. We will then characterize the regulatory networks for a subset of these genes and examine gene expression in S. scabies in response to highly susceptible and moderately resistant to potato scab.

However, the economic sustainability of this industry is threatened by a new emerging disease named Zebra Chip (ZC). Zebra Chip affects all market classes of potato, such as the potato chip, fresh market, and French fry industries, by reducing both yield and quality. It was first identified in the US from Texas in 2000, but now has been detected in several other major potato production regions across the US. It is imperative to identify the major factors that impact disease incidence, severity, and spread, and to develop research and educational programs that will help producers deal with this new threat. Containment of the disease is especially important since Korea recently placed a quarantine on importation of potatoes from areas where Zebra Chip is present, an act that quickly could escalate into a cascade of countries placing restrictions on importation of US potatoes Specific deliverables of this project will include 1) Best management practices (BMP) for ZC, 2) A ZC risk assessment/disease forecasting model to trigger BMP, 3) Germplasm with tolerance to ZC, 4) an Economic cost/benefit analysis and economic models for best case/worst case scenarios, 5) Publications, and educational and training programs dealing with all aspects of ZC, and 6) Dependable scientific data that will be useful to US regulatory agencies in development of a Pest Risk Assessment for ZC, which will be needed to address the recent Korean quarantine on US potatoes. These deliverables will directly impact and enhance environmental quality through more controlled and targeted pesticide application, economic sustainability for potato producers and processors, and overall consumer confidence in the safety and quality of US potatoes and potato products."

In response, diverse groups of students, retired executives, women, and gardeners aspire to start and expand new farm enterprises in the region. The goal of this program is to increase the success of beginning farmers and ranchers in the Southeast Region of Pennsylvania. Success will be measured not only by the numbers of new farms and farmers, but also by their ability to be profitable, productive, environmentally sound, and engaged in their communities. Beginning farmers and ranchers in the region will be trained in production, marketing, financial management and land acquisition skills necessary for successful farm entry. Program activities will address the three main barriers to farm entry: lack of training, land and capital. An eight week introduction to farming will be taught in three counties each year. Intensive training courses in ten production and marketing areas will be available for new farmers who are ready to make serious steps toward building their new farm business including: Sheep Management, Sheep Shearing, Novice Farmer Study Circles, Grazing School, Organic Vegetables, Fruit Production, Exploring the Small Farm Dream, Potato Production, and Soils. The Lehigh County Agricultural Incubator will serve as a living classroom where potential farmers can learn diverse production strategies. New farmers will start their new businesses on county owned land with reduced land and equipment rental rates. Pennsylvania Farm Link will provide training in land and capital acquisition. As a result of this project four hundred and sixty-five beginning and aspiring farmers will increase knowledge in production, marketing, financial management and land acquisition strategies and intend to implement new techniques critical for their success each year. Participants will increase the productivity, profitability and environmental stewardship on their farms. Fifteen successful new farms per year will be established."

In the past, PVY has been managed effectively by potato seed certification programs, but the widespread acceptance of cultivars that are tolerant of infection (plants are diseased, but do not show symptoms) and the emergence of necrotic strains of PVY bring new challenges to seed certification, seed trade and potato production. Many of these necrotic viruses induce mild foliar symptoms in potato and are more difficult to identify during field inspections, yet they are more damaging to tubers. The current practices in potato seed certification which are dependent upon visual assessment of virus infection levels in the growing crop cannot effectively manage the new strains of PVY in the current array of cultivars, and they will not prevent the necrotic strains from becoming prevalent. Inaccurate field inspections and improper diagnosis have contributed to increased incidence of some necrotic strains leading to some unnecessary trade restrictions. Necrotic strains of PVY pose a significant threat to the potato industry due to reductions in yield and lower tuber quality. Additionally, because they are regulated pathogens, the necrotic strains will continue to impact interstate and international seed trade. An evolving national management plan sanctioned by the industry provides guidelines that will be refined by our research to reduce overall PVY incidence and limit the introduction of necrotic strains. Several of the principal investigators of this project have served as the scientific advisors for the plan development and revision. The US-Canada Management Plan for Viruses that Cause Tuber Necrosis in Potato Tubers, signed into effect in April 2006, is designed to facilitate the trade of potatoes within and between the US and Canada while protecting the potato industry from several emerging viruses, including PVY, that cause yield and quality losses in the potato crop. Management strategies and research needs of the industry are listed in the plan and by design are reviewed and refined by the industry on an annual basis. The overall objective of this project is to refine the current management strategies based on industry needs to reduce overall levels of PVY and prevent the spread of necrotic strains. Specifically, we will 1) Work with seed certification agencies to develop new tools to better identify and eliminate PVY from seed stocks. These will include training aids to better identify infected plants in the field, and improve diagnostics and post harvest testing procedures to better evaluate the tuber crop, 2) Work with breeders to develop PVY resistant cultivars or cultivars with recognizable symptoms. Current cultivars and breeding lines will be evaluated in regional trials to look for new sources of resistance and to identify the level of susceptibility to a range of PVY strains, 3) Work with growers to develop cost effective, on-farm virus control strategies that are aimed at reducing the amount of PVY introduced to the crop and controlling the spread of the virus in the crop."

Our long-term goals are to develop potato varieties adapted to our states and region. The climate for investing in genetic and breeding strategies to improve the cultivated potato 2n=4x=48 Solanum tuberosum subsp. tuberosum L. could not be greater than today. Challenging the production system are newly emerging pathogens with unfamiliar pathogenicity and unstudied epidemiology along with more aggressive strains of historical pathogens. Advanced technologies allowing potato breeders to respond with a diversity of genetic approaches from field and laboratory based platforms are available. Stresses on the environment and ecology are concerns such as nitrate leaching from agricultural production, ground water contamination, pesticide and sediment runoff into waterways, and the need to reduce water use. This research is important to our region because the NCR accounts for 263,000 acres or 23% of U.S. potato production. The potato is the highest volume vegetable crop in the NCR. In US production, the NCR annually ranks fourth (ND), fifth (WI), sixth (MN) and seventh (MI). The farm-gate value of the region's production amounts to approximately $716 million; $128 million (MI), $129 million (MN), $168 million (ND), and $291 million (WI). NCR producers grow potatoes for seed, fry processing, chip processing, and fresh market. A large portion of the production is processed, thus the value-added component considerably increases the crop's contribution to the region's economy. Our research provides solutions by combining novel genetics with new breeding strategy to develop and release potato varieties adapted to the NCR. Complicating the market are trends that show flat or declining potato consumption in various market segments. Our research performs sensory evaluations to have greater understanding of consumer response to NCR clones. We are also screening for attributes important to human health (potassium), as prioritized by the industry in our region."

These techniques will ultimately be incorporated into potato production systems. Outreach and education targeted specifically at biologically based IPM and ecosystem production methods are essential to promote adoption by growers. In Wisconsin we have developed the foundation for biointensive IPM education. We are now proposing to continue the educational efforts which will enable growers to integrate biointensive IPM strategies into existing production systems. The overall momentum of the Collaboration has been extremely strong with many accomplishments such as the continuation of the marketing effort, enhancements of the Collaboration standards, improvements of resistance management protocols, database implementation, grant coordination and expansion of the development and use of educational tools for growers. We have worked with numerous faculty, industry representatives, potato and other commodity organizations, and environmental organizations to export this agricultural model for targeted and industry-wide change. In Wisconsin, this work is expanding to other vegetable crops, such as carrots, peppers, beans and peas, and is now also expanding to fruit crops. Furthermore, we have enhanced the ecological portions of the Collaboration by working with national and local environmental organizations and expanding our research with University of Wisconsin faculty by involving their expertise, research and education into the project. We need to maintain this strength while exporting the model of industry-wide agricultural changes through the use of policy and communication efforts. The success of the adoption of biointensive IPM programs by growers will be measured utilizing the measurement system previously developed by the Collaboration. At the conclusion of this project we expect to have completed detailed performance evaluations for a range of reduced-risk pest management alternatives. We will use this information in the educational activities and materials to provide growers with detailed efficacy and economic analysis of various alternatives which can be used by individual growers to refine their pest management practices to more biologically based, less toxic practices. The marketplace rewards which have been generated through the eco-labeling project in Wisconsin have also created a favorable climate for our biointensive IPM strategies to be adopted throughout the region. We are confident that growers see the potential for value-added marketing as a mechanism to offset declining commodity returns in traditional markets. The WWF/WPVGA/UW Collaboration will continue its outreach, stakeholder participation, and national policy efforts to increase dialogue on using market-based incentives to advance growers' use of biointensive IPM and reduce reliance on high-risk pesticides."

Potato is the #1 dollar-value vegetable crop in the region, contributing over $9 billion annually to the US economy. For decades growers have used frequent, prophylactic sprays of broad-spectrum insecticides to meet the very low damage thresholds mandated by potato processors. However, processors are now requiring growers to document their use of integrated pest management (IPM) schemes, and to justify each pesticide application. Unfortunately, we lack knowledge of the true disease-transmission risk posed by insect vectors and have yet to identify effective, targeted control options. This threatens the economic sustainability of regional potato production. We will fill these knowledge-gaps with three integrated research and extension components. The First Component develops a multi-state sampling network for aphids and leafhoppers and their associated plant pathogens, and effective reduced-spray management plans for these pests (and for the secondary pests likely to become more prevalent as spray frequency decreases). The Second Component develops a detailed understanding of the impacts of predators and pathogens on key pest species, so that biological control agents can be included in IPM decision making. This will be accomplished in part through the use of novel molecular gut-content analyses of key predator species. The Third Component develops an improved sociological understanding of how growers reach spray decisions, and creates the means for growers to analyze the economic effectiveness of new risk mitigation strategies given the uncertainty of vector and plant pathogen outbreaks. The principal investigators include entomologists, virologists, extension educators, economists and sociologists from the three regional land-grant universities and the USDA-ARS. Results and IPM recommendations will be disseminated through an innovative extension program that emphasizes hands-on learning and in-field demonstration, in addition to innovative web, instruction, and publication outlets.

One of the most economically important groups of oomycetes are PHYTOPHTHORA species, which attack vast range of plant hosts, causing rots of seedlings and the roots, stems, leaves and fruits of mature plants. The economic damage to crops in the United States by PHYTOPHTHORA species is estimated in the billions of dollars, and worldwide it is many times this. PHYTOPHTHORA PARASITICA Dastur (syn P. NICOTIANAE Breda et Haan) is a devastating pathogen with one of the widest host ranges of any described PHYTOPHTHORA species, infecting more than 100 genera of plants. Economically important hosts include solanaceous crops (tomato, pepper, eggplant, potato, tobacco), many orchard tree crops (citrus, walnut, almond, pistachio, papaya, peach, plum, apricot, apple, pear, macadamia, avocado, guava, pomegranate), tropical fruits (pineapple, banana, durian, passionfruit), oilseeds (sesame, safflower), vegetables (cucurbits and Brassicas) and many ornamental plants. The most important economic losses in the United States are to the tomato, citrus, tobacco and nursery industries. Comparing the genetic repertoire of P. PARASITICA with those of three other sequenced PHYTOPHTHORA species, two that have a narrow host range and one that has a broad host range, will provide important insights into the genetic basis of host range and host specificity, which will be valuable in designing strategies for protecting wide ranges of crops against PHYTOPHTHORA infection. Comparison of the genome sequences from P. PARASITICA with those of P. INFESTANS, with which it is evolutionarily similar, will significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms of evolution of host range. In particular, understanding the mechanisms underlying wide host range will help understand the broad host range forest pathogen P. RAMORUM, that causes the sudden oak death disease in California."

However, these programs are at immediate risk because of the development of large populations of the potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli) and the losses associated with the transmission of Candidatus Liberibacter psyllaurous. As a result, growers are repeatedly applying large amounts of chemical pesticides, particularly organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, and neonicatinoids. We propose to develop sustainable IPM strategies based on a combination of chemical, biological, and cultural strategies. For the chemical approach, we will determine the resistance levels to key pesticides and invesigate the potential of new 'green' compounds to deter transmission of the pathogen. Our biocontrol approach includes an assessment of the potential for emplyoment of beneficial insects to provide critical ecosystem services in areas outside the crop fields. The cultural approach will allow growers to 1) choose the level of cultivar susceptibility they plant and, 2) target weed control specifically to the species that harbor the pathogen, while allowing other species to act as field insectaries to generate beneficial insects. This project directly addresses all PMAP objectives, including: 1) developing or adapting IPM tactics and technologies to address specific pest problems, 2) adapting and evaluating effectiveness of modified IPM tactics, and, 3) describing how anticipated results can be economically integrated into production systems for individual crops.

Much of the native flora is either threatened or endangered, which has made the conservation of these species a priority. Due to the sensitivity of Hawaii?s botanical resources, concern has been voiced that hybridization and gene flow between agricultural crops and native species may exacerbate the precarious position of rare endemic species. Of particular concern is that gene flow may occur from agricultural crops that have been modified through recombinant-DNA or biotechnological techniques. Genetically engineered agricultural crops play an important role in Hawai?i, and have the potential to significantly benefit local industry and environment. However, areas where these crops are grown are sympatric with the distributions of a number of rare endemic Hawaiian plant species. Therefore, it is essential that the potential for hybridization between transgenic agricultural crops and native Hawaiian species be examined so that proper management strategies can be developed for situations posing high risk. This project will examine the potential for cross-pollination between sunflower and endemic Compositae; commercial and endemic cotton species; and potato and indigenous Solanum species in Hawaii. Previous examination of the flora has determined that these three crops pose the greatest risk for hybridization with native species. We will make hand-pollinations in the laboratory among the study species, and will measure fitness of F1 and F2 hybrid progeny. Molecular markers (AFLP?s), seed viability and back-crossing will be used to quantify outcrossing compatibility and fitness of hybrids. Legitimate and important agricultural growth could be threatened by the absence of an adequate understanding of potential gene flow, and thus the development and implementation of management protocols to prevent cross-pollination. The risk of gene flow to the species of concern may be negligible; however, this study will quantify this risk through a formal risk assessment using field and laboratory data, to determine if this is the case or not. Determining the potential for gene flow from crops to native species will allow all stakeholders to minimize the risks, and thus contribute to the protection of Hawaii?s agricultural potential and natural resources. This project will contribute to improved capabilities for assessing potential environmental impacts of transgenic crops on the national and international scale, in addition to providing data pertinent to Hawaii."

Increasing temperature inactivates pectinases. To reduce clarification time, one would need to add greater amounts of enzymes which would increases the cost of processing. Also, to ensure safety and to preserve, juices also need to be pasteurized to inactivate pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. Typically juices are pasteurized at about 85 C for 30 s. The combined effects of depectination and pasteurization decreases the nutritional value and fresh-like sensory attributes of the juice. In this project we propose to simultaneously clarify and pasteurize apple juice to maximize fresh-like quality retention by applying high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) to unclarified apple juice. Most research in food enzymes has focused on the inactivation of enzymes that are deleterious to food quality such as polyphenol oxidase that causes browning in potatoes, and apples. However, very little research has been done on the stabilizing and activating effects HHP on some processing enzymes used in the food or pharmaceutical industries. The hypothesis is that HHP in the range of 100 to 300 MPa stabilizes some microbial pectolytic enzymes allowing increasing the temperature above 60 C thus, increasing activity above the level used under atmospheric pressure and reducing the required amount of enzyme and/or decreasing processing time. The stability and activity of commercial pectinases at 0-400 MPa and 55-85 C for selected incubation times will be studied by determining the rate of viscosity reduction and the rate of decrease in turbidity. We will also determine the extent of inactivation of the most important pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms found in apple juice: E. coli O157:H7, and Alicyclobacillus. A high pressure reactor and high pressure optical cell will be used for incubations and measurements. The proposed research will help better understanding pressure stabilization and activation of enzymes. Clarification under HHP with simultaneous microbial inactivation has the potential to reduce enzyme consumption and energy usage during pasteurization and potentially eliminate pasteurization after juice clarification. This reduction in enzyme and energy costs has the potential of making HHP technology economically viable in the fruit juice industry. The resulting higher quality products will increase the competitiveness of U.S. fruit juices, in particular, for markets seeking fresh-like quality products. In this project we will study the effects of pressure."

Since the inception of the Southwestern Regional Project in 1997 18 new cultivars have been released which make up substantial and increasing portions of the regional potato acreage and have become important contributors to the economies of the states. Of newly released cultivars ranking in the top 20 that were accepted for certification in the US in 2007, cultivars developed by the Southwestern Regional Potato Cultivar Development Project since 1997 comprise the highest percentage acreage - more than any other region."

We call this effort translational genomics. Our team of researchers (SolCAP) aims to reduce this gap by focusing on development of genetic maps that are relevant to breeding improved varieties in two major Solanaceae vegetable crops: potato and tomato. We will use leading high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to identify DNA variation in genes of high value traits such as carbohydrate, sugar and vitamin content (important consumer and processor traits). We will support centralized facilities for characterizing the DNA sequence variation in relevant potato and tomato lines and breeding populations. In addition, we will support a centralized database that the breeders will use to curate and share information. Concurrently, we will also provide workshops for the breeders to learn how to integrate these new techniques and the database in their breeding efforts. We established a network of cooperating breeding programs to collect standardized data on relevant varieties, parental lines, and wild species that are broadly useful in breeding and to the scientific community. These resources will ultimately be used by breeders to develop improved varieties. Through partnerships with the Solanaceae Genomics Network and Michigan State University, we will enhance access and availability of breeder friendly analysis tools. A small grants program will leverage the DNA sequence variation characterization tools for additional genetic mapping of agronomic, disease/insect resistance and quality traits that will ultimately impact the environment positively and nutritionally enhance the consumer products (potatoes, tomatoes and processed products). Outreach efforts will consist of integrated education and extension, through developing curricula for graduate students, offering a breeder practicum, and developing a community of learning for extension specialists via the eXtension web portal to extend our impact to the national level. Continuous assessment by a designated evaluator will be used to improve effectiveness of our education and extension efforts."

Hawaii is the most isolated island chain on the planet and is now dependent upon long distance transport (2300 miles) for our food and fuel. Though as late as the 1940s Hawaii could feed itself, the state now imports 90% of its food and almost all of its agricultural inputs, including seed. Disruption of shipping through shortages, natural disasters, strikes, or rising costs, leaves the state with a 3-7 day food supply on grocery shelves according to the Food Security Briefing at last session's Hawai'i State Legislature. Because Hawaii currently imports 90+% of our food, time is ripe for the development of a Public Seed Initiative. Hawaii's farmers and home gardeners are dependent upon mainland seed produced in temperate climates to provide the foundation for agriculture in the state. However Hawaii's climate is tropical and has diverse climatic zones as well as great variability in soil types and rainfall patterns. Open-pollinated seed nationwide is disappearing at an alarming rate and many of these OP and heirloom varieties, with their wide adaptation to climatic ranges, would be suitable for variety trials and seed development in and for Hawai'i. The University of Hawaii had a seed breeding program at one time, but this program was discontinued. Although multinational corporations conduct research and development of genetically engineered seed varieties in Hawaii due to its geographic isolation, this seed is not suitable for Hawaii's organic market farmers or home gardeners.  Hua Ka Hua - Restore Our Seed  is a three-day statewide symposium to bring knowledgeable agricultural stakeholders, including farmers, researchers, and extension agents, to discuss Hawaii's needs and opportunities for a long-term public seed initiative in the State of Hawaii. This symposium is necessary to re-start an organized and scientific approach to organic seed breeding and selection in Hawaii. This research has not been a university or extension service priority for many years with resulting loss of heirloom varieties and plant biodiversity. We will assess Hawaii farmers' knowledge and interest in organic seed production and solicit input on the development of a comprehensive plan for organic seed education and breeding programs specific to Hawaii and the Pacific Basin. This symposium will result in state-wide and local working groups that produce a plan and funding requests for island-by-island educational workshops, on-farm variety trials, selection and improvement of organic open-pollinated seed and germplasm (such as taro, and sweet potato) varieties suited for tropical environments, along with development of effective ways to share data in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific."

We will explore the potential to create effective mulches from pure preparations and mixes of shredded recycled newspaper and dried cover crop residues that can be grown on site. Our objective is to develop mulches using readily available materials and tools, that can be easily spread on the soil surface (i.e., around growing vegetables), and, which, after wetting, bond to themselves to create an impenetrable barrier against weeds. Shredded newspaper, when wetted, has been shown in previous research to have this tendency, but it is not known how to prepare a mulch to ensure that the mulch fragments will bond to each other, creating a solid barrier. We will determine the influence of different preparation methods on mulch cohesion including the width and length of mulch fragments and the amount and force of watering the mulch after it is spread on the soil. We will also determine if mixing shredded newspaper with plant residues that naturally suppress weeds through the release of chemicals that are toxic to germinating weeds (i.e., allelochemicals) increases weed control compared to newspaper alone. In addition, we will determine to what depth mulches need to be applied to control annual and perennial weeds that emerge from organs of different types and sizes (i.e., seeds, tubers, bulbs, etc.) so that appropriate mulch rates can be selected according to the types of weeds present. Mulches of different composition and with different physical characteristics can influence permeability to water and thus soil moisture, the spread of fungal spores to crop leaves through rain splash from the soil surface, and the availability of soil nutrients for crop growth as mulches are decomposed by soil microorganisms, which consumes nutrients. We will test the effect of mulches prepared from different materials on their overall effects on the growth of vegetables, including heirloom tomato, Edamame soybean, and sweet potato. These species have different growth habits (upright, trellised, or spreading), nutrient needs, and susceptibility to disease. Finally, we will do a budget analysis to determine the most cost-effective mulches, considering the costs of preparing, applying, and weeding (if needed) the mulches, and the expected return from crop sales. Our expected outcomes are 1) development of new sustainable, cost-effective, and user-friendly weed control strategies; 2) an improved scientific understanding of the physical characteristics required for a mulch to prevent weed emergence; and 3) the development of guidelines for the small farmer on how to prepare and apply mulches at a minimum cost to achieve good weed suppression and also build soil quality."

Use of disease-free planting stock limits tuber-borne diseases in potato crops, improving yield and quality. The current situation, with limited organic production of certified seed potatoes in the Midwest, forces organic growers to import at least some of their planting stock from other regions, and increases the risk of accidental introduction and spread of potato diseases. This project will support organic production of certified seed potatoes in the Midwest through field-based and economic research. Organic potato growers are also in need of access to a greater diversity of varieties, and to varieties adapted to organic production system. Heirloom varieties are likely to perform well in low-input organic conditions, and there is increasing consumer interest in the flavor and nutritional qualities of specialty potatoes. Our research will provide growers with detailed agronomic, sensory and nutritional data on heirloom and specialty potato varieties. Heirloom potato varieties will be grown in on-farm trials and characterized for yield, quality, disease resistance, taste and nutritional quality. Heirloom potato varieties are difficult to obtain as seed potatoes. Our collaboration with Seed Savers Exchange to eliminate pathogens from their heirloom potato collection is crucial to increase the availability of these varieties. We will conduct on-farm trials to define best management practices for organic production of seed potatoes, testing strategies for control of aphid-transmitted viruses which are a major seed potato production problem. A microeconomic analysis will be conducted based on the results of on-farm trials, and will be complemented by a macroeconomic analysis of organic markets. A grower-oriented publication focusing on the feasibility of growing organic seed potatoes will include worksheets useful to growers as operating guidelines and as financial documents for loan applications. Extension materials on heirloom and specialty varieties, best management practices for seed potato production, and the economics of organic seed potato production will be provided to growers and extension professionals through industry meetings and publications, field days, and online. Increased regional access to high quality seed potatoes for varieties that perform well in organic production will benefit organic growers in the Midwest by reducing seed potato costs (including shipping costs), reducing crop loss due to disease, increasing profitability by use of varieties suited to organic production, and increasing growers' ability to serve high value specialty potato markets. Economic risk to growers entering the seed potato industry will be reduced by providing them with analyses of the economic feasibility of organic seed potato production and markets for organic seed and tablestock potatoes. Increased economic stability of organic growers will benefit rural communities by providing employment opportunities and a demand for services in rural areas. Improved disease management of potato crops by cultural methods will reduce pesticide use, improving ecosystem health."

This threat of introduced pathogens is increasing due to a global trade, a highly mobile world population, and potential acts of bioterrorism. Rapid response to new pathogens requires accurate and reliable diagnostic procedures. This research is directed toward identifying regions of DNA diagnostic for pathogenicity, survival, and toxin production in fungi. Completion of the outlined research is necessary to locate specific DNA regions that can be used to identify individuals within a population and to distinguish between endemic and introduced fungal pathogens."

PVY, the most economically important potato virus in North America, causes severe economic losses to growers due to yield and tuber quality reduction. Seed growers have suffered rejection of over 50% of seed lots that are used as stock to recertify the following year. New PVY strains that cause tuber necrotic rings have increased the economic losses. Seed certification programs base cultural virus management in roguing diseased plants showing symptoms. However, some preferred cultivars in the U.S. display mild symptoms when infected with PVY necrotic strains, thus nullifying the effectiveness of roguing as a management strategy. Currently available insecticides are not effective, since the aphid vectors require only a few seconds of probing for acquisition and transmission of PVY. This project will a) study the reasons for the increased incidence of necrotic strains; and b) determine the effect and symptoms of necrotic strains in new and soon to be released potato cultivars. A list of cultivar-PVY reactions (foliar and tuber) determined by this research will be provided to the US potato industry to help in choosing cultivars that are resistant and/or have good foliar symptom expression allowing them to be rogued effectively. This list will be integrated in an improved multidimensional IPM program to reduce PVY in the PNW and consequently improve profitability for all potato growers."

The first objective involves evaluating the use of biofumigants from the genus Brassica and Sinapis to reduce G. pallida cyst viability by using seed meal and liquid extracts. The second objective is to isolate and identify possible biocontrol organisms from G. pallida cysts. The third objective is to evaluate potato germplasm for resistance to G. pallida. The fourth objective is to evaluate potential trap crops for G. pallida. The fifth objective is to develop potato grower education programs to minimize threat of infestation by G. pallida. The sixth objective is to evaluate an extract from a pathogen of wheat as a potential control method for G. pallida. The seventh objective is to continue research on the life cycle of G. pallida to insure adequate production of G. pallida cysts in laboratory and greenhouse to supply the cysts needed for the other objectives of this project. By combining several approaches to control G. pallida, a management plan for G. pallida will be developed that would increase the potential for elimination of G. pallida from Idaho production fields and minimize the economic impact on potato production based agricultural economies of the western United States."

Statistics No. 77, 2008). The value of all crops ranges from $ 4 to $ 6.5 billion/year (ND Ag. Statistics No. 77, 2008). Pest problems may severely impact yield and quality any given year, threatening the economy of the state and region, and export capacity. Examples: Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley resulted in several billion dollars loss to the state's economy from 1993-2005 (Nganje et. al., 2004; McMullen, 2005); other pests impact crops each year (Sugarbeet Research and Extension Report, http://www.sbreb.org; ND Crop and Pest Report (http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/aginfo/entomology/ndsucpr/index.htm). ND producers use pesticides as one management tool to combat pest outbreaks. For example, in 2004, 45.4% of cropland was sprayed with herbicides, 2.3% with insecticides, and 5.4% with fungicides (Pesticide Use and Pest Management Practices Survey in ND, 2004). This survey also showed that ND producers increased their use of IPM practices, such as use of field scouting and forecasting models, between 2000 and 2004 surveys. ND has a short growing season and a harsh winter climate. Citizens place high value on urban plantings which can survive the winter and which are relatively free of pest problems. A recent electronic questionnaire about urban IPM needs, sent to extension educators in 8 states of the High Plains region, including ND, indicated that almost 40% of their pest questions. This IPM project addresses those critical needs, by coordinating a statewide IPM program, providing collaborative efforts in pest management education across two states for two key crops, wheat and soybean, by demonstrating the value of integrated strategies for controlling a key disease of wheat, Fusarium head blight, by supporting the valuable resource of the NDSU Diagnostic Lab that services agriculture, homeowners, and the ornamental industry, and by increasing the outreach capabilities of the Urban IPM programs."

White grubs are the most cosmopolitan and damaging turfgrass pest of cool and warm season grasses in the U.S. White grubs feed on grass roots and are transported in sod and nursery plants. The older chemical pesticides, including organophosphates and carbamates, act as nerve toxins and kill many insects at any stage in their life cycle. These pesticides are highly toxic and are under examination and reregistration review by the U.S. EPA, and in most situations are not available for use. Increasing resistance development in Colorado potato beetle (CPB) against relatively new neonicotinoids that suppresses CPB populations has been reported. Thus, it is becoming critical to have environment-friendly effective control measures ready to manage white grubs and also manage CPB resistance. The synergistic combination of beetle-active Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) with BtBooster would increase the control efficacy of Bts for pest beetles leading to wider user acceptance of biological pesticide. InsectiGen, Inc. has developed biological technologies that control these insects. Our products may enhance the performance of the leading biocontrol strategies. Specifically, BtBooster will serve as an additive for current and future Bt products. BtBooster may reduce the amount of Bt needed to kill larvae or may extend the activity of Bt products, by prolonging pesticidal activity via enhancing the residual activity of Bt."

Prior to soybean aphid introduction in 2000, soybean was a crop that was rarely treated with insecticide, effectively making this crop a key untreated ecosystem in the landscape. This has now changed and it is not uncommon to have more than 50% of the soybean crop treated with one or more insecticide applications to control soybean aphid and to prevent devastating losses. Aphids in general and specifically soybean aphid are vectors of plant viruses. Virus can reduce yield, affect quality of the harvested fruit or tubers, and there is little that can be done to prevent viral epidemics. We have specifically focused on transmission of Potato Virus Y, a viral pathogen of potato and other crops that is readily transmitted by soybean aphid. One non-chemical approach to soybean aphid control is to allow natural enemies to control aphid outbreaks. We are focusing our efforts on understanding what situations favors control by natural enemies and what situations will natural enemies be overwhelmed. The best way to preserve natural enemies is to provide producers with reliable data on yield loss attributed to aphids and provide answers to questions like:  How many aphids are too many aphids? ,  Can predators, parasites and pathogens of aphids reliably control an aphid outbreak? ,  Are there safer alternatives when choosing an insecticide to use to control soybean aphid? ,  Will there be resistant soybean varieties that I can use available in the future? , and  If I plant a resistant soybean variety will aphids that can use this resistant variety develop?

Under the Food Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, support price for virginia-type peanut declined from $610 to $353 per ton. Further reductions are likely under the terms of GATT and NAFTA. With lower price, growers who formerly relied heavily on applications of chemicals for control of diseases and pests have been forced to reconsider these practices. To maintain profitability, the cost of peanut production must be reduced. Diseases and arthropod pests in NC are estimated to reduce yields by about one third in spite of the application of pesticides costing approximately $120 per hectare or 24% of the grower's direct cost of production. Important fungal diseases of peanuts include Cylindrocladium black rot or  CBR,  leafspots, southern stem rot, and Sclerotinia blight. Aflatoxin produced by Aspergillus species has been found in peanuts particularly after long periods of storage under suboptimal conditions. Nematodes occasionally cause stunting or wilting of peanuts in NC and may increase susceptibility to CBR or other soil-borne pathogens. Southern corn rootworm or  SCR  is the most important insect pest. Potato leafhopper, lesser cornstalk borer, and spider mitesmay cause serious damage in dry seasons. Corn earworm and fall armywormmay cause yield reductions due to foliar feeding late in the season. Tobacco thrips cause stunting of seedlings and are a vector for tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). Peanut producers need to improve their efficiency while reducing their use of pesticides. Reduction of pesticide use would have the additional benefit of reducing environmental degradation and pesticide residues in foods. One means achieving this goal is to grow high-yielding pest-resistant cultivars. Early-maturing cultivars would reduce the risk of damage to the crop in seasons that are unusually wet or cold during the customary harvest period. Early cultivars would allow growers to spread harvest operations over a longer period of time. While earliness is desirable, yield, pod and seed attributes, shelf life, processing quality, and flavor of the virginia type must be maintained or improved. Peanuts contain over 50% oil on a dry weight basis. Consumers enjoy peanuts' unique flavor but may be averse to consumption of high fat foods. Reduced oil content may be a reasonable breeding objective. Conversely, the steady rise in prices of petroleum products has sparked interest in biofuels including vegetable oil for biodiesel production. Because of their high oil content, peanuts may be a candidate crop for this niche market. The occurrence of severe allergic reactions to peanuts and peanut storage proteins continues to be a concern. Effective utilization of the available germplasm in the development of peanut cultivars and breeding lines requires the use of efficient methods of selecting parents for crosses and of evaluating the segregating progenies after hybridization."

Michigan ranks in the top 10 nationally for nine vegetable crops in spite of the fact that we are limited to summer production only. These rankings include 1st in pickling cucumber and squash production; 2nd in celery production; 3rd in asparagus and snap beans; 4th in processing carrot and fresh market cucumber production; sixth for pumpkins; and 9th for potatoes. Commercial vegetable production in Michigan, including potatoes, is valued at >$350 million/yr. Along with our diversity of vegetable crops comes equally diverse vegetable insect pests, pest/crop situations, pesticide registrations, and pest management systems. Control of insect pests is particularly critical on vegetable crops where appearance is a major consideration and crop value and risk of loss are high. For example, in 2000, average gross value of celery harvested in Michigan was $6,800/A, peppers were valued at $8,600/A, onions were valued at $2,300/A, cabbage was valued at $4,800/A, and potatoes were valued at $2,940/A. Insecticide use in vegetables is primarily aimed at preventing cosmetic injury or contamination and is often much higher than would be required to protect from yield loss. However, unlimited use of pesticides is no longer a practical or desirable alternative for pest control. Costs of pesticides continue to rise (the result of increased costs of petroleum products and increased research and development costs) and the regulation of pesticides under the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act continues to become more restrictive in response to increased concern for public health and safety and increased knowledge about the effects of pesticides on non-target systems. In addition, insecticide resistance problems are severely limiting the effectiveness of insecticides for control of insect pests in Michigan vegetables. To avoid severe economic losses and serious conflict between agricultural, environmental, and public health needs in the future, we must identify cultural and biological controls that can be integrated with or substitute for chemical controls to manage insect pest problems in Michigan vegetables. The benefits derived from such research will include: 1) Increased efficiency and effectiveness of pest control, 2) Decreased costs and numbers of pesticide applications, 3) Increased safety for agricultural workers, 4) Decreased potential risk to consumers and the environment, and 5) Increased sustainability and stability of pest/crop systems. EXPECTED OUTCOMES/BENEFITS AND ANTICIPATED BENEFITS Outcomes of this research will be directly applicable to the efficient and economical production of vegetables in Michigan. Expected benefits are reduced control costs and losses to insect pests and reduced need for insecticide applications to control pests."

The semi-arid irrigated conditions where a majority of potatoes are grown is ideal for supporting high populations of plant parasitic nematodes like the Columbia root knot nematode, Meloidogyne chitwoodi, which can complete 5 - 7 life cycles per growing season, leading to high potato infestations. Recently, this nematode species also causes exportation concerns as several shipments of potatoes to Mexico and Korea have been rejected and returned to Washington due to the presence of the nematode on the tubers. In potatoes alone, the estimated annual cost for controlling nematodes in Washingtonwith synthetic nematicides exceeds $20 million. Further threat to Washington potatoes comes from the quarantined golden potato cyst nematode (PCN) which was found recently in seed potato lots in Alberta. This same area of Alberta has been a source of potato seeds for Washington growers in excess of 15 years and is a direct threat to our industry. Due to public concern of the environmental risks of synthetic nematicides, several compounds have been withdrawn from the market, resulting in limited options for growers to use. We have demonstrated that the naturally produced biofumigants of the fungal endophyte, Muscodor albus, are able to control four species of plant parasitic nematodes resulting in the protection of several vegetable crops including potatoes. In addition, the biofumigant potential of various new varieties of Brassica crops on plant parasitic nematodes was investigated under field conditions. The nematicidal ability of Brassica crops protected potatoes against low densities of plant parasitic nematodes. Green manures are also used as part of the PCN eradication program. New Brassica crops, meals and organisms that produce naturally derived nematicides are constantly tested in our laboratory. We have also demonstrated that using double fumigation i.e., bio-fumigants from incorporation of green manure crops, followed by a synthetic fumigant application, we can protect potato tubers against root knot nematodes. This program was developed to minimize the environmental impact of standard fumigation practices based on the application of two synthetic pesticides, and to provide growers with control methods that can ensure high quality of exported potatoes. Greenhouse, and field trials were performed to develop the above sustainable nematode control methods. Expected outcomes/impacts from this project will be the implementation of new nematode management tactics that lead to reduction of synthetic pesticide usage, are environmentally friendly, and therefore benefit human health. In addition, the new nematode control strategies promote healthier food and sustainability, thus leading to economic benefits for the producers and the consumers. The new nematode control strategies provide us with efficient means to respond to invasive species, and deal effectively with trade product contamination issues. The benefits from this project are reduction in synthetic pesticide use, and protection of Washington agriculture against invasive nematode species."

In addition to yield losses resulting directly from tissue destruction, these pests play a significant role in transmitting pathogens that cause a variety of plant diseases. Nowhere better are these problems echoed than in the state of Michigan, where pests such as the Colorado potato beetle can cause millions of dollars in crop losses in a single year. Despite the effectiveness of chemical pesticides in controlling herbivore populations, it is widely recognized that many of these compounds adversely affect the environment, food safety, and human health. These considerations justify the need develop alternative pest management strategies that reduce the nation's reliance on environmentally persistent chemicals. One way to achieve this goal is to make greater use of  built-in  plant defense systems that are known to provide durable resistance to a broad spectrum of arthropod pests. For example, physical barriers (e.g., trichomes and cuticular waxes) effectively inhibit feeding by many arthropod herbivores. Other defense traits involve toxins that perturb the insect's growth, or volatile compounds that attract natural predators of the pest. Recent studies indicate that the plant hormone jasmonate (JA) plays a central role in regulating the wound-induced expression of defensive processes that confer durable host resistance. This form of induced resistance has been documented in well over 100 plant species throughout the plant kingdom. The widespread occurrence of induced defenses, together with their effectiveness of thwarting insect attacks, suggests potential applications for improving plant resistance to insect pests. Our research is broadly aimed at identifying genes that play an important role in JA-mediated plant anti-insect defense. Results obtained from this work may find application in the development of environmentally sound strategies for crop protection that benefit agricultural productivity in Michigan and elsewhere."

Monetary losses due to soilborne diseases in the U.S. are estimated to exceed $4 billion per year, and losses due to parasitic nematodes exceed $100 billion per year world wide. The cost of soilborne plant pathogens to society and the environment far exceeds the direct costs to growers and consumers. The use of chemical pesticides to control soilborne pathogens has caused significant changes in air and water quality, altered natural ecosystems resulting in direct and indirect affects on wildlife, and caused human health problems. For example, methyl bromide, a fumigant used to control soilborne diseases, has become notorious in recent years for contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer. Consumers are demanding plentiful low cost but safe food while simultaneously requiring the use of fewer chemical controls. From 2000 to 2005, the number of organic acres in the U.S. increased 128%, to around 4 million acres. Organically-grown crops require non-synthetic methods for management of diseases, and organic growers are seeking scientifically-based disease management methods. The recent spike in food prices due to increased demand and decreased supply further necessitate the development of sustainable methods of disease management. This project directly addresses these problems in a multistate, multidisciplinary approach. The promise, public acceptance and environmental benefits of non-chemical management of root diseases continue to make research on this area both timely and of critical importance to the future of U.S. and world agriculture."

A large percentage of the eucaryotic viruses are plus-strand RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of host cells, and many of these cause diseases that are of medical and agricultural significance. In fact, plus-strand RNA viruses constitute the largest category of plant viruses and consequently have substantial agronomic impact. Despite their importance, only a few animal and plant viruses have been studied in terms of replication and very little is known about the mechanisms involved. Potato virus X (PVX) is an excellent model system for understanding RNA replication. This virus contains only one genomic RNA that is functionally monocistronic. The viral replicase, P1, is translated directly from this RNA and does not require cleavage, readthrough or frameshifting for expression. P1 is the only viral protein required for RNA synthesis and, by homology to other viral and cellular proteins, may also function as a helicase and RNA capping enzyme. PVX is useful for both biochemical and genetic studies because the virus replicates to high levels in tobacco plants and protoplasts, and infectious transcripts generated from a PVX cDNA clone are available for mutational analysis. In addition, our laboratory has developed a protoplast replication system for in vivo analyses of PVX RNA accumulation, as well as an RdRp preparation from infected tobacco that can be used to study the mechanisms of RNA synthesis in vitro. Thus, the PVX system can be used to define the components, reactions and structures that mediate replication of an RNA genome and, ultimately, this system can be utilized to understand the virus/host interactions necessary for RNA replication and disease development. Our data indicate that regulatory sequences, structures and complementarity between terminal sequences and internal conserved elements are necessary for plus- and minus-strand RNA accumulation, and suggest that both long-distance RNA-RNA interactions and sequence recognition by components of the replication complex are required. Viral and/or host proteins may modulate this process by stabilizing or destabilizing potential RNA-RNA, RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Experiments proposed herein will further define the cis- and trans-acting functions, interactions, and mechanisms that regulate PVX RNA synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Our hypothesis is that during infection, there are preferred genomic RNA configurations that may then facilitate translation initiation and subsequent transcription. Such configurations may arise either during or after the process of disassembly, prior to translation, or during translation to position the newly translated replicase near the viral RNA termini for efficient transcription. Alternatively, optimal configurations for transcription may form upon binding of the replication machinery. Given the multiple interaction possibilities, the configuration of the viral RNA and associated viral and host proteins will dynamically reflect different aspects of the replication process."

We are also trying to determine if the flavor and mouth feel of the grape during ripening can predict the flavor and mouth feel of the resultant wine. Additionally, can winemakers consistently use their sensory evaluation of the ripening grapes to predict the resultant wine quality Wines are produced to be consumed with foods, yet there are very few studies exploring the effects of food on wine and of wine of food. We propose to look at two such combinations L port wine & chocolate and a full meal (meat, potato and vegetable) and wine (probably a red wine). Additionally, the context of wine consumption seems to affect the consumer's liking response to that wine - we hope to explore this using laboratory settings. If solution osmolality predicts perceived wine mouth feel, then this measurement - which is much easier to do than physical viscosity - would have widespread application in the wine Industry. Additionally, exploring the effect of large sized molecules on wine mouth feel has global implications in terms of perceived wine quality. Raisins made by dried on the vine (DOV) are cheaper to produce than those that were tray dried If we can show that consumers prefer DOV over tray dried (or at least like them equally) then this would have large implications for California raisin producers."

Therefore, cultural management guidelines that maximize the production and quality of individual potato cultivars must be developed. The best guidelines for nutrient fertility practices, irrigation management, plant population management, vine kill management for maximum tuber skin set, and other management practices are obtained from field experiments conducted in replicated trials. New cultivars are much more successful when release is accompanied by cultivar specific management guidelines. This information relates growth habit and other plant characteristics to nutrient and other plant management strategies for yield and quality goals, which are agronomically sound, economically advantageous, and environmentally responsible. Some cultivar traits such as tuber dormancy can be modified through seed management to the advantage of the grower of a cultivar. When management guidelines are tailored to individual cultivars, it leads to the successful, sustainable, and economic production of the cultivars, which result in the optimization of their genetic potential, while minimizing economic inputs and environmental impact. In this project, the management profile of each potato cultivar will be summarized in a user friendly language and distributed as fact sheets to the potato industry. Studies will be conducted to develop optimum N application rate, in-season N application timing, pre-plant N application rate, and pre-plant placement of fertilizers. In-season Nitrogen Application Timing studies will be conducted to evaluate the effect of early, mid, and late application of in-season N on tuber yield, tuber size distribution, quality, and tuber skin set. Pre-plant N rate treatments will be studied. Fertilizer Placement and Nutrient Use Efficiency will be studied. The response of tuber yield, tuber size distribution, and tuber quality to in-row seed spacing will be studied. Vine kill timing treatments will include killing potato vines at 90, 100, 110, and 120 days after planting. A study will be conducted to aim at establishing the minimum amount of irrigation water needed for the optimum production of individual potato cultivars. Different seed management practices will be developed to modify the genetic traits of individual cultivars that are difficult to grow. On-farm evaluation of advanced potato selections from the Colorado State University potato breeding program will be continued to evaluate yield, yield stability, and tuber quality of the new clones. Results obtained from this study will be summarized as fact sheets for the potato industry. Workshops will be conducted to make growers aware of the best management guidelines. Results will be presented at potato meetings to growers and consultants. To evaluate the success of this project, surveys will be sent out to determine how many growers are using recommended management practices. Yield and quality of potato tubers will be assessed throughout Colorado by conducting meetings with growers."

They are considered quarantine pests by most countries and potatoes for export or seed cannot be grown in or near fields where PCN has been found. Currently, in the western US any field in which PCN is found is not allowed to grow potatoes. Recently, a new species of Globodera was found which closely resembles PCN but is not G. pallida or G. rostochiensis. It is important to learn more about this nematode so that if it is found in surveys of potato fields it is not mistaken for PCN and cause unnecessary quarantine of fields. Columbia root-knot nematode, CRKN (Meloidogyne chitwoodi) is a serious pathogen of potato in much of the western US and infects tubers to produce quality defects that can cause entire crops to be rejected. CRKN is considered a quarantined pest by many countries and no shipments with even a single CRKN infested tuber are allowed entry. Tobacco rattle virus is vectored into potato by stubby-root nematodes and causes corky ringspot disease which also produces quality defects that can cause crop rejection. During this project, effects of environment, rotation crops and cover crops on suppression of nematode damage will be examined to improve management options that require less pesticide use and increase profitability. Strategies that are adequate for commercial potato sales where some level of nematode damage is permissible will be delineated from strategies necessary to obtain nematode-free standards required for seed or export."

In soil bacteria the metabolism of proline by PutA is critical for root growth of major legume crops such as soybeans. In plants proline is important for adaptation to stress such as drought, heat, and high salt. Proline also stimulates the synthesis of phenolic phytochemicals in plants that have therapeutic applications. In insects, proline is stored in flight muscles and is a primary fuel used during flight. Deeper molecular understanding of PutA will help us develop inhibitors of proline metabolism in insects such as the Colorado potato beetle and Japanese beetle. Thus, results from our work will benefit future studies on proline metabolic processes in soil bacteria, plants, and insects."

While genetic variation is often observed in those crops, breeding to improve this trait is complicated because its genetic basis remains poorly understood. It would be difficult to analyze this process directly in the root crops because the genetic tools that are needed for such studies have not been developed in these plants. Therefore, there is considerable interest in using a model plant system such as the mouse-ear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) to investigate some of the molecular mechanisms that govern root shape. When known, this information can be translated into temperate root crops such as carrot and beet, and tropical crops such as cassava, arracacha and sweet potato, by isolating the corresponding genes in these species and testing their potential role in modulating root shape in the corresponding crop. We recently showed that roots of the mouse-ear cress do spiral when forced to grow on a tilted hard-agar surface. Considering the large array of tools available for molecular genetic studies in this plant, we adopted this system to uncover some of the molecular mechanisms that govern root spiraling. This project is aimed at untilizing the natural genetic variation that exists between Arabidopsis strains to identify and characterize genes that contribute to the control of spiral root growth. These data will then be used to identify the corresponding carrot genes and test their involvement in conditioning important agricultural traits such as carrot splitting and twisting. Initial studies of the molecular mechanisms that modulate spiral root growth in the mouse-ear cress have led to a better understanding of the processes that control the synthesis and composition of plant cell walls, which constitute an important fraction of the material that can be fermented into biofuels. We have all reasons to believe that further investigations will continue shedding light on this important aspect of plant growth and development. Our lack of knowledge in this area of plant biochemistry and cell biology is recognized as a critical factor that limits our ability to generate crops that are optimized for biofuel production, a recognized top priority for the upcoming decades. It is anticipated that our work will, in the long run, also have important applications in this new area of agriculture."

The majority of these efforts include the common overall goal of reducing weed competition by adding energy or inputs to the production system, such as increased cultivation. Selecting and planting a crop cultivar that suppresses weeds and/or tolerates weed interference could achieve the same goals without significant additional energy or economic input. The proposed research will evaluate the competitive ability of potato cultivars introduced over the last 150 years and develop and implement cultivar-specific weed management programs with the overall goal of reducing herbicide use. The ability to tolerate or suppress weeds will be incorporated into a cultivar competitiveness ranking system that will be extended to growers. The cultivar-specific weed management systems will allow growers to control weeds based on timely strategies relative to crop growth characteristics instead of prescriptive treatments. Successful cultivar-specific weed management programs will be demonstrated in commercial potato production. The integration and implementation of these low-input strategies can reduce the reliance on herbicides for the majority of weed control."

In fact, drought affects more people than any other natural hazard (Wilhite, 2000). According to the National Drought Mitigation Center, loss in agriculture in the United States due to drought was estimated to be approximately $11 billion in 2002 (Hayes et al., 2004). There is increasing demand for potato, the fourth most important world crop, to ensure food security and to contribute to sustainable livelihoods in the coming decades. Many of the world&#39;s poorest, most food-insecure households will increasingly depend on this crop for subsistence and income generation. Potato is highly susceptible to drought stress and extracts less of the available water from the soil in comparison with other crops (Weisz et al., 1994). Withholding water reduces leaf number, leaf size, shoot height, and the rate of photosynthesis (Basu et al., 1999; Deblonde and Ledent, 2001). Dalla Costa et al. (1997) showed that limiting water supply to plants in lysimeters significantly reduced the photosynthetic rate of potato plants, which was reflected in lower tuber yields and biomass. The relative inability of potato to withstand drought limits its productive range to areas with adequate rainfall or suitable irrigation and means that it has a high and costly water requirement for maximal yield. A better understanding of the effects of drought on plants, especially the integration of drought-responsive events from the molecular and cellular to the whole-plant level, is vital to prepare for the genetic engineering of varieties with improved drought tolerance. With the genomics and bioinformatics resources that are currently available for plant species, especially the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and, increasingly, crop species such as potato, it is now possible to investigate the regulatory mechanisms that underlie relative drought tolerances among closely related genotypes. Although individual components of stress response systems have been studied under water-deficiency, the overall  network logic  of pathways that are operational in drought tolerant plants remains still largely unknown. To further understand drought systems biology, the nature of regulatory control over pathways and networks must be elucidated, and other kinds of data, such as metabolomics and physiological data, and current findings from the literature, incorporated into the system."

Growers in New York associate decreasing crop yields in previously productive fields with reductions in soil quality. Reduced tillage (RT) systems (e.g. no, zone, strip, or ridge till) represent strategies to reduce soil degradation and erosion, protect water quality and improve farm fuel efficiency and profitability. Our goal is to increase use of RT systems in the cooler climates of New York and the upper Northeast, by demonstrating that these systems can improve soil and environmental quality, maintain yields, and reduce costs on vegetable farms. The benefits of adopting these practices will accrue to the growers as well as society at large, by protecting the productivity of soils and water quality. In the last three years, we have seen increased interest in RT. This FFF funding will allow us to focus on adapting RT systems for root, small seeded and transplanted vegetables on organic and conventional farms. These types of crops, such as beets, carrots, greens, onions, and potatoes, are much more difficult to produce in a RT system. We will examine challenges such as 1) creating suitable planting conditions for these crops, 2) planning rotations, 3) choosing cover crops to enhance soil quality and not interfere with production; 4) overcoming crop delays, 5) controlling weeds chemically and mechanically, 6) economics, and 7) designing RT equipment for small farms. On-station experiments will compare differences in crop yields, pest pressure and mechanical or chemical weed control strategies in different tillage systems. We will modify the width and depth of RT systems and design equipment to improve soil drainage, soil warming, and crop establishment. In organic systems research, we will examine strategies to rotate into RT systems to optimize the overall reduction in tillage intensity over several years and compare the efficiency of permanent beds with other RT systems. These are very novel approaches for organic systems, since these are often very dependent on tillage for weed management. Data collected will highlight differences in crop yields and quality and soil quality. On-farm trials will address site specific and other challenges of grower interest. Extension field days and workshops will share results and demonstrate RT systems in action, increasing grower knowledge and recruiting new farmer collaborators for on-farm research. Farmer discussion groups will also help both organic and conventional growers transition to RT. Case studies, to be published in paper and web formats, will summarize successes and failures of growers implementing RT systems for vegetables. We will record methods, motivations, adaptation and innovations, and the economics of implementation of RT systems on these farms. The combination of these activities will provide needed research data, demonstration and publications to help NY and Northeast vegetable growers evaluate when and where RT systems can mitigate soil degradation and enhance crop yields."

Information gained on potato cropping systems in Maine can be extended to much of the potato industry of the eastern and northern regions of the U.S. and Canada. One drawback of conventional potato production systems is their heavy reliance on purchased inputs of synthetic fertilizers, fuels, and pesticides. As concerns have mounted regarding the impacts of agricultural practices on the environment, especially water quality and greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural researchers are being asked to take a more holistic perspective. Research objectives are no longer a matter of maximizing yields or minimizing costs, but instead focus on prevention of environmental degradation while maintaining reasonable profitability.

However, it is becoming apparent that specific components of various foods can further promote or inhibit absorption of certain vitamins and minerals, and that the vitamins, minerals and extracts of specific foods can have huge impacts on the incidence, severity, and complications resulting from many chronic diseases. Vitamin and mineral supplements are a growing industry. Many foods are being fortified to replace vitamins lost during processing, or to increase the perceived value of the product. There is a pressing need to increase our understanding of the biological functions of vitamin, mineral and nutraceutical food components. In some cases consumers may benefit by increasing intake of these foods with reduced risk of certain chronic diseases. In other cases more research would prevent foods or food supplements from being marketed based on inaccurate claims for the ingredients they contain. Finally, it is important to find new ways to educate various consumer groups about nutrition and foods in ways that will convince them to modify their behavior toward more healthy eating habits. An emphasis of this project will be on evaluating and improving nutritional quality of foods, improving nutrient availability, and reducing the risk or symptoms of chronic diseases associated with poor diets. This project will involve collaborative research in several areas with the common goals of enhancing nutritional qualities of foods, understanding biological effects of food components, and educating various consumer groups to improve the nutritional quality of their diets. Specific objectives are: a. Investigate techniques for optimal vitamin and mineral fortification of foods and supplementation of diets to reduce the risk of diabetes, obesity, and other chronic diseases.

These results used to be published annually in an Experiment Station Circular, but electronic media outlet is now needed (the Dean does not pay for printed publications anymore). In addition to the annual summaries, growers, seed industry personnel and others in the vegetable industry have access to results of the vegetable variety evaluations through various publications; examples of which follow: tomatoes, onions and collards (Momol and Olson, 2002), cantaloupes (Maynard and Dunlap, 2000a), pumpkins (Hochmuth et al., 2000), watermelons (Maynard and Dunlap, 2000b), peppers (Shuler et al., 2001) and potatoes (Hutchinson et al, 2001). Vegetable variety evaluation in Florida is an essential part of the crop production scheme. Improved varieties must be identified before they can be incorporated into commercial production. One notable example was release of `Solar Set', the first commercial  hot set  variety, (University of Florida release) in 1989 (Scott et al., 1989). An improvement to `Solar Set',  Equinox' was released in 1995 (Scott et al., 1995) but never reached the popularity of `Solar Set'. Another example is release of `Neptune' in 1995 (Scott et al., 1995). This brought the first heat tolerant variety on the market with a high level of bacterial wilt resistance. Cooperative statewide tomato, pepper, cantaloupe, and watermelon variety evaluations have been conducted in the major production areas of Florida. Standard varieties along with new varieties and advanced experimental lines have been evaluated for production potential in each production area. These multi-location trials provide information as to a variety's adaptability across locations (Beany et al., 1997 and Chandler et al., 1995). Numerous other examples of the direct benefits of variety evaluation to Florida growers over the years could be cited. In the future, variety evaluation will continue to be important to growers to insure the rapid introduction of high yielding, superior quality and pest tolerant varieties. The seed industry is aided by identification of experimental lines of theirs or potential releases from University of Florida that perform well in a production area."

Since Pennsylvania has the largest number of potato chip companies both large and small and the fact that several of the companies have ventured into marketing colored potato chips, the further development of the use of colored potatoes in the chipping industry is important to both the growers and the processors. New production and marketing strategies for colored potato chips need to be further refined and cannot rely on traditional methods of production and marketing. New Previous research has documented that this technology has provided for e-marketing strategies such as viral (web-based) marketing need to be investigated and evaluated. The question is what do we need to do to be competitive in today's potato chip marketplace. This is a complex question because it involves not only production but also marketing. Both will have to be addressed if we are indeed to be competitive in marketing specialty potato chips. On the production side we need to continue to incorporate some of the intensive production technology (plastic mulch, drip irrigation, fertigation, fumigation, use of high tunnels, and row covers), which are currently being used by small acreage potato producers in Pennsylvania. We need to optimize the growing conditions and maximize yields for these colored potato varieties. The use of intensive production technology has permitted some Pennsylvania potato growers to plant earlier, begin to harvest earlier, grow a more defect- and blemish-free crop, and increase yields; all of which will allow them to be more competitive in the marketplace of the future. It may be that colored potato chips will only be marketed certain times of the year due to the storage characteristics of the currently available varieties. Close communication with the leading potato breeders of colored potatoes will be important to the success of the colored potato chip market. The potential impact of this research could increase the use of colored potato chips via the new marketing avenues being evaluated, which in turn would increase the demand for the raw product and mean increased economic return for potato growers growing for this developing market."

Due to relatively high levels of plant disease pressure, pest problems, and high fertility requirements, conventional agricultural production routinely uses high inputs of agricultural chemicals. In contrast, sustainable farming practices involve the principles of improving soil quality, increasing soil biodiversity, and enhancing natural disease and pest suppression. Although sustainable production provides major improvements over conventional agriculture regarding soil and crop management practices, there are still many limitations to sustainability, crop productivity, and farm profitability that need addressing. In the work proposed here, three primary tools of sustainable management, biological control, other biological amendments, the use of organic matter amendments, and effective crop rotations, will be customized, managed, and combined to provide improved control of soil-borne diseases and increased crop yield in sustainable crop production systems in Maine. UMaine and Maine Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station have a long tradition in potato research and sustainable approaches to crop production.

Some of the impacts/outcomes of this project are: a) Maine growers will have the opportunity to assess the value (cost/benefit) of different amendments (organic matter, biocontrol agents, mutualistic organisms) that are thought to offer major advantages in disease management and increased crop production; b) More conventional farmers will adopt sustainable approaches to crop production; c) More organic growers will use biocontrol and mutualistic microorganisms to improve disease management, enhance crop yields, and increase soil fertility. d) Relative abundance of healthier, locally grown, food for consumers; e) Higher incomes, through higher product value, for Maine growers; f) Reduced rate of environmental pollution through a decreased use of synthetic agrichemicals."

Pests and diseases are among the main limiting factors. In the case of taro, corm weight losses due to root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne javanica) could reach 90% and those due to Phytophthora colocasiae (pathogen that causes Taro Leaf Blight, TLB), Pythium sp., or other fungal pathogens could average 25-36%. On Molokai, yam farmers have experienced crop losses to reniform nematodes (Rotylenchulus renformis). First, this project will seek to control parasitic nematodes through non-host green manure crops, such as sorghum x sudangrass hybrids (Sorghum + drummondii ?Sordan 79? or ?Graze-all MST?), marigolds (Tagetes patula) or sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea). Second, conventional breeding of taro to increase resistance to TLB will be conducted through back-crossing of promising TLB-resistant hybrids to the parental ?Maui Lehua? or other cultivars. We will identify genetic markers in the taro genome to accelerate the conventional breeding of TLB resistant hybrids. Third, this project will evaluate sweet potato cultivars as a food and potential biofuel crop for the Hamakua Coast of Hawaii. Finally, we will evaluate yam cultivars (in two yam species) as a potential food crop for the island of Molokai and we will seek funding to evaluate these yam cultivars along the Hamakua Coast of Hawaii island."

Hence most potato varieties currently in use were released decades ago and the benefits of improved varieties that have been enjoyed in most other crops still remain to be seen in potato. The work described in this proposal is a genetic deconstruction of potato to a minimalist organism, a monoploid with only 12 chromosomes compared to 48 for commercial potato. In this minimalist condition, traits that may otherwise be too complex to understand may be more accessible. Flesh color is one such trait. Since vegetables high in yellow pigments have been demonstrated to impart better nutrition, this is a trait that deserves more attention in order to release new varieties with enhanced pigmentation. Our methods of breeding potato with reduced chromosomes will enhance our understanding of the more complex tetraploids that can be reconstructed from minimalist components, hopefully into an improved product."

This worsened situation persists to the present time because it was caused by the introduction of strains from Mexico to different locations around the world including the USA (Fry and Goodwin 1997). One approach to achieve better disease suppression and to enable more efficient use of fungicide (less fungicide without attendant increase in disease severity) is to use potato cultivars that are resistant to P. infestans. The potential benefits of using resistant cultivars have long been known, but there is a dearth of high quality resistant cultivars. A major problem has been that, for potato, the easiest resistances to manipulate [single gene (R gene)] have had only ephemeral effects. In fact, R genes have not been demonstrated to contribute to resistance in any popular commercial potato cultivar. However, there is a resistance that has been identified from analysis of crop plants in the field non-R gene resistance (termed  polygenic ,  field ,  horizontal , or  partial ) which has a smaller effect than that of a traditional R gene. Because it has typically been demonstrated to be polygenic, it has been expected to be stable. This resistance is identified by analyzing segregating populations to locate loci contributing to the resistance (each a Quantitative Trait Locus - a QTL) for resistance. These QTLs would then be used in breeding programs. However, it is not yet known if the resistance from QTLs is qualitatively different than the resistance from R genes or from basal defense. This project will investigate whether or not QTLs for resistance represent a type of resistance that is different from R gene resistance - using a model system. The results will guide our efforts to develop potatoes resistant to late blight. We will employ two approaches. The first will depend on genomic analysis. We will identify QTLs for resistance in the model system (using Arabidopsis thaliana and the pathogen that causes downy mildew), and then analyze the genes in the QTL to determine if they contain typical R genes. Second, we will compare gene expression in QTL resistance with gene expression in QTL resistance. If these differ, we will have evidence that QTL resistance is materially different from R gene resistance, and we will have evidence that it will be useful to incorporate such resistance into potatoes."

In addition, the aim of the project is to breed for high tuber calcium and release cultivars that have the ability to aquire and transport higher calcium into the tuber. Many studies, including our own, have provided evidence that tuber internal quality, as well as storage quality, can be improved by increasing calcium concentration in the tuber. In addition, tuber bruising can be reduced by increasing tuber calcium. Tuber bruising and tuber internal quality (hollow heart, brown center, internal brown spot) are of major concern to the potato processing industry.

In Texas, bacterial diseases seriously decrease production of several fruit, vegetable and field crops. Examples of major bacterial diseases include Pierce's disease of grapevine, bacterial blight of cotton, and a possible bacterial etiology associated with Zebra Chip of potato. This project is focused on Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, an aggressive colonizer of plant surfaces, as a model system to explore the influence of environmental effects, microbial interactions, and various pathological features, including host specificity, on ecological success of a major bacterial pathogen. The prevalence and importance of diseases caused by P. s. pv. syringae and other bacteria attest to the lack of effective control procedures. An understanding of the physiological, biochemical, and genetic determinants involved in initiation and establishment of disease is critical for developing new approaches to disease control. P. s. pv. syringae B728a is a highly versatile pathogen that forms both acute infections of plants as well as long-term associations as bacterial aggregates that may be considered to embody  chronic  resident associations with plants. The molecular basis of how the bacterium switches from a resident epiphytic existence to an acute infectious agent is complex requiring the interaction of multiple virulence factors and associated secretion systems. In my laboratory, genetic studies of P. s. pv. syringae yielded important information about toxin production and its relationship to pathogenicity. For example, analysis of a 180 kb DNA region revealed that the syringomycin gene cluster lies adjacent to the syringopeptin gene cluster on the bacterial chromosome, and together they compose 2.2% of the genome to constitute a genomic island not found in the genomes of related pathovars. Consequently, we are now at a phase where the regulatory hierarchy can be described that controls expression of factors necessary for both acute and chronic associations of P. s. pv. syringae with plant hosts. The project will exploit the B728a genome sequence to (A) characterize what appears to be a new secretion system that was discovered only recently to occur in medically important bacteria, and (B) define major regulons that contribute to epiphytic fitness and pathogenicity. The project also includes studies aimed at detection and control of major plant pathogens of crops grown in Texas. These studies contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural competitiveness in a global market."

In addition, many biological control agents are non-native species which can have unintended impacts when released and this project focuses on a native predator. Although there is a local and national industry in providing biological control agents for agricultural pests, most of the information on the efficacy of these agents comes from research measuring their consumption rate. However, by only measuring  consumption , we are missing at least half of the effect of the predator on the prey and plant. By understanding how predators affect their prey, we can predict which predators and when predators will be effective and also manipulate the cropping system to maximize their effectiveness. For instance, we can direct research to forms of plant resistance that are more compatible with biological control. In particular, the predaceous stink bug I am proposing to work with has two fundamental benefits as a potentially realistic native predator to be used in biological control. First, its use has been previously proposed and studied in this context, and second, my own previous work demonstrates that the presence of this predator (in the absence of predation) can substantially reduce herbivory on tomato."

Much of the native flora is either threatened or endangered. There is concern that hybridization and gene flow between agricultural crops and native species may impact rare endemic species. Of particular concern is that gene flow may occur from agricultural crops that have been modified through biotechnological techniques. Genetically engineered agricultural crops play an important role in Hawai`i. Areas where these crops are grown are sympatric with some rare endemic Hawaiian plant species. It is essential that the potential hybridization between transgenic agricultural crops and native Hawaiian species be examined so management strategies are developed for situations posing high risk. This project will examine the potential for cross-pollination between sunflower and endemic Compositae; commercial and endemic cotton species; and potato and indigenous Solanum species in Hawaii. Previous examination of the flora has determined that these three crops pose the greatest risk for hybridization with native species. We will make hand-pollinations in the laboratory, and fitness of F1 and F2 hybrid progeny. Molecular markers, seed viability and back-crossing will be used to quantify outcrossing and fitness of hybrids. Legitimate and important agricultural growth could be threatened by the absence of an adequate understanding of potential gene flow, and the development and implementation of management protocols to prevent cross-pollination. The risk of gene flow to the species of concern may be negligible; however, this study will quantify this risk through a formal risk assessment using field and laboratory data. Determining the potential for gene flow from crops to native species will allow all stakeholders to minimize the risks, and thus contribute to the protection of Hawaii's agricultural potential and natural resources. This project will contribute to improved capabilities for assessing potential environmental impacts of transgenic crops on the local, national and international scale."

Nitrogen and phosphorus in dairy manure can be transported to waterways, posing serious health and environmental threats. The direct impact of dairy manure on phosphorus concentrations in streams has not been evaluated in Idaho. The Idaho DEQ has also documented an increase in nitrogen concentrations in groundwater wells located in Idaho watersheds containing large dairies. However, these same watersheds also receive substantial nitrogen inputs fertilizers, septic systems, and other non-point sources). The primary source(s) of nitrate pollution in these watersheds have not been identified. Potato growers are also concerned that they will not be able to predict when nitrogen in the manure will be converted from the plant unavailable organic form to plant available inoganic forms that can be used by the crop. The objectives of this research project are 1) to determine the effect of manure application timing prior to planting on plant available nitrogen concentrations in the soil during the cropping season, 2) to evaluate the effect of dairy manure applications to potatoes on plant available nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, petiole nitrate concentrations, tuber yield, and tuber quality, and 3) to quantify the impact of dairy manure applications on nitrate and dissolved phosphorus concentrations in runoff and leachate in first order streams. To meet the first objective, soils combined with dairy manures as well as soils from fields that received dairy manure applications several years prior will be kept at temperatures simulating both fall and spring temperatures, and frequently analyzed for plant available nitrogen concentations. From this research, we will be able to provide growers with estimates on nitrogen availability of dairy manure applied to soils at varying times prior to planting. This will lead to greater nitrogen use efficiency, which will improve yield production while reducing nitrate leaching. To meet the second objective, potatoes will be planted on soils that have received both recent and non-recent applications of dairy manure. Soils and potato plant tissue will be tested for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Potato tuber quality and quantity will also be determined. With the results from this study, potato growers will have the opportunity to reduce fertilizer costs and nitrate leaching losses by applying manures at times and rates that are most comparable to the potato growth patterns. To meet the third objective, water draining from crop fields that have and have not received manure applications will be tested for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Understanding how dairy manure applications impact nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in first-order streams will provide state government agencies an effective starting ground for determining how to reduce hazardous concentrations of phosphorus and/or nitrogen levels in streams."

What makes fermentation a unique form of processing is the adaptability of end product based on the quality of input materials. Thus, for fuel ethanol, the input could be poor quality, partly decomposed or waste. If the intent is to produce an ethanol feed-stock, higher input quality may be necessary, especially for production of a food product such as vinegar. In the case of acetification, ethanol meeting minimal food grade standards would be required but the input crop quality could be the lowest food-grade quality. Finally, the highest quality processing would be required for ethanol produced for direct consumption as a beverage. This product could be a simple fermented low alcoholic beverage or a distilled spirit but high purity would be demanded and input would most likely be food grade material such as off-grade sizes but not processing waste. Unlike typical starchy cereal crops, little research has been done on efficient fermentation of higher moisture starchy crops, such as sweetpotatoes. One of the principle issues for this type of crop is the transportation costs associated with moving the high water content from harvest field to processing facility. If the final product is a high value fermented beverage, the cost associated with transportation and processing can be accommodated. However, production of fuel ethanol is another matter and transport/processing costs may outweigh any potential energy yield. This problem could be somewhat offset by placing fuel fermentation/distillation apparatus at the farm site or at a broker facility or food plant where material has already been transported for other food uses. At these sites, any surplus, rejected loads, sorted culls or processing waste could be redirected to fermentation rather than to waste treatment or land disposal which incurs additional cost. Coincidently, in the case of sweetpotatoes, such complete utilization could reduce current issues of weevil over-wintering infestations caused by abandoned excess sweetpotato crops or land applied waste residue from packing sheds and canning plants which provide ideal environments for next year's problems. A typical sweetpotato variety, Beauregard, yields about 400bu/A roots for fresh market but also produces 150 bu/A of  canner grade , 200bu/A of  jumbo  and 80bu/A of  culls . Some of the canners and jumbos are harvested and supplied to food processors but much is discarded. In late summer, remaining stored material must be dumped prior to curing the new crop. Of the material supplied to food processing plants, a significant portion ends up as unusable waste which must be treated in some way. All of this waste material could be used for fermentation since flesh color, root size and symmetry are not important for material that will be pulverized. Even less than perfect harvests from wet fields could be utilized which ordinarily represents a complete loss."

Furthermore, prevention of below ground damage is especially problematic for the development of organic production systems which will require the development of specialized insect management methods. Experiments will be conducted to improve insect pest management systems for sweet potato growers by evaluating insect sampling techniques used to quantify insect pest populations in sweet potato and develop sequential sampling plans, by determining the damage threshold for the banded and spotted cucumber beetles in sweet potatoes, evaluating the efficacy of pre-plant and lay-by soil incorporated insecticides, developing sweet potato breeding lines with resistance to the sweet potato weevil, and by evaluating the effect of plastic mulch on insect populations in an organic sweet potato cropping system. Vegetable crop research will include an evaluation of insecticides for control of key insect pests, development of sampling methodology for the yellow margined leaf beetle on mustard, and an evaluation of the impact of sustainable growing practices on insect pests of selected vegetable crops. Improved insect pest management systems for sweet potato growers will increase the profitability of growers by reducing both the losses due to insect damage and the cost of inputs through a more efficient use of insecticides to manage the key insect pests. Development of sweet potato breeding lines with resistance to the sweet potato weevil could ultimately reduce the cost of managing this pest.

The development of cutivars resistant to these diseases will be a significant step in long term disesae management and the adoption and use of genetically resistant cultivars by the potato industry will contribute to their long term economic viability. A number of bacterial and viral diseases are transmitted primarily through seed and have had significant economic importance to the seed potato and commercial potato industry in recent years. The development of new technologies to improve detection of the pathogens that cause these diseases will reduce the incidence with which they occur. The adoption of new laboratory detection methodologies will assist producers in mitigating the high degree of risk associated with the production of this commodity.

The sting nematode (Belonolaimus longicaudatus)is a very damaging pathogen of cole crops, strawberry, soybean, cotton, field corn, sorghum, sesbania, turf grasses, and many other grasses including digitgrass, Bermudagrass, and limpograss. Other important nematodes with wide host ranges include stubby root (Paratrichodorus and Trichodorus spp.), lesion (Pratylenchus spp.), lance (Hoplolaimus spp.), awl (Dolichodorus spp.), and ring (Criconemella spp.). In cotton, the reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis) has become a widespread problem in Florida. Estimated statewide losses from nematodes include: vegetables (strawberry, snap bean, sweet corn) 10%; soybean 9%; sugarcane 4%; potato 10%; field corn 15%; peanut 15%; tobacco 4%; and cotton 7%. In local situations, nematode damage can be completely devastating in individual grower plantings of many crops, e. g., squash, cucumber, eggplant, pepper, strawberry, okra, and peanut. Crop losses from nematodes are further compounded by nematode and soilborne disease complexes such as Verticillium wilt, Fusarium wilt, and bacterial wilt. It must be emphasized that losses on most agricultural crops would be many-fold higher if it were not for nematode management programs already in existence. For example, nearly 100% of tomato, pepper, eggplant, melon and strawberry plantings are treated annually with multipurpose-soil fumigants. Almost all soybean cultivars grown in Florida are root-knot and cyst nematode resistant. Production costs for most agricultural crops are rapidly rising. This has become particularly important recently since many agricultural inputs are petroleum-based. Hence, there is a continuing need to maximize crop production by reducing the influence of factors that limit yields. Also, greater emphasis is being placed on environmental issues regarding agricultural production. This has encouraged widespread support for developing agricultural practices designed to preserve and enhance environmentally-sound and sustainable methods for managing plant-pathogenic nematodes."

Predicting the long-term stability of carbon compounds in soil remains difficult because of the wide array of processes that control soil organic matter turnover, including C chemistry and its interaction with microbial enzyme systems, soil fauna, mineral soil surfaces, disturbance, and climate (Schimel and Weintraub, 2003; Grandy and Robertson, 2007). Several authors have reviewed the contributions that biological, physical, and chemical mechanisms make to C sequestration but experimental work - particularly in agricultural systems - that integrates all of these components is extremely limited and remains one of the greatest challenges to developing new theoretical and conceptual models that describe soil C dynamics. One of the largest gaps in our understanding is the role that soil fauna play in controlling litter decomposition dynamics. While it is generally known that soil fauna can exert top-down influences on microbial community structure and litter decomposition, a specific knowledge of the interactions between soil fauna, microorganisms, and chemical changes in C during decomposition is lacking. Further, there is little if any information that considers these interactions plus their consequences for the stabilization of C on mineral soil surfaces. In this proposal I put forth a plan to use a combination of field and laboratory studies to integrate the contributions soil biological, physical and chemical processes make in sequestering soil C. Broadly, I will test the hypothesis that agricultural management alters C stabilization by changing the biological processes that control the molecular structure of C and its interaction with mineral surfaces. This proposal is relevant to two key MAES areas. The first is `Environmental Stewardship and Natural Resources Policy and Management'. I will gain a significantly better understanding of soil organic matter and its process- and management-level controls. This will allow land managers in the state to target production practices that promote C sequestration. This will increase soil stability and fertility, improve water quality by reducing sediment loading and N leaching, and make a positive contribution to reducing atmospheric greenhouse gases. The second MAES area is, `Enhancing Profitability in Agriculture and Natural Resources'. Soil organic matter is closely tied to fertility and a number of soil quality parameters such as water holding capacity and bulk density that have a direct effect on yield. Soil organic matter dynamics may be closely related to the population dynamics of organisms that suppress several major plant diseases, including those in potatoes. Because of these multifunctional aspects of organic matter, it can increase yields and reduce dependence on external, purchased inputs. In Michigan the economic benefits of organic matter maybe particularly great because of the sandy soils and low soil quality in many regions."

Tobacco and dairy farming, once the largest agricultural industries, have declined and are being replaced by vegetable, nursery stock, and Christmas tree farming in many acres. The marketing of produce has also shifted from wholesale contracts with local supermarkets to direct retail sales. Approximately 441 farms offer direct sales through roadside stands and sales rooms. Another important segment of direct sales of vegetables to consumers is the development of a network of farmers' markets in Connecticut's urban centers and densely populated suburbs. In 2008, there were 114 farmers' markets attended by over 400 farmers. Consumers used to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in large supermarkets are seeking a greater diversity of ethnic and specialty crops at farmers' markets and roadside stands. Since 1982, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station has been investigating specialty crops to provide new opportunities for Connecticut's farmers. Over 40 fruits and vegetables have been studied resulting in over 50 publications and the introduction of new crops. Research included variety trials and experiments to determine the best cultural methods for growing each specific crop in Connecticut. Crops were chosen that have a high market value and an existing or expanding market that would readily accommodate these commodities. In this proposal, crops that appeal to Connecticut's ethnic population will be studied. These include specialty eggplant, pumpkins, and sweet peppers. New varieties of sweet potatoes will also be examined. Knowledge of high yielding cultivars of these crops and cultural details about these crops benefit growers, especially those who serve innner city consumers who purchase these vegetables at local farmers' markets throughout the Northeast. Project beneficiaries also include consumers of ethnic vegetables, especially those in urban areas. Availabilty of traditional foods increase fresh vegetable consumption, thereby increasing public health."

The research program caters to the unique needs of the industry in the valley. These projects are carried out in collaboration with other faculty at SLVRC and also at main campus. The first objective is developing storage guidelines for new cultivars, such as Canela Russet and Rio Grande Russet. Canela Russet and Rio Grande Russet are popular cultivars grown in the valley. Management information on storage will further benefit growers and help increase their returns on these two cultivars. The second objective is managing pressure bruise in potato storages. Pressure bruise is a primary concern for all market classes of potato. Pressure bruise limits the storage duration of potato and reduces grade the longer potatoes are stored. Pressure bruise can result in quality losses of 20-30% in long term storage potatoes, yet little is known about factors influencing this condition. Pressure bruise is primarily caused by the weight of the pile, but physiological and genetic factors play a role in affecting the structure of tubers on the bottom portion of the bin. Some cultivars are more prone to this condition. In addition to that, there are a number of pre-harvest and post-harvest factors that can cause this condition. Third objective of this project is screening for resistant starch levels in potato cultivars and wild relatives. Starches are one of the main forms of dietary carbohydrates. Starch consists of two types of molecules, amylose (normally 20-30%) and amylopectin (normally 70-80%). Amylopectin is a compact molecule with a higher molecular weight than amylose. Amylose has an extended shape and hydrogen bonds between these extended chains make it resistant to amylases. The amount of resistant starch (RS) in a given cultivar is dependent on the amount of amylose. Identifying cultivars with high levels of RS and developing storage regimes and guidelines for processing methods can enhance the nutritive value of the potato. This can create a new market potential for the potato as a specialty crop. The final objective is studying the population dynamics of powdery scab and molecular characterization of skin mutant susceptible to powdery scab disease. Powdery scab symptoms cause significant economic losses in both fresh and seed markets. Depending on the severity of symptoms, tubers could become non-marketable or the grade may be lowered in fresh and seed markets. Seed lots infected with powdery scab may or may not pass inspection depending on the regulations of the certifying agency and the degree of infection. A better understanding of russeting mechanisms will help us to develop new cultural tools for better skin set in new Cultivars to enhance the native capacity of tubers for skin set. Skin setting is an important biological process in tubers that protects against biotic and abiotic stresses, and has a great impact on potato quality."

Nearly 82% of the potatoes produced in Idaho are stored for some duration. In most years, a loss in storage due to shrink and disease is approximately 6 to 7% but can be higher if frost or wet rots have affected the crop. Minimizing potential storage loss is always a major concern for storage managers. Stakeholder and other industry inputs have indicated disease control needs for processing, fresh market and seed potatoes as an area of research emphasis. It is important to minimize wounding of the crop during harvest and handling to reduce susceptibility to many storage diseases. The impact of wounding and predisposition to disease development can also be influenced by cultivar, pulp temperatures and storage conditions. Post-harvest applications of either sprout- or disease-control agents to tubers are often made to help maintain quality prior to entering the storage facility and after leaving the packing shed. There are very limited data on the impacts from the use of post-harvest disease-control agents on wound healing. The use of phosphorous acids as a low-pressure spray application on potatoes being loaded into the storage facility is gaining nationwide acceptance. This product is very effective in minimizing the spread of pink rot and late blight in storage. There is currently no data on the impact of wound healing in storage after applications of this product. Additional products being used in the industry include disinfestants applied on either potatoes going into storage or just prior to being packaged and shipped. Additionally, for both the organic and conventional markets, microbial biocontrol agents are also being considered. Again, there is limited information on these post-harvest products on the potential effects on wound healing, efficacy and subsequent tuber quality. Data on this response would be beneficial to fully recognize the use and impacts of these post-harvest disease-control agents. The potato industry has gained a few novel post-harvest products in the last several years although there is still a paucity of post-harvest chemicals and/or application methodologies available to the industry. The lack of effective products to control disease in storage prompted the industry to support and evaluate the use of additional control agents in storage. Products with low food safety concern need to be tested as viable post-harvest disease-control agents. Research information will help establish recommendations on the use of post-harvest disease-control products and if additional alternative products or methods need to be identified. Various methods of applications, such as application via aerosol or humidification, may need to be implemented in some situations to elevate efficacy. The impact of this project will be to provide research based information to the potato industry regarding storage management of diseases and the use of post-harvest disease control products."

In addition, more and more previously unreported viral strains, probably recombinants, with new and unknown capabilities continue to be discovered within U.S. seedstocks. The impact of PLRV (and the serious  net necrosis  tuber symptom that it causes) was greatly reduced by the advent of systemic insecticides, such as imidacloprid, that effectively control the aphid vectors of the virus. While the amount of PLRV in Idaho seed lots has not rebounded to high levels, there appears to have been a small but steady increase over the last three years."

Pto-mediated immunity requires Prf, a host resistance protein with a nucleotide-binding site and a region of leucine-rich repeats. Pto and Prf form a recognition complex in the plant cell and function coordinately in defense signaling. However, how the recognition signal is transduced from Pto/Prf complex to the downstream defense responses is largely unknown. Recently, we have identified SlNAC1, a plant specific transcription factor, interacts with Prf in the yeast two-hybrid assay. The SlNAC1 gene is induced during Pto/Prf-mediated defense response. Interestingly, we found that SlNAC1 is undergoing a regulation of ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Together, we hypothesize that Prf might function in defense response via direct interaction with transcription factor for transcriptional reprogramming. To further characterize the role of SlNAC1 in disease resistance, we are currently using the combination of molecular, genetic, biochemical and cellular approaches to investigate the role of SlNAC1 in Pto/Prf-mediated resistance and the regulation of SlNAC1. In addition, the possible role of SlNAC1 in PAMP-mediated basal defenses will also be investigated in order to elucidate the signaling crosstalk between these two branches of plant immunity system. Given the fact that NAC transcription factors are highly functionally conserved plant specific transcription factors are involved in many stress responses, the discovery from this study may have broader impact on study of disease resistance mechanisms in other crops, especially for other economically import crops in Solanaceae family, such as potato, tobacco, and eggplants. We propose the following objectives: 1.Determine the functional relationship between Prf and SlNAC1. 2.Determine the role of SlNAC1 in Pto/Prf-mediated disease resistance. 3.Investigate the regulation of SlNAC1 transcription factor in the plant cell. 4.Explore the downstream genes regulated by SlNAC1. 5.Generate tomato transgenic plants containing engineered variants of the SlNAC1 gene."

Indications from initial results of another global survey by the nematology community of nematode associated crop losses are that these estimates remain at similar levels. In economic terms, these estimated annual crop losses translate to at least $8 billion in the United States and $78 billion worldwide (Smiley, 2005). In addition, economic loss associated with increasing material and application costs of nematicides and economic loss associated with trade embargos due to actual or suspected quarantine status nematode infestations exacerbate nematode problems in agriculture. Increasingly, scientific evidence and public awareness have heightened concerns about environment quality, food quality, and human health and safety relative to pest management in agricultural production. The need for alternative, integrated nematode management has been propelled by the actions triggered by the Montreal Protocol and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of the 1990s. Phase-out of methyl bromide is in the latter stages where current use has been reduced by about 80% and is allowed only under negotiated Exceptional Use Permit. Based on FQPA requirements, it is likely that widely-used and efficacious nematicides will be unavailable or greatly restricted in the future. For example, Nemacur, a commonly used nematicide on several crops was canceled in 2007, and the soil fumigant nematicide 1,3-dichloropropene (Telone II) is a B2 carcinogen, reviewed under FQPA and used under more rigorous restriction. Together with another fumigant, metam-sodium, the fumigant nematicides have been identified by California EPA as the largest agricultural source VOC (volatile organic compound) contributors to air pollution by ground level ozone formation. Both locally and nationally, the agricultural production community (our stakeholders) is scrambling to find viable and agro-ecologically sustainable alternatives to chemical-based soil pathogen and nematode control. In addition, world travel and commerce have accelerated the dissemination of pest species, including plant-parasitic nematodes. Development and application of new diagnostic protocols for accurate identification of nematode species is beneficial and necessary for national and international regulatory and quarantine agencies relative to free trade and economics, as exemplified by recent trade restrictions on movement of potatoes due to findings of quarantine-status cyst or root-knot nematodes in US production areas such as Idaho. The nematology community has repeatedly advocated the need for funding support focused on the basic and applied research required to advance agro-ecologically sustainable alternative management approaches and accurate nematode detection and diagnostics."

The behavior of these vectors in turn can be affected by the host plant's response to virus infection. This project continues investigations into the effects of virus infections on the principal vectors of two important viruses, Potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) and Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV-PAV), affecting potato and wheat respectively. Prior work has shown that volatile cues from infected plants affect aphid behavior with implications for plant-to-plant movement of the virus. In this project, we will address a long-term goal to develop an understanding of the role of virus-induced changes in plants in the spread of PLRV and BYDV and to apply this understanding to reduce the impact of the diseases they cause. The specific objectives are: 1. Assess behavioral responses of aphids to plants at various stages of the disease progression using three pathosystems as models (PLRV- Potato-GPA; BYDV-Wheat-BCOA). 2. Assess if PLRV infection affects virus titer, VIV production, and the resulting distribution of GPA within the plant. 3. Examine effects of VIV on among plant movement by aphids and spread of virus in both pathosystems. 4. Compare responses of viruliferous and nonviruliferous aphids to virus-infected and non-infected plants. Expected outcomes include a research community better informed about the roles of plant cues in spread of important disease causing viruses in crops. This will direct efforts to improve management of aphid-vectored viruses by manipulating their behavior through various means, including plant breeding. Vector management will remain central in efforts to limit virus impacts on key economic and staple crops in the USA and worldwide. Methods based on sound understanding of the biology of these systems are needed and can result from this project."

In particular, the abundance of branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine) can increase 100-fold or more in Arabidopsis and other plant species. This large dynamic range in branched-chain amino acid accumulation provides a reliable and quantitative assay for investigating the regulatory networks that lead to metabolic changes in plants during osmotic stress. Knockout mutations in four out of fifteen tested transcription factors showed that they have defects in drought-induced, but not basal levels of isoleucine, leucine, and valine. Although some of these genes have been studied previously for other reasons, none of them have been associated previously with regulating branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. Further bioinformatic analysis of Arabidopsis gene expression and metabolic pathways will identify additional transcription factors that regulate branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. Assays with transcription factor knockout and overexpression lines will help to determine the contributions that these individual genes make during plant adaptation to osmotic stress. Broader Impacts. Abiotic stress, in particular drought and salt, greatly limit agricultural productivity in many parts of the world. Large increases in the biosynthesis of isoleucine, leucine, and valine, which will be studied in Arabidopsis, have also been observed in crop plants subjected to osmotic stress. Therefore, research on these Arabidopsis responses will lead to the identification of basic regulatory pathways that may aid in the development of drought and salt tolerance in crop plants. Isoleucine is also considered a limiting essential amino acid in some of the world's major food crops. Transcription factors that regulate the isoleucine biosynthesis pathway may be implemented in a targeted manner to increase isoleucine accumulation in rice, potatoes, or other agriculturally relevant plant species. This project will contribute to training a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in bioinformatics and plant metabolic biochemistry. Undergraduate summer interns participating in the project will be recruited through a well-established education and outreach program at the Boyce Thompson Institute (http://www.bti.cornell.edu/pgrp/). Additionally, the principal investigators will be involved in teaching, both in a university classroom setting and in ongoing outreach efforts to educate community members about plant biochemistry, bioinformatics, and molecular biology."

P. infestans is believed to absorb nutrients during plant infection through the use of specialized structures that it inserts into host cells, and to adjust its metabolism to adapt to the nutrients encountered in its different hosts, but neither phenomenon is well-understood.  A combination of molecular and cellular tools will be used to explore these processes, such as methods to identify genes that are turned on and off in response to different feeding conditions and techniques to localize within P. infestans the proteins that participate in nutrient sensing and uptake.  This work is significant since organisms like P. infestans cause disease on hundreds of different plant species, and those diseases are difficult to control with existing tools.  The research may lead to practical applications, such as inhibitors of the pathways used to assimilate nutrients which might be used to reduce the incidence of disease.  The project also integrates research, education, and outreach at several levels as it will support junior scientists and graduate students, as well as undergraduates that might be interested in careers in science."

Small-holder farmers in Africa and South America are responsible for more than 95% of cacao production, providing economic benefits to millions of cacao farmers and their dependents, as well as important ecological benefits such as rain-forest preservation. Fungal and oomycete diseases have devastated cacao production in South America and West Africa, dislocating populations of farmers and resulting in destruction of the rain-forest sheltering the cacao trees in favor of large-scale open farmland. This project will test two novel approaches to protecting developing country crops against a broad-spectrum of oomycete and fungal pathogens, using cacao as the initial target. The first involves targeting anti-microbial proteins to pathogen feeding structures called haustoria, using RPW8, an Arabidopsis protein that has a natural affinity for these feeding sites. The second approach involves blocking the entry of virulence proteins (effector proteins) that pathogens secrete into host cells to suppress the plant host's immune system. The most effective strategies will be identified first using fast growing Arabidopsis and tomato plants before being tested in cacao.Broader Impacts: The novel technologies that will be tested in this project are potentially applicable to an extremely broad array of crop diseases important to the developing world. The most destructive diseases of broad acreage staples such as rice and wheat are potentially amenable to this approach, as are many of the most limiting fungal and oomycete diseases of crops of importance to smallholders, such as yams, cassava, groundnuts, pearl millet, finger millet, sorghum, maize, potato, bean and cowpea. The project includes visits from scientists from developing countries, a colloquium in Ecuador, and regular communication with scientists from cacao-producing countries.  Project outcomes as well as access to biological resources that include DNA constructs and germplasm will be disseminated through a project website (accessible via https://www.vbi.vt.edu/faculty/research_groups/brett_tyler) and through publications."

A novel method for producing haploid Arabidopsis thaliana has been developed based on the observation that, when wildtype plants are crossed to mutant plants in which a centromere protein (CENH3) is replaced with an altered centromere variant, chromosomes from the mutant are eliminated, yielding haploid progeny at a high frequency. Unlike most existing methods for producing haploids, this method creates haploids through seed and thus does not require tissue culture, a major source of genotype dependence. In addition, CENH3 is universally required for centromere function in eukaryotes, providing a practical basis for transferring the method into any plant that can be transformed. This EAGER project will leverage this preliminary work to adapt the technology to produce haploids in tomato. The work will use A. thaliana to determine how genome elimination can be engineered without a cenh3 null mutation, information critical for the potential use of the method in crop plants. RNA interference will be used first to down-regulate CENH3 in tomato.  Finally, altered CENH3 transgenes will be introduced into tomato plants where endogenous CENH3 has been silenced to test for their ability to induce haploids when crossed to wild type. Broader Impacts Tomato has tremendous economic importance, and is rapidly becoming a model for basic plant biology both within and outside the Solanaceae. Despite these advantages, it completely lacks a haploid production method. Development of such a protocol would synergize with existing genetic tools (including large banks of wild germplasm) and emerging genomic resources. The combination of these strengths will facilitate studies that use natural variation to understand agriculturally important traits and will provide for improved tomato breeding, which could have profound effects on food security in the many countries including developing countries in Africa and Asia where tomato and its close relatives eggplant and potato are important crops. The proposed research will provide research training opportunities for postdoctoral fellows and disadvantaged and underrepresented undergraduate students that integrate genetic and molecular methods with statistical and mathematical rigor. These young scientists will also receive training in plant breeding as well as in quantitative genomic methods."

Ms Chacaltana will excavate the coastal archaeological site of Tacahuay that has evidence of Inca architecture and appears to be an Inca way station (tambo). Tambos were installations systematically built along the main and secondary roads of the empire.  She will also excavate in houses around the way station to see how the Inca presence affected the local population. Data gathered from this excavation will be compared with the Inca site of Camata Tambo, an Inca waystation and adjacent local peoples' houses located in the highlands of the Colesuyo territory. Excavations will focus on imperial central storage systems and nearby houses to better understand the political and economic interests of the empire in the region.Despite what is known about Inca imperial strategies of integration, little is understood about the way the empire impacted local communities and regional interactions. Ms Chacaltana will conduct small-scale excavations in the Tacahuay Inca storage structures, and in four houses from Tacahuay Pueblo to detect the types and quantities of products kept in these state-controlled and locally controlled spaces. This information will help to understand the way local consumption and local storing technologies changed from the pre-Inca to Inca period. In addition, this investigation contributes to understanding how imperial actions impact local interests, resources, and political and economic demands, a priority in today's global economy. Based on archaeological and historical data from Colesuyo, three models will be tested to observe the imperial impact in local communities of this region. Ms Chacaltana will analyze plant and animal remains as well as chemical composition of ceramic fragments to observe local and regional exchange of goods during the Inca period. Preliminary investigations conducted at Camata Tambo storehouses and nearby agricultural facilities - located in the upper Moquegua Valley - showed that these imperial storage systems kept goods from different ecological zones of Colesuyo and more distance regions. It also showed an intensification of maize production and a growing storage preference for potatoes. By focusing on storage patterns in two small-scale Inca installations (tambos), this project will observe imperial variability in two ecological settings of the Andes. Several lab methodologies and lines of data will be used to observe how imperial presence in a region is the dynamic result of both imperial and local interests.The broader impact of this research rests on the fact that it creates a multi-national research cooperation that will contribute to strengthen the relationships between US and Peruvian investigators. MsChacaltana works with the Contisuyo Program, an international archaeological research institution located in the city of Moquegua, of which she is an active member. The Contisuyo Program has a strong commitment to public outreach and local education. Finally, Ms Chacaltana will closely work with local governments to help create awareness of the importance of pre-Hispanic site management and cultural heritage."

Generally, genetic resistance is used to minimize the impact of potyviruses in conjunction with pesticides to control the insect carriers of the virus. Both of the control methods can be overcame due to adaptation of the insects or evolution of the virus. An essential aspect of the virus life cycle needs to be targeted for effective control and to achieve this, better understanding of potyvirus molecular biology will be required. A new gene, pipo, that was recently discovered is present in all the members of Potyviridae. Previous data show that pipo expression is required for proper establishment of infection in plants. Studying the mechanism of pipo expression will provide more knowledge about potyviruses and protein translation. This may provide a new avenue of research for developing a sustainable method to control potyviruses."

In agriculture this will weaken biological control, an ecosystem service dependent on high levels of natural enemy biodiversity, and worsen pest outbreaks. In potato crops, we have compiled evidence suggesting that warming temperatures degrade a key component of predator biodiversity - community evenness (the balance among predator species) - leading to communities dominated by one or a few common species. This is concerning because we have shown that evenly-distributed predator communities are most effective at controlling the Colorado potato beetle, a devastating potato pest. Reduced-input farming practices, however, promote predator evenness and restore biocontrol services, and might therefore mitigate the harmful effects of climate change on natural pest control. To investigate whether reduced-input farming can reverse harmful effects of climate change on biological control, we will first assess whether variation in temperature and precipitation, two climatic factors that vary widely across Washington agroecosystems and that are expected to be impacted by climate change, affect landscape-wide natural enemy biodiversity and resulting pest densities. Second, we will assess whether reduced-input farming practices might reverse climate-based degradation of predator biodiversity and restore natural pest control. Accordingly, we have two objectives: (1) Isolate the effects of climatic variation on predator evenness and densities of key aphid and beetle pests across Columbia Basin potato-growing landscapes; and (2) Assess the potential of reduced-input farming to mitigate this harm to predator communities and restore biological function. Thus, the proposed research addresses a key challenge area of the AFRI program: mitigate and adapt agriculture to variations in climate."

This beetle has developed resistance to all classes of synthetic chemicals introduced for its control. We recently completed pyrosequencing of CPB transcriptome, prepared custom microarray, and developed feeding RNAi methods. These recent developments prepared us to exploit this insect to study the mechanisms of plant chemical detoxification. We will employ CPB custom microarrays to identify detoxification enzymes induced by plant chemicals. The top 50 xenobiotic enzymes identified will be confirmed qRT-PCR. We will employ RNAi to study the function and mechanisms of plant chemical induction of 20 selected enzymes. We will determine the role of three nuclear receptors (HR96, HNF4 and USP) and four bHLH-PAS transcription factors (Tango, Spineless, SRC and Met) in plant chemical detoxification.

The large travel distances increase both cost and time required and the relatively few extension specialists at MSU in the IPM area are primary constraints to IPM implementation. Therefore this proposal addresses this need with Extension IPM Associates and funding for travel and program support. Primary Coordination Program Emphasis will include: IPM Implementation for Agronomic Crops: wheat, barley forage crops (alfalfa), oilseeds (safflower, canola and camelina) and seed legumes ( dry peas, lentils and chickpeas);; IPM Implementation for Specialty crops (seed potatoes, sugarbeets, and dry beans); and IPM Training for Consumer and Urban Environments (consumers, home landscape businesses, public facilities (parks, city forestry) and Master Gardner training). Secondary coordination program emphasis includes: IPM Support for Pest Diagnostic Facilities; IPM education for Pesticide Applicators: IPM Training and Implementation in Schools; and IPM Partnerships in Wide-Area Pest Monitoring and Reporting Systems (weather-based pest prediction, cutworm prediction, NPDN) These programs are built on the expertise of the MT IPM team and state needs in terms of pest problems, technical assistance and IPM education with overall goals driven by the National Road Map for IPM. New emphasis will include: IPM Training and Implementation in Schools, IPM, building a web-based weather-based IPM information system linked to regional assets for Montana and continued expansion of the web-based High Plains IPM Guide cooperatively with IPM specialists in Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Outcomes will be better educated growers, landscape and turf businesses and public building mainatinance personnel.

While annual usage varies based on world economic conditions, approximately 80,000,000 metric tons of fertilizer N are applied annually in the world, of which more than 10,000,000 tons are applied annually in the United States. If crops don?t have an adequate supply of nitrogen, significant yield losses can occur. Consequently, growers typically apply an extra margin of fertilizer as insurance against possible yield reduction from under-application. Excessive nitrogen applications create a number of problems. First, excess nitrogen rates can contaminate water resources. Nitrogen lost from Midwest farm fields is a leading cause of the hypoxia zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Second, wasted nitrogen can cause a significant reduction in profitability, well beyond the cost of the wasted nitrogen. On crops like potatoes and sugar beets, excess nitrogen can cause a reduction in crop quality. Third, there is a negative impact to our atmosphere from applying nitrogen that is not consumed by the crop. Unused nitrogen enters the atmosphere as a potent greenhouse gas. As US farm policy becomes increasingly based on soil and water-quality initiatives, individual farm sustainability may be affected by a farmer?s ability to maintain production levels under closer scrutiny, and even mandates on the amount of fertilizer used. For each of these factors, improvements in managing nitrogen properly will increase the sustainability of their agro-economic production systems. These improvements include accurate assessments of available nitrogen already in the soil. Current approaches employ conventional soil sampling and lab analysis. Sampling depths required for nitrate are relatively deep. As a result, nitrate sampling is laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Because the samples must be submitted to a testing lab for analysis, the delay in receiving results is a major problem for growers needing to apply fertilizer immediately. As a result of these and other obstacles, many fields that would benefit from improved nitrogen management are not sampled at all, or not sampled with the density required for accurate variable rate prescriptions. The Veris Technologies Automated Soil Measurement System will collect and analyze nitrate and other soil properties to a depth of 24? rapidly, accurately, and economically. The System will perform the measurements automatically, with no action required by the operator. Based on typical zone sampling for nitrate, this system will have a daily capacity of several hundred acres, and will be able to perform these measurements for a competitive price versus conventional sampling and lab analyses. This will offer growers major improvements in fertilizer management, reducing sampling cost, shortening turnaround time for soil test information, increasing precision of site-specific fertilizer applications."

(2n=4x=48), is the most important vegetable in the US, with about 21 million tons produced annually and with a 2008 farm-gate value of $3.49 billion. Our proposal directly supports a four state (Minnesota, Michigan, North Dakota, and Wisconsin) potato breeding, genetics and cultivar development project in the North Central region that is both collaborative and multidisciplinary. The North Central program is an integrated, cooperative potato breeding and cultivar development effort; unique to the regional efforts in potato research, potato breeding occurs in all 4 North Central states, with each program responding to specific needs of producers, industry, and consumers in their areas. Multi-site evaluation and cultivar development is conducted by the state potato improvement teams involving potato breeders and geneticists, agronomists, plant pathologists, entomologists, and biochemists from the four state land grant universities and the USDA/ARS. Contributing to the utilization of potatoes in the North Central region are the French fry and frozen processing sector, chip processing, and reds, russets, round whites and specialty types for the fresh and storage tablestock market. Our breeding programs focus on market limiting traits as a basis in breeding superior cultivars for these specific end uses. For example, in the processing sector, high specific gravity, low sugar content, long-term storability, bruise resistance, and tuber shape are market limiting traits, in addition to sugar end resistance for French fry cultivars. Minimum standards are established from which our advanced germplasm is then compared. Upon this foundation, we combine traits that will provide durable host plant resistance to regionally important pathogens, insect pests and environmental stresses, and enhanced plant physiological efficiencies resulting in improved nutritional attributes for consumers and more sustainable environmental quality, as prioritized by our stakeholders. The overall objectives of the proposed research are to 1 - Develop potato (Solanum tuberosum Group Tuberosum L.) cultivars and germplasm for release and commercialization in the North Central region and beyond; 2 - Evaluate germplasm for traits that are market limiting in the North Central region, focusing on durable and multiple resistances to important disease, insect pest and environmental stresses including late blight, Verticillium wilt, common scab, PVY, Colorado Potato Beetle, and cold sweetening, as prioritized by the industry in our region; 3 - Conduct breeding studies to improve early generation selection (EGS) strategies and develop novel technologies to enhance cultivar commercialization; and 4 - Combine the phenotypic evaluation of a mapping population with the genotype data generated by SolCAP to identify marker-trait associations for genes with large effects for market-limiting variables. The project primarily employs traditional breeding techniques, but also includes utilization and development of marker-assisted selection and early generation screening techniques to enhance selection efforts for resistance to disease and insect pests and stresses."

In 2009, an unusual strain of late blight was introduced to Maine on imported tomato seedlings. Also in 2009, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) reached epidemic proportions in susceptible animals in Maine, but fortunately no human cases were confirmed. Due to the increasing numbers of Lyme disease cases, concerns related to West Nile Virus, and the multiple animal deaths and one suspected human death from Eastern Equine Encephalitis, the state's Vector-Borne Work Group has decided that more emphasis should be placed on IPM programs for ticks and mosquitoes. The billion dollar Maine agriculture industry is the most diverse agricultural system in New England. The management of pests is an integral part of the production of every commercial crop in Maine. Without reliable and sustainable pest management strategies, Maine's agricultural industries face severe crop losses resulting in reductions in profits and threats to their long-term viability. To ensure an adequate response to the potential pest-related hazards confronting Maine agriculture, collaboration between the UMaine Extension IPM Coordinator and the other five New England IPM coordinators is vital. Multiple New England wide collaborative projects are currently being undertaken, with several more in development. The Extension IPM Coordinator also collaborates with the Maine Department of Agriculture on many projects, including the implementation of school IPM and homeowner IPM. Information gathered through multiple sources, including direct observation, traps, weather data, and prediction models, is delivered to growers through newsletters, websites, and telephone message centers. The use of computers has become crucial in the management of pest related information. In the potato IPM program alone 1.5 million data entries are used to establish late blight prediction models and to supply pest information to the potato industry. Educational materials for the IPM programs are constantly being revised and created. We have developed multiple ways to convey pest related information to the agricultural industry, including the use of IPM games, fact sheets, and how-to brochures. Not only are these materials developed by Extension, but training of farmers, consultants, coordinators, and public health officials is also undertaken to provide them with the tools created by us and their use. The ongoing IPM programs have had a major impact on pest management in the state of Maine. Very few commodities still employ the traditional  calendar  spray schedule. Growers typically rely on Extension developed IPM programs that are implemented on their farms by Extension, private consultants, or themselves. Impacts on pest management in Maine include the elimination of sprays in schools, reduction of apple pest damage losses by 35% while spending $245 less per acre, and saving the potato industry an estimated $26 million in 2009."

Control of the recent infestation in Southeastern Idaho will require both short term and long term approaches. The short term approaches are designed to reduce the presence of PCN in the soil to the level where it no longer a threat to potato production or export. This will be done by identifying soil fumigants, soil biofumigants, and bacterial and fungal biocontrol agents that effectively reduce the viability of PCN cysts currently in the soil. Long term approaches will be developed to minimize the potential for reinvestation of U.S. potato production fields in the future. This will be done by facilitating the identification and development of G. pallida resistant potato cultivars. Using the combination of short term and long term approaches to control G. pallida will make it possible to eliminate the current threat to U.S. potato production and defend against G. pallida becoming a threat to the U.S. potato industry in the future."

Research needs to address the issues currently facing growers so that they can achieve competitive yields in a sustainable manner. The proposed research will benefit Michigan dry bean growers by reducing yield losses caused by potato leaf hopper, and the use of pesticides to control the pest. Enhanced levels of potato leaf hopper resistance in future dry bean varieties would facilitate the transition from conventional to organic production practices of dry beans in Michigan, and reduce the need and costs of expensive pesticide control. The savings from improved productivity due to lower yield losses and the reduction in pesticide use, would contribute to sustained productivity of a vital commodity and an important industry in Michigan. Breeding for adaption to the local growing environments has proven extremely successful to meet challenges worldwide over time. On-going work has identified unadapted sugarbeet germplasm with good germination in over 150 mM NaCl salt solutions as well as good field emergence, however these results and germplasm selections need to be validated under highly saline field conditions, a project being done with colleagues in Egypt. We propose to apply molecular transcription profiling tools to better understand the genetic basis for salt tolerance in beets, with particular effort to discover genes differentially expressed under varying salt levels and between germplasm showing tolerant and intolerant phenotypes. The resulting knowledge and materials will be further developed in the form of new germplasm and molecular genetic markers. The sugarbeet cyst nematode is considered the most important soil-borne pest of sugarbeet worldwide, and has recently been identified as a serious pest for many Michigan sugarbeet growers. Historically, this pest has been managed through crop rotation and limited use of fumigant and non-fumigant nematicides. The goal of this aspect of the proposal is to introgress these newer sources of nematode resistance into a well-adapted Great Lakes genetic background suitable for release to the sugarbeet seed industry. Management of weeds in sugarbeet production continues to be a challenge. The 2008 growing season was the first wide-spread commercialization of glyphosate-resistant (Roundup Ready) sugarbeet. The acceptance of this technology has simplified weed management in Michigan sugarbeet fields. However, the development of glyphosate-resistant weeds is a major concern with the increased use of glyphosate for weed control in most crops grown in rotation. Incorporating other weed management strategies including the use of cover crops to suppress initial weed emergence and growth may reduce the need for relying only on glyphosate for weed control in sugarbeet. In current production systems glyphosate will need to be applied three or more times to control weeds and maximize sugarbeet yield. Incorporating cover crops into sugarbeet production systems may reduce the number of glyphosate applications for summer annual weed control."

Given the limited insecticide options for organic producers, high expense of organic insecticides, and well-founded concerns over development of insecticide resistance in CPB, sustainable management tools for organic potato producers are sorely needed. The primary objective of this project is to clarify differences among commercial potato varieties in regard to CPB preferences and defoliation rates in order to establish the relative susceptibility of commonly grown commercial potato cultivars to CPB damage. Field experiments will be conducted at the University of Idaho Kimberly Research & Extension Center (Kimberly, ID) comparing the abundance of different life stages of CPB (eggs, small larvae, large larvae, and adults) and defoliation rates over time among different commercial potato varieties. A total of at least ten different varieties will be used. The results will allow for evaluation of host preference of CPB and the importance of beetles on defoliation and yield within each variety. Variety-specific defoliation and yield data will allow economic analysis of potential returns and risks of organic versus commercial potato production in this region. This project will contribute to the development of sustainable organic potato production in several ways: (1) growers could produce less preferred varieties to limit CPB damage with fewer insecticide applications or (2) tailor a CPB management strategy to a variety's susceptibility; (3) reduced insecticide use would satisfy consumer demand for environmentally responsible production, (4) mitigate against insecticide resistance development, and (5) reduce input costs; moreover, (6) varieties that are particularly attractive to CPB ultimately could be used in a trap cropping program. The use of more tolerant or less preferred varieties could be part of an overall integrated pest management strategy to reduce insecticide use and environmental risks while increasing yields and contributing to the long-term sustainability of organic potato production."

Maine farms produce a wide variety of agricultural commodities including grain crops such as corn, soybeans, and canola, fruit crops such as apples, strawberries, and blueberries, as well as broccoli, dry beans, peas, and multiple other vegetable crops. The potato industry, however, is the top agricultural sector in the State of Maine with a total economic value to the state of over $500 million, including farm-gate receipts of $100 million, and employing over 6,000 individuals. In order to ensure the sustainability and economic viability of Maine's potato industry, timely and efficient management of pests is crucial. A successful IPM program can not only potentially reduce production costs through decreased pesticide applications but, through the use of effective monitoring techniques, can ultimately save growers millions of dollars in potential crop losses. Integrated pest management programs, such as those offered by the University of Maine Cooperative Extension Service, play a pivotal role in supporting the Maine potato industry by offering assistance directly to growers. The University of Maine Cooperative Extension's Potato Integrated Pest Management Program impacts approximately 56,000 acres of potatoes. The program employs 18 seasonal program aides, maintains nearly 150 specialized insect traps, coordinates a statewide network of electronic weather stations, and surveys 100 potato fields on a weekly basis for weeds, insects and diseases. The data produced helps IPM scientists track potential pest outbreaks and helps provide growers with current information on specific and timely treatments in order to minimize the number of pesticide applications and maximize potato yield. The current market demand for perfect, pest and damage-free produce and crops, combined with the public's desire to decrease pesticide use for human health and environmental reasons, creates a difficult challenge for Maine potato growers. Homeowners and growers are increasingly at odds over the application of pesticides on farms adjacent to new or existing housing developments. The Potato IPM Program plays an integral role in ensuring that Maine's potato crop is pest and damage free while attempting to minimize the amount of pesticides that are applied. The presence of late blight in Maine during the 2009 crop year has produced the potential for inoculum to be widespread in 2010. Although, potato late blight does not typically survive Maine winters, early snow cover, could facilitate the proliferation of volunteer potatoes, which could serve as a host for late blight. This potential inoculum source, combined fungicide resistance of the late blight organism, and the confirmed presence of both the US-8 and the US-14/17 late blight strains, have the potential to create a considerable threat to the Maine potato industry's 2010 crop. For the 2010 crop year and beyond, it will be imperative for growers to eliminate all inoculum sources by controlling volunteers, cull piles, and by planting only late blight free seed."

PVY is one of the top disease management issues for the over 2 billion pounds of seed potatoes produced in the United States each year. Seed potato certification programs in the US require a post-harvest grow-out test to assess virus incidence in seed potato lots. Unfortunately, foliar symptoms are not always clear cut, especially with recently established tuber necrotic lesion strains of PVY. With no or limited foliar symptoms, there is a need for an inexpensive, rapid and dependable PVY assay for post-harvest grow-out testing.

Concurrently, a production system will be developed to increase the supply of the test reagent. Due to time and monetary parameters of the phase I program, there may be only limited testing with one potato variety and one PVY strain. Specifically, Rxoa will: Design and have synthesized a PVY specific reagent, design and make a reagent production system and conduct initial testing of reagent in a known PVY infected potato plant. At the end of the phase I portion of the project, we expect to have confirmation that our assay strategy shows promise.

This condition is commonly caused by stroke, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, or radiation therapy due to cancer. For those with medical conditions that cause dysphagia, they are unable to break down, manipulate, collect, and swallow the food that is in their mouth. For most of these patients, all food items must be pureed into a  pudding  or  mashed potato  consistency to avoid choking hazards, defined by the American Dietetic Association as Level 1 Puree. Unfortunately, the physical and chemical effects of pureeing food causes flavor, texture, and other changes that make the food less appetizing and, therefore, less likely to be consumed. These effects on an individual's appetite can have adverse consequences on the medically fragile patient who suffers from dysphagia. Current scratch recipes and available products from manufacturers are of marginal acceptability. No company has yet effectively addressed this unmet need.

This will decrease their risk of choking and aspiration pneumonia, as well as improve their nutritional intake, thereby improving their resistance to infection and other diseases. Increased normal food consumption will also reduce reliance on supplemental nutrition, thereby reducing cost pressures on facility budgets.

Climatic models indicate that drought will become increasingly common in the future. For example, 2009 was the worst drought in 50 years, with record-high temperatures and record-low rainfall in south/central regions of Texas causing $3.6 billion losses in crop and livestock production. Therefore, understanding plant and crop responses to drought, high temperature, wind, and nutrient balance is critical to develop sustainable cropping systems and tolerant genotypes to maintain or improve crop productivity and increase product quality. In Texas in 2008, major vegetable crops for fresh market and processing were grown under conventional systems across 74,400 acres (not including potatoes), with a total value of $276 million for fresh market and processed types and an economic impact of about $1 billion. In terms of value, the major crops for Texas are watermelon, onion, cabbage, and chile/jalapeno pepper and spinach. In the Wintergarden region, predominant spring crops are watermelon, cantaloupe, cucumber, pepper, green bean, and potato, while fall-winter crops are onion, cabbage, spinach, carrot, broccoli, cauliflower and more recently romaine lettuce. Other small scale specialty crops grown commercially, or on experimental basis, are tomato, eggplant, habanero pepper, cilantro, turnip, collards, kale, mustard, herbs and more recently artichoke. This project will address environmental constraints during seedling establishment, crop development and maturity. It will also focus on adaptation of new cultivars known to possess high yield potential and high levels of phytochemicals. Emphasis will be on the morphological and physiological characterization of root/shoot responses in order to better understand plant acclimation. This understanding is a pre-requisite to develop improved production strategies under those limited environments."

Tomato is one of the most consumed and widely grown vegetable crops in the world, supplementing a large proportion of vitamins and micronutrients in the US diet. In the US alone, tomato production and processing is a billion-dollar industry, ranking at par in terms of yield and consumption with potatoes among commercial vegetable crops. Studies for developing fundamental knowledge base in reference to breeding, genetics, and genomics are essential that will allow enhancing fruit quality, appearance, taste and phytonutrient content of fruits. Tomato is now featured among the foremost crop plant models in horticultural crops for understanding and controlling fruit ripening and enhancing phytonutrient levels via molecular genetics approaches. Reverse genetics has allowed usw to reduce biosynthesis or perception of ethylene to improve fruit shelf life. However, impaired ethylene production may have compromised the organoleptic fruit flavor. We have shown that enhancing the levels of polyamines greatly improves nutritional and processing fruit quality, and vine life of fruits. We have discovered that co-silencing a ripening specific lipoxygenase (LOX) decreases membrane breakdown, maintain fruit texture and extended period shelf life of ripe tomato fruits . Increasing expression of one of the small heat shock protein significantly improved processing attribute of tomato fruit. Pyramiding these genetic engineering modifications in one genotype holds promise to improve fruit shelf life, flavor, and nutritional quality and processing yield."

However they face intensively managed crops lacking effective herbicides with only a few herbicides being developed. Ineffective weed management programs results in an average of 20 to 25% loss in production and revenues annually. Estimates of 60 to 70% of the NC sweetpotato acreage experiences up to 30% yield and quality reduction from primarily Palmer amaranth. In addition, several herbicide resistant weed species have been identified in NC and are increasing exponentially in vegetables and fruits. In addition to reducing yield and quality weeds also interfere with harvest. This interference is exacerbated in many crops in NC because they are hand harvested and harvesters are paid based on quantity of produce harvested (ie buckets of no. 1 sweetpotato roots picked up and poured into bins). Weeds can also cause an increase in other pests (diseases, insects, animal) and can contaminate (ie nutsedge penetrating potato tubers or cantaloupe fruit; cocklebur fruit in green crops). In grown vegetable and fruit crops, the high cost of labor and mechanical cultivation for weed control necessitate the use of herbicides. The lack of EPA-registered herbicides for these crops has always been anobstacle to attaining optimum production of vegetables and fruits. Herbicide development in vegetable and fruit crops is now almost totally through the IR-4 program because these crops are grown on few acres compared to agronomic crops. Fear of damage claims to high value vegetable and fruit crops, low relative acreage of these crops, and the high cost of development discourage manufacturers from developing new herbicide registrations for these crops. As a result, much of the work must be conducted by the state agricultural research services (SARS) cooperation with IR-4 and industry. The impending loss of methyl bromide will also greatly reduce growers ability to control troublesome weeds in certain vegetable and fruit crops until alternative strategies are developed. Growers of these crops have long depended on methyl bromide for controlling most pests including weeds. With respect to weeds, the void from loss of methyl bromide brings will need to filled for the most part with herbicide systems. Growers of vegetable and fruit crops have large investments (production costs,etc.) in their crops. Growers have to develop a weed management program for each field they farm, specific to the weed problem and crop. They sometimes struggle with many decisions involved in developing and implementing a weed management program. Specifically, decision-making involves methods of weed control and timing of various methods of weed control (herbicide, cultivation, hand removal, etc), herbicide application (ie directed vs. broadcast). This research project will involve field and greenhouse research in vegetables and fruits that will address the problems related to weeds threatening these crops. The resulting impact of this research will be more efficient production systems, reduction of impact of weeds on quality and yield, and more abundant supply of these food crop products."

Considerable amount of resources are spent each year for chemical pest control strategies. To reduce the burden to growers of the added production costs associated with the use of chemical pesticides and to minimize the environmental impact of such control strategies, more sustainable and environmentally friendly strategies such as host plant resistance must be continuously explored. For many years, major efforts toward this goal have focused primarily on disease resistance and limited progress has been achieved with respect to the enhancement of resistance of commercial cultivars to insect pests. The limited level of resistance within the cultivated germplasm that can be incorporated to elite genotypes is the major reason for the slow progress in developing insect resistant potato cultivars. In this project, we will explore the hypothesis that R-gene-mediated mechanism of resistance is involved in the Solanum bulbocastanum-aphid interaction and that S. bulbocastanum can be used as genetic donor to enhance aphid resistance of commercial potato cultivars. We will use both a candidate gene approach and semi-global functional genomics approach to study a large number of genes associated with R-gene-mediated signaling in order to develop a good understanding of the major components of aphid resistance mechanism in S. bulbocastanum and its subsequent backcross derivatives in potato genetic background. Identification of these genes could lead to the development of innovative strategies for targeted gene introgression into the genetic background of commercial cultivars either by conventional sexual hybridization or by genetic engineering."

The Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is the most serious potato plant defoliator within the USA, Europe, and Asia. CPB first shifted onto the potato in the mid&#8208;1800's, somewhere in the Midwestern US. Given its worldwide distribution, it is surprising that CPB does not feed on cultivated solanaceous plants in its likely region of origin, the highlands of Mexico. This suggests either that: (1) genetic changes associated with potato colonization altered its evolutionary trajectory, or (2) pest evolution is highly dependent upon chance events. We propose to determine the roles of historic chance vs. adaptation in influencing beetle establishment and success in northern potato agroecosystems. The main objectives of this study are to: (1) determine the beetle's colonization routes and how colonization influenced beetle genetics; (2) determine if beetle populations vary along the hypothesized colonization gradient vary in their ecophysiological adaptation to northern climates. By incorporating a null expectation on colonizing species as recommended by Keller and Taylor (2008), we will be able to determine how history and chance vs. adaptation influenced beetle evolution."

This has resulted in a ranking of third for principal crops harvested, but only a ranking of eleventh in cash receipts for crops, and twenty-eighth in net farm income. Thus, even though producers in North Dakota lead the nation in the production of at least eight crops, they struggle to make a living. The reasons for the low net farm income could include lower yields and higher production costs. However, regardless of the reasons, producers need to discover ways to combat low profit margins per unit of land. Increasing farm size generally is not an option due to high land costs. A viable alternative requiring higher management, but also providing increased income potential, is high-value crop production. These products are typically perishable, of high quality and specific value, and increasingly sold through specialized markets. This production alternative may help diversify farming operations and increase net returns. In addition, numerous communities have developed farmer's markets due to the increase in demand for locally produced food. The United States Department of Agriculture reported that between 1994 and 2006, the number of U.S. farmers' markets more than doubled to over 3,700, and the value of U.S. agricultural products directly sold increased thirty-seven percent from $592 million to $812 million. North Dakota's large diurnal temperature differences during the growing season are ideal for high-quality and high-yielding specialty crops such as vegetables, herbs, and small fruits. Many producers are experimenting with small fruits and vegetables, utilizing limited production information available from nearby states and learning from personal experiences. Sustainable production practices are desperately needed to avoid costly mistakes at a time when financial stability is already a concern. With the introduction of Roundup Ready crops in the 1990's and the explosion in the adoption of glyphosate-resistant crops, the acreage receiving more than one application of glyphosate has increased dramatically nation-wide. Glyphosate label additions allowing pre-harvest applications to several non-glyphosate-resistant crops has further increased the acreage treated with glyphosate. Currently, glyphosate is the largest-selling single crop-protection chemical product in the market. Nontarget injury from glyphosate drift to non-glyphosate-resistant crops has been a concern since the introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops. Most research has shown detrimental effects when drift occurred early in the growing season and that nontarget monocot crops are more sensitive than dicot crops. However, since this chemical is translocated within a plant, there is potential injury to the current season growth as well as tubers used for seed the following year. Potato seed producers as well as commercial producers need to be educated on the potential risks associated with glyphosate applications near a potato field."

The three main long term storage diseases are Fusarium dry rot, black dot and silver scurf. All three diseases are caused by fungi, and these pathogens exist in both farm soils and on the seed used for planting. Thus the question is not if the diseases will occur, but rather how much loss is sustained. Postharvest treatment of fruit and vegetables is not new, since man has dealt with stored product losses for centuries. Fungicides can provide an effective means of reducing storage losses if you can identify products that are safe and effective and will not result developing fungicide resistance due to misuse. Both fungicidal products and biological products will be evaluated to determine their effectiveness in reducing rotting and shrinking of tubers over time. The three most common foliar diseases of tomato in both commercial and home garden settings are early blight, late blight and Septoria leaf spot. Up until now, conventional genetic resistance to all three diseases was unavailable. Through considerable effort and time, genetic material now exists for controlling these diseases. This material needs to be fixed into desirable horticultural backgrounds and shown to provide acceptable control when subjected to field inoculations. Since resistance for early blight and Septoria leaf spot is recognized as tolerance, some minimal amount of fungicide or biological product may be necessary to cover all possible growing conditions. This project will determine what chemicals can be used that qualifies as reduced risk to humans and the environment, and in fact, has as low as possible environmental impact quotient to insure safety. The current work allows us to assess plant resistance before it is widely acquired by commercial seed breeders and at the same time determine how best to use this resistance in concert with minimal sprays programs or even the elimination of needed sprays."

This agricultural system is undergoing rapid and unprecedented change in terms of increasing crop prices (e.g., corn, soybeans, small grains and alfalfa), the proportion of Wisconsin acreage planted to each of these crops, and resulting state and regional forage supplies. In 2007, alfalfa prices increased sharply, partly due to tight hay supplies and partly in response to rapid increase in corn costs exerting upward pressure on forage value (Mintert 2008). Although refined to incorporate the use of glandular haired, potato leafhopper-resistant alfalfa varieties (Lefko et al. 2000), land-grant university economic threshold recommendations for potato leafhopper on standard, leafhopper-susceptible varieties have not been validated or updated with field research data to reflect the current high value crop market. This Integrated Research and Extension activity is designed to update linear yield-loss models for alfalfa and potato leafhopper. Model coefficients from new field research data in Wisconsin, over multiple years with additional data points at lower potato leafhopper numbers, will be used to re-calculate the Economic Injury Level and determine if the Economic Threshold should be lowered. In addition, laboratory experiments will test the hypothesis that alfalfa weevil and alfalfa blotch leafminer parasitoids are negatively impacted by increased insecticide use for potato leafhopper in the absence of field scouting data and clientele loss of confidence in economic thresholds developed over 30 years ago. Results will be delivered to county agents, farmers, and crop advisors through UW Madison Entomology and Agronomy research/extension programs. This project will generate research-based knowledge and develop educational programs that will provide updated IPM decision support to UW Extension county agents, farmers and crop advisors allowing them to continue to benefit from highly effective potato leafhopper insecticide management tactics, while refocusing on practices to preserve long-standing biological control success for alfalfa weevil and alfalfa blotch leafminer in alfalfa."

This hypothesis will be tested using lab-scale TPAD digesters receiving a mixture of dairy cattle manure and potato/corn chip wastes.

This research builds upon and expands our Third Frontier Biomass-to-Energy Program, which is centered on AD and direct electricity production using solid-oxide fuel cells. Enhancement of lignocellulose conversion to methane by TPAD potentially produces additional 3.5-7.0 billion m3 of methane/year from the 87 million dry tons of livestock manures available for bioenergy production in the US each year."

On a local scale in NYS, farmers seek to increase sustainability and efficiency to maintain dynamic farm profitability and to reduce the impact on natural habitats as well as human and ecosystem health. Therefore, improving crop productivity without further increase in agrochemical use and expanding cropland areas is of general concern and requires new and innovative agricultural methods. To accomplish this goal, modern plant breeding and agricultural management have focused on minimizing the effects of pests and competition while increasing resource availability through supplemental application of mineral fertilizers. However, in the face of the current food crisis there is a need to seek ever new ways to increase crop productivity. One potential and economically sound way of increasing productivity is to increase the assimilation of atmospheric carbon since plants use only a relatively small fraction of their photosynthetic capacity. However, attempts to increase crop productivity by increasing photosynthetic activity through breeding usually failed, supposedly because of complex feedback loop-driven interactions of the involved biosynthetic pathways. Interestingly, we found that the damage by two insect pest species, the mirid bug Tupiocoris notatus and the lepidopteran potato tuber moth Tecia solanivora increases photosynthetic activity, defensive secondary metabolite production and productivity of wild tobacco and crop potato, respectively. The application of the herbivores? oral secretions are sufficient to specifically induce these plant responses. We hypothesize that the chemical elicitation by the two-herbivore species orchestrates complex interactions of plant biosynthetic pathways to allow the plants to allocate more resources into growth, anti-herbivore defenses and storage. Identifying the herbivore-derived compounds that elicit these unusual plant responses and understanding the plant response mechanisms will provide us with the basis for manipulating plant endogenous signaling to increase crop productivity and food quality. With this project we will isolate the active compounds in the herbivores' salivary secretions and test if their application increases photosynthetic efficiency and herbivore resistance of three major NYS/US crop species (tomato, potato and tobacco), representing three types of agricultural produce (fruit, tuber, leaves). Our results will establish the potential use of herbivore-derived elicitors as a new method to increase crop productivity and contribute to the understanding of physiological and ecological mechanisms of plant responses to herbivory. A multi-institutional collaboration and the continuous exchange of information and knowledge with the stakeholders, including plant breeders, extension officers and farmers, from the beginning of this study will help to identify ecologically and economically sound ways to successfully use insect-derived elicitors in agriculture as a new means to increase crop productivity."

Late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, is the most devastating potato disease worldwide. The first shock of devastation caused by P. infestans was the well-known Irish Potato Famine, which led to the death of approximately one million people through starvation and disease, with another million thought to have emigrated as a result of the famine. Control of late blight in the United States relies almost exclusively on fungicide application. During an average epidemic year the fungicide cost to control late blight is about $200-300 per acre. Extensive fungicide applications can also result in a major environmental issue. Potatoes contain many resistance genes (R genes) against late blight. At least 11 race-specific late blight resistance genes, all from a wild potato species Solanum demissum, have been incorporated into numerous potato varieties. However, all of these genes have already been overcome by specific P. infestans strains. Because the race-specific resistance genes have been short-lived in breeding practices, it is of great interest to study the mechanisms of broad-spectrum, or race-non-specific disease resistances against late blight. We have cloned such a race-non-specific late blight resistance gene, named RB, from a Mexican wild potato species Solanum bulbocastanum in 2003. Transgenic potato lines containing the RB gene showed resistance against various P. infestans strains. Most remarkably, the transgenic lines exhibited a high level of resistance in the Toluca Valley in Mexico, which is the most late blight infested region in the world. The proposed research will investigate the molecular mechanisms of the RB-mediated resistance pathway. We are interested why and how the RB-mediated resistance is different from the resistance conferred by the race-specific resistance gene. Using genomics mythologies we have identified a set of 185 genes that are associated with the RB-mediated resistance. Most importantly, we have discovered a novel receptor-like kinase (RLK) gene, which may play a key role in the resistance pathway. We will use several different techniques, including gene expression, gene silencing, and late blight inoculation tests in greenhouse, to study the specific role of this RLK gene. Results from the proposed research will be important to develop strategies for breeding and deploying the RB gene in sustainable ways."

About 10 million individuals in the United States have the disease and another 34 million have low bone mass with increased risk for osteoporosis. The annual cost for treating osteoporosis related fractures in the U. S. is currently estimated to be $19 billion and is expected to rise to approximately more than $25 billion by 2025. Eight million of those affected by osteoporosis are women. Therefore, identification of treatment or prevention strategies for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women has significant socioeconomic implications. Currently available therapies have side effects that drive significant number of people to seek other alternatives. In addition, treatment becomes ineffective once bone fractures occur. Thus, research into novel nutritional strategies for preventing osteoporosis is urgently needed. Previous efforts to prevent osteoporosis have focused on calcium and vitamin D intake due to their recognized importance in bone metabolism. Epidemiological studies of human subjects have suggested that fruit and vegetable consumption may contribute to bone growth in children and the maintenance of bone density in adults. Recent studies showed that foods rich in anthocyanins, such as prunes and blueberries, prevent bone loss due to estrogen deficiency. Anthocyanins content of purple sweet potatoes is comparable to that of purple fruits such as blueberries. Purple sweet potato powder has strong antioxidant activities. Anthocyanins extracted from purple sweet potatoes protect liver function and suppress atherosclerotic lesions in mice. However, it is not clear whether purple sweet potato would help to prevent bone loss as observed for blueberries. Further research is also needed to clarify how the effects of purple sweet potato on bone may be influenced by dietary calcium intake. We will conduct two experiments with ovariectomized rats as the experiemntal model to determine the potential benefits of purple sweet potatoes on bone health. If the beneficial effects of purple sweet potatoes are confirmed, this project will add new options for postmenopausal women to prevent osteoporosis. The identification of new health benefits of purple sweet potato may also encourage local farmers to produce purple sweet potatoes locally."

Disease loses in subsistence crops like potato can be devastating in less developed countries. A better understanding of how this pathogen causes disease is necessary for developing new, environmentally responsible control methods. R. solanacearum uses a complex type II system (T2S) to secrete multiple extracellular proteins (EXP) through its outer membrane. The T2S is essential for R. solanacearum to colonize tomato plants and cause disease, but exactly which of the 30-plus EXP is important for pathogenesis remains to be determined. I will investigate which of the EXP is most important for pathogenesis by inactivating each gene and determining if the mutants have retained their normal ability to cause wilt disease. The T2S has a similarly important role in other pathogens, but many aspects of how this secretion system works are still unclear. For example, how the SdpC and SdpD proteins recognize putative 3-dimensional features on the surface of folded proteins and selectively secrete a subset of periplasmic proteins is not understood. Unusual features of SdpC in R. solanacearum and related bacteria suggested several new hypotheses about how the structure of SdpC proteins in general might affect function. These hypotheses will be tested by evaluating the ability of cloned sdpC genes from selected bacteria and various artificial gene constructs or mutants to restore protein secretion by a R. solancearum that lacks its sdpC gene. Options for controlling bacterial wilt caused by R. solanacearum remain inadequate. For example, despite years of effort by academic and corporate scientists, there still are no horticulturally acceptable resistant tomato cultivars. Identification of one or more chemicals that selectively inhibit the T2S system in R. solanacearum could open the door to development of completely new bacterial wilt control strategies. Therefore I will begin developing a high-throughput screening method than can be used to test a large library of small, diverse chemicals to identify inhibitory compounds."

Compared with synthetic antioxidants, antioxidative peptides have the main advantages of exerting no known health risks and can offer additional functionality. Despite the demonstrated antioxidant potential, the fate of antioxidative protein hydrolysates or peptides in foods during processing and subsequent storage is poorly understood. This project seeks to investigate the physicochemical changes in antioxidative peptides as a result of exposure to reactive oxygen species (objective 1), interactions of antioxidative peptides with various food components under different food processing pH, temperature and salt conditions (objective 2), and properties of selected foods treated with antioxidative peptides (objective 3). Mixed antioxidative peptides (protein hydrolysates) will be prepared from soy, milk whey, potato and buckwheat proteins that have proven to be excellent sources of antioxidant peptides from previous research. Antioxidative peptides and proteins in 0.1-0.6 M NaCl at pH 5-7 will be oxidatively stressed by exposures to hydroxyl radicals produced from FeCl3/ascorbate/H2O2 reactions, or auto-oxidized at different temperatures (5-80C). Oxidatively modified peptides and proteins will be evaluated for structural characteristics, physicochemical changes, tendency to interact with major food components, and influence on the quality of selected foods (meat batters, pork loins, and gravies). We expect that in the process of neutralizing small-sized radials, for example, hydroxyl radicals, antioxidant peptides and proteins will undergo major structural changes and form aggregates among themselves and with other chemical components in food, and ultimately, alter the physicochemical characteristics of final food products. Furthermore, we expect peptides to degrade into fragments when exposed to strong oxidizing environments while serving as antioxidants. It is likely that many of the antioxidative peptides not only can protect foods from oxidative destruction, but they also can enhance the functional attributes of final food products. With an annual output of 46.92 million bushels (1.28 M tons) of soybeans, Kentucky ranks 17th in the nation in total soybean production. Through identification of antioxidant activity and physical and chemical stability of soy peptides during processing, the proposed research may lead to novel utilization of soybeans or soy proteins thereby stimulating the economy of the state. Results obtained from this study will be disseminated to the stakeholders through presentations at local, regional and national meetings and publication in technical and non-technical journals. The output of the research will be evaluated by the progress (annual) publications and presentations at meetings, the number of graduate students trained from the project, and patents (if applicable) filed."

Production occurs under an extremely wide range of environmental and marketing conditions, ranging from the winter crop in southern in FL to the fall storage crops of ME, NY, and PA. This range creates diverse variety needs. Fresh market production remains a significant part of the eastern industry (e.g. 15% of ME's crop in 2003 and 60% of PA's 2000 crop); however, almost 34 percent of all potato U.S. chip plants are located in the eastern U.S., and they account for 38 percent of production (NPC Potato Statistical Yearbook, 1999). Processing, primarily for French fries, is expanding in ME and accounted for 62% of utilization during 2003. ME and NY maintain high quality seed potato industries which service the East's seed potato markets. Research aiding the eastern potato industry impacts markets associated with over half of the U.S. population. Quality requirements are rigorous and many existing varieties are deficient in one or more necessary characteristics. Improved varieties need to be developed, evaluated and released to meet the diverse needs of growers and their markets. Improved pest resistance will reduce the need for pesticides and reduce agriculture's impact on the environment.

Possible reasons include (1) an anti-obesity campaign that targets oils used to cook frozen fries in quick service restaurants and (2) rapid growth of fast-casual restaurants and sandwich shops that do not serve fries. Demand for fresh potatoes has also been declining. Market analysts suggest that consumers view fresh potatoes as healthy, but are substituting foods that are more convenient to prepare. Health concerns lead some consumers to purchase organic potatoes. They have been willing to pay higher prices for potatoes grown without pesticides and chemical fertilizer. Organic potato producers have been selling for higher-than-conventional prices, but production costs are also higher. Planting certified seed potatoes is a recommended practice to control many potato pests, but organic seed potatoes have been scarce due partly to the difficulty of meeting certification standards. Since it takes three years to transition from conventional to organic, growers are reluctant to make investments to produce organic seed potatoes without an understanding of long-term demand for organics. Biotechnology is another force that impacts potato markets. Anti-biotechnology activists shut down the market for genetically-modified (GM) potatoes in the 1990s. Monsanto, the main GM potato player, abandoned the product but researchers continue to use GM technology to develop new potato varieties. Some of these varieties have been tested in developing countries where GM regulations and approval are in early stages. If GM potatoes become accepted in developing countries, they may then become accepted in the US, Europe and other developed countries. The U.S potato industry has recently been dealing with a new pest - Zebra Chip (ZC) - which causes serious quality problems in chip and frozen potato processing. Industry experts have suggested that infestations of ZC could affect up to 40% of potato acreage in some regions. The impact of ZC losses not only jeopardizes the financial viability of potato growers but has a rippling effect throughout the rest of the potato industry and regional economies. A better understanding of these four categories of market forces would enable people in the potato industry to make better-informed decisions. The project leader has a network of industry contacts, and writes a column for a potato industry trade magazine. He intends to disseminate results of this project at industry meetings, in the trade press and in academic journals."

The drop in Russet Burbank acreage has been accompanied by an increase in the production of new varieties such as Ranger Russet, Russet Norkotah and Umatilla Russet. One of the driving forces behind this trend is the need for producers in this region to improve production efficiency to remain competitive. The need for more rapid adoption of new potato varieties has recently been heightened due to public debate about sustainability in agriculture, nutritional issues relating to human health, and climate change. As the most widely planted vegetable crop, potatoes have taken a center role in these debates. Potato producers in Idaho and other states already strive to optimize applications of inputs, but Russet Burbank is relatively input intensive due to low resistance to disease and environmental stress. One of the best ways to meet consumer demands for more sustainable potato production practices is through adoption of new potato varieties with increased pest and stress resistance. The Northwest Potato Variety Development Program has released more than 15 new varieties in the past 10 years, many with the ability to produce higher yields and quality than traditional varieties with fewer inputs. Efforts are currently underway to increase the nutrient content of potatoes through breeding and biotechnology. Increasing the nutritive value of potatoes by itself does not guarantee that consumers will choose to purchase new cultivars with these attributes. Skin quality has been shown to be the major factor in consumer acceptance of specialty potato cultivars. Skin color and brightness are key attributes that draw consumers to these novel potatoes. Enhancing skin color may also improve nutrient content as the skin is a primary location for many phytonutrients. Potatoes have become an important source of food in developing countries, especially in tropical regions. It has been estimated that climate change will increase average global temperatures by up to 5.8oC over the next 100 years. This will lead to a shift in production towards higher latitudes and an increase in the need for heat and water stress tolerant varieties. The potato production region in southwest Idaho provides a good location to select for stress tolerance due to the relatively mild winters and long, hot summers. This project will evaluate new potato cultivars for adaptability to southwest Idaho and develop management information to help growers more effectively adopt new cultivars."

Improvement of markers will attempt to modify existing protocols to increase efficiency and lower cost and in some cases identify alternative markers that might be more suitable. This process also includes testing of new protocols to improve functionality. One goal is to identify molecular markers that can take advantage of the polyploidy nature of potato and wheat. New technologies will be evaluated and utilized to increase the functionality of existing and new markers. Molecular markers can be used for many purposes and will be developed with these uses in mind. Markers can aid in the identification of plants with a particular gene of interest, and also identify plants with more than one gene. They also increase our understanding of complex traits.

S.",,,75746271.0,UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,MOSCOW,ID,83844-0001,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2010,,,"Since 1999, growers in eastern Idaho have experienced significant losses due to storage rots, such as pink rot and Pythium. In 2006, the number of reports of problems in the Magic and Treasure Valley's increased and in 2007 and 2008, many growers experienced an increase in the amount of pink rot and Pythium coming out of the field. In 2008 and 2009, many growers also reported increased problems with lack of control of early blight using traditionally effective fungicides. The majority of these increases in disease problems may be due to the emergence of new fungicide resistant fungal pathogens. In recent years it has been reported that most of the pink rot problems in eastern Idaho have been caused by pathogen isolates that are resistant to mefenoxam (Ridomil Gold) and increased applications of Ridomil Gold have proven ineffective in controlling the disease. Mefenoxam resistant strains of Pythium leak have also been found in Idaho in the past several growing seasons. Like pink rot, Ridomil Gold has been the main fungicide used for the control of Pythium leak in Idaho. In 2006 and 2008, Pythium was responsible for significant storage losses. With the development of mefenoxam resistance in Idaho, Pythium leak could become a much more severe problem in the field and storage. In 2008 and 2009, many Idaho growers reported the failure of the traditionally effective strobilurin fungicides (e.g. Headline and Quadris) to control early blight. This may also be due to the development of fungicide resistant isolates of Alternaria solani (the early blight pathogen). Fungicide resistant isolates of A. solani have been reported in Idaho and are common in other potato growing regions (e.g. Wisconsin). However, these problems may also be due to misdiagnosis of early blight. Brown leaf spot, caused by A. alternata is also a common disease of potato in Idaho and is often confused with early blight as its symptoms are very similar. The pathogens causing these two diseases are also closely related. However, unlike the early blight fungus (A. solani) the brown leaf spot pathogen (A. alternata) is inherently more resistant to strobilurins and has never been well controlled by this class of fungicides. Due to the similarity of these two pathogens and their disease symptoms it may be possible that growers are confusing brown leaf spot for early blight and thus reporting poor disease control of early blight. The objective of this study are to take a holistic approach to management of pre- and postharvest diseases in Idaho. Firstly, fungicide resistance surveys will be carried out to assess the extent of fungicide resistance in the pathogen populations of Pythium and early blight. Secondly, field and storage trials will be carried out to determine the best fungicides and management practices for the control of these pathogens. Thirdly, the information generated by this research will be used to produce new extension bulletins to help growers make proper and timely diagnoses of these diseases. With the emergence of new fungicide resistant fungal pathogens, proper and timely diagnosis of diseases is paramount to effective crop health management."

Their feeding damage injures plant leaves, roots, stems, flowers, and fruits, thus limiting marketable crop yield and reducing economic gains. Indiana potato growers, for example, consistently rank insects such as Colorado potato beetle as the primary factor affecting crop growth, compared with weeds, pathogens, and other potential pests. Managing insect outbreaks has historically entailed widespread and frequent application of chemical insecticides on cropland, an approach that is generally effective but comes with an array of environmental, social, and human health costs. While insecticides remain at the forefront of insect pest management tactics currently employed in U.S. agriculture, calls for more judicious use of chemicals and development of alternative, biologically-based control strategies are ever-increasing. This demand is reflected in the adoption and growth of integrated pest management (IPM), the passage of new legislature restricting pesticide use (e.g., 1996 Food Quality Protection Act, the phase out of methyl bromide), and the explosion of the organic food movement over the past two decades. More recently, the demand for local foods has erupted in popularity, in large part because of food safety concerns among consumers. Two of the most effective means of  natural  pest control are: (1) facilitating the action of natural enemies (i.e., predators, parasites, and pathogens) of pests; and (2) exploiting innate plant defenses that repel, poison, or otherwise deter pests. Naturally enemies are considered beneficial insects, such as ladybugs that kill and eat aphids, and it is estimated that these predators contribute $4.5 billion annually in pest suppression services in the U.S. alone. Despite the magnitude of this staggering value, enemy impact on pest abundance is highly variable and in many cases pests escape from control. Similarly, plants vary enormously in their inherent susceptibility to pest damage and it is unclear which plant traits contribute to this variation. Thus, we continually struggle with how to enhance the efficacy of predators and plant defenses on herbivorous insects in agriculture. This project aims to improve upon our knowledge in this realm by studying the ecology of natural enemies, plant defenses, and their interaction. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to establish multipronged strategies that squeeze pests between what they eat (plants) and what eats them (predators), resulting in effective, safe, and ecologically-minded pest management systems."

Among them, hemipterans are responsible for transmitting 55% of vectored viruses. Often, the vector insect is also a plant pest causing yield damage. In many cases, the only strategy available to control the spread of the disease is the avoidance of vector populations by the use of insecticides. This strategy poses problems such as the risk of development of resistance in insect populations, the pollution generated by pesticides and the cost associated with their use. Novel economically and environmentally friendly control strategies are possible but their development needs a deep understanding of the biology of the vector and the relationship between the plant pathogen and its vector. To develop these strategies the vector components involved in pathogen transmission, the effect of the pathogen on the vector fitness and biology or the route used by the pathogen through the vector need to be known. The development of these new strategies will result in the reduction of the use of pesticides with consequences on the environment, on farmers' economy and farmers' quality of life. These new strategies will contribute in the long term to the control of the spread of plant diseases; however, in the meantime adapted approaches to control the vector populations can be developed. We propose to aid in the development of these new adapted control strategies in vector insects causing damages to crops. Specifically, we will concentrate our initial efforts studying potato psyllids (Bactericera cockerelli) and greenbugs (Schizaphis graminum). The potato psyllid is responsible for the transmission of the causative agent of Zebra Chip, a disease affecting solanaceous. Plants infected with the causative agent of Zebra Chip show reduced yield and/or unmarketable potatoes. Questions as basic as the pathway of the pathogen within the vector body remain unanswered. In the mean time, this disease is costing millions of dollars annually. Similarly, the greenbug aphid is a severe cereal pest damaging crops worldwide. The annual cost this pest generates in crop losses and chemical control is estimated to be $250 million for wheat farmers and $125 million for sorghum farmers. Greenbugs are responsible for the transmission of several viruses, among them members of the Luteoviridae family causing Barley yellow disease. Arthropod-resistant plant cultivars exist but new aphid biotypes capable of overcoming plant resistance threatens their use. The research on the transmission of luteovirids by aphids has advanced rapidly these last years however, the involvement of any aphid proteins in virus transmission has not been identified yet. Today, genomic databases for different hemipterans exist or are being created. The use of these databases will prove essential tools for the development of new control strategies and improved diagnostic abilities. We propose to use genomic tools to identify competence factors in the two previously described systems: potato psyllid- Candidatus liberibacter and greenbug- luteovirids."

Emerging evidence suggests that diet plays an important role in pathophysiology of childhood obesity. Functional foods with putative anti-obesity properties marketed today are expensive, thus, it is imperative to develop evidence-based functional foods that are affordable to low income consumers susceptible to obesity. The potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the world's 3rd-largest food crop and the leading vegetable crop in the United States, with per capita consumption of about 126 lbs annually. In recent years, demand for specialty potatoes has risen sharply in developed countries and the United States, in particular. Due to their health benefiting properties, specialty and/or colored potatoes represent one mechanism for enhancing human nutrition through popular and palatable means. Colored potatoes are rich in anti-oxidant and anti-obesity bioactive plant compounds, such as carotenoids, and anthocyanins. However, potatoes are stored and processed before consumption and the effect of storage and processing on the health benefitting properties of specialty potatoes is not known. For producers and consumers to fully benefit from these properties, it is imperative to document the specific mechanisms of action of the protective foods and to understand the effects of post-harvest storage and processing methods on the biological activity of the functional compounds found in specialty potatoes. To address the above need for research, we propose to determine the effect of post-harvest treatments (fresh vs. stored potato) and processing methods (baking vs. frying) on the total phenolic and acrylamide content and antioxidant capacity. We will also determine the extent to which raw and processed potato carotenoids and anthocyanins differ in their alteration of Bacteroidetes-rich  lean microbiota  or Firmicutes-rich  obese microbiota  in the gut of obese pig. Obesity is associated with higher proportion Firmicutes, and lower proportion of Bacteroidetes, and reduced diversity. To answer these research questions we will utilize samples collected from pigs provided with high-fat diet for two months followed by high-fat diets containing either fresh, baked or fried potatoes for 6 weeks. Research findings will be communicated through a variety of mechanisms that results in greater technology and knowledge transfer to stakeholders including consumers, potato producers and processors."

Additionally, Michigan is 8th in the nation for the value of potato production. Potatoes in Michigan are grown on 39,000 acres and are worth over $100 million annually in sales (USDA - NASS, 2007; Michigan Potato Council). The large species diversity within vegetable crops provides opportunities and challenges for the vegetable entomology research and extension program. Some commodity groups represent high revenue or are specific to Michigan, while others are produced on few acres and have a smaller market share. Some of the dominant vegetable crops that have challenging insect pest management problems in Michigan are potatoes, asparagus, celery, carrots, and onions. Asparagus and celery represent two of the highest value per acre vegetable crops. Vegetables provide important sources of revenue and employment in environmentally-sensitive areas of the state increasingly under pressure from urbanization. All of Michigan?s vegetable crops can suffer direct yield loss and product contamination from insect pests that feed on above and below ground portions of the plant. The consumer?s demand for quality and an intolerance of insect contamination in food has driven the setting of zero or low tolerances for key vegetable insect pests. At the same time as growers strive to reach these stringent demands for quality, increasing legislative restrictions on insecticides are reducing their availability for vegetable growers, or more selective, less lethal ones are replacing traditional insecticides. These opposing forces are creating a situation where growers have fewer of the traditional tools for managing insect pests, but are still expected to produce an insect-free, healthy product. A cornerstone of integrated pest management is the application of insecticides on a per need basis. This requires a close and accurate watch for pest abundances, which can be facilitated by the development of appropriate baits, traps, or degree-day models. Our aim is to discover and develop baits, which can increase the efficacy of population monitoring. Another area of concern is insecticide resistance, especially as it pertains to Colorado potato beetle. Ecosystem services, such as the one accrued from biological control agents can be an effective part of pest management with correct incorporation into a strategy. Habitat diversification and biological control are two strategies used in integrated pest management that need further research to make them a valued and respected part of a grower?s pest management tool box. This project aims to develop and deliver Integrated Pest Management strategies for insects in Michigan vegetable crops, based on a combination of chemical, molecular, behavioral, and ecological approaches."

This is arguably the most significant pathogen of the world's largest non-cereal crop, potato, and a noteworthy tomato pest. While several fungicides exist that are effective against the disease, their use is expensive and thus reduces the profitability of potato and tomato production. The chemicals also have potential adverse environmental effects, and are not a viable option for many types of growers including organic and low-input producers. Moreover, the appearance of fungicide-insensitive strains, failures in once-promising plant resistance genes, and public concerns about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) suggest that there may not be one  silver bullet  against the late blight disease. An integrated plan of research, education, and extension will therefore be pursued to battle late blight. This includes developing diagnostic tools, improved resistant plants through breeding and biotechnology, and systems to provide improved management guidelines to growers that embrace innovative extension education and communication strategies. Several of the approaches are related to an understanding that variability within pathogen populations is a key factor in disease control failures in past epidemics. Therefore, pathogens will be isolated from regions of late blight outbreaks, and their characteristics such as fungicide sensitivity, aggressiveness, and ability to be avoid plant defense responses will be assessed. Information about the location and traits of the pathogen, and overall disease risk, will then be provided to growers to allow them to purse the best disease mitigation method. The delivery of this information will be scientifically optimized based on the needs and characteristics of diverse groups (such organic and conventional growers) and transmitted using several technologies including a national late blight web site. The project will also breed tomato cultivars with improved resistance to P. INFESTANS and identify new sources of resistance in potato. Since biotechnology may also have a role to play in battling late blight, several promising methods for enhancing plant defenses through genetic engineering will also be studied, and investigations of consumer attitudes towards genetically engineered potato and tomato will be carried out. Another dimension of the project is the sponsorship of summer undergraduate projects, which will help attract future plant pathologists to the field. In summary, the project will reduce on-farm costs, reduce fungicide use, ensure the sustainable long-term control of late blight, and contribute to global food security."

Among the genetic improvements needed are better fresh market and processing quality, resistance to major environmental stresses, insect pests and diseases, more efficient utilization of water and nutrients, improved storability, and lowered production costs. The purpose of this research is to release and commercialize new potato varieties that will directly benefit all segments of the Northwest potato industry and indirectly benefit all US producing regions. The strategy is to identify traits, make crosses, and apply selection pressures that will increase the probability of developing varieties that can be produced and utilized more efficiently than existing varieties. Appropriate breeding goals include high yield, improved processing quality, genetic resistance to major pests and diseases, higher levels of resistance to stresses, increased nutrient use efficiency, improved human nutritional value, and high tuber quality. An additional environmental benefit comes with reduced use of pesticides, water, and fertilizers, which are normal byproducts of improved varieties. This major objective is accompanied by myriad minor objectives involving germplasm enhancement, germplasm production, selection procedures, disease and stress screening, variety trial design and conduct, seed increases, management studies, and commercial evaluations. Each objective is to be carried out by the Northwest institution(s) best equipped to complete the associated tasks. A heavy element of interdependence among all institutions is essential in achieving the outlined objectives. The impact of the Tri-State Potato Variety Development Program on the Northwest potato industry has been substantial. The fresh market industry, french fry processors and chippers have incorporated many varieties developed through the Tri-State variety development program into their businesses. Ranger Russet, Premier Russet, Western Russet, Umatilla Russet, and Alturas are examples of russet cultivars released from the Tri-State program that have greatly benefited the Northwest potato industry, being the 2nd, 4th, 5th 6th and 8th most widely grown cultivars in Idaho in 2009, respectively (NASS, Crop Production, November, 2009), and accounting for 23% of the planted acreage in Idaho in 2009. Ranger, Umatilla, Alturas, and Premier Russet were the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 7th most widely grown cultivars in WA in 2009, respectively, accounting for 37% of total acreage. In OR, these cultivars ranked 3rd, 8th, 5th, and 4th, respectively, and accounted for 35% of total acreage. Ranger Russet, Umatilla Russet, Alturas, Premier Russet, and Western Russet were also the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, and 11th most widely grown potato varieties in the United States in 2008, with Tri-State varieties representing about 20% of the fall crop nationally."

These techniques will ultimately be incorporated into potato production systems. Outreach and education targeted specifically at biologically based IPM and ecosystem production methods are essential to promote adoption by growers. In Wisconsin we have developed the foundation for biointensive IPM education. We are now proposing to continue the educational efforts which will enable growers to integrate biointensive IPM strategies into existing production systems. The overall momentum of the Collaboration has been extremely strong with many accomplishments such as the continuation of the marketing effort, enhancements of the Collaboration standards, improvements of resistance management protocols, database implementation, grant coordination and expansion of the development and use of educational tools for growers. We have worked with numerous faculty, industry representatives, potato and other commodity organizations, and environmental organizations to export this agricultural model for targeted and industry-wide change. In Wisconsin, this work is expanding to other vegetable crops, such as carrots, peppers, beans and peas, and is now also expanding to fruit crops. Furthermore, we have enhanced the ecological portions of the Collaboration by working with national and local environmental organizations and expanding our research with University of Wisconsin faculty by involving their expertise, research and education into the project. We need to maintain this strength while exporting the model of industry-wide agricultural changes through the use of policy and communication efforts. The success of the adoption of biointensive IPM programs by growers will be measured utilizing the measurement system previously developed by the Collaboration. At the conclusion of this project we expect to have completed detailed performance evaluations for a range of reduced-risk pest management alternatives. We will use this information in the educational activities and materials to provide growers with detailed efficacy and economic analysis of various alternatives which can be used by individual growers to refine their pest management practices to more biologically based, less toxic practices. The marketplace rewards which have been generated through the eco-labeling project in Wisconsin have also created a favorable climate for our biointensive IPM strategies to be adopted throughout the region. We are confident that growers see the potential for value-added marketing as a mechanism to offset declining commodity returns in traditional markets. The WWF/WPVGA/UW Collaboration will continue its outreach, stakeholder participation, and national policy efforts to increase dialogue on using market-based incentives to advance growers' use of biointensive IPM and reduce reliance on high-risk pesticides."

The US Potato Board, through the National Eating Trends Report (2010), revealed that over the past ten years, though the consumption of traditional potatoes declined, specialty/colored potato consumption increased by 17%, possibly due to their putative health benefits. Colored potatoes are rich in anti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory bioactive plant compounds. However, potatoes also contain glycoalkaloids (GA), which serve a protective function in plants but are toxic to humans and can be toxic when consumed in high amounts. Though the commercial potato varieties cultivated in the US contain less than the stipulated safe limit of 20 mg GA/100 g potato (&#8804; 10 mg GA/100 g in Europe), certain post-harvest storage and processing methods tend to increase the GA content well above the regulated safe limit. Thus, it is important to determine the effect of GA individually and together with acrylamide, a reproductive toxin formed during processing, on genotoxicity and male reproductive toxicity. To answer this we will be collecting samples from pigs consuming white and purple potatoes as part of ongoing USDA NRI-funded project. White and purple fleshed potato clones (five each) subjected to different storage temperatures and baking temperatures will be assessed for toxins (GA) and health benefiting bioactive compounds (phenolic acids and anthocyanins) to identify an appropriate storage-cum-processing strategy to minimize toxicants and retain bioactive compounds. Research findings will be communicated through a variety of mechanisms that results in greater technology and knowledge transfer to stakeholders including potato consumers, producers and processors."

This information will identify sources of tarnished plant bugs that may lead to alternative control measures prior to infestations into cotton fields. Tarnished plant bug populations will be monitored for resistance to various classes of insecticides commonly used by mid-South producers. This will provide real-time information to decision makers that will allow them to adjust their control recommendations based on the type of resistance that is found in their area of the mid-South.

This research aims to understand and interpret the genetics of functional adaptive biodiversity by integrating analyses at multiple levels of functional trait variation (DNA sequence, gene expression, phenotypes) with data on the environmental, ecological, and evolutionary history of an entire clade of species: Solanum section Lycopersicum (the wild tomatoes). The project focuses on two traits critical to plant-environment interactions: leaf ecophysiology (which influences plant responses to water, light, and carbon dioxide), and constitutive and induced defense responses (which influence the interaction between plants and their natural predators). Both traits differ within and among Solanum species, likely as the result of rapid adaptive change. Using 'next generation' sequencing technologies to quantify DNA sequence and gene expression differences among genotypes and environmental conditions, the project has three components: 1) Comparative transcriptomics (i.e., gene expression profiling) which will provide a evolutionary genomics framework for understanding genetic variation in the group, and identify candidate genes for important ecological transitions among species; 2) Experimental transcriptomics of gene expression responses to both benign (unstressed; noninduced) and stressed (drought-stressed; induced defense) conditions, which will identify molecular responses to ecologically-relevant environments, and evaluate the genetic constraints on current and future evolutionary responses critical to organism-environment interactions; and 3) Integration of results from this study with existing data to generate a core set of loci underpinning functional responses to abiotic and biotic environmental variation, and to develop an integrated understanding of natural adaptive trait variation across an entire group of species. Global environmental change is expected to fundamentally alter patterns of biodiversity, but predicting the direction and magnitude of this change is extremely difficult. This research aims to understand how current biodiversity is shaped by, and reacts to, environmental variation. The sequence and trait data uncovered will contribute to understanding how plants are able to respond to and cope with stress imposed by both their physical environment and by their predators. The project will also contribute to human resources by training researchers in a broad set of skills at the interface of experimental genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics. This research focuses on the wild tomatoes, a diverse group of Andean species within the economically important genus Solanum. Uncovering the genetic basis of diversification is particularly pertinent in the Andean biological hotspot, where the impacts of land-use and climate change threaten a cradle of biodiversity that holds an estimated 12% of global flowering plant diversity. In addition, by examining the wild relatives of several important crop species, including tomato, potato, and pepper, this research has the potential to identify valuable natural variation that confers plant tolerance to critical environmental stresses."

Improving these crops through breeding is extremely challenging, because they have a long generation time and lack pure inbreds that yield consistent traits. The ability to produce doubled haploid plants containing only one set of parental chromosomes could revolutionize breeding in slow cycling crops such as banana and cassava. However, there are no methods available for doubled haploid production in these crops. A novel strategy for producing haploids was recently developed in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The strategy is based on mutations in centromeric proteins that are required for accurate inheritance during cell division. When Arabidopsis plants containing a defective centromere protein (CENH3) are crossed to wild type or normal plants, chromosomes from the mutant are eliminated to give haploids with only chromosomes from the wild type parent. The goal of this project is to develop this novel centromere engineering technology for doubled haploid production in cassava and banana. To accomplish this, haploid cassava and banana will be created by down-regulating the expression of CENH3 and expressing an altered transgenic protein in its place. Transgenic plants expressing altered CENH3 proteins will be crossed to wild type, and progeny will be screened for haploid individuals. Haploid plants will be characterized using genomics approaches and converted into fertile diploids for breeding. Radical improvements in cassava and banana breeding have the potential to increase food security and economic well-being for smallholder farmers. The doubled haploid production approach to be developed in this study could potentially transform banana and cassava breeding and facilitate rational improvement of these vital crops. Homozygous plants resulting from this technology can accelerate introgression of favorable traits, and development of vigorous hybrids. Results of this project will establish the feasibility of this technology for other slow-cycling food security crops such as sweet potato and yam.  This project will also provide unique training opportunities for researchers and students from Colombia, Uganda, and the US. Research capacity in Colombia and Uganda will be strengthened by training researchers from CIAT and IITA in genomics and cytogenetic techniques, and providing opportunities for career development, including presentations at scientific and group meetings and mentoring of undergraduate students. Participation of students from underrepresented groups will be promoted by drawing from an NIH-funded MARC program and the minority-rich Biology Undergraduate Scholars Program at UC Davis. Educational outreach will be extended to Colombian and Ugandan sites by holding yearly meetings at which PIs will present general interest lectures on plant breeding. Results and a description of available sequences, reagents and germplasm will be described in a project website (to be constructed; accessible via http://biosci3.ucdavis.edu/FacultyAndResearch/FacultyProfile.aspx?FacultyID=182), and further disseminated through plant research conferences, publications, and outreach to cassava and banana breeders through existing CIAT and IITA programs.

BéninSweet potato is among the most important food crops in the world and an extremely important food crop for subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is grown throughout the African continent and currently around 34.5% of global sweet potato area is in Africa. One major limitation in sweet potato production is cultivar decline, mostly due to the cumulative effect of virus infection on this vegetatively propagated crop. Thus, viral diseases are considered a major limiting factor in sweet potato production worldwide, and particularly in SSA. The objective of this project is to evaluate a novel approach, deep sequencing of small RNAs from field-grown sweet potato samples collected throughout Africa, to systematically and efficiently identify known and novel virus genome sequences. A total of around 1750 geo-referenced field-grown samples of sweet potato will be collected from more than ten countries in Africa. Small RNA populations of these samples will be prepared and sequenced using high throughput next-generation sequencing technology, and then assembled to identify known and novel sweet potatoviruses.Broader Impacts: Food security remains a huge challenge for millions of Africans, particularly for those in sub-Saharan regions, who depend on agriculture for their subsistence. Emerging and reemerging pathogens, including many viruses, continue to cause devastating losses of food production in Africa. Current knowledge of crop viruses in Africa is limited and sporadic at best. Novel virus genome identification technology through deep sequencing of small RNA population is potentially applicable to continental surveys as its efficiency in virus identification has been proven with both greenhouse and field grown samples. This technology can then be applied to systematically determine the total virus genome sequences (virome) on a number of other major crop plants in Africa such as maize, rice, tomato, bean, and cassava. Public availability of such information will provide the scientific community and government unprecedented possibilities to understand crop virus distribution in Africa, guide phytosanitary requirements, predict risks of future epidemics, and suggest regional disease management strategies. Data generated under this project will be disseminated through the project website (accessible via http://bti.cornell.edu/ZhangjunFei.php) and raw and processed small RNA sequences will also be available through EBI Sequence Read Archive and NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, respectively. Novel virus genome sequences will be deposited into GenBank."

This project will develop mathematical models that incorporate interactions between speciation, extinction, and changes in the traits of species. These models will be implemented in software and applied to the evolution of geographic ranges and plant mating systems, using empirical data from extant species. They will enable tests of fundamental macroevolutionary questions such as: How is trait evolution partitioned between changes within single lineages versus changes during speciation?  How are rates of speciation and extinction determined by diversity, or by the joint effects of many interacting traits?The theoretical advances from this project are useful not only for its immediate study systems (including the nightshade family Solanaceae, which contains such agriculturally important species as potato, tomato, and tobacco), but also for applications to similar questions in many other plant and animal groups.  Developing these more powerful analyses, and training young researchers in computational evolution, will help maximize the scientific gains from ongoing efforts to assemble the tree of life.  The software developed will be freely available and well-supported, facilitating further empirical analyses and consequent collaborations."

Understanding the spread of weeds therefore requires studying how these responses, called  induced defenses , may evolve.  While many invasive weeds live for many years and can reproduce asexually through underground stems, previous studies of defense evolution have only measured sexual reproduction (seed set) over one year.  This project examines the evolution of induced defenses in the weed Solanum carolinense by using genetic analysis to measure both sexual and asexual reproduction.  Sexual reproduction and defenses have already been measured in an ongoing field experiment over one year; re-sprouts from this experiment will be identified using microsatellite DNA analysis to quantify reproduction in a second year.  The relationship between defenses and combined reproduction will indicate how induced defenses are expected to evolve in natural populations.This project will address how herbivores affect the evolution and asexual spread of a noxious weed that is also a host for several economically important insect pests, including the Colorado potato beetle.  Better understanding of how weeds succeed is relevant to developing better management of weeds and invasive species. Additionally, this project will develop genetic markers for future studies and provide undergraduate research training."

This project addresses the role of noncoding RNA structural motifs for trafficking in host adaptation. It tests the hypothesis that (i) an infectious RNA can rapidly evolve new three-dimensional (3D) motifs for trafficking as a means of host adaptation, and (ii) different infectious RNAs can evolve distinct trafficking motifs for adaptation to the same host. This hypothesis was developed from the following observations. First, when a particular motif, called loop 19, of Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) was obliterated to abolish trafficking (but not replication) in the experimental host plant Nicotiana benthamiana, a new loop (loop 19*) evolved to restore trafficking. Second, some viroids, such as Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), differ significantly in sequences from PSTVd but also can infect N. benthamiana systemically. To test this hypothesis, the following experiments will be performed: 1) to elucidate the 3D structure of loop 19 and determine whether loop 19* is similarly structured, 2) to determine the cellular boundary at which loop 19 and loop 19* function, and 3) to perform a genome-wide mutational identification of HSVd trafficking motifs and compare them with the PSTVd motifs that have already been identified for similarities and differences.This project will contribute new knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of infectious RNAs and broadly the unifying and unique principles controlling the systemic trafficking of different RNAs. New research tools and experimental systems developed may also help transform research on the general principles of RNA structure-function relationships. This project will train undergraduate/graduate students in developing cutting-edge cross-disciplinary approaches to study fundamental biological problems, and help enhance science education for elementary/middle/high school students, including traditionally underrepresented groups."

Both inbreeding and herbivory reduce the growth and reproduction of plants but the effects of inbreeding on plant resistance to herbivores is largely unexplored. The proposed studies will use horsenettle plants to examine differences between inbred and outbred plants in the expression of anti-herbivore genes (using microarrays), the induction of key plant defensive chemicals (using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry) that help to protect the plants from herbivores, and the impact of these defensive chemicals on the feeding behavior of herbivores and their natural enemies (predatory insects). Horsenettle is a close relative of crop species such as tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, and peppers and it shares many of the same insect herbivores as these crops. Horsenettle, however, is a widespread invasive weed that is a problem in 43 states. It is an important weed in agricultural fields and it harbors pests and diseases that reduce the yield of these crop species. In addition to producing a complete study of the effects of inbreeding on plant resistance, the proposed research will produce critical information on the colonization and establishment stages of the life cycle of this important weed; provide insight into potential biocontrol agents of horsenettle; and elucidate the potential roles of chemical defenses in the development of sustainable management strategies informed by a sophisticated understanding of underlying genetic and chemical mechanisms."

Anthony Ranere, Ruth Dickau and an international team of researchers will conduct archaeological and paleoecological fieldwork over a two year period in the Middle Cauca River Valley of Colombia. The project brings together researchers and students from institutions in the United States, Great Britain and Colombia with expertise in archaeology, paleoethnobotany, paleoecology and geology. The research seeks to document the initial appearance of cultivation in the subsistence strategies of populations in the Middle Cauca River Valley and to identify the plant species that were either domesticated in this region or imported from elsewhere in South America or Central America. Research to date has demonstrated that species from Mexico to Brazil came under domestication early in the Holocene (ca. 9,000-10,000 years ago) and became widely dispersed over the next two or three millennia. A number of crops appear to have been domesticated in the seasonal tropical forests of northern South America, including arrowroot, sweet potato, leren, achira and possibly cocoyam, as well as a variety of squash. The Middle Cauca River Valley of Colombia is an especially promising region for examining the early cultivation, domestication and dispersal of plant species because of the numerous sites identified here with early Holocene deposits containing both microfossil remains and artifactual evidence for plant cultivation.The project will focus on the recovery of plant remains from tools and sediments in archaeological sites already identified and tested by project personnel. Additionally, a site survey and testing program will be carried out aimed at locating sites that would extend the occupational history of the region back into the Late Pleistocene. Vegetational history will be established through an analysis of pollen and phytolith sequences paying particular attention to disturbance indicators reflecting cultivation activities. The identification of specific taxa utilized will rely primarily on analysis of starch grains and phytoliths, and secondarily on plant macrofossils and pollen. In order to confidently distinguish starch grains and phytoliths produced by domesticated species from those produced by their wild progenitors and relatives, botanical collecting of both domesticated and wild taxa will be undertaken to establish comprehensive reference collections for the study region.The domestication of plants - and the subsequent development of agricultural economies - constitutes one of the most transformative episodes in human history. The intellectual merit of the project is the contribution it will make to our understanding of when, where and under what circumstances the critical change from gathering to cultivating plants first came about in tropical America. The broader impact of the project includes providing students from several academic institutions with the opportunity to participate in both field and laboratory aspects of the research, thereby contributing to their training as future professionals. In addition, the comparative reference collections of starch grains and phytoliths will be made available on the web for use by other researchers studying the ancient use of plants in the American tropics. A GIS database with project generated data will also be put on the web."

PLRV-infected seed results in stunted and weak plants having dramatic reductions in tuber yield and quality. Plants infected with PLRV during the growing season can produce tubers displaying tuber net necrosis, ranging from a slight reduction in crop value to complete loss due to unacceptable processing quality. Control of tuber net necrosis in commercial production and PLRV infection of seed tubers requires intensive use of insecticides to control aphids that vector PLRV, due to PLRV susceptibility of the most widely grown potato varieties. Field resistance to PLRV from Solanum etuberosum has been mapped to a single gene, Rlretb, on potato chromosome 4. This research proposes to begin characterize the chromosome region surrounding Rlretb. Application of aphid and graft inoculations to fourth generation progenies will help elucidate the mechanisms of resistance to PLRV with respect to virus multiplication, accumulation, and movement. Molecular markers closely linked to Rlretb will be analyzed with the compiled PLRV resistance mechanism data to define how this natural host resistance gene functions in the field. Incorporation of Rlretb into commercially-acceptable varieties would reduce insecticide applications, promoting more sustainable production with reduced costs for potato growers. Results will also provide insight into S. etuberosum genome structure and organization relative to S. tuberosum and S. phureja, and potentially identify a PLRV resistance gene useful for the development of intragenic/cisgenic potatoes."

In addition to the direct damage that is caused by removing nutrients from the plant, phloem-feeding insects also transmit a large number of agriculturally relevant plant viruses and other pathogens. The increasing incidence of resistance to insecticides, as well as the current lack of transgenic approaches that target phloem-feeding insects, makes it imperative to develop new control strategies. A particular problem for phloem-feeding insects is that the phloem of most plants has very high sugar content. Although sugar is an essential energy source for the insects, too much dietary sugar results in the passage of water from the insect body to the gut, dehydration of the insect, and eventual death. To counter this problem, phloem feeding insects have developed several strategies that reduce the effective sugar content of the diet and/ or prevent movement of water into the gut. Genes that are required for this regulation of sugar metabolism are the target of new transgenic approaches that are being developed. Specifically, plants will be engineered such that they can silence the expression of genes that insects need to maintain their water balance. Phloem-feeding insects that consume these transgenic plants will shrivel and die over the course of one to three days. Three important agricultural pests, the peach-potato aphid, whitefly, and potato psyllid, will be targeted using genetically engineered plants. Experiments with two model plant species, Arabidopsis and tobacco, will set the stage for using similar transgenic approaches for controlling these phloem-feeding insects in crop plants."

A 2004 survey of family cooking habits found that 94 percent of kids can access the internet, 54 percent can program a VCR and 51 can download music from the internet, but only 45 percent can make a baked potato, 42 percent can cook a spaghetti dinner and almost 60 percent do not know that there are three teaspoons in a tablespoon (Toots, 2006). Other research has shown the foods that parents eat are an important influencing factor on what their children eat (Cooke, 2004). Focus groups were held with low-income White, Latino and African American and showed that  eating nutritiously is viewed as hard work  (Brown & Marczak, 2008). In a pilot study of the Simply Good Cooking program, participants reported that they hoped to learn to cook  healthy  foods (43%) followed by wanting learn how to cook  new foods  (35%) and cook from scratch (10%) (Breen, 2011). The findings of these focus groups informed the development of the current project. The goal of Lets Cook! Minnesota is to increase the motivation of parents and other caregivers, who purchase food and prepare meals, to improve the quality of their family's dietary intake by preparing more nutritious home-cooked meals and thereby reduce obesity in their children. These objectives will help achieve this goal: The objectives are to: 1) improve low-income rural parents' cooking and shopping skills; and 2)develop a framework for rural communities that will inform their decision making to ensure improved outcomes and sustainability as they identify, implement and evaluate nutrition education programs. The Lets Cook! Minnesota project will be implemented in 2012 at 2 levels in 8 communities. For the individual, 2 cooking-based programs (Cooking MattersTM and Simply Good Cooking) will be provided to parents with responsibility for preparing meals for their minor children. Evaluative data from the two programs will be compared with a basic nutrition education program. At the community level, community building will occur to develop a network of entities concerned about health. For evaluation, key stakeholders will be interviewed and programs mapped to form a health resource network for communities. Expected results include individuals showing increased skills and confidence in one's ability to purchase healthy foods, plan and prepare healthy meals on a limited budget; increased consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains; and increased motivation to take responsibility to prepare healthy meals for their family. Rural communities will develop a community network of health programs and a framework for use in assessing and addressing health-related issues in rural communities.

Among these various policies, searching for feed-stocks other than corn, improving the ethanol production process, and increasing the productivity of primary feed-stocks are top priorities for US policy makers. To address the food-fuel controversy, the US government is looking at second-generation bio-ethanol feed-stocks with major emphasis on lignocellulosic and starch and sugar-rich biomasses as well as algae. Cassava (Manihot esculenta), also known as manioc is grown worldwide as a food source for billion of people and animal feed as well as various industrial applications. Cassava tubers are an excellent source of carbohydrates with 20-40% starch content. Cassava starch costs 15-30% less to produce per acre than corn starch making cassava an attractive and strategic source of renewable energy. Cassava grows in diverse environments, especially extremely harsh climate, and its starch is already being used for large-scale ethanol production in many countries. Despite cassava's excellent potential as a bio-fuel feedstock, a cost-effective biomass-to-ethanol process still needs to be developed to make cassava a sustainable alternative to corn. Conventionally, starch is processed using microbial enzymes. It is liquefied using &#945;-amylase and a de-branching enzyme, amylopullulanase, then saccharified with glucoamylase, before the sugars are used as feedstock for ethanol fermentation. Engineering cassava tubers to express hyperthermophilic starch-hydrolyzing enzymes would eliminate the need to add microbial enzymes in starch liquefaction and saccharification and will reduce the cost associated with starch breakdown into sugars, and increase ethanol yields. The aims of this project are (1) to engineer cassava plants to simultaneously express the genes for Pyrococcus furiosus (Pf) &#945;-amylase and amylopullulanase, and Sulfolobus solfataricus (Ss) glucoamylase in their roots, (2) to determine the extent to which the engineered flour can auto-hydrolyze, (3) to train a new generation of underrepresented minority students in bio-energy and gene technology, and (4) to increase capacity for transgenic technology and bio-energy research at Delaware State University (DSU). Depending on the outcome of this phase, future work will focus on increasing the activity of the complete Pf and Ss enzymatic starch degradation apparatus in cassava tubers, characterizing the best transgenic lines for starch composition and self-processing properties, and evaluate their field performance. Once this approach is validated in model cassava, it will be applied to high starch-yielding cassava cultivars and other starch-rich feedstock such as sweet potato as strategy to lower the corn demand for ethanol production. This project will strengthen our molecular bioscience and bio-energy research and teaching programs, create a substantial opportunity for the world's cassava farmers, strength the growing bio-fuel industry, and will provide a unique opportunity for DSU students to acquire various skills in molecular bioscience and bio-energy."

Handling methods and processing methods will be evaluated to determine factors responsible in an attempt to maximally recover a high quality food colorant that is all natural with demonstrated health benefits not obtained from synthetic colors. This research will benefit US farmers who can utilize 100% of their crop (ie. no culls due to size, shape, or defect) to guarantee maximum farm value, processors will be able to optimize pigment yield to produce a valuable natural food colorant, and consumers benefit from a healthy, natural colorant that improves the appearance and quality of their food supply."

A partnership has developed among experts from industry, government and academia that focuses their collective effort on addressing this single need. The transdisciplinary approach described in this proposal builds on and extends industry-funded variety evaluation initiatives and the USDA AFRI SolCAP project that is developing molecular breeding tools for potato. Objectives are structured so that research and extension specialists across the US work with commercial potato growers, processing companies and end-users to address system-wide challenges related to new variety development and adoption. Areas of emphasis include research in potato breeding and genetics to improve potato quality, appearance, texture and taste to processor and end user specifications; identifying potato varieties that will reduce health concerns related to acrylamide in the production and processing of potatoes; and economic analysis focused on improving production efficiency, and profitability for growers and processors over the long term. The unprecedented level of participation across regions, disciplines and businesses that occurred as this proposal was developed highlights the commitment of the entire potato industry to this project. This work will accelerate the adoption of improved potato varieties by the commercial sector and achieve the goals of reducing the acrylamide content of processed potato products in the near term and decreasing acrylamide content to as low as reasonably achievable in the future."

These aphids are not only plant feeders, but also frequently vectors of virus that negatively affect plant health. Of all the arthropod-born plant viruses known, a majority (nearly 60%) are transmitted by aphids, making aphids arguably the most significant virus-transmitting insect group in the world. In addition to the aphids that are troublesome in farmland settings, there are numerous species invasive on flowers, ornamentals shrubs, and trees. Fundamental to research and integrated pest management of aphids is accurate identification of species. Precise determination of aphid life forms has long challenged growers, fieldsmen, consultants, and researchers. This project will use molecular analysis in concert with traditional approaches to accurately characterize the aphid taxa of the region, delineate species boundaries, recognize cryptic species, detect invasives, and resolve pest complexes. As aphids feed, colonize, and build in numbers on crops and crop yields, crop quality, and grower profits are often lowered. One of the major crops in Washington invaded by aphids annually is potatoes. Washington potato production is valued at about $3.5 billion annually. Losses in potatoes associated with aphids in Washington are estimated at 5-10% annually, but can be much higher on individual farms. A key goal of this project is to reduce insecticide usage in potatoes without compromising performance. The project will also develop comprehensive keys to beneficially important aphid-attacking parasitoids. Presently, the lack of updated keys is a major limiting factor to advancing the use of these beneficials in regulating pest aphids in agricultural and other settings."

D.",,,555456995.0,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,LINCOLN,NE,68588,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2011,,,"Potato acreage in Nebraska has stabilized at about 20,000 acres, double that of 1992 (Pavlista, 2010). To achieve Nebraska's potential in potato yield and quality, problems for pest control and crop rotation need to be addressed. This project will emphasize evaluating plant growth regulators for potato production, irrigation and nitrogen management of potato grown under reduced water availability, pest management strategies, and rotational crops to allow for improved fit. Increasing commercial demands for cultural practices to improve potato production and to adapt to climatic change are an on-going need for research. Renewed emphasis on plant growth regulation is essential to maintain profitability under the current pricing environment (Pavlista and Feuz, 2005). Potatoes have been an economically important crop in Nebraska throughout this century and are currently grown in counties throughout the state (O'Keefe et al., 1998). The field production in 2008 was over 400,000 marketable tons with a reported gross value of over $80 million for the state (Pavlista, 2010). Production is triple that of 1988. Nebraska ranks the 10th major fall-producing state in potato production. Compared to the peak potato-acreage years during WW II, Nebraska's potato production has almost doubled on less than a third of the acres of 1940s. A five-fold yield increase per acre in six decades. Since 1980, production efficiency (yield/acre) has increased to 425 cwt/acre in 2008. Increases are occurring nationwide due to improved cultural practices. For Nebraska to maintain or increase its market share, research must keep up with new advances in agricultural technology especially with a changing climate and water availability. The official estimate of Nebraska's potato industry's gross sales is $82 million in 2008. Almost two thirds of the gross sales is returned directly to the local communities. The distribution of this income is payroll 25%, vehicle costs (maintenance, etc.) 14%, farm chemicals (fertilizers, pesticides, etc.) 13%, land costs (rental, etc.) 13%, capital equipment (storage sheds, conveyors, etc.) 10%, and miscellaneous (utilities, packing, taxes, etc.) 25%. Using the input-output multiplier of 2.5 for the state, over $100 million is funneled into Nebraska's economy by the potato industry. The Nebraska potato industry is an exporting industry. Of the $50 million gross sales, over $45 million dollars come from state export. Seven states are the major buyers of Nebraska's chipping potatoes; most of the table-stock potatoes are sold east of Nebraska and in the Southeastern part of the country. Nebraska seed is sold in most states of the country. Potatoes are an important industry in Nebraska bringing income from other states and contributing income to local economies. The potato industry provides diversity for Nebraska's economic base and needs continued support for further development."

The Minnesota apple industry, with about 475 farms producing over 15 million pounds of fruit on more than 3000 acres in 2007 (NASS, 2007), got an economic lead when the Honeycrisp variety was released in 1991. To help maintain that lead, novel and popular apple varieties need to be released in the future. The qualities of apple fruit that make them popular include juiciness, flavor (sweetness and/or acidity), and crispness. By understanding the physiology, biochemistry, and genetics leading to the improvement of any of these qualities, our work would help breeders develop new, popular, and economically important apple varieties in the future. Potatoes are a $20 million industry in Minnesota. In 2007, 427 farms harvested fresh market potatoes from 15,000 acres (NASS, 2007). Red potatoes make up approximately 15% of stored potatoes in the state. Enhancing and maintaining the redness of red potatoes to keep them economically viable is an expected outcome of this project."

Today, the Michigan potato industry (over $160 million farmgate value) is dominated by the chip processing sector that accounts for over 70% of the approximately 45,000 acres in production. The Michigan potato industry ranks as the largest northern supplier of potatoes to the chipping industry. Michigan is one of the few major potato producing states that are strategically located to ship potatoes to the East Coast market for potato chip processing. The ability to store and supply chip potatoes into June offers expanded market opportunities for the industry. At the same time the industry faces challenges regarding the public's awareness of acrylamide as a byproduct of the frying process. The increasing transportation costs are also offering opportunities for the fresh market. The tablestock market (especially russet types) is expanding with the changes in transportation costs. There also are opportunities for other fresh market classes due to consumer interest in premium fresh foods. New varieties are central to the health and growth of the Michigan potato industry. As a foundation for our potato breeding and genetics program, we are focusing on market limiting traits. In the processing sector, low sugar, high specific gravity, storability, mechanical bruise resistance and tuber shape are market limiting traits. The ability for varieties to have extended storage is also a challenge. These traits set a minimum standard from which advanced germplasm should be evaluated. Upon this foundation we must add traits that will provide host plant resistance and plant physiological efficiencies that improve environmental quality and provide enhanced consumer nutrition. Key resistance traits are for scab, late blight, potato virus Y (PVY), potato early die and Colorado potato beetle as well as drought resistance and lower acrylamide. New breeding strategies may provide exciting opportunities to create superior varieties. For example, genetically modified (GM) potatoes can contribute traits that are difficult to achieve through conventional breeding. The SolCAP project has developed a new set of genetic markers (8,300) called SNPs that are located in the genes. These markers can be linked to traits of interest such as dry matter content, low reducing sugars, bright skin, disease resistance, etc. and used for marker assisted breeding (MAB). The United States Potato Board (USPB) is supporting national early generation trials called the National Chip Processing Trial (NCPT) which will feed lines into the national Snack Food Association (SFA) trial."

Appropriate statistical analysis will be conducted to identify significant treatment effects. Other studies, especially those relating to rhizomania of sugar beet, will be more basic in focus and approach. These experiments and studies will attempt to identify factors that impact mutation and survival of a specific group of soilborne viruses.

Some species have wide host ranges such as the root pathogen P. cinnamomi which can infect over 3000 host species. Migrations of Phytophthora species in plant materials over large geographic areas have led to some of the most devastating epidemics known to mankind including late blight of potato which spread by migration of infected tubers from South America and sudden oak death (P. ramorum) which has moved repeatedly with the nursery plant trade between continents and across the US. In 2009, late blight epidemics in the eastern US were the worst in recent history due to movement of the pathogen in infected tomato transplants.

The European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis, accounts for over $1.85 billion in control costs and grain losses annually. In 2006, 88% of the fresh market sweet corn acreage was treated with one or more insecticide applications for a total of 605,000 lbs of insecticides applied. ECB also attacks many other crops, such as sorghum, small grains, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, and peppers. The southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella, causes about $1 million in damage in the Western High Plains (Morrison et al. 1977). Recently, the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis, has emerged as an important corn pest in the southern U.S. Other significant stalk-boring pests include the common stalk borer, Papaipema nebris, hop vine borer, Hydraecia immanis, and potato stem borer, Hydraecia micacea. Since 1950, previous committees have focused on ECB and other stalk-boring lepidopteran corn pests. In addition to stalk borers, we propose to address the other lepidopteran corn pests, which include those that feed on corn leaves and ears. This is a natural progression for the committee, as these pests are increasing in economic importance. Corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea, and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, consume corn leaves, tassels, silk and kernels. In the southeastern U.S., losses attributed to corn earworm in field corn range from 1.5-16.7%, and sweet corn losses can be as high as 50% (Wiseman 1999). Black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon, is the most damaging of the cutworm complex in the Corn Belt. Stand loss over 25% and yield losses of about 2,900 kg/ha are not unusual (Showers et al. 1983, Showers 1999). Western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta, increasingly is a pest of corn ears across the north central region. Outcomes or projected Impacts: -Cumulative benefits to Bt and non-Bt maize due to a suppressed European corn borer population during 13 growing seasons are conservatively estimated at more than $6.1 billion for a 5-state region, with cumulative benefits to non-Bt maize accounting for almost $3.9 billion of this total. -An improved program for monitoring for European corn borer resistance to Bt corn would help safeguard Bt technology for growers. -Blended seed refuge would increase grower productivity across the Corn Belt and reduce the likelihood that European corn borer would develop resistance to Bt corn. -Growers and consultants will have practical methods to monitor for western bean cutworm adults so they can initiate field scouting and avoid undue economic loss to either the pest itself or the increased mycotoxin contamination it might cause. -Online publication of outputs will expand clientele access to corn insect IPM decision support tools and increase implementation of IPM for corn lepidopteran pests."

We will use advanced statistical tests to identify impacts of natural enemies and weather on aphid populations based on the time series data collected starting in 1971 on the untreated potato plots at the University of Maine Aroostook Research Farm, Presque Isle, Maine. Natural enemy consumption of potato-colonizing aphids will be confirmed in laboratory trials. We will also evaluate compatibility of the biorational insecticides with aphid natural enemies in laboratory and field trials. Better understanding of the driving forces behind fluctuations in aphid populations is likely to improve our ability to manipulate their densities in commercial potato production.

However, in recent years, agricultural and food industries have become more concentrated and vertically integrated, which has resulted in greater market power for producers and increased incentives for product differentiation instead of collective marketing. One argument from opponents of generic advertising is that since generic advertising sends a signal to consumers that all products are homogeneous commodities, it weakens brand messages by producers trying to differentiate their products. The concern is not that generic advertising is ineffective at increasing primary demand, but that it is also redistributing  shares of the pie . The issue of asymmetric benefits of generic advertising has been raised by wine and milk producers as well as apple, onion, and potato growers in New York State. Recently, there also has been interest in implementing a mandatory broad-based generic promotion program for all fruits and vegetables. The idea of broad-based advertising of fruits and vegetables is highly controversial among horticultural producers in the U.S., and the ensuing debate has included much speculation from both sides of the argument. Whether commodity-specific or broad-based promotional efforts would lead to greater sales of fruits and vegetables has been questioned by industry stakeholders, and there is no clear consensus among growers on this issue. The purpose of the proposed research is to empirically investigate and quantify the indirect effects of commodity-specific and broad-based advertising. The broad objectives are: 1) to investigate whether generic advertising disproportionally benefits large vs. small producers, and to quantify such distributional effects; 2) to examine whether generic advertising increases the market power of vertically integrated producers (where several stages of production, such as processing, packing and retail, are owned by the same parent company); 3) to analyze whether producers (both in New York State and elsewhere) would be better off with solely generic, solely branded or a mixture of both types of advertising and to propose an optimal advertising scheme; 4) use experimental economics to evaluate consumer response to promotional efforts for agricultural products; 5) empirically measure the economic effects of both broad-based advertising and commodity-specific advertising for fruits and vegetables; 6) assess how commodity-specific and broad-based advertising influence demand for fruits and vegetables, as either shifts or rotations in demand, and facilitate a test of the advertising theory; 7) investigate the spillover effects of commodity-specific advertising on other fruits and vegetables; 8) based on the research results recommend any potential improvements aimed at maximizing the return of all types of promotional effort. The summarize, the broad goal of the proposed research is to investigate the coexistence and potential interdependence of commodity specific, broad-based and branded advertising."

While there are current conventional and organic pesticides that can control the beetle such as neonicotinoids and spinosad, some beetle populations in Maine, upstate New York, and Long Island, NY have already developed resistance to these insecticides (Alyokhin et al. 2008). The fact that the beetle has developed resistance to 52 compounds in all of the major insecticide classes supports the notion that the beetle's ability to rapidly evolve will continue to be relevant to sustainable pest management (Baker et al. 2007, Alyokhin et al. 2008). The combination of warmer winters and the rising prevalence of pesticide resistance within northeastern beetle populations underscore the timeliness of regional ecological and evolutionary CPB research (see letter from Dr. Vernon Grubinger- University of Vermont Extension and Vegetable and Berry Specialist). Global warming is bound to increase CPB abundance and the frequency of outbreaks in Vermont, and will challenge the sustainability of pest management within the growing Vermont diversified agriculture sector. As a model system, this proposal will provide greater insight on insect latitudinal expansions within temperate agroecosystems and the underlying mechanisms associated with successful establishment. The latitudinal framework will help us to forecast how this beetle may respond to future climatic scenarios, through adaptation or dispersal. This knowledge will allow for the development of novel pest management strategies. Growers have been elated by the possibility that there are Mexican beetle populations that avoid feeding on potato (D. Marchant and A. Jones, pers. comm.), because any variation within species could be exploited for pest management. Beetles that prefer to feed on S. rostratum could be used in augmentative releases in agroecosystems. If insect lineages mate randomly, then mating non-pest lineages with pest lineages could lead to a decrease in beetle fitness in agroecosystems. Understanding the degree of current gene flow between pest and ancestral lineages can also present potential benefits to pesticide resistance management and resistance management of genetically modified crops. The results will be disseminated through research and extension presentations, and through twilight meetings organized by UVM extension with grower groups. We expect that this research will identify some factors key to the beetle's success in northern agroecosystems, which can directly lead to novel opportunities for control. We will also provide forecasts of the beetle's ability to adapt or disperse in Vermont and NE potato-growing regions. The stakeholder beneficiaries of this research will be growers in Vermont and throughout the potato-growing regions throughout the world."

Idaho is among the top 10 production states for specialty crops. According to 2009 statistics, Idaho producers are first in the nation in potato production and Austrian winter peas; second in the production of sugarbeets, wrinkled seed peas, lentils, barley, and alfalfa seed; and third in the production of dry edible peas, mint, hops and summer storage onions. Idaho growers also are in the top 10 production states for apples, sweet cherries, prunes and plums, various seed crops and processing sweet corn. Since most specialty crop pesticide registrations or minor uses on major crops are usually not economical for the manufacturer to defend with additional data, one method that chemical registrants can use to reduce their risk is to eliminate certain crops from pesticide labels. In Idaho and many western states, most specialty crops only have one or two choices for pest control options. The loss of one or both pesticide tools could result in crop devastation. Production costs will increase due to changes in agronomic practices. Other impacts could be the loss of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) tools. Pest resistance could develop due to the heavy use of one type of pesticide. This disruption in production could also have impacts to society in the lack of affordable,diversified and nutritious foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables, so important to a healthy diet. The Idaho project will generate data for five new pesticide registration for minor crops as well as supporting new Section 18 registrations. This will result in increased productivity and cash value of Idaho minor crops."

Development of resistance to common pesticides, restricted use of pesticides, concern for water and soil resources, and the expense of chemical inputs and long-term storage contribute to the need for developing potato cultivars with genetic resistance to pests including the Colorado potato beetle and green peach aphid, diseases such as late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans (Mont) de Bary, pink rot and Pythium leak, Verticillium wilt, Fusarium dry rot and other, and to physiological disorders triggered by environmental stresses including cold sweetening and the sugar end disorder. Host plant resistance is an important component of an integrated approach to managing abiotic and biotic stresses and may result in economically sustainable production due to reduced input costs and limited environmental impact. Traditional breeding techniques including introgression of traits from wild species and wild-species hybrids, combined with biotechnological techniques such as marker assisted selection, and field and greenhouse screening techniques, will be used in identification and selection of improved genotypes and development of resistant cultivars. Improved potato cultivars with multiple resistances to pests and environmental stresses will reduce input costs for producers, provide high quality raw materials for processing, and provide superior choices for consumers, thus providing a sustainable, cost-effective, healthy, and environmentally friendly food source."

The increasing and somewhat volatile costs of petroleum-based fuels have created a great deal of interest across the US and in Alabama on alternative energy solutions. Biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel offer an attractive alternative and in Alabama crops like field corn, soybeans, timber, switchgrass and industrial sweet potatoes offer promise as a means to produce this biofuel and help our land owners. The technology to convert corn to ethanol is well understood and is a proven commercial success. However, maximum corn yields such as though in the Midwest are not readily obtainable in the southeast due to droughty growing season conditions. However, industrial (non-edible) sweet potatoes and trees are drought tolerant and well suited for our climate and soils. In addition, industrial sweet potatoes grow well on marginal land. Furthermore, three-year averages in Alabama have produced over 1,000 gallons/acre of ethanol from industrial sweetpotato grown dryland. Production of industrial sweet potatoes as a bioenergy crops could be very beneficial to farmers in Alabama but further research is vitally needed in order to develop a feasible system to make such an alternative reality. Those interested in pursuing these alternative solutions need information on equipment, techniques, and costs to successfully transition to providing feedstocks for the production of renewable fuels. One aspect of industrial sweetpotato production which limits large scale, sustainable production is the current manual labor required at planting. Research is needed to develop a total mechanized system of planting sweetpotato slips to replace the current mechanical transplanters. Typical transplanters plant four to six rows at a time but require excessive labor. Labor requirements for sweetpotato production are about 60 man-hours per acre which is currently too high to support the use as a feedstock for ethanol production. Machine automation can greatly reduce production costs while increasing the capacity of producers to expand their production acres to meet the demand of a biofuel production facility. Similarly, the forest industry is in great need to improve operation efficiency to remain globally competitive. There is a need to develop information technology systems that will lead to lowered production costs and improved environmental stewardship. Farmers have recognized the value of emerging precision techniques to their bottom line and drove industrial development of agricultural technology, but the process required many years and a great deal of research. Forestry is in a similar developmental stage in that there is a tremendous need for research to create the information and machine systems that will propel silviculture into the next technological age. The ability to evaluate the timber quality at is needed to maximize land owner return and the delivery of a consistent product to conversion facilities. Our goal is to create these forest management systems and close the information loop from the nursery to the production facility."

The vegetable production system in Southwest Florida generally includes raised beds, soil fumigation, polyethylene mulch, and either seepage or drip irrigation. This production system has been effective in producing commercially valuable tomato yields. These cultural practices attempt to maximize economic return by maximizing productivity. Since, vegetables in Florida are grown in sandy soils with intensive use of soil fumigant and fertilization/irrigation, state and federal agencies have become concerned with issues affecting ozone layer and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) entering our environment and the impact on air and water quality. Nitrogen fertilizer management has become an environmental concern for Florida vegetable growers following the adoption by the State of Florida of vegetable BMPs [Best Management Practices, (www.floridaagwaterpolicy.com)]. BMPs emphasize the need to better manage fertilizer, increase fertilizer efficiency, and reduce N loss to the environment. Choosing which varieties to plant each year is a cornerstone of a successful vegetable industry. This variety testing program provides unbiased information about the adaptability and performance of varieties in Florida's diverse environments, thereby allowing growers to make informed decisions. Variety trials are being conducted in multiple locations (Palm Beach and Collier) and multiple seasons (winter and spring) in cooperation with David Sui (Palm Beach County Extension Services), Eugene McAvoy (Hendry County Extension Service), Crystal Snodgrass (Manatee County) and Richard Raid (UF/IFAS).

Potatoes (3rd nationally) and processed vegetables (2nd nationally) are an essential component of Wisconsin's agricultural economy with an annual value of $6.4 billion and over 35,000 jobs . Major processing vegetables include green beans and carrots (1st nationally), sweet corn (2nd), peas and potato (3rd) and significant acreages of beets, lima beans, onions and cucumbers. The continuing health and profitability of this important Wisconsin industry is dependent on its ability to remain competitive in the face of increasing national and global production. Currently, our farmers benefit from the central location of production in the US, our proximity to major population centers and a climate that is ideally suited to temperate vegetable production. In recent years, however, our climate is changing requiring increased reliance on irrigation, added costs and potential conflict with the water resource on which it depends. Simultaneously, the food industry has experienced a rapidly escalating demand from food processors and consumers for more sustainable production practices. This trend is emerging nationally as a driving force (Anonymous 2010, Food Trends, Schwartz 2010) with key vegetable end-users such as WalMart, Sysco, DelMonte, Pepsico/Frito-Lay, McCain's, McDonald's and others introducing new sustainability requirements that Wisconsin farmers must meet to remain competitive. Unfortunately, independently derived sustainability audits are inconsistent, often repetitive, rarely science-based, costly and come with no increased return to farmers. Several initiatives have emerged to generate consistent national standards or metrics but progress has been slow and national metrics are, of necessity, high-altitude and are unable to reflect regional differences in production or elicit meaningful change at a local level. This project will enable us to assemble a broad coalition of expertise both inside and outside the university that represents all segments of the food supply chain. With this support, we will develop assessments of research-based, producer-driven sustainability practices that are nationally coordinated and yet regionally appropriate and capable of driving change locally. We will build on the success and enthusiasm of a network of scientists, farmers, processors and NGOs which has developed assessment protocols for Wisconsin's 6.4 billion dollar vegetable processing industry. We will expand nationally through a series of regionally-based working groups patterned after the Wisconsin model. This framework will be developed in collaboration with an existing network of national commodity organizations that assisted in developing this proposal. We directly address the themes for sustainable practices, farm to consumer food and green payments for sustainability. The project is a key component of the USDA priority for Global Food Security and we will work with our national network to develop a NIFA proposal to implement a framework for sustainability that will be applicable to a broad range of cropping systems."

Specifically the study will try to improve the treatment techniques for type 2 diabetes patients. Through a systematic training protocol it is expected that the subjects will get stronger and improve their metabolic and biochemical profiles as well as functional measures of the quality of mobility. If successful, this could reduce the costs of medical care if the patient needs fewer drugs and is less likely to develop complications from the disease of diabetes. This would greatly impact our healthcare costs since diabetes is the largest growing disease in the United States. We also propose a new and fundamental approach to study the strength curve and its relationship to parameters relating to range of motion and speed of contraction. By examining the slope of the fatigue curve rather than just the percentage decline we hope to understand fatigue mechanisms with greater acuity and thus have the potential to develop better and more efficient muscular strength and endurance training systems. Muscular strength is critically important component in locomotor activities and helps keep a person stable whether walking, balancing, standing or getting up or sitting down. Maintaining and improving muscular strength is important in bone health and preventing osteoporosis. The above studies should give us a better understanding of muscular strength and endurance allowing us to not only improve the quality of living for the elderly diabetic patient but also possible improve the training protocols for the elite athlete, weekend warrior, and/or the sedentary couch potato who wants to get moving again."

The ability to increase the value of raw agricultural commodities represents a key component for continued economic growth and development. In fact, value-added processing of agricultural commodities by the food industry accounts for approximately half of realized profits across the entire food distribution system. Thus, a greater proportion of the total market revenue is retained within the state by processing raw agricultural commodities into value-added products. The long-term sustainability of production agriculture and, to a significant degree, the state economy are linked to maximizing profitability from the state's agricultural commodities through value-addition to enhance competitiveness in both domestic and global markets. The proposed work will contribute both fundamental and applied research needed to support production of value-added products from wheat and potato commodities. For potatoes, research efforts will focus on technology that fosters development of potato-based products that could potentially lower incidence of chronic disease (i.e., type II diabetes, heart disease, etc.) and promote digestive health. In regard to wheat, the proposed research seeks to elucidate key factors necessary for creation of modified wheat starch products (i.e., functional biopolymers) with enhanced and/or novel functionalities for use in food and industrial applications.

This technology has been successfully applied to generate biogas from manure as well as crop silages; however, AD is not currently applied to generate bioenergy from manure and other agricultural wastes in Colorado. Conventional technologies that have been successfully applied to generate biogas from manure in the eastern part of the United States require large volumes of water, and therefore, these technologies are not viable in arid regions such as Colorado. Multi-stage AD processes, which utilize multiple reactors as opposed to a single reactor, are a promising approach because this technology can be designed to incorporate water recycling to drastically reduce water requirements. However, due to the fact that the multi-stage AD process design involves water recycle in the hydrolysis reactor to minimize water requirements, conditions of high ammonia and high salinity can occur, and these conditions can reduce energy yields. Future studies are needed to determine how to design multi-stage AD processes for manure and agricultural wastes with low water usage and to develop microbial inocula (source of microorganisms that mediate AD processes) that can function optimally under the conditions that occur with low water usage. Additionally, research is needed to identify the additional sources of agricultural waste in Colorado that can be converted to energy via multi-stage AD and to determine if these other agricultural wastes can be digested alone or mixed with manure to increase methane yields and potential profits from bioenergy production in multi-stage AD processes. The proposed project involves three components: 1) A mixed agricultural waste feasibility study, 2) laboratory AD studies, and 2) computer modeling. A survey will be conducted to identify additional sources of agricultural wastes available in Colorado such as waste from growing potatoes, onions, and other crops currently being produced. Laboratory tests will be conducted to measure rates of hydrolysis (microbially-mediated process that breaks down solids into soluble components that controls the rate of energy generation) as a function of reactor operating conditions for AD of manure and mixed wastes. An Excel-based model will be built to determine optimal reactor designs based on the data generated via the laboratory AD studies. The proposed project will result in the determination of hydrolysis rates for a range waste mixtures and potential reactor designs which will be used to support optimization of multi-stage AD processes for application to agricultural wastes. Additionally, optimized microbial inoculum will be produced that can be applied to achieve increased methane production, which are expected to increase the profitability of multi-stage AD processes. The proposed work will provide fundamental the information needed to design AD processes suitable for widespread implementation in Colorado and other arid regions."

The European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis, accounts for over USD 1.85 billion in control costs and grain losses annually. In 2006, 88 percent of sweet corn acreage was treated with one or more insecticide application totaling 605,000 lbs of insecticides applied. ECB also attacks crops like sorghum, small grains, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, and peppers. The southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella, causes about USD 1 million in damage in the Western High Plains. Recently, the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis, has emerged as a corn pest in the southern U.S. Other significant stalk-boring pests include the common stalk borer, Papaipema nebris, hop vine borer, Hydraecia immanis, and potato stem borer, Hydraecia micacea. Corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea, and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, consume corn leaves, tassels, silk and kernels. In the southeastern U.S., losses attributed to corn earworm in field corn and sweet corn range from 1.5-16.7 percent, as high as 50 percent, respectively. Black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon, is the most damaging of the Corn Belt cutworm complex. Western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta, increasingly is a pest of corn ears across the north central region. The commercial release of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) transgenic corn in 1996 revolutionized corn pest management. This revolution rapidly moved corn pest management away from synthetic pesticides to biotechnology-based planted incorporated protectants. Bt technology often eliminates insecticide handling and increases the ease of planting and pest control. Seed companies continue to develop genetically-modified (GM) crops for pest protection. New GM corn hybrids have resistance to a broader range of lepidopteran and coleopteran pests. Changes in corn technology have caused major changes in the agricultural community and identified major knowledge gaps, increasing the need to reevaluate knowledge about corn pests. U.S. Bt corn acreage has increased steadily since 1996, as has the potential for resistance evolution. NC-205 Committee Research was used to develop models predicting the rates of resistance evolution and to investigate the role of refuge in preventing resistance. Recently deployed GM corn hybrids utilize multiple genes that target ECB. The IRM plan for these hybrids requires a smaller refuge of at least 5 percent. Seed mixtures (Bt and non-BT) are a new reality that assures refuge compliance, but introduces new concerns regarding movement of corn pest larvae. Models of these IRM modifications were constructed using the best information available and some assumptions to bridge data gaps. These assumptions must be tested to move them to quantified variables. Eliminating these information gaps forms the basis for several objectives of the project. The long-term goal of our research is to develop sustainable ways to manage lepidopteran corn pests. This is a high regional and important national priority."

In other words, each species is reproductively isolated from other species because of reproductive barriers that prevent hybridization. The focus of this research is to understand the nature of reproductive barriers between species within the genus Solanum, which includes two important crop species, potato and tomato. In the previous funding period, the timing of reproductive barrier formation and site of barrier action in inter-species crosses was determined, and male and female genes involved in forming reproductive barriers were identified.  In the current project, this information will be used to pursue the detailed molecular mechanisms that constitute inter-species recognition and rejection during mating attempts. Prior research has identified a population of S. habrochaites (a wild tomato species) with incipient reproductive barriers that isolate it from other populations. This system will now be developed as a powerful model for answering fundamental questions about how new species evolve. In the previous funding period, studies were conducted using tomato because it is an excellent model system for genetic and genomic studies.  In the current project, research on reproductive barriers will be expanded into potato, an increasingly important crop worldwide. Broader Impacts:  Undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in the research laboratories will participate in the teaching of undergraduate 'Many Minds' laboratories in an Introductory Biology course; this will ensure that integration of research and teaching becomes second nature as their careers advance. Public outreach will also be a key component of the project. During this project three 90-second radio spots will be produced to air on the public radio Earth & Sky series, which reaches about 15 million listeners.  In addition, three podcasts will be produced for the EarthSky (www.earthsky.org) and the project (www.irbtomato.org) web sites. One topic of these media efforts will be the importance of preserving wild germplasm, using tomato as an example, which should truly resonate with lay audiences.  The project will also impact society by advancing crop improvement. The wild relatives of tomato and potato possess genes for resistance to pathogens, drought, cold and salinity--traits that are particularly important in a time of global climate change. Unfortunately, accessing these important agronomic traits is often prevented or impeded by reproductive barriers. This project will lead to understanding that will facilitate inter-species crosses between domesticated and wild species by altering reproductive barriers; this advance will greatly expand the genetic base for crop improvement to include resistance to disease and environmental stresses."

Some hybrids, like mules, are sterile, because the parents have different chromosome numbers.  In plants, some sterile hybrids can become fertile when their chromosome number is doubled, a process called polyploidy. Many important crop plants, such as alfalfa, cotton, potato, and wheat are recent polyploids while others, such as maize, soybean, and cabbage, retain the vestiges of ancient polyploid events.  This project will investigate how polyploidy can give rise to novel traits, such as the resistance to insects, in the order Brassicales (broccoli, mustards, capers, papaya, and relatives).  The investigators of this project have developed new phylogenomics methods that allow one to understand the evolutionary history of how species are related while simultaneously determining whether or not they are polyploid.At a time when rapid global changes are placing unprecedented pressure on plants in agricultural and natural landscapes, it is imperative that scientists think beyond a single discipline. Phylogenomics has emerged as an interdisciplinary approach in the biological sciences; however, there are few opportunities to learn the genomic and bioinformatics tools becoming required in biology.  To address this gap, this project will develop modules for undergraduate courses; create an interdisciplinary research environment that uses computational methods; and engage in outreach to systematic biologists by annual workshops. All research proposed here involves recruiting and mentoring students from underrepresented groups."

Robin Buell (Michigan State University) Co-PIs: Yuehua Cui and David Douches (Michigan State University), Jiming Jiang (University of Wisconsin-Madison), and Richard Veilleux (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University)Potato is the third most important food crop in the world following rice and wheat and is cultivated for its tuber, a below-ground storage organ. Potato is distinct from many other major crops in that it is asexually propagated, has four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid), and all cultivars are highly heterozygous. As a consequence, potato has a greater probability of retaining deleterious gene mutations than sexually propagated diploids such as rice, maize, and soybean. These three characteristics make genetic improvement of potato slow and unpredictable due to a lack of understanding of the interaction of genetic elements in a complex background. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge regarding the molecular nature of heterozygosity and allelic composition in the potato genome and how these correlate with phenotype. The objectives of this project are to understand the contribution of genes/alleles, transcripts, copy number variation and epigenomic features to a complex of phenotypic traits associated with fitness in potato. Data to be generated from this project will include characterization of the genome, transcriptome and epigenome from multiple potato populations with differential degrees of chromosome number and heterozygosity and statistical analyses to identify genes and alleles associated with a set of phenotypes associated with vigor. These data will also facilitate modeling genomic features into phenotype. Many of the genetic and genomic questions associated with potato cannot be readily addressed by using diploid model plants. Project efforts to probe the genetic complexities of potato will serve as a model genomics system for other vegetatively propagated, highly heterozygous crops with similarly intractable breeding systems, including alfalfa, banana, cassava, grape, strawberry, sugarcane, sweet potato, yam and scores of minor horticultural crops, thereby improving the understanding of the genetic machinery underlying phenotypic diversity. Through outreach activities in this project, the public will gain knowledge of plant biology, specifically in the uses of potato and its unique biology, through a suite of activities with the Michigan State University Children's and Horticulture Garden involving all age groups. Through engagement of high school and under-represented groups, this project will provide opportunities for students to see science as a viable career opportunity and increase the representation of women in computer-related science/technology disciplines. The techniques and approaches used in this project will provide a rich training environment for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in relevant and emerging disciplines of bioinformatics, genomics, and epigenomics.  The data to be generated in this project through publication and deposition in public databases will provide the first high-resolution map of genome variation and its association with gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and phenotypic traits in potato.  Sequence data will be made public through the project website (to be accessible via http://buell-lab.plantbiology.msu.edu/), the SOL Genomics Network (http://solgenomics.net/) and through the NCBI Sequence Read Archive and the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus for permanent archiving.  Germplasm developed and/or used in this project will be available on request and long-term through the NRSP-6 U.S. Potato Genebank (http://www.ars-grin.gov/nr6/)."

This may represent active manipulation of plant metabolism by viruses, which rely on insects for their transmission from one plant to another. However, although numerous studies have demonstrated altered aphid growth on virus-infected plants, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon. Research using Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), Myzus persicae (peach-potato aphid), and Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) as a model system will be used to study the molecular biology of plant-aphid-virus interactions. Preliminary results show that Arabidopsis defense responses, which are normally turned on when aphids initiate feeding, are reduced in TuMV-infected plants. Further research will be directed at measuring virus-induced changes in plant metabolisms, identifying plant defense pathways that are manipulated by TuMV, and determining which of the eleven TuMV genes are required for shutting down anti-aphid defenses in Arabidopsis and other plant species.TuMV, which is commonly transmitted by green peach aphids, is a serious pathogen of vegetable crops. Virus control in agricultural systems is complicated by the propensity of peach-potato aphids to develop insecticide resistance, as well as TuMV reservoirs in Arabidopsis and other weed species. Research on the interactions of Arabidopsis, peach-potato aphids, and TuMV interactions, will identify previously unknown aspects of plant metabolism that contribute to aphid attraction and reproduction. Such information can be used to improve the insect and virus resistance of crop plants through classical breeding and transgenic approaches. The proposed project also will contribute to training a new generation of students in plant molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics. These students will be well-prepared for future careers in the plant biotechnology industry, academia, or government service."

BmJ (Certis USA) has been evaluated by the project PIs for the past three years in both greenhouse and field trials at Hermiston with the result that PVY infection has been reduced by 20-70% with best control in systems integrating BmJ, rogueing and and insecticides that preserve beneficial insects. This project will evaluate stylet oils with the previously identified control practices."

Potatoes are used for multiple end uses. Many varieties are planted each year to satisfy consumer demands. Consumers have variable demands such as fresh market round white, reds, russets and specialties (fingerling, yellow flesh, colored potatoes, etc). Processing potatoes are used for French fries, chips, canning or dehydrated products. For these categories the industry is looking for varieties with capacity to store. Some varieties are only suited for marketing off the field; other varieties have the required capacity for short, intermediate or long storage. These categories may have specific and many time exclusive traits that breeders need to select for. All of these traits or potatoes are controlled by the genes they carry. In addition to consumer demands, growers in different regions are challenged with a large number of pest and diseases including early blight, late blight, common scab, early dying, soft, silver scurf, pink rot and leak; several viruses, notably PVY, PVX and PVS. Climate and soil stresses including heat, frost, drought, flooding and low fertility are also factors affecting yield and quality of potatoes. This research supports the interaction of researchers, growers and industry to target real needs of the potato production and processing industry. Our goal is to develop potato varieties needed by growers and industry by targeting our region research priorities defined in collaboration with state growers organization and industry. Our research group has traditionally and recently developed successful varieties for the potato industry. This cooperative NC project makes efficient use of limited resources, infrastructure and breadth of expertise from our NC institutions and diversity in potato genetic resources. This research also serves to prioritize traits of focus, and compliments efforts in the Pacific Northwest, Northeast and Southwest. The NC effort aims to release new varieties to react to stakeholder needs, and reflecting industry goals. This applied research helps NC potato breeders to use genetic technology and research approaches developed by other national and otherwise supported projects that are mostly devoted to create knowledge but not to develop varieties. Genetic and molecular methods will be used in combination with field, greenhouse and other controlled condition experiments to reveal new genes associated with relevant traits such as yield, disease resistance, and traits related to response to climate changes and soil fertility such as resistance to heat and cold stresses and ability to best use available nutrients such as nitrogen. This knowledge will greatly facilitate selection and decrease the time that takes to release new varieties. This research will support interaction of researchers with growers, industry and the production and dissemination of information like factsheets and variety cards through participation in field days, regional and national growers and industry meetings such as winter growers meeting at each state, the Potato Association of America Meeting and the US National Potato Expo."

Among the genetic improvements needed are better fresh market and processing quality, resistance to major environmental stresses, insect pests and diseases, more efficient utilization of water and nutrients, improved storability, and lowered production costs. The purpose of this research is to release and commercialize new potato varieties that will directly benefit all segments of the Northwest potato industry and indirectly benefit all US producing regions. The strategy is to identify traits, make crosses, and apply selection pressures that will increase the probability of developing varieties that can be produced and utilized more efficiently than existing varieties. Appropriate breeding goals include high yield, improved processing quality, genetic resistance to major pests and diseases, higher levels of resistance to stresses, increased nutrient use efficiency, improved human nutritional value, and high tuber quality. An additional environmental benefit comes with reduced use of pesticides, water, and fertilizers, which are normal byproducts of improved varieties. This major objective is accompanied by myriad minor objectives involving germplasm enhancement, germplasm production, selection procedures, disease and stress screening, variety trial design and conduct, seed increases, management studies, and commercial evaluations. Each objective is to be carried out by the Northwest institution(s) best equipped to complete the associated tasks.

These emissions damage air and water quality, negatively impact climate change, and cause health problems in humans, thus restricting sustainability of these regionally and nationally important agriculture commodities. In addition, rising energy prices, tightened regulatory requirements, increasing concern over GHG emissions, and interest in producing renewable energy have led to a greater interest of the AD of wastes from these regionally important agriculture commodities. Further, with increasing concern over GHG emissions and global warming, both the federal government and some commodity organizations such as the U.S. Dairy have pledged to reduce GHG emissions by 28% and 25% by 2020, respectively. Anaerobic digestion of agricultural wastes is considered by far the most effective technology that reduces GHG emissions, generates renewable energies, promotes better manure nitrogen uses, reduces odor emissions, and contributes to the emerging economic opportunities of carbon-based market systems. Even though AD has many benefits, the use of on-farm AD continues to be low in the PNW. This is due in part to the lack of science-based AD information pertaining specifically to the PNW and insufficient Extension programs connecting the information sources with concerned stakeholders. The goal of this project is to collect preliminary baseline AD data and conduct Extension activities facilitating the adoption of AD to reduce GHG emissions from the PNW regionally important agriculture commodities. A bench-scale AD test system will be developed for diverse AD tests. Regionally important digester feedstocks will be characterized and their biogas potential will be evaluated. Extension activities will be conducted to facilitate on-farm AD adoption and to assist stakeholders in making better decisions regarding AD and GHG emissions. The expected outcomes include the developed AD test system and AD manual, generated baseline data pertaining to AD of wastes specific to the PNW, and delivered Extension activities. The AD test system will be valuable for future research and Extension activities. The AD manual will help stakeholders make better decisions regarding AD, assist Extension specialists and educators in conducting AD related Extension activities, and popularize knowledge in AD among the general public as well. The generated preliminary data will fill the knowledge gap in AD of wastes from regionally important agriculture commodities, benefit future anaerobic digester design and operation, and assist commodity groups in making better decisions toward sustainable agriculture. The delivered Extension activities will increase awareness and knowledge of GHG emissions from agricultural wastes among producers, Extension professionals, and the general public."

In the United States, annual potato production is valued at $3.7 billion, and over 53% of that production originates from the Pacific Northwest, including Oregon, Washington and Idaho. One of the most important diseases worldwide is Potato Virus Y (PVY). PVY reduces yields and tuber quality, threatening the stability and quality of the food supply. Potato cultivars, as well as tobacco, tomatoes and peppers, are all affected by PVY at varying levels of severity, making it a significant issue for plant health and production. PVY is transmitted rapidly via aphid feeding, with multiple aphid species serving as vectors. Consequently, insecticides are rarely successful at controlling this disease. One means of reducing PVY may be to control weeds that serve as alternative hosts for both the aphid vectors and the disease. However, limited research has been done on alternative weed hosts or vectors in the United States. The objectives of this research are to: 1) survey weed hosts and determine the distribution of PVY in two production regions in the Pacific Northwest, 2) identify vectors of PVY, 3) estimate transmission rates of PVY for alternative hosts and aphid vectors, 4) develop and disseminate more sustainable control methods through extension, and 5) evaluate the effectiveness of extension activities. This research will aid investigators and producers in developing more effective and sustainable PVY control tactics in the face of varying climates and unpredictable insect and disease pressures."

However, a number of diseases caused by bacterial, fungal and oomycete pathogens cause serious economic losses worldwide. Despite the release of new varieties, current control measures for these diseases are not always successful. Development of transgenic plants through incorporation of disease resistance genes encoding antimicrobial peptides (AMP) has shown potential in the development of disease resistant potato cultivars. However, due to lack of genome sequence, a comprehensive genome-wide identification of AMP-encoding genes and subsequent analyses of their efficacy against diverse potato pathogen has not been possible. With the recent release of the potato genome, this proposal seeks to identify the AMP coding potential of the potato genome through bioinformatics analyses. Through the expression of AMP-encoding genes, transgenic plants resistant to a broader spectrum of microbial phytopathogens will be produced and tested against the diseases caused by bacterial, fungal, and oomycete pathogens. Development of transgenic plants capable of producing AMPs may provide broad-spectrum resistance to phytopathogenic microorganisms and complement other resistance genes currently in potato and thus providing a basis for development of novel disease management practices."

Moreover, parasitic weeds are notoriously difficult to control without harming crop plants because they grow directly into and around crop plant roots and/or stems. This intimate association complicates conventional control measures such as spraying with herbicides or hand-weeding, therefore alternative strategies informed by an understanding of underlying ecology are needed. The proposed research addresses this need by studying the ecology of parasites in the genus Cuscuta (dodders). For currently unknown reasons, few insects feed on dodders, which cause significant losses to US production of tomato, potato, alfalfa and other important crops. Our initial findings suggest that both innate characteristics of dodder vines and chemical factors originating in host plants can influence herbivore success on the parasite. We are using analytical chemistry as well as insect growth and preference experiments to examine the chemical mechanisms that underlie the three-way relationship between host plants, parasitic plants and insect herbivores. Knowledge created in this project will help us to understand why the growth of dodder in crop fields is seemingly unchecked by insect herbivores, and insights gained through this work may inform the development of new management strategies. At the same time, this project is will shed light on the influence of host plant identity on parasite-insect interactions - which has been poorly studied to date, and could have relevance for the management of several highly destructive parasitic weeds around the world. We know that anti-insect toxins can move from host plants into parasitic plants, and our work investigates whether this phenomenon is important in the success of parasitic plants. Because this project is funded by an AFRI NIFA fellowship grant, it also serves as a platform for the professional development of the project director (a graduate student) who is acquiring essential research and communication skills under the guidance of two mentors who are leading researchers on plant-insect interactions. Portions of this project will also be used by the project director to mentor undergraduate interns and to educate younger (K-12) audiences about the importance of plant-insect interactions in nature and agriculture."

This strategy has been particularly effective in crops such as tomato where the gene pool is narrow and genetic variation is found in related wild species. A major problem with interspecific transfer can be difficulty in introgressing the trait of interest into the target species. Fertilization barriers may demand special techniques, or linkage drag may bring in deleterious traits. Thus, new approaches for (i) direct identification of novel resistance traits in cultivated species and (ii) facile transfer into related species are needed. Approach (i) depends on multi-generation screening of ?mutator?tomato plants for novel resistance traits. Approach (ii) will use Cibus? Rapid Trait Development System (RTDS) to produce non-transgenic, specific mutations identified in approach (i), using chemically synthesized gene repair oligonucleotides (GRONs), in half the time of other breeding techniques. This technology harnesses the cell?s normal DNA-repair systems to correct and change specific targeted bases within the genome of a cell. The Gene Repair OligoNucleotide (GRON), a chemically synthesized oligonucleotide, is designed to create mismatched base-pairs compared to the target sequence within the host organism?s genome. The GRON hybridizes at the target region and the mismatched base-pairs work with the cell?s repair system at those sites to correct (replace, insert or delete) the designated base(s). Once the correction process is complete the GRON is degraded and the now-modified or repaired gene retains its normal pattern of expression and stability within the genome. Here we propose two linked proofs-of-concept for radically new ways to (i) select for novel crop variants resistant to different stresses and (ii) introduce novel resistance-conferring mutations into a related crop recalcitrant to breeding approaches. Approach (i) employs tomato as a prototype crop and Phytophthora infestans as a prototype pathogen and approach (ii) employs other solanaceous crops."

Plant pathologists who have directed the Center's long-time Vegetable Pathology program have all placed strong focus on diseases caused by fungi and oomycetes. Broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, cucumbers, green beans, and green peas, and squash dominated the processing vegetable acreage of the past. Now, fresh market specialty potatoes (red, purple, yellow, and white cultivars) and certified seed potatoes comprise the largest part of the region's vegetable crop base. Due to the value-added traits of meeting fresh market or seed potato certification standards, both of these types of potatoes command a higher price than the Russet type potatoes grown in eastern Washington which are destined for processing. The same is true for tomato where consumers pay premium prices for nutritious, high quality, disease-free fruit sold during direct market sales. Over the years, the vegetable disease control measures that have been utilized have been fairly standard (crop rotation, cultural practices, fungicide applications, host resistance, sanitation, and soil fumigation). However, traditional plant disease control practices are becoming more and more difficult to implement. Alternative approaches in vegetable disease management for the region need investigation. Practices such as directed low-dose fungicide applications, disease forecasting, growing crops in high tunnels, soil flooding, using biodegradable mulches, and vegetable grafting are not widely employed, but are worthy of investigation. Ways in which public welfare or scientific knowledge will be advanced: Since its inception, this program has strived to develop a comprehensive research and extension program that has flexibility; provides research-based answers for practical as well as fundamental questions; focuses on integrated approaches in plant disease control; utilizes new research techniques and applications when possible; and, delivers information promptly and effectively. Further, since 2000 the program has played a key role in developing WSU's Vegetable Pathology Team which has now expanded to PNW-VEG (Pacific Northwest Vegetable Extension Group). Leadership by the program on the USDA SCRI SREP project, Biodegradable Mulches for Specialty Crops Produced Under Protective Covers, also has had strong research and extension components. Likewise, the program has received funding from The Nature Conservancy (a non-traditional agricultural research funding source) on Field Flooding for Soilborne Potato Pathogen Control. All program personnel have a long history of interacting with growers and agricultural organizations, providing a wide variety of extension activities and written materials, participating in field days, presenting at workshops, and utilizing websites. In addition, the program has published numerous scientific journal articles and technical reports and abstracts as well as contributed to many scientific meetings."

Unfortunately, the aroma component of flavor is highly complex and not completely understood. There are over two hundred different volatile chemical compounds in the aroma of most food products. Processing and storage conditions change how these volatiles are produced and destroyed, often in very complex ways. Understanding how processing and storage changes the volatile profile helps processors to optimize the flavor of the products they produce. A new type of mass spectrometer (Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometer, SIFT-MS) is available at OSU to detect volatile compounds without the extensive sample preparation required with existing methods. Therefore SIFT can be used to measure the volatile formation during key processing and storage steps. Coating The United States snack food industry is a huge market representing $30 billion a year (Anon, 2000). Most of these snacks owe their popularity to their flavor. Given that most seasoning is added at 8-12% by weight of this 5.7 billion pound industry, costs at least $1/lb, and, 30-50% more seasoning has to be applied than is actually needed due to inefficient coating systems (Anon 1992), electrostatic coating could save the industry 200 million dollars a year ( 36 million in the potato chip industry alone). Previous studies have shown that electrostatic coating produces an average of 68% increase in transfer efficiency (Ricks et al. 2002). Further improvement may be possible by manipulating coating physical properties. With a 68% increase in transfer efficiency, a company could decrease their powder costs by a quarter. Our research has shown that electrostatic coating also reduces dustiness up to 53%, resulting in significant savings in clean-up costs and decreased worker exposure. If more even coating can be produced, this would improve food quality and may allow less total powder to be added. The results of this work may provide insight for snack and convenience food companies to determine the optimal coating system for their products."

A search of the CRIS system yielded references to 33 projects (not including Dietrich's previous Hatch project) focusing on various aspects of Empoasca leafhopper pest management. Among these, only Dietrich's lab at INHS is addressing taxonomic problems in this genus. Because Dietrich's lab has the necessary infrastructure and personnel, and the INHS collection contains most of the specimens necessary for the project, INHS is the ideal location for the proposed project."

T.",,,627797426.0,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,RIVERSIDE,CA,92521-0001,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2012,,,"Until recently, sustainable low input IPM strategies for vegetable production had been widely adopted. However, these recent gains are at immediate risk because of the development of large populations of the potato psyllid and the losses associated with the transmission of a plant pathogen. The U.S. potato industry, a nearly $4 billion dollar crop in 2008, has been devastated by the appearance of this pathogen, known as 'zebra chip'. The insect and pathogen have spread to major production areas across the U.S. The losses are likely to increase as Korea, Argentina, and Brazil have established quarantine restrictions on U.S. potatoes. Tomato growers in Baja California, Mexico lost 85% of their tomatoes in 2001, and growers in San Diego Co, Ca lost 50% of their crops in 2003. In Ontario, Canada, greenhouse tomato growers experienced major losses. The potato psyllid was found in potato fields in Minnesota for the first time in 2007. A recent introduction into New Zealand has resulted in major losses in both peppers and tomatoes. Thus, the problem appears to be increasing in both geographic scope and economic importance. Using established procedures and novel strategies, we will develop new approaches to controlling the pest. These include 'green' approaches and plant resistance, as well as using chemistries selected for low mammalian and environmental toxicity. The benfits will be substantial. Consumers will be subjected to reduced potential pesticide residues on food, farm woirkers will be exposed to less pesticide residue, and growers will produce crops more economically, thus improving their profits. Finally, increased pesticide usage associated with psyllids and other new invasive pests, coupled with the use of ground water supplies contaminated with a variety of pollutants, have resulted in significant contamination of agricultural runoff water from fields. Very few studies have been conducted that investigate the effects of these pollutants on insects of importance in agriculture. Consider the example of selenium (Se). Se naturally enters the food chain through water and accumulates in drainage areas where evaporation concentrates soluble salts. Within the western USA, high Se levels around the Salton Sea and Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge have resulted in symptoms of Se intoxication of animals including lameness, hair loss, developmental retardation, malformation, and death. However these are not just localized problems; approximately 160,000 ha of agricultural land in the San Joaquin Valley of CA are affected by salinity and high water tables, a combination which has been correlated with high Se concentrations in this region. Unfortunately, very little is known regarding the effects of selenium accumulation in plants on the lower part of the food chain such as insects or how to deal sustainably with this problem. The effects are almost certainly greater on lower life forms than on mammals and avians. Additional studies designed to address these pollution problems are necessary to understanding both the impact of pollutants on agriculture and agriculture's effects on critical adjacent habitats."

Oomycetes represent a large and diverse collection of important but poorly understood species. The group includes significant parasites of plants, insects, and animals as well as saprophytic species. Most of this project will focus on P. INFESTANS, which is an experimentally tractable oomycete as well as arguably the most important pathogen within the group. P. INFESTANS is the infamous cause of the late blight diseases of potato and tomato. These are difficult to control and of major economic importance throughout the United States, California, and the world. Many billions of dollars are spent each year to control the disease worldwide, and the high cost of conventional control measures can drive growers out of business. Major goals of the work include characterizing cellular pathways that are needed for the growth of P. INFESTANS, to form the spores that are used to transport the pathogen between locations by wind or water, and infection structures, that enable oomycetes to acquire nutrients from their environment including their plant hosts, or that mediating other aspects of the plant-pathogen interaction. The long-term goal of such work is to develop new or improved strategies for blocking disease, through plant-based or chemical approaches. For example, agents could be developed that block the pathways necessary for spore germination, or inhibit the transport of plant nutrients into the pathogen. Other research activities focus on improving disease management by developing technologies that growers or extension personnel can use to obtain information about pathogen strains. These include methods to assess traits of pathogens that can lead to informed disease management decisions. In summary, the goal of the work is to learn more about the biology of P. INFESTANS and related species to develop safe and effective methods for disease control, thus ensuring sustainable agricultural production and global food security."

The corresponding acreage amount of farms in North Dakota increased from 28,427 thousand acres to 39,400 thousand acres leading to an increase in farm size from 382 acres to 1,300 acres. A century ago, North Dakota was overwhelmingly a wheat state; today the leading crops are oil crops. According to North Dakota Agricultural Statistical Service publication, the state ranks first in the production of barley, durum wheat, spring wheat, all dry edible beans, pinto beans, navy beans, sunflower, canola, flaxseed, oats, dry edible peas. It ranks second in all wheat, lentils and honey, third in sugar beets and rye; fourth in potatoes, and tenth in soybeans. The farm receipts increased from 0.257 billion nominal dollars in 1924 to 3.98 billion nominal dollars in 2006. During the same time period, the crop and livestock receipts increased from 0.197 and 0.60 billion nominal dollars to 3.089 and 0.897 billion nominal dollars respectively. These changes in North Dakota due to technological improvements, farm programs, farm crop insurance programs and public investments will be quantified for the fourteen (including the 2008 farm bill) major farm bills since 1933. The project will collect, construct and analyze original farm-level, county-level, state-level, and regional-level data utilizing statistical econometric, mathematical programming and/or simulation data to provide conclusions of the stated objectives. This project will also develop a ND agriculture sector database for the future researchers and the state."

This goal directly applies to the national missions of increasing global food security and improving agricultural production practices. Many of the biological control agents currently used are non-native species which can have unintended impacts when released and this project focuses on a native predator. Although there is a local and national industry in providing biological control agents for agricultural pests, most of the information on the efficacy of these agents comes from research measuring their consumption rate. However, by only measuring consumption, we are missing at least half of the effect of the predator on the plant. We have demonstrated that the herbivore's perception of and behavioral responses to the presence of a predator greatly reduces plant damage. By understanding how herbivores detect predators, we can manipulate those responses in the absence of actual predators or increase the impact of existing predators. Using pheromones from predators to manipulate herbivore host choice and feeding behavior could be a major new pest management tool for local farmers who do not wish to use pesticides. The predaceous stink bug I am proposing to work with is already used as a biological control agent but is often not sufficiently cost effective. The work proposed will investigate how to make this predator more effective against a major pest (Colorado potato beetle) in a crop of major economic importance (potato)."

Florida growers receive more than US $500 million in sales of tomato, $200 million in bell pepper, and $150 million in cucurbits (watermelon, cantaloupe, cucumber, and squash). Citrus is a $1 billion industry. Southwest Florida is a leading producer of citrus and vegetables including pepper, watermelon, cantaloupe, squash, corn, cucumber, potato, tomato, and snap bean. A large transplant industry for vegetables is located in the region. Additionally, there are ornamental and palm nurseries, herb producers, organic growers, and various specialty crops. This wide diversity of crop species can be subjected to a number of limiting plant diseases, most of which are favored by Floridas subtropical climate of warm and wet environmental conditions for rapid disease development. Additionally, Florida crops are exceptionally at risk because of the frequent introductions of exotic pests, including plant pathogens. Plant diseases can severely and adversely affect production of all of these crops. Documented disease outbreaks caused 100% plant loss in watermelon and tomato caused by watermelon vine decline (Squash vein yellowing virus; Adkins et al,. 2007) and late blight (Phytophthora infestans), respectively. Losses incurred by diseases can impact productivity by 10-50% in any given year. Currently, the citrus industry is facing one of the most devastating diseases of citrus, Huanglongbing (HLB) a.k.a. greening disease (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus), vectored by the Asian citrus psyllid, which causes tree decline, lost productivity due to reduced yields and quality, and ultimately tree death (Bove, 2006; de Graca, 1991). Another disease introduced in the 1990s, and now endemic to Florida citrus despite a massive eradication program, is citrus canker caused by the bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri. Citrus canker can cause severe yield losses due to fruit blemishes and premature fruit drop. The introduction of exotic pests to Florida creates challenging situations to the ecosystem and agriculture. Although the potential exists that an exotic pest can devastate a particular host and entire industry, at the very least, growers may have to substantially change their management practices and increase inputs to include disease control measures for an exotic pathogen. Additionally, established pathogen populations can shift and become increasingly problematic to manage, for example, a genetic shift may occur in the pathogen which then becomes insensitive to fungicide active ingredient"

Sclerotia (sing. sclerotium) are survival structures produced by Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi (Mvc) and Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agents of economically important diseases of blueberry and potato, respectively. Except for the plant pathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, little is known about the genetic, metabolic and population processes that govern the formation of sclerotia. However, the process and type of sclerotium formed by Mvc and R. solani are different than Sclerotinia. Insight into these processes may potentially provide valuable information for developing novel management strategies that involve the use of chemical-based inhibitors or fungal parasites of sclerotia that target this critical phase of their life cycle and reduce the survival of the fungus in soil. R. solani is a destructive pathogen with a wide host range (e.g., >500 different species of agricultural, forestry and ornamental plants, while Mvc is a specialized pathogen of cultivated and wild species of blueberry. Although there have been many microscopy-based studies that have examined how sclerotia of Mvc and R. solani develop under laboratory conditions, nothing is known about the molecular basis of and how the population genetic diversity contribute to sclerotia formation in these fungi. Results generated from this research will facilitate the development of more economical and effective ways to manage Monilinia and Rhizoctonia diseases that have been historically difficult to manage with traditional approaches such as breeding plants for disease resistance and crop rotation. The primary goal of this project is to reduce economic losses to farmers and promote increased agricultural productivity, profitability and sustainability."

Tuber sprouting during storage, caused by dormancy release of tuber buds, leads to undesirable loss of weight, turgidity and texture alterations. Undesirable sprouting during storage is a serious problem for the fresh market, prior to industrial processing, and in storage of seed-tubers (Coleman, 2000). Ultimately, breakthroughs in table potato and seed-tuber marketing will depend on controlling sprouting with breeding, transgenic strategies, or environmentally friendly agents that pose low health risks.

University of Idaho research has shown that cultivation can cause potato tuber yield and quality losses. Potato yields could decline by 32% without herbicides. An estimated 90% of Idaho acreage is infested by nightshade sp. There are four main herbicides labeled which can provide nightshade control, however, these herbicides have caused potato crop injury, tuber yield and quality losses. Since potato is a minor crop, many crop protection manufacturers consider the potato market too small to invest development dollars and will not likely develop new potato-specific herbicides in the near future or expand potato herbicide labels with additional application timings. The Tri-State Breeding Program traditionally conduct metribuzin tolerance trials with not-yet-released cultivars. However, these and recently released varieties are not generally tested for tolerance to other, newer potato herbicides such as dimethenamid-p, flumioxazin, or fomesafen. The specialty variety market is growing so there is a definite need for information about variety tolerance to these herbicides. Hairy nightshade has been shown to serve as a significant alternate host to major potato diseases such as Potato Virus Y and Potato Leafroll Virus as well as being the preferred host for green peach aphid - the principal PVY and PLRV vector and also serve as a bridge for late blight and some nematodes that are devastating to potatoes, during the crop rotation years when potatoes are not present in a field. The potato industry has identified PVY as one of its most serious disease problems and is looking for ways to reduce overall disease incidence below an economic threshold and to eliminate the new tuber necrotic isolates that pose a serious threat to the seed and commercial industries. Need for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, integrated virus-vector-alternate/weed host management plan was strongly expressed by all in attendance. Until 2006, the United States was thought to be Potato Cyst Nematode free. However, PCN has recently been found in southeastern Idaho (2006). PCN eggs hatch in the presence of a host triggered by exudates from the host roots. The threat of PCN in Idaho is that seed potatoes from PCN-infested fields may not be sold to Canada, and trade with other countries also is impacted. Quarantines would affect the potato industry as well as any agricultural commodity shipped from the regulated areas and carrying soil (e.g. all nursery, turf, root, and tuber crops) in the regulated areas. Several eradication strategies are being evaluated as tools to aide in the eradication effort including use of trap crops. Solanum sisymbriifolium is a trap crop being researched and sold in Europe to remove PCN from infested soils. The plant does not allow the nematodes to complete their life cycle and reproduce. Since S. sisymbriifolium can become a noxious weed in warmer climates, introduction of it as a trap crop should be tempered with research to determine how to control weedy volunteers of the crop in an overall management scheme for use."

However, substantial increases in transportation, fuel, fertilizer, pesticide and processing costs and changing consumer preferences have created an even greater need for improved potato production efficiency and nutritional quality. Potato production efficiency must therefore be improved to offset increasing transportation and finishing costs, and to keep the industry competitive with ever increasing foreign imports. Future improvement clearly depends on the introduction of new potato varieties because the dominant varieties currently grown, such as Russet Burbank and Russet Norkotah, have serious production and quality limitations. New potato varieties with reduced requirements for fertilizer, water and pesticide inputs offer improved yield, processing quality and nutritional characteristics while reducing the demand for pesticides and limited fertilizer and water resources. Improved varieties should also reduce unit production costs, provide more uniform quality for fresh-pack and processing, decrease storage losses, and enhance processing recovery Results from this project will therefore be used to promote adoption of new potato varieties as a way to reduce inputs, improve economic returns, and promote sustainable production practices. The results will also immediately benefit the estimated producers already growing newly released varieties by supplying detailed management recommendations that will allow reductions in pesticide, fertilizer and irrigation inputs. As improved varieties are adopted, quality and production efficiency will continue to improve, fertilizer and pesticide inputs will decrease, and environmental impact will be lessened. The overall impact will be to maintain or improve the competitiveness of the Northwest potato industry, assist farmers to retain their way of life, and improve the safety and quality of the work environment for all involved in potato production. Consumers will also benefit through the increased availability of more nutritional potato products and improved environmental quality."

U.S. Agriculture is also impacted by such external factors as trade legislation, environmental regulations, weather conditions (drought, floods, freezes, etc.), diseases (wind borne, seed borne, and insect borne) and market structures in sectors or businesses which purchase agricultural products as inputs. Agricultural commodity policies have even been blamed for contributing to America's epidemic of obesity. High prices for grains are said to be the result of ethanol policies. Obviously agricultural producers are likely to face many and varied challenges in the near future. Idaho's economy is still largely resource based and therefore the economic health of the state depends in no small measure on the economic health of Idaho agriculture. Idaho agriculture has witnessed steady but dramatic, changes over the last decade. Dairy production has supplanted potatoes as Idaho's number one agricultural output. A large manufacturer of Greek yogurt has decided to locate in Idaho, increasing the demand for a steady supply of quality milk. Still, establishment of new animal agriculture businesses faces stiff opposition from the general public. This is due to the perceived externalities which would result in negative environmental impacts in areas near the proposed business. Existing dairy and livestock businesses are also impacted by public opinion and changes in environmental regulations. Persistent and short term drought conditions continue to plague much of the Western United States. This season's snow pack is well below averages and that portends the lack of irrigation water for the coming growing season. Drought conditions impact not only crop agriculture, but livestock production as well. Irrigated and dryland agriculture are both impacted, particularly when the irrigated areas depend on winter precipitation to fill the reservoir system for summer irrigation. Competing uses of water, including the need for increased flows to help the salmon runs, also impact agriculture. Changing crop production patterns in the face of gradual climate change will impact the quality and quantity of crops grown. These persistent issues will continue to impact the production patterns across Idaho in terms of crops, rotations, and best management practice. Economic analysis of impacts on agriculture from changes in these myriad factors can improve society's understanding of how changes in public policies will affect the agricultural sector. Such analysis will also aid in the design of better public policies, since policy makers will possess better information on the outcomes of various proposed policies. On the other side of the policy process, farmers and agribusiness must be aware of possible policy changes and their impacts on their businesses."

Costs associated with foodborne illnesses are approximately $23 billion every year. Over the past 30 years, listeriosis caused by L. monocytogenes has become a major foodborne disease. There are now over 1500 cases of listeriosis reported every year with 260 fatalities. Pregnant women, infants, and people with compromised immune system are at serious risk. Outbreaks of listeriosis in the early 1980s made the FDA and USDA establish a zero policy on Ready-to-eat (RTE) foods in which the occurrence of L. monocytogenes is considered unacceptable. Seafood has often been associated with foodborne listeriosis outbreaks. Occurrence of L. monocytogenes in RTE seafood ranges from 6% to 36% and can even reach 78%. The FDA/USDA risk assessment included smoked seafood in the list of foods that are at high risk of causing human listeriosis on a per annum basis. Consumer demand for minimally processed seafood has been on the rise. Therefore, there has been a great interest in developing efficient methods to control foodborne pathogens in foods by the use of naturally occurring antimicrobial agents. An alternative approach to control L. monocytogenes is the use of edible films with incorporated antimicrobial systems. Antimicrobial edible films can be used to improve microbiological food safety by reducing the risk of microbiological contamination by prolonged antimicrobial activity on the surface of the food. Edible films are made from various film forming substances that contain protein and carbohydrates. One of the main factors in choosing a raw material for film formation is the cost. The material chosen for packaging should not add much cost to the product. Potato processing waste is an inexpensive and readily available material. Each year approximately 10 billion pounds of potato processing waste is generated within the United States. Essential oils are volatile aromatic liquids obtained from various plant materials. Use of essential oils to preserve foods can ensure food safety by satisfying the consumers demand for minimally processed or natural foods. Essential oils from oregano, bay laurel, Spanish lavender and fennel show antibacterial activity against various foodborne pathogens. Of the essential oils studied, oregano essential oil has shown more antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes. The objectives of the study is to develop potato peel waste-based edible films with incorporated oregano essential oil, determine the physical properties of the films, and study their antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes inoculated onto the surface of cold-smoked salmon. The films have the potential to inhibit L. monocytogenes on cold-smoked salmon and other RTE seafood and thus ensure the safety of the foods. Demonstration of the effectiveness of the films developed in this study will likely increase the use of potato peel waste."

Most agronomic crops encountering environmental stresses result in reduced crop yields. While lower yields are a major concern for most agronomic crops, there is an additional concern for ornamental horticultural crops, their aesthetic beauty which includes the floral display. When plants encounter environmental stresses, the senescence process is often accelerated. Plants that have wilted or died because of environmental stresses are not marketable, resulting in loss of investment for growers. Poor post-production environments for floriculture crops can result in up to 20% of a crop being lost. A large portion of these losses are associated with accelerated senescence caused by exposure to environmental stresses. During shipping and retailing, floriculture crops likely encounter various stresses that can hasten the senescence process. These environmental stresses will cause a decrease in crop quality, accelerated senescence, and decreased aesthetic beauty. To maintain the post-production quality of these crops, efficient measures to prevent damages from such stresses desire to be developed. According to USDA report in 2011, sales of annual bedding and garden plants in the U.S. amount to $1.91 billion, which is 46% of all floriculture sales in the U.S. Petunia is one of the top five bedding plants sold in the U.S. Petunia is a member of the Solanaceae family along with valuable food crops such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), potato (Solanum tuberosum), and pepper (Capsicum annuum). Petunias will be used in this project as a model system. Petunias are relatively easy to transform and a large amount of genomic information is now available. An in-depth evaluation of ornamental crops and their genetic responses to environmental stresses will provide valuable information regarding the function of gene(s) involved in stress signal transduction and interaction with plant hormones and/or developmental cues. With identification of genes that are important to drought and/or heat stress, generation of transgenic plants with enhanced tolerance will be important not only to the floriculture industry but to horticulture and agricultural in general. Thus, the research projects to identify genes that contribute to drought and heat stress tolerance and to develop petunias tolerant to such stresses are very important to achieve those objectives. Information obtained from this research will not only expand our knowledge of drought/heat stress mechanism but also benefit the industry for the expansion of ornamental crop production throughout West Virginia."

Of particular concern is the Potyviridae family, which causes 30% of the most damaging crop viral diseases and responsible to up to 60-100% of crop losses in the US and worldwide. This family encompasses one of the major threats in potato production and seed potato certification, here in Wisconsin, Potato virus Y, with its new emerging tuber necrotic strains, which make it difficult for growers to identify in the field and can results in seed downgrading or rejection. The aim of this proposal is to harness tools in biology and in bioinformatic to study potyviral infection to understand of mechanism of viral pathogen resistance and contribute in safe and effective control of viral pathogens. Recessive resistance genes have been reported as another efficient barrier against plant viral infection and open door for exploitation in plant breeding. While the precise role of the reported recessive genes against potyviral infections has yet to be determined, these host factors have been implicated in translation and as a requirement for successful viral infection of a large variety of agronomically important crops like tomato, pepper, lettuce, pea, wheat and recently potato. The objective of this research project delves into the mechanistic details of RNA viral elements in translation and in the larger context of viral replication and plant virus resistance. Untranslated regions of many RNA virus genomes are known to harbor important functional elements, acting at the RNA primary sequence or secondary or tertiary structure. Such elements may be involved in various aspects of the viral lifecycle. This research proposal address questions  basic to the problems of agriculture in its broadest aspects  and aims to contribute to our knowledge of plant disease resistance genes in agronomical crops by investigating the basic molecular mechanism of viral translation and replication and their requirement for those translation factors. The research from this project will not only be beneficial for other researchers working on viral translation regulation, but it is key and first ground step to study plant virus resistance and resistance durability if exploited in plant breeding."

These horticultural crops usually have pests that affect the harvested part of the plant, and thus have low tolerances for injury resulting in frequent applications of pesticides. This is true both in the United States, as well as many developing countries, where these crops contribute both in the family diet as well as being distributed in local markets. There is a need to develop pest management programs for high-value horticultural crops that minimize insecticide use, to prevent pesticide residues at harvest, but to also slow the development of pesticide resistance. Movement of insect pests is a global issue; while most Americans are aware of earlier and more recent arrivals here in North America (gypsy moth, Japanese beetle, European corn borer, Asian longhorned beetle, emerald ash borer, etc), some pests of American origin cause significant economic impact in other countries (Colorado potato beetle and grape phylloxera in Europe, fall webworm and red turpentine beetle in Asia). When an invasive pest attacks a restricted host range, as with emerald ash borer, the impact may be severe, but nevertheless restricted to that crop or plant species. However, if an invasive pest is highly polyphagous, such as Japanese beetle (Pfeiffer in press), its establishment can cause economic loss over a much wider span of the agroecosystem; this impact continues over years. There are currently two new invasive insects from Asia that are threatening all fruit and vegetable crops grown in the US: brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB) (Halyomorpha halys) and spotted wing drosophila (SWD) [Drosophila suzukii). Fruit producers need pest management practices that control these pests without resulting in excessive pesticide residues on harvested fruit or disrupting populations of beneficial natural enemies of other pests. The American food supply is increasingly international in origin. Not only are exotic fruits and vegetables in our stores, but even more conventional crops like tomato and cabbage are often imported from other countries. It is important that pest management practices in these countries do not result in pesticide residues, in order to protect our public. Furthermore, humanitarian concerns dictate that pest management practices in developing countries do not put farmers and their families at risk."

In addition to the impacts of climate change and urbanization of rural areas, these changes have been driven by the substantial price increases of non-renewable energy sources. Because of these shifts in land use, there is an increased necessity to integrate land and water management in order to sustain yields and profitability in farming systems. In particular, maintaining high quality soil and water is a challenge in both annual and perennial irrigated crops. To solve this problem, the agricultural community must implement emerging technologies that improve water use efficiency, nutrient recycling, and soil and water conservation. Through its development of integrated soil, water and nutrient management practices, the results of this project will contribute to the creation of a more sustainable agricultural production system in the PNW region. The rationale underlying the proposed project is that growers will have new techniques and information for growing their crops sustainably and profitably. We expect an increase in the number of growers in the PNW who use techniques and information that subsequently improves the availability of abundant and quality produce for food, feed and bioenergy. We will address the stated objectives through field and laboratory research we conduct in collaboration with different stakeholders. Crop nutrient recommendations and innovative soil quality management practices for target crops will be developed based on secondary and primary field and controlled-environment research data. Experiments will be designed to integrate soil and water quality improvement experiments, nutrient response trials, in-season soil and tissue analysis methods, and remote sensing tools. Field experiments with durations ranging from three to five years will be implemented and adequately replicated at several distinctly located research sites. Studies will be conducted using common experimental designs, such as randomized complete block with at least three replications and different arrangements (factorial, split plot, strip plot, fractional, etc). Plot sizes will be determined to accommodate specific experiment requirements. When required, fresh and dry biomass/forage yields will be estimated from representative areas selected randomly within the experimental plots. Soil samples from study areas will be collected before planting to establish the initial soil chemical properties at different depths. Additional soil and tissue samples will be collected and analyzed during the crop growing period and at harvest. We will compare soil quality parameters, yields and econometrics. Crops targeted by the proposed research include tree fruits, cellulostic and biodiesl biofuel, hops, potato, and other crops that are widely grown in the Columbia Basin irrigated area. We plan to impact 20-30% of producers through education and outreach efforts. The project impacts will be assessed using established monitoring and evaluation methods."

These new plants are especially pronounced in the herbaceous plant material (annual bedding plants, herbaceous perennials, roses, daylilies, etc) segment of the industry. Organized plant trials in a simulated consumer and/or commercial landscape setting generate useful information on the suitability of particular ornamental plants in different geographical areas and hardiness/heat zones. Regional and state plant trials have led to successful programs such as Louisiana Select, Mississippi Medallion, Texas Superstars, Florida Plants of the Year, and others. In addition, more studies are needed to determine the  real  landscape performance in regional areas of such nationally promoted plants as All-America Selections (bedding, flower, and vegetable) winners, All-America Rose Selections, All-America daylily winners, and others. A Louisiana green industry survey in 2003 identified ornamental plant evaluation as a top research priority. A recent survey of the board of directors of the Louisiana Nursery and Landscape Association also found new plant material evaluation is a high priority research area. The Louisiana Super Plant promotion, marketing and recommendation program was initiated by the LSU AgCenter in 2010. At the present time in the Southeastern and South Central United States, the largest organized plant evaluations, primarily of warm season annual trials, are conducted at the LSU AgCenter's Hammond Research Station, Dallas Arboretum, Texas A&M University's Research Center in Overton, University of Georgia - Athens, Mississippi State University Truck Crops Experiment Station (Crystal Springs), and Mississippi State University's South Mississippi Branch Experiment Station (Poplarville). In addition, there are a number of All-America Selections display and trial gardens in these states. Previous research in the area of ornamental plant performance in landscape settings has evaluated daylilies, crape myrtles, cool season annual bedding plants, warm season annual bedding plants, lantanas, ornamental grasses, ornamental sweet potatoes, roses, gingers, and other ornamentals. Currently, this effort is continuing and on-going at the Hammond Research Station in Hammond (USDA Hardiness Zone 8b and AHS Heat Zone 9) and at the Burden Center in Baton Rouge. These trials result in People's Choice Landscape Award winners and also result in listings of plants available for Louisiana Super Plant (www.lsuagcenter.com/superplants) possible selection. Problems generally seen in the landscape performance of herbaceous ornamentals includes cultivar selection, inappropriate planting times, issues with growing/planting media in landscape beds (pH and physical properties), disease pressure, weed issues, mulching, and poor irrigation monitoring."

In 2008, Louisiana faced the destructive insect-vectored plant pathogen, citrus greening which is transmitted by Asian citrus psyllid. Finding of citrus greening resulted in a quarantine of citrus stock sales in two Louisiana parishes (Orleans and Washington). This disease can affect yield, leading to decline and eventual tree death. If citrus greening reaches Plaquemines parish, the leading citrus-producing parish in Louisiana, a total loss of gross farm value would be $4.1 million. In addition, potential new insect vectored plant disease threats exist for Louisiana, such as laurel wilt a fungus pathogen transmitted by the redbay ambrosia beetle. Without an IPM strategy for insect vectored plant pathogens, losses to Louisiana agriculture could be immense. Of EIDs, plant viruses compromise the largest group (47%). Plant viruses can adversely affect agricultural production, being costly to both grower and consumer by limiting yield and impacting quality. For example, the two most important virus pathogens affecting potato production are Potato virus Y (PVY) and Potato leafroll virus (PLRV). These aphid transmitted viruses can reduce yields by as much as 80% with a net loss of $2 billion per year. In sweetpotato, aphid transmitted viruses reduced yields by 30 to 40%. For Louisiana sweetpotato, this could be a potential loss of $16 million. Interactions with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (whitefly transmitted) and Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (aphid transmitted) can cause up to 90% loss. Barley yellow dwarf virus and Cereal yellow dwarf virus, two luteovirues infecting wheat, can reduce yields by 20% in the Midwest. For Louisiana, this could result in $5.2 million. One of the main reasons plant viruses are on the rise is due to changes in vector populations. Of the 531 known vectors of plant viruses, 85% are transmitted by insects and of those, 37% are transmitted by aphids. In North America, the single biggest change in vector populations has been the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura. This has had a profound impact on seed potato production in the Midwest. Current environmental conditions and global climate change favor aphid population growth and thus, favor increased virus transmission. Clearly, viruses and virus vectors can have an incredible impact on U.S. agriculture. To effectively manage insect-vectored pathogens, knowledge of the interactions between the susceptible hosts, viable virus inoculum, favorable environment and insect vector are needed. For most agricultural production systems, these interactions are poorly understood."

Use sequence motifs derived from Eggplant latent viroid (ELVd) to redirect mRNAs encoding enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis into the chloroplast.  Approach: This project seeks to elucidate specific signaling mechanisms that are involved in plant disease resistance.  Plants respond to biotic stress by the integration of responses located in two different cellular compartments, the symplast and the apoplast. Improvement of existing resistance to plant disease requires a more comprehensive understanding of key apoplastic and symplastic responses to pathogen invasion and how they are integrated.  In the apoplast, we will examine the complex interplay between secondary metabolites and redox signaling that controls early events in bacterial and viroid pathogenesis as well as other responses triggered by long distance signaling.  In the symplast, we will examine the molecular interactions between viroids and their hosts to determine how these small RNA molecules replicate and move between organelles within a single cell or over long distances between cells.  The long-term objective of this multidisciplinary project is to understand the role of plant-pathogen signaling in disease resistance in sufficient detail that novel strategies can be developed to render plants resistant/immune to pathogen infection.  In the intermediate term, we will test the ability of certain viroid-derived targeting signals to redirect mRNAs to the chloroplast, thereby adding novel biosynthetic capabilities to chloroplast metabolism with the need for chloroplast genome transformation."

Approach: Viruses and cyst nematodes present the United States potato industry with its most severe regula-tory problems. This project primarily focuses on potato cyst nematodes (PCN), Potato virus Y (PVY), and Luteoviruses including Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) and the viruses causing barley yellow dwarf disease of cereal crops. The two species of PCN (Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida) are quaran-tine pests that cause direct crop losses, increase pest control costs, constrain cropping patterns, de-value property, and interfere with domestic and international trade of potato and many other soil-associated crops.  PVY and PLRV cause crop losses, interfere with marketing and trade of potato, and are the major diseases targeted by seed potato certification programs.  Additionally, management options for vector-borne viruses are extremely limited and an understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses are carried between hosts by insects will lead to new targets of opportunity to control these pathogens. In recent years, PCN and the necrotic strains of PVY have been spreading to new areas.  It has been determined that the population genetics of PCN and viral pathogens are far more dynamic than previously thought, and these genetic shifts profoundly influence disease detection and management strategies.  The overarching research goal is to develop an understanding of the major genetic and environmental factors that drive the dynamics of nematode and virus diseases. Multifaceted objectives needed to accomplish this research goal include: the improvement of detection and management strategies of the various pathogen populations, the identification of genetic mechanisms that regulate nematode and virus pathogenicity and pathogen movement within the crops, and the development of new sources of resistance in potato germplasm. Approaches include epidemiological and etiological studies to identify major factors contributing to the spread and diversification of these pathogens, fundamental studies of the mechanisms of pathogenesis and transmission of PCN and viruses, respectively and the collaborative development of potato germplasm with effective resistance to PCN and viruses. Rapid identification and containment, coupled with new strategies for management of nematode and virus diseases will help the U.S. potato industry remain viable and allow them to expand market share."

Phenotypic convergence, the appearance of similar forms in independent lineages, provides an opportunity for testing the predictability of genetic evolution. Similar phenotypes in different lineages are often due to similar changes at the genetic level. One possible explanation is that, among the possible mechanisms for producing a particular phenotype, some genetic changes are preferentially fixed during the course of evolution. This project will test the preferential fixation hypothesis by comparing the genetic basis of white flower coloration above and below the species level. The central hypothesis predicts that a wide array of mutations will be responsible for white-flowered mutants within pigmented species, but only a subset of these classes of mutations will be fixed during transitions from pigmented to white flowers at the species level. Using a group of species in the potato family, the PI will apply a combination of genetic, developmental, and biochemical approaches to test this prediction. The results will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between microevolutionary and macroevolutionary change. These studies will have important implications for manipulating and enhancing pigment content in horticultural varieties and crops. Plant pigments, including those targeted by this project, are strong antioxidants that contribute to the positive health benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Thus, a better understanding of how genetic changes affect pigment biosynthesis adds to the potential for improving crop species. The project encompasses local outreach activities for K-12 students in order to promote interest in plant evolutionary biology and to spread awareness about the importance of plant pigments in human health."

Prior work demonstrated that plant genes like those known to confer resistance to pathogens are the targets of a set of  microRNAs --suppressive regulatory RNAs just 22 nucleotides in length. These microRNAs are believed to function as master regulators of a very large family of protein coding disease-resistance genes, and part of their activity is to trigger the production of additional small RNAs (21 nucleotides in length) that have an unusual, regularly spaced pattern, or  phasing  of biogenesis. The regulation of this gene family, and several others targeted by microRNAs in the same way, is a new paradigm for microRNA function. The investigators have identified these small RNAs as conserved in many crop plants, including soybean, an alfalfa relative, tomato and potato. The aim of this project is to investigate this novel gene regulatory circuit to understand its function in plants, its role in plant defenses or beneficial microbial interactions, and whether it can ultimately be developed as a tool for improving plants or altering plant-microbe interactions to reduce disease or improve beneficial interactions. The project will utilize methods that include plant genomics, plant cell biology, plant-microbial interactions, and RNA analysis. The expected result is the dissection and understanding of a novel and complex gene regulatory mechanism. The broader impacts of the project range from a local impact on the training of students and a post-doc who will be directly involved in the project, to national and international impact to the scientific community in the databases and web tools that the project will release."

The bacterial wilt pathogen, Ralstonia solanacearum, is a root-invading, vascular pathogen that employs a specialized secretion system to deliver a collection of  effector  proteins directly into plant cells.  Effector proteins are thought to promote disease by interfering with plant defenses. This project will identify plant targets of a conserved effector, Rsp1281/PopS, which is present in most R. solanacearum species, is highly expressed within the plant vasculature and is required for full virulence on several plant hosts.  The investigators will use biochemical, microscopic and genomic approaches to identify plant proteins, organelles and pathways that are targeted by this effector. The identification of effector targets of a root-invading pathogen may yield new information about plant defense pathways employed in roots and can be useful for developing wilt resistant crops. Additionally, the majority of the work in this project involves student research, integrating research and education. A total of approximately 100 students will participate in this project, acquiring knowledge and skills that will be important in other STEM courses, in graduate school and for success as future scientists."

Terrestrial application of treated wastewater such as for crop irrigation could simultaneously protect drinking water source quality, by diverting treated waste effluents from sensitive aquatic ecosystems while reducing demand for drinking water. This project will optimize green infrastructure designs including aerobic vegetated sand filtration (VSF) in combination with subsurface flow (SSF) constructed wetlands for removal of chemicals of anthropogenic origin in wastewater and investigate the extent to which residual chemicals in the reclaimed water accumulate in the edible portions of crops irrigated with this type of water. The project will systematically evaluate how changes to the operation of VSF and SSF can optimize trace organic contaminant and pathogen removal to minimize measureable differences between crops irrigated with such reclaimed water and those irrigated with tap water. This will be achieved through two approaches; a laboratory column study that simulates the treatment designs will investigate the combination of different processes and filter substrates for this optimization using a characterized domestic effluent, and the treated water will then be used in a greenhouse to irrigate a variety of crops including potatoes, soybeans, and leafy vegetables selected because of differences in known properties of chemical uptake or rejection alongside controls conventionally grown with tap water. Specifically, we will determine whether crops irrigated with such waters reject the pollutants making them viable for consumption or if the crops uptake the pollutants and, if so, might they be used as an additional remediation tool for wastewater treatment. Changes to the operation of the green infrastructure design process determined from the laboratory study will then be transferred to full-scale operation and the viability of the optimized process towards crop growth evaluated onsite. The project will, therefore, demonstrate whether more widespread use of similar designs and the use of reclaimed water in this manner could be part of a managed approach to pollutant remediation and crop irrigation, thereby saving freshwater for more critical needs. The project will provide a better understanding of how vegetation and crops respond to the presence of wastewater constituents in their environment. Most wastewater treatment systems are not specifically designed to remove man-made chemicals from the influent waste and so by evaluating the fundamental treatment processes in a laboratory-controlled environment, design can be better optimized to improve treated water quality. Moreover,  the project results will show whether wastewater constituents are taken up by the crops (in which case such a process has implications for a remediation technology) or whether the crops are resistant to uptake (in which case a more widespread use of recycled wastewater in crop irrigation can be considered). The use of green infrastructure design for the effective removal of wastewater contaminants at the site of their entry into wastewater has broader impacts on the disbursal of these contaminants throughout the wider environment as is typical in wastewater discharges from centralized wastewater treatment plants. Upgrading such plants to target individual contaminants and prevent their disbursal will likely prove expensive whereas with on-site treatment, cost can be staged and treatment more effectively targeted to individual pollutants. The project will also provide policymakers with valuable information to assist with determining safe operating practices and will help to improve public perception regarding the safe use of reclaimed water."

This loss can occur through leaching into the groundwater, which harms water quality, or through bacterial conversion to gaseous N or nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a strong greenhouse gas that causes global warming. Climate change may alter snowfall patterns, which could affect soil N cycling. To study these potential effects, Dr. Brin will conduct a 2-year field experiment to examine how snow depth affects N2O production, the amount of N in the soil, and the soil bacteria that produce N2O. She will also conduct a laboratory experiment to examine how snowmelt and refreezing affect soil N processes.By adding to our knowledge of winter N cycling, this project may help managers in both the United States and Canada improve practices to avoid N losses from agricultural fields. Furthermore, results from this work may be useful for modeling climate change effects and feedbacks.

The number of taxa with a given trait is shaped largely by the transition rates toward and away from that state as well as the diversification rates for taxa with the trait.  This project will test the role of these macroevolutionary forces in shaping the distribution of red flowers in the potato family, Solanaceae.  Although red-flowered taxa are spread across 13 genera, they are extremely rare, accounting for only 1% of the roughly 2850 species in the family. Using phylogenetic, anatomical, and biochemical methods, this project will (1) identify the origins and mechanistic basis for red coloration in Solanaceae, (2) test the hypothesis that red flowers remain rare due to reduced rates of diversification, and (3) examine whether this effect is contingent on the developmental pathway involved.This research will bring new insight into the range of developmental pathways employed during convergent evolution and the extent to which those mechanisms affect the evolutionary success of lineages.  Moreover, the plant pigments targeted by this project have important health benefits for humans, and understanding their evolution in flowers may lead to increased potential for improving pigment content in related crop plants (e.g., potato and tomato).

Lippman (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)Co-PIs: Michael C. Schatz (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) and Joyce Van Eck (Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research)Key Collaborators: Molly Hammell and Jesse Gillis (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)  Plants show remarkable variation in the number of flowers they produce during their lifetime. This widespread variation traces back to differences in how, when, and where plants switch from making leaves to making flowers - the flowering transition. Although vitally important to crop yields, the transition to flowering and the subsequent effects on shoot growth and flower production remain poorly understood in many types of plants. For example, it is still not known why one plant will form just a single flower each time there is a flowering transition, as in pepper, and yet another plant will grow dozens of branches bearing hundreds of flowers, as in some types of tomato. To address this fundamental question in plant biology, this project is uniting a unique set of genetic, genomic, and natural variation tools in tomato and related Solanaceae plants, such as pepper, potato, and petunia, to reveal the genes and networks controlling how, when, and where plants undergo flowering transitions throughout development to continuously generate new branches and flowers. By analyzing a wide range of tomato mutants and wild Solanaceae species reflecting a wide range of flower production, this research will identify and characterize the differences in gene expression and DNA sequences that underlie variation in flowering transitions and flower production. This multi-dimensional project will provide the most detailed information yet on the key genetic regulators that drive the initiation and production of flowers in both agricultural and wild plants, which will enable the application of novel strategies to improve crop yields. The Solanaceae comprise the most valuable family for vegetable crop production, and we will deliver to both the public and scientific community broad genetic and genomic data in tomato, pepper, and edible wild Solanaceae species that have the potential to become agriculturally important crops.This project will train high school and college students in interdisciplinary plant research, and a unique outreach program has been developed with an elementary school in Queens, New York to excite young students about plant biology and to explain the importance of integrating multiple research disciplines to create the knowledge and tools that will ensure food security. Students will meet scientists, experience plant genetic research in their own school, experiment in a  Virtual Greenhouse  with kid-friendly genetics games, and practice science writing. Each year, several students will be awarded a daylong visit to CSHL to experience firsthand, modern plant biology research. All data from this project, including gene expression, genetic mapping, network analyses, and computational tools for analyzing DNA sequences will be made publically available immediately after passing quality control.

All sectors of the potato market are present in this region, including fry and chip processing, fresh market, and specialty types. Changes in climate, consumer preference, production economics, and environmental regulations require continual innovation in the potato industry, and plant breeding is critical to meeting these evolving demands. This proposal, which is a joint effort of the breeding programs at the University of Wisconsin, Michigan State University, North Dakota State University, and the University of Minnesota, has three main objectives: (1) Develop potato varieties for release and adoption in the North Central region and North America; (2) Evaluate germplasm for resistance to key diseases and insect pests; (3) Use previously validated genetic markers to screen early generations and conduct QTL mapping studies to identify new markers for variety development. The four project directors and their collaborators have the requisite experience, facilities, and stakeholder relationships to successfully complete these objectives.

We have IPM guidelines for single crops, but the goal of this project is to develop IPM guidelines and tactics and provide education and outreach that will be appropriate for diverse vegetable and fruit farms, both organic and conventional. We will advance IPM implementation through collaboration and interaction with our Mentor and Partner farms.  Mentor farms  are run by growers who are building a farm-wide comprehensive IPM program for their operation. Farm goals will be set and visits will be conducted through the season with an evaluation at the end. It is anticipated that, over the course of the 3-year project, current Mentor farms will graduate from the program and new farms will join in their place.  Partner farms  will have one issue of focus on one crop and will be sites for trials with novel IPM techniques. These farmers will share results in a publication and/or meeting with other growers. Partner farms will vary from year to year and provide an excellent forum for growers to see, first-hand, how IPM techniques work and how they are developed and for Extension personnel to understand, first-hand, the complexity of decision making on the farm. Twilight meetings held throughout the season at Mentor and Partner farms will provide an excellent avenue to communicate knowledge and experience with practical IPM adoption, not only from Extension personnel to grower, but from grower to grower. Extension of IPM knowledge will happen one-on-one during site visits, during biweekly Mentor Farm visits (Extension personnel interacting with several farm staff), twilight meetings where Extension personnel and growers exchange information on a scale of 15-50 people, and through social media outlets such as web sites, newsletters, and text alerts (engaging 100&#39;s of growers). Promotion of pollinator diversity and sustainability is an issue that cuts across commodity and pest management approaches. We will start our focus on cranberry production areas, but anticipate that the knowledge we gain will be adaptable to other commodities in the future. We will encourage the adoption of habitat improvement and will educate growers how to promote the populations of native pollinators and how to identify pollinators and parasitoids. Another component of theproject involves the use of the Network of Environmental and Weather Applications (NEWA). NEWA evaluates key pests in several fruit and vegetable crops and is useful for IPM implementation. We will train growers who have weather stations on their farms on the best ways to maintain and use this tool for IPM implementation. We will provide information, gather from pest and environmental monitoring, that will promote timely pest management decisions. Cultural techniques and baiting will be promoted by project personnel for control of several key tree fruit pests. Organic, biological, and reduced-risk treatments for vegetable pests will be demonstrated and their adoption will be encouraged over the course of this project. Late blight of potato and tomato is a significant disease of concern for MA vegetable growers. Proper identification is needed to provide growers with the correct information to manage this disease. Phytophthora capsici, a relatively new disease of peppers, pumpkins, and squash has become firmly established in many farms in MA and southern New England. We will provide diagnostic support and will create and distribute educational materials related to proper disease management on diversified organic and conventional farms."

Although historically small grains, potatoes, sugar beets, and beans represented the primary crops, a surge in dairy production has lifted Idaho to the 3rd largest dairy-producing state in the U.S. Over 70% of the dairy cattle within the State reside within the south-centrally located Magic Valley. Idaho also has 115 permitted aquaculture facilities with approximately 98% of those facilities also located within the Magic Valley. Rainbow trout are most important in that Idaho provides approximately 70% of the domestic supply. Annual precipitation within the region averages less than 300 mm, thus making the Snake River a key resource linking crop production, dairy operations, and aquaculture. Critical to continued sustainability of agriculture in this region is irrigation water from Snake River dams, water that once applied to crops moves quickly through the sandy soils to shallow aquifers that drain back into the Snake River. Thus any contaminants originating from municipal or agricultural sources and transported through the soils are available in downstream waters reused for irrigation or for aquaculture. The ability of agricultural soils to attenuate transport and obviate the threat of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) such as hormones, antibiotics, and other veterinary drugs to environmental quality and downstream aquaculture operations is unknown. Our objective is to determine the capacity of soils in the Eastern Snake River Plain to attenuate the transport of biologically active concentrations of CECs contributed from irrigated, dairy manure-amended fields, thereby improving the sustainability of crop production, dairy operations, and aquaculture. We propose to not only identify and quantify potentially harmful CECs, but to assess biological impacts with respect to endocrine disruption and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Both field and laboratory studies will be conducted to identify harmful CECs (hormones, antibiotics, and other veterinary drugs) and Cu in manure and manure-amended agricultural samples and determine the potential biological impacts. Data will be used to construct a model that will predict the fate of CECs in the environment and whether those CECs will be potentially harmful to agricultural sustainability and human health. Our data will contribute to developing best management practices designed to minimize negative environmental consequences associated with the land application of dairy manure in an irrigated environment of critical importance to three major agricultural industries."

The problem is exacerbated by challenging economic times and increasing food costs that put pressure on consumers to purchase lower priced meals, which may be of inferior nutritional value and/or contain excessive proportions of animal fat. Whereas many ingredients can lower fat and calorie contents of foods, their use is limited because, compared with full-fat, full-calorie alternatives (i) they are of limited nutritional value; (ii) their eating properties are inferior, and (iii) they cost more. Therefore, there is an urgent need for fat replacement food ingredients that are (i) more nutritious; (ii) have improved eating properties; and (iii) cost less. Fiberstar Bio&#39;s platform technology extracts fibers from surplus natural plant materials in an innovative method that allows the fibrous material to rehydrate readily, a unique property that is key to replacing the favorable eating properties conferred by fats. The innovative technology was used in developing the Citri-Fi&reg; line of food ingredients, introduced in 2004. Citri-Fi is a line of unique, multi-functional fibers derived from orange pulp. Citri-Fi tightly binds moisture to improve quality and yields; partially replacing oil, fat, eggs and meat to reduce costs; and replacing less label-friendly ingredients to improve label declarations. However, Citri-Fi&reg; requires orange pulp (the material left over from orange juice manufacture) as its input raw material, and the continued use of Citri-Fi&reg; is quickly exhausting the available supply of orange pulp. Moreover, only ~50% of fat can be replaced by Citri-Fi&reg;--above this level, eating properties of several foods is diminished. In this SBIR Phase I project, we successfully tested alternative sources of raw material, and modified the manufacturing process at laboratory scale, in order to begin to address the raw material supply challenge we are facing with Citri-Fi&reg;, and to determine whether alternatives may be able to replace more than 50% of the fats normally present in popular foods. We identified several promising alternative fibrous raw materials (sugar beet pulp, citrus peel, inner segment membranes from citrus fruit, and potato fiber), and in this SBIR Phase II application, we now propose to identify an optimum raw material and process for a new fat substitute. Briefly, we propose (i) to expand processes developed in Phase I from laboratory to pilot plant scale; (ii) to test whether the products made at pilot scale match the properties of the same products made at lab scale; (iii) to incorporate the products into several different foods and perform compositional, stability, and functionality testing to assess their performance in end products; (iv) to carry out preliminary process engineering work and develop economic models; (v) to rank the raw materials for their commercial potential; (vi) to confirm the raw material&#39;s long-term availability; then, based on these prior steps, (vii) select the one best raw material for subsequent steps to prepare for commercialization; (viii) carry out testing and prepare documents to ensure the material meets the criteria for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status; (ix) prepare documentation for customer usage; and (x) send samples of the new fat substitute to selected customers and elicit their feedback."

Thus, vector behavior can affect pathogen epidemiology. Potato leafroll virus (PLRV), which is primarily transmitted by the potato-peach aphid (Myzus persicae), causes one of the most serious diseases of potato (Solanum tuberosum) worldwide, reducing crop yield by 40-70%. The objectives of my proposed research are to investigate the molecular mechanisms that underpin potato-M. persicae-PLRV interactions and determine the functions of specific PLRV proteins in vector-plant relationships and virus epidemiology. By studying potato gene expression, metabolic and protein responses to PLRV and M. persicae, I will test the hypothesis that PLRV-induced changes increase nutrient availability for aphids and suppress potato defense responses. In addition, I will clone and express each of the nine PLRV proteins in transgenic potatoes and tobacco. Using insect bioassays and biochemical screens, I will determine the impact of individual PLRV proteins on plant-aphid interactions. My proposed research will promote the development of novel virus-vector control strategies in crop plants, thus leading to reduced pesticide use and increased food safety. By studying the mechanisms mediating plant-virus-vector interactions, I will address the following program challenge and foundational areas: (1) Plant health and production and plant products; (2) Food safety, nutrition, and health; (3) Agriculture systems and technology; and (4) Food security."

Moreover, application of auxin is indispensable for horticulture and tissue culture and auxinic herbicides have long been important in weed control. Although much of the basic research on auxin is being conducted in Arabidopsis, this research is on processes of importance to crop productivity. For example, in the root, auxin controls primary root elongation and lateral root initiation, in the shoot, auxin controls branching and during reproductive development, auxin controls anther fertility, carpel structure and fruit development. Auxin plays a critical role in seedling establishment due to its control of the response to light, gravity and shade. Auxin is also a key player in the response to abiotic stress. Auxin levels increase with increasing temperature and auxin is also involved in the response to drought and salt stress. There is a significant amount of auxin research being conducted in crop plants, such as maize, soybean, rice, tomato and grape, which will also be represented at the meeting. For example, auxin regulates fruit development in tomato, nodulation in soybeans, tuber formation in potato and ear development in corn . Research on auxin is also relevant to the biofuels industry as auxin controls vascular development and plays a significant role in wood formation in trees Therefore, research on auxin is highly relevant to crop productivity and sustainability in the US. These research areas will be discussed at the meeting as invited talks, posters, and talks chosen from submitted. The purpose of this meeting is to bring together researchers from the US, Asia, Australia and Europe to dissect the mechanism of action of this critical plant hormone. This funding will provide partial support for US speakers to attend the Auxin 2012 Conference."

Tomato products are a leading source of vitamins and mineral nutrients in the American diet. A much wider genetic base than exists in commercial cultivars has been and continues to be necessary for breeding improved tomato varieties. In particular, the wild tomato species are the main source of improved disease and pest resistance, drought tolerance, improved yield and quality, etc. In certain cases, access to these traits can be limited by reproductive barriers that prevent or impede hybridization with cultivated tomato. Purpose: The purpose of this project is to continue operation of the C.M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center (TGRC) and carry out synergistic research on reproductive barriers and germplasm enhancement. The collection of tomato genetic and wild species stocks held by the TGRC has reached a total of over 3,600 accessions, for which viability and original genetic variability must be maintained. The majority of these accessions exist nowhere else. Many of the wild species populations are now extinct in the native region. The TGRC distributes over 5,000 seed samples annually to researchers and breeders, representing a utilization rate well in excess of 100% relative to the number of accessions held. Each year, nearly 100 publications mentioning use of TGRC stocks appear in the scientific literature. Interspecific reproductive barriers prevent hybridization between related species in nature and can impede the efforts of plant breeders to transfer genes between species. Knowledge of the genes underlying these reproductive barriers may reveal new breeding strategies to overcome them. This project focuses on reproductive barriers that act prior to fertilization (pre-zygotic), including unilateral incompatibility and self-incompatibility. The SOLANUM SITIENS is a wild tomato relative with unique traits, including tolerance to extreme aridity, salinity and low temperatures, that have not been successfully bred into tomato because of strong crossing barriers. This project will develop a set of cultivated tomato lines with genetic material from S. SITIENS. Each line will contain a segment of DNA, identified with genetic markers, from one of the 12 SITIENS chromosomes. The segments in different lines will overlap so as to represent an entire SITIENS genome in the background of a modern tomato variety. These stocks will be will be made available through the TGRC."

Crops that contribute to the majority of this income include potato (fresh and processed), processing sweet corn, and processing peas. In addition to their on-farm value, these vegetables are economically important to the state for their value added attributes related to their processing. There is also significant interest in Midwest grape and wine production due the recent introductions of cold hardy grape cultivars by the University of Minnesota Fruit Breeding Program. Many of the specialty crops are grown on glacial outwash soils that require high rates of nitrogen and supplemental irrigation to optimize yields. These soils are characterized as excessively drained and vulnerable to losses of nitrate due to leaching, particularly when a shallow rooted crop like potato is grown. Because these crops contribute to the economy of rural Minnesota, there is a need find ways of growing them that will minimize environmental degradation. This project will focus on new generation enhanced efficiency fertilizers and improved diagnostic techniques to achieve this goal. Potatoes can have both positive and negative nutritional value depending on how they are cooked or processed. From a positive standpoint, potatoes have more potassium, vitamin C, and vitamin B1 than many other fruit and vegetable. However, acrylamide, a potential carcinogen, can form when fried. This project will evaluate way of reducing the acrylamide concentration in fried potato products. Grape production for wine has increased dramatically in the upper Midwest over the past 15 years due to the introduction of cold hardy grape cultivars by the University of Minnesota. These cold hardy grape varieties are so new that optimal mineral nutrition and soil management practices have not been established. Growers use leaf or petiole analysis to assess the nutritional status of their vines prior to nutrient supplementation. Unbalanced mineral nutrition can lead to undesirable grape juice properties for wine making. Results from this project will be used to optimize vine growth and wine quality and reduce unnecessary nutrient applications. Most sweet corn in Minnesota is grown on fine textured soil without irrigation. They are grown in areas where loss of nitrogen to surface waters is a concern. With new sweet corn varieties being developed for the processing industry, there is interest in determining if these new varieties can be grown with lower amounts of nitrogen. This project will identify hybrids and growing conditions that minimize nitrogen losses to the environment."

Two species, P. infestans and P. capsici, attack regionally important vegetable crops, including cucurbits, peppers, tomatoes, eggplant and potatoes. In 2007, over 8,000 acres of vegetable crops susceptible to infection by P. capsici and P. infestans were harvested in Massachusetts. Both species are exotic to New England, and have been responsible for disease outbreaks that have resulted in losses totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages. In 2009, an outbreak of P. infestans in the northern U.S. and eastern Canada devastated tomato and potato crops. This outbreak was caused by two unique genotypes of P. infestans, which differed in virulence, host preference, and fungicide resistance. This outbreak highlighted the need to determine the incidence of Phytophthora in Massachusetts farms, and for the development of a rapid disease response system that could accurately identify clonal lineages, new outbreaks, and also predict areas that are most likely to support disease development. The clonal lineage that was predominant in 2009 was US-22 which is highly sensitive to mefenoxam. Mefenoxam is highly effective against sensitive strains but it was not recommended in 2009 because most strains are known to be insensitive to the fungicide. The rapid detection of clonal lineages would allow more effective fungicide recommendations. Phytophthora capsici has become firmly established in many fields in southern New England. Research has shown that P. capsici oospores were viable after exposure to freezing temperatures, allowing the pathogen to over-winter in northern regions. Soil fumigations can, at times, effectively manage P. capsici and P. infestans, while crop rotations are not always successful. Because Phytophthora species sporulate profusely under suitable environmental conditions (excess soil moisture and soil temperatures from 15 to 30 C), if outbreaks are not managed at early stages of development they become too expansive to control. Current disease forecasting models for Phytophthora have been developed for use over large areas, and do not incorporate case-history information or site-level monitoring. While these forecasting models have enormous utility, they cannot provide the resolution required to adequately predict disease outbreaks at the farm-scale in Massachusetts (see http://uspest.org/risk/tom_pot_map). The most fundamental component for an effective risk map, and often the most difficult to obtain, is accurate data on the current distribution of the targeted pathogen. Without this foundation, risk maps cannot accurately predict where and how a pathogen may spread and management plans often fail to meet their objectives."

Because new crops are being grown where cotton has been historically monocultured, the presence and number of plant-parasitic nematodes will likely change. Very little data is available on the economic importance of root-knot, reniform, or lesion nematodes in soybean, peanut, grain sorghum, watermelons, potatoes, or sweet potatoes in Arkansas, but changing cropping systems will alter the nematode communities throughout the state. These changes, will likely create new concerns in some crops, but will also provide an opportunity to manage certain nematodes via crop rotation in areas where diverse cropping systems did not exist. This project will evaluate the current situation regarding the incidence and distribution of known economic nematodes that exist in the state, including a thorough survey of species of root-knot nematodes that are present. Field experience will be obtained through small-plot and microplot studies with various cropping sequences that are either already being practiced by growers or are being seriously considered for economic reasons. The knowledge that is gained from these studies over the next five years will provide a basis for developing rational and effective crop rotation strategies for minimizing the impact of nematodes, an approach that will become increasingly necessary in the face of declining availability of chemical nematicides and increases in nematicide costs."

To date, biocontrol has focused on maximizing predator consumption of pests. However, we now understand that non-lethal effects (NLEs, behavioral and physiological changes induced in prey by presence of predators) can account for up to 50% of the overall predator impact on prey populations. Insect prey can reduce the risk of themselves or their progeny being killed by dispersing or waiting to deposit eggs until predators move away. Although these behaviors reduce predation risk, the costs associated with moving or having fewer offspring can indirectly impact prey density. While NLEs are well documented, the potential impact on pest management in the homogenous habitats typical of agricultural fields and greenhouses has not been explicitly considered. For example, one of the most important greenhouse arthropod pests is the western flower thrips. Resistance to chemical insecticides has increased grower willingness to rely on natural enemy releases for thrips control; however, these releases are not consistently effective. Similarly, the predaceous stink bug is already used as a biological control agent in potato against Colorado potato beetle but is often not sufficiently cost effective. Biological control of thrips and Colorado potato beetle could be improved by quantifying the impact of non-lethal predator effects on prey demographics and using this information to tailor natural enemy deployment strategies used to respond to pest infestations. We know that thrips significantly reduce the number of eggs deposited when near a predator and move to avoid habitats with predators. Although this could have substantial impact on prey density at a population level, the exact size of this impact is not clear. On a very practical level, we expect the project to generate testable strategies for improving the commercial deployment of natural enemies. For example, for thrips it may be most important to release natural enemies at low pest densities so that NLEs can best translate to reduced population growth. For Colorado potato beetle, releasing predators early in the season may reduce oviposition and therefore future larval damage. We also expect to generate natural enemy deployment strategies that have not previously been considered and which can be tested. Improving the reliability and effectiveness of biological control will continue to reduce insecticide applications both as fewer applications are needed and as grower adoption of biocontrol increases. Reduction in insecticide use comes with a concomitant reduction in human health and non-target risks. The proposed project will provide information to extension personnel and growers about non-lethal predator effects and this is one piece of a more long-term goal to develop a robust set of recommendations for use of biological control organisms, such that these tools are more effective and growers who are new to incorporating these organisms in pest control programs achieve successful control outcomes more quickly. The ultimate impact of the proposed work will be to make biological control a reality in many cropping systems."

In potatoes, PVY infection reduces yield and quality, and significantly limits the production of certified seed potatoes. Despite various control measures, PVY is a significant concern for potato production in the US and Canada due to the emergence of new strains, particularly ones that cause tuber necrosis. PVY is transmitted by several species of aphids during feeding. Since aphid feeding periods required for transmission are very brief, insecticides do not provide effective control. The use of border crops and biological control of aphids are likely to be important for limiting PVY, and both control methods are related to the configuration of crops and natural habitats in the landscape. However, research at this scale is lacking. In this project, we will study the importance of landscape complexity for the spread of PVY in potatoes in New York State. To address this issue, we will: 1) Identify landscapes of varying complexity in upstate New York using GIS and ground truthing. 2) Quantify the prevalence of different strains of PVY, aphid diversity and abundance, and natural enemy diversity and abundance in potato fields located in simple and complex landscapes. 3) Evaluate the use of sorghum and wheat border crops for reducing PVY transmission in agricultural landscapes. Our approach will include GIS analysis of landscapes, field studies to measure virus prevalence and insect diversity and abundance, lab assays to identify virus strains, and field experiments to determine the efficacy of border crops as barriers to PVY spread. A primary goal of this research is to enhance our understanding of the spread of different PVY strains by both colonizing and non-colonizing aphid species in landscapes of varying complexity and to evaluate the importance of landscape heterogeneity for biological control of PVY transmission. This research will improve our understanding of landscape controls on insect-vectored pathogens and contribute to developing environmentally sound control of PVY, a pathogen of worldwide importance."

It is grown over a very diverse set of environmental conditions, has significant pest and disease complexes and supplies numerous markets which have increasing demands for higher quality. Unfortunately most available varieties lack multiple resistances, nor have a wide range of adaptation, and hence can require high chemical and cultural practice inputs. Potato production uses fertilizers, insecticides, nematicides, fungicides, herbicides, vine desiccants, and sprout inhibitors, and is second only to apples in chemical control measures. Proposed project plan: This multidisciplinary project is conducted by individuals with expertise in plant breeding, plant pathology, and horticulture. A high priority is given to collaborative working relationships between potato growers, associated industry, Extension staff, state and federal agencies and university researchers. Farm visits, research plots on grower farms, field days, Extension advisory meetings, educational presentations at industry conferences, regional NE1031 workgroup sessions, and Potato Association of America meetings all serve as mechanisms to help develop, disseminate and evaluate research and extension program needs. Northeast Regional Project NE1031 focuses on potato lines developed by Cornell University, University of Maine, North Carolina State University and the USDA (Beltsville), where selected lines are placed in trials in seven Eastern states and three Canadian provinces. This project has set up common objectives to conduct trials and experiments on: yield stability; resistance to disease, pests (including golden nematode resistant lines); environmental stresses; and utilization characteristics. Relevancy for NYS and beyond: The eastern US industry has become a large, interdependent production and utilization region. NYS supplies seed, chipping and tablestock varieties to many Eastern states. New 2006 discoveries of the pale cyst nematode in Idaho and the golden nematode in Quebec illustrate how national and international markets are immediately shut down until control measures can be in place. The use of golden nematode resistant varieties has eliminated the use of expensive soil fumigants and has stopped the spread of this quarantined pest within NYS and prevents a marketing embargo on potatoes worth 70 million dollars annually. Intended Impacts: Potato growers would be the first beneficiaries in the form of reduced production costs, less chemicals used, more stable yield and better product quality. Seed growers, processors, and tablestock retailers would benefit from more stable crop production with fewer disease and defect issues. Crop consultants and IPM practitioners would be able to utilize more non-chemical control strategies.

Ultimately consumers and the environment will benefit from having varieties which are produced using less chemical and cultural practice inputs."

Consumption of P fertilizers has been continuously increasing for food security worldwide. As a raw material for P fertilizer production, mineral phosphate rock is nonrenewable. The world supply will be run out in 50 years. Our future generations will have to face a  P crisis  in the near future (Abelson, 1999). On the other hand, P use efficiency of applied P fertilizers is less than 20%. The 80% unused P leads to excessive algal blooms (eutrophication) of surface water and contamination of groundwater. The purpose of this proposed project is to exploit the vegetable genetic diversity and characterize P-efficient genotypes for maximizing P-use efficiency, enhancing the sustainability of tomato production and minimizing eutrophication. Hundreds of vegetable genotypes will be randomly collected and hydroponically screened first in artificial soil solutions created with insoluble phosphates. The identified P-efficient genotypes will be further electro-physiologically characterized using non-invasive microsensors to determine the protein-mediated flux of ions in metabolically distinct zones along the root surface. The proposed project will identify 2 to 3 superior genotypes and provide basic parent materials and potential molecular markers for future molecular marker-assisted selection in tomato breeding. The proposed project will develop a novel approach for plant breeding, food security and ecosystem protection and avert a crisis in P availability in the long term. Expected outputs include (1) 2-3 P-efficient genotypes potato or tomato to increase P-use efficiency; (2) 1-2 fertilizer improvers to enhance N- or P-use efficiency; (3) 1-2 new methods to minimize nitrate or phosphate leaching from vegetable or fruit production."

The variability of Streptomyces spp.over space and time, in response to environmental conditions, and in association to potato cultivars has been documented. However, the need to consistently control common scab (CS) in potato is critical in sustaining quality production. Improved understanding of the genetic diversity and microbial complexity in Streptomyces spp. in the soil environment in Wisconsin production fields will provide a key to enhanced management by more clearly defining the pathogen target. Conventional and biorational pesticides have provided results that are not reproducible in individual sites over time or among sites. Biological fungicides have environmental requirements for activity that are not reliable. Conventional pesticides may be effective on Streptomyces targets, but their placement in the furrow at planting may not provide control at the correct time in crop physiology to protect tubers. While soil fumigation of chloropicrin for CS can be effective, it has not been widely adopted as it is costly and can be inconsistent. WI potato producers are in need of alternative strategies as fumigation can have detrimental effects on soil quality and overall environmental health. The EPA is progressively mitigating fumigant use with the implementation of buffer zones, emission control, and rate restrictions. Currently, growers need non-biased research to address CS control in Wisconsin. With a rise in incidence and severity of disease, limited cultivar resistance options, and recent fast-paced restrictions in pesticide registrations through the EPA, growers' toolboxes for CS control are ill-equipped to effectively manage this formidable disease. Our proposed project will address 1) basic scientific discovery of soilborne Streptomyces population dynamics for improving understanding of pathogen biology, 2) applied production questions aimed at refining disease management strategies of CS, 3) the need for educational opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students in plant pathology, and 4) the development of extension deliverables to educate WI potato producers on advances made from this research. This research fits the priority goal of Global Food Security and Hunger. Additionally, this proposal addresses Wisconsin's specific priorities of developing agricultural production and pest control strategies that advance environmental protection and promote sustainable production systems for improved food safety, economic stability, and human well-being."

In 2012, planed potato crop in Wisconsin was 63,500 acres. If uncontrolled, damage from Colorado potato beetle (CPB) will result in 50-100% yield reduction (North Central IPM Center, 2012). Over the past few years localized areas of neonicotinoid resistance are resulting in clear reduction of control. Therefore, monitoring insecticide resistance in the field is of critical importance if long-term usage of existing and new insecticides is to remain as critical components of integrated pest management strategies. Continued increases in measured insensitivity to the neonicotinoid class insect control products could dramatically increase the cost of adult Colorado potato beetle control using foliar-based products exclusively. Complete loss of these compounds for CPB control could result in significant losses on an area-wide basis which may threaten the viability of the potato production industry in the region. A short-term goal of this study is to provide research-based information to improve our current integrated pest management programs for CPB. A long-term goal is to provide a list of insecticide resistant target genes for alternative management strategies to control resistant CPB populations in the future."

Production occurs under an extremely wide range of environmental and marketing conditions, ranging from the winter crop in southern FL to the fall storage crops of ME, NY and PA. This range creates diverse variety needs. Fresh market production remains a significant part of the eastern industry (e.g. 15% of ME's crop and 60% of PA's crop); however, ~38 percent of all potato U.S. chip plants are located in the eastern U.S., and they account for 43 percent of US chip production. Processing, primarily for french fries, is expanding in ME and accounted for 50% of utilization during 2008. ME and NY maintain high quality seed potato industries which service the East's seed potato markets. The potato value-chain is a major source of revenue for many individuals and communities throughout the eastern U.S. New and improved varieties are a foundational component of that value chain. Moreover, the characteristics of commercial potato varieties affect consumers and non-consumers and the environment in multiple ways. In fact, research aiding the eastern potato industry impacts markets associated with over half of the U.S. population. Quality requirements are rigorous and many existing varieties are deficient in one or more necessary characteristics. Improved varieties need to be developed, evaluated and released to meet the diverse and ever changing needs of growers and their markets. Improved pest resistance will reduce the need for pesticides and reduce agriculture's impact on the environment. Potato breeding and variety development involves many steps, all of which are addressed by the Project."

It has long been established that local, in-field farming practices, such as insecticide use, tillage, and crop rotations have strong impacts on insect communities in agricultural ecosystems. For example, intensive insecticide use can limit pests but also be harmful to beneficial species such as pollinators and natural enemies that control pests. Similarly, the effects of landscape-level factors, such as crop diversity and climate, on insect populations have been well studied. For example, climate change is expected to degrade natural enemy biodiversity, which could limit the ability of natural enemies in controlling pests. In addition, multiple studies have shown that the diversity of crop habitats can impact populations of predators and pests. One recurring theme from these and similar studies is that understanding how insect pests and beneficial species are affected by cropland diversity and climate can aid in developing integrated pest management (IPM) programs that maximize beneficial species abundance while minimizing pests. Here we will explore how farming systems affect insect communities across variable climatic regions in Washington State. Initially, our research will focus on pests in cereal and potato cropping systems in Washington State. These two crops rank 3rd and 4th, respectively, in terms of the value of production for Washington State, with a total value of production across both crops of nearly $2 billion annually. Furthermore, cereals and potatoes anchor most crop rotations in the region by having significantly greater profit potential than any other crop in these series. Thus, the economic viability of many regional growers is largely or entirely dependent on production of robust yields of consistently high-quality cereal and potato crops. Both crops are attacked by a diverse group of insect pests, and harbor many beneficial species such as natural enemy species. By understanding the role of farming systems and climate on these communities, we will increase our ability to design effective IPM strategies for these crops. By working across two important systems, we will demonstrate how models and data can be linked to examine effects of farming systems and climate on insects. This will improve our ability to understand and manage existing and emerging insect complexes in a variety of crops in Washington and other states. Our extension outreach plan involves the publication of extension bulletins, direct discussions with growers, field days where results will be presented, and publication of results on appropriate websites. Through these activities we expect our project to yield immediate and significant benefits to the agricultural community in Washington State."

Soybeans are produced in 31 states and 3 provinces in the eastern, central, and southern U.S and Canada, from Quebec to Florida, and Delaware to Nebraska. Given this large acreage and wide distribution, it is not surprising that soybean continues to suffer from insect pests that impact plant growth, grain quality, and yield. As in many other production systems, invasive species are an issue of increasing importance in soybean production. The introduction of a single species can significantly and negatively impact the profitability of soybean production, and increase risks to human health and the environment. In the northern U.S. and eastern Canada, the discovery of the soybean aphid (SBA) in 2000 fundamentally changed soybean insect management. SBA feeding impacts all components of yield; under heavy aphid pressure, yield differences between treated and untreated research plots may reach 50%. On a landscape level, SBA outbreaks often correspond to potyvirus outbreaks in dry beans, snap beans, vine crops, and potato, broadening the impact of this invasive insect. From an economic standpoint, SBA infestation increases the cost of soybean production. In 1999, the year prior to discovery of SBA, the National Agricultural Statistics Service estimated that less than 1% of the soybean acres in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio were treated with insecticide (NASS 2000). In 2005, an outbreak year, estimated insecticide use in these same states ranged from 9% (IL) to 42% (MI) (NASS 2006); in 2006, when outbreaks were more sporadic, 56% of the acreage in Minnesota was treated (NASS 2007). At least 20 different foliar and seed-applied insecticides are now used for aphid control on millions of acres, adding $10-$20 per acre to production costs (Song et al. 2006). To move beyond chemical use, particularly to control SBA and other chronic pests, alternatives are critically needed. These alternatives include both biological control and host plant resistance, preventative tactics which form the foundation of IPM, and which must be integrated with therapeutic tactics such as insecticide use. Significant progress in developing resistant varieties has been made since SBA was first discovered as a pest in North America in 2000. However, the rapid progress and success in developing resistant varieties and germplasm is complicated by the identification of SBA biotypes capable of overcoming plant resistance (Kim et al. 2008; Hill et al. 2010). Three separate biotypes have been reported in peer-reviewed publications and there are unofficial reports of even more, indicating that a significant amount of aphid biotype variation already exists in natural populations. This shows the need for continued discovery of more sources of resistance, specifically tolerance and the incorporation of these resistance genes into new varieties. In addition to discovery and breeding of aphid resistance genes, we require more information on the mechanisms and physiological function of SBA resistance (specifically tolerance)."

These pathogens cause costly diseases of staple crops, vegetables, high value specialty crops, and timber trees. Late blight of potato, caused by P. infestans, is infamous for the Irish potato famine and is still a major disease of this important crop, costing more than $3 billion per year to worldwide potato production and threatening food security. This species also causes late blight on tomatoes on a nearly annual basis in Florida. Phytophthora species cause the most serious soilborne diseases of citrus in Florida, causing damping-off of seedings, and tree-decline and yield loss in mature trees. Phytophthora diseases affect other Florida crops including strawberries, bell pepper, squash, watermelon, and ornamentals including palms, orchids, and Anthurium. Thus, Phytophthora pathogens are costly to growers across Florida. Several Phytophthora species have been studied for many years, yet we still have much to learn about the biology of these pathogens. For example, P. infestans has been studied for over 150 years, but the series of events that led to the emergence of this species as a global pathogen are debated and new strains are appearing in the US from unknown sources. In contrast, the research community has scrambled to study P. ramorum, which is a relatively new species that is destroying oak and tanoak woodlands in coastal California and larch plantations in the UK, and threatens the Appalachian ecosystem. P. ramorum has a broad host range, including many ornamental plants, and regulations implemented as a result of the introduction of this aggressive pathogen have been costly to the nursery industry. Likewise, many new Phytophthora species are being discovered in forest environments about which little to nothing is known. While regulations, improved crop breeding, and disease management may control the damage from Phytophthora pathogens in the short-term, managing these pathogens in the long-term will require more extensive knowledge about the global movement of these pathogens, how and why some Phytophthora emerge as damaging pathogens, and the biology of this group in their native ecosystems, which is essentially unknown. The benefit of this research will be in the prevention of future losses from new introductions, early identification of introduced species for rapid management, and the early detection or prevention of emergent virulent lineages of existing pathogens."

An estimated 79% of Idaho's dairy cows are located in only 7 counties in Southwestern and South-central Idaho. Cows in the intensive dairy-producing counties produce an estimated 13.2 million tons of manure every year. In this same region, large acreage is dedicated to a variety of high-value crops. Specifically, there are 118,000 acres of sugar beets, 68,000 acres of potatoes, 111,200 acres of barley, and 231,450 acres of wheat. Fields that are nearer dairies commonly receive the highest rates of applications, as a means to dispose of the manure while avoiding expensive transportation costs to move the manure to fields further away from the dairies. Alternatively, many Idaho growers are realizing the benefit of manure as a nutrient source and soil amendment, and are applying manure to their fields as an affordable source of phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients. However, there are concerns that manure does not contain enough P and/or K to replace fertilizers at lower application rates. At the higher rates used for waste disposal, there are concerns with degraded soil quality due to salt and copper accumulations, degraded water quality due to phosphorus accumulation and nitrate leaching, crop yield losses, and crop nutrient toxicities. To avoid some of the issues related pest and pathogen pressure, sugar beet and potato growers commonly apply manures prior to establishing the grain crop in their rotation due to the perception that root crops are more susceptible to pathogen and disease issues than grain crops. Some fields near dairies continue to receive manure applications on a yearly basis, regardless of crop. The majority of the research regarding manure applications and plant growth in southern Idaho has been focused on only one, two, or three annual manure applications. These research efforts have not captured the impact of repeated manure applications over several years on crop production. These types of applications are more realistic to the common practices of a dairy operation, and will better reflect soil quality, soil nutrient, crop yield, crop quality, microbial, and pest pressure responses than shorter-term manure applications. The goal of this project is to determine the impact of repeated manure applications to a wheat-potato-barley-sugar beet irrigated crop rotation at varying rates and timings on yield, crop quality, plant nutrient uptake, soil nutrient accumulations, soil organic matter, and soluble salts. We will achieve this goal by conducting an eight-year field study focused on dairy manure application rate and timing. Three manure rates (7, 14, and 21 dry ton/acre) and two timings (every year and every other year) will be evaluated. We will observe how these treatments impact crop growth and soil quality. Crops to be evaluated will include wheat, barley, potatoes, and sugar beets. Using information generated by this study, the expected impact is improved crop quality, soil quality, and water quality on crop fields receiving repeated dairy manure field applications."

This project addresses two important areas of plant biology: The development and ripening of fleshy fruits. The biochemical evolution of plant specialized metabolism. Fleshy fruits are an essential component of the human diet, providing sources of carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. A diet rich in the consumption of fruits and vegetables reduces the likelihood of obesity and the incidence of disease. Therefore, research into the biology of fruit development and ripening, together with production and postharvest strategies, is of significant importance to food and nutritional security, both within the US and globally. Generating a mechanistic understanding of the genes and processes required for the development and ripening of fleshy fruits, including those that influence their nutritional content, will create fundamental knowledge that can be utilized to infer targets for incorporation into breeding programs, leading to improved crop varieties. The research outlined in this project will utilize tomato as a model crop plant to identify and characterize genes that influence fruit development and ripening. Collectively, plants synthesize hundreds of thousands of specialized metabolites derived from different biochemical pathways, including isoprenoids, alkaloids, phenylpropanoids and modified sugars. These compounds accumulate in specific families or genera, often in specialized cell types, and provide a selective advantage to the plant species within its native environment through enhanced defense capabilities, reducing damage caused by abiotic stress, and facilitating the attraction of pollinators and seed dispersers. The bioactivity of specialized metabolites has long been exploited by humans for use as medicines, repellants, pigments, flavorings, and perfumes. Indeed, many modern medicines are still derived directly or indirectly, from plant specialized metabolites. The Solanaceae (tomato and potato) family displays considerable heterogeneity in the composition of plant specialized metabolites, particularly terpenoids, alkaloids, and acylsugars. This project will utilize the chemical diversity within the Solanaceae family combined with genetics, genomics, and biochemistry, to identify and characterize new genes and enzymes involved in the synthesis of plant specialized metabolites of agricultural and medicinal significance. In particular, focus will be placed on understanding the synthesis of terpenes and acylsugars within glandular trichomes and the biosynthesis of tropane alkaloids within the roots of select Solanaceous species. This research will facilitate strategies for improving the tolerance of crop plants to biotic and abiotic stresses and lead to improved understanding of the biosynthesis of medicinally important compounds that can be utilized to enhance yields and engineer new production platforms."

In Texas, bacterial diseases seriously decrease production of several fruit, vegetable and field crops. A major bacterial disease is zebra chip (ZC) of potatoes, which was first reported in Texas in 2000 and continues to be a major economic threat to potato production in Texas. The disease is caused by a nonculturable bacterium called Ca. Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso). Texas citrus production is threatened by the discovery in 2012 of huanglongbing (HLB) disease, a disease caused by Ca. L. asiaticus (Las) that leads to the ultimate death of infected grapefruit and orange trees. The overall goal is to improve methods for rapid and sensitive detection of Liberibacter species, and to develop new approaches for managing ZC disease in potatoes. Other work is focused on Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, which is used as a model system to explore the influence of environmental effects and pathological features, including host specificity, on ecological success. The prevalence of diseases caused by P. s. pv. syringae and other bacteria attest to the lack of effective control procedures. An understanding of the physiological, biochemical, and genetic determinants involved in initiation and establishment of disease is critical for developing new approaches to disease control. The project also will initiate studies of exploiting the metabolic diversity of plant-associated strains of Pseudomonas putida to develop a platform for the degradation of lignin in biofuels development. Preliminary screening of a small collection of plant-associated P. putida identified a strain (A514) capable of growth on Kraft lignin and vanillic acid. We plan to use strain A514 in future work as well as enrich for/screen other isolates for improved capacities for lignin degradation. Preliminary proteomic work identified novel enzymes from the termite gut with high lignin depolymerization activity in vitro that will be used to augment those of P. putida. Furthermore, protein expression profiles of A514 grown in glucose (as a control), lignin, and vanillic acid showed that different metabolic pathways were activated in the presence of the three substrates. These preliminary data are exciting because they demonstrate the potential for using proteomics as a foundation for enhancing existing capabilities for P. putida lignin degradation. Because the genetics of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthesis in P. putida are documented, strategies for boosting PHA synthesis were identified. We will use this information to improve the bioconversion of lignin to PHA in engineered derivatives."

The Rhg1 locus is in widespread commercial use as the primary tool to reduce SCN damage, but the molecular basis of the trait has remained largely unknown. We recently isolated the Rhg1  gene  and discovered that it is actually a block of three different genes, and that this three-gene block is present in as many as ten repeated copies in the genome of SCN-resistant soybean varieties. Still, essentially nothing is known about how the proteins encoded by these genes confer SCN resistance. For the present project we propose to identify molecular mechanisms by which the three dissimilar Rhg1 gene products confer resistance to soybean cyst nematodes. As a second aim, we will carry out experiments to determine if the soybean Rhg1 gene cluster or analogous genes can be used to increase resistance of potato and sugar beet to economically important cyst nematode pathogens of those crops."

Our novel approach is to advance precision agriculture science by utilizing hyperspectral sensors from UAS flights to detect a broader wavelength spectrum that allows discernment between crop health factors. Remote sensing technologies offer the potential to protect U.S. food security by rapid assessments of crop health over large areas. Detected areas can then be prioritized for measures to limit the impact of crop losses. This approach can provide early detection of stress and be used in a preventative manner for crop management strategies.The spatial analysis nature of our proposal has the potential to examine relationship ties to climate change as crop threats expand their range and capacity for long?term impacts into new areas. Once remote sensing techniques are developed they are transferable to similar crops and environments and thus can be rapidly repeated globally.

Root colonization by AM fungi (AMF) triggers profound physiological changes in the host plant thereby affecting other interactions with above- and below-ground organisms. Though, it has been proposed that the plant hormone, jasmonic acid plays a central role in AMF-induced resistance (AIR), the exact mechanisms involved in tripartite interactions (especially in crops) still remain unclear. In many cases, AMF-crop associations exist in the field under natural conditions, so it is essential to better understand the influence of AMF on plant-insect interactions, not only because of the AM symbiosis&#39; important role in nutrient cycling, but also, because of the deleterious effects caused by insects on crop yield and as vectors of devastating plant pathogens. This Seed Grant starts to fill the void regarding the potential impacts of AIR in potato especially against insects. It will allow us to establish the experimental conditions to study two tripartite interactions: 1) potato with AMF and potato aphids, and 2) potato with AMF and cabbage loopers. The research goals are: a) to evaluate the conditions to create a rigorous biological system to study AMF-potato-insect interactions, b) to examine the effects of above-ground insect herbivory and below-ground AMF colonization on potato plant physiology, and assess organism performance in these tripartite interactions, and c) to determine the impact of AIR in potato against insects of two feeding-guilds.We expect that: i) AMF-root colonized potato plants will exhibit enhanced systemic resistance against shoot herbivores; and ii) the AM-symbiosis will counteract the detrimental effects caused by insect herbivory. These are supported by our preliminary data showing that mycorrhizal barrel medic plants had fewer pea aphids feeding on them compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. The data obtained through this Seed Grant will strengthen a future grant proposal to AFRI aiming at elucidating the mechanisms through which AMF alter potato-insect interactions. The project outcomes will serve as a foundation to achieve our long-term goals of discovering genes useful in developing insect-resistant crops; therefore, this research has significance in enhancing food security and has practical applications for U.S. agriculture. Furthermore, the proposed project explores an environment-friendly approach to reduce the use of phosphate fertilizers and pesticides, thus it is of an urgent nature to the AFRI&#39;s priority area: Plant-Associated Insects and Nematodes."

Our analyses suggest that leaf type is a better predictor of fruit Brix than even fruit size and time until fruit ripening. In addition, we found that specific aspects of leaf shape are significantly correlated with fruit sugar levels in a large scale mapping experiment. Thus the role of leaf morphology as a modulator of fruit attributes in tomato varieties should be more closely investigated to determine if leaf shape should be an important consideration for tomato breeding efforts. This project will investigate whether natural variation in tomato leaf morphology 1) modulates photosynthetic efficiency and 2) impacts the accumulation of sugar in the fruit. A combination of existing genetic resources coupled with new resources, and a battery of genetic, molecular, physiological and genomics techniques will be used to understand the impact that leaf shape and physiology have on fruit sugar and starch content. Monogenic leaf shape mutants (like potato leaf) have been extensively used in the breeding of heirloom tomatoes and correlate with high Brix. In addition, the S. pennellii X S. lycopersicum ILs and BILs, and selected heirloom varieties with known leaf shape morphs, provide additional resources for these studies. Our work will determine if leaf shape is a determinant of fruit quality as measured by Brix, and thus represents an as yet untapped resource for fruit quality improvement."

Fresh tomatoes and processed tomato products are a major source of nutrients in the American diet. Production of high value vegetable crops is often dependent on irrigation in areas of the US where water is scarce. California is a major producer of irrigated tomatoes and other irrigated vegetable crops. During drought years, many growers in the Central Valley of California, one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world, do not receive any surface water allocation for irrigation, limiting crop productivity. Water status of the soil controls crop plant productivity via its impact on photosynthesis and plant biomass accumulation. A better understanding of the genetic and genomic basis of water-stress tolerance in crop plants is critical for U.S. agriculture because water availability limits crop production in many parts of the US. Breeding crop plants for water-stress tolerance using beneficial genes from tolerant wild species relatives of crop plants can help address this issue. A wild tomato, Solanum habrochaites, is tolerant to water stress, while cultivated tomato is not. To determine the genetic basis of water-stress tolerance in wild S. habrochaites, we will use a combination of research methods including genomics, genetics, bioinformatics and statistical analyses to determine the wild species genes on chromosome 9 that control water-stress tolerance. Reduced use of irrigation water for tomato production can be achieved by breeding cultivars using favorable genes from wild tomato that confer water-stress tolerance. Cultivated tomato bred for tolerance to water stress would help insure crop productivity even if availability of water becomes intermittent due to changing climate patterns. Future breeding and use of tomato cultivars that are water-stress tolerant would help maintain crop productivity, conserve fresh water, reduce production costs and enhance agricultural sustainability. Determining the genetic and genomic basis of water-stress tolerance in tomato will have direct applications to breeding for improvement of cultivated tomato as well as other important Solanaceous crops (potato, pepper and eggplant) that are evolutionarily closely related to tomato."

In particular, species of phytopathogenic Phytophthora are well known for their ability to cause disease on economically important crops, with almost 100 recognized species targeting close to 300 different hosts. Phytophthora infestans, causal agent of late blight on potato and tomato, is a problem everywhere these crops are grown. The accumulated costs of control efforts and losses due to late blight alone are estimated at more than $3 billion/year worldwide, which represents one of the most disastrous dieseases among any crops Most plant breeders are interested in the identification and incorporation of simply inherited genes that confer robust resistance to diseases. These resistance (R) genes typically encode proteins that recognize the presence of very specific pathogen molecules, termed effectors, resulting in the activation of defense responses. However, deletion or mutation of effectors can allow individuals in pathogen populations to elude recognition, cause disease, and pass this advantage on to subsequent generations. This breakdown in resistance has been observed many times in potato varieties containing major late blight resistance genes. In fact, P. infestans has been termed an  R-gene destroyer . A promising source of resistance to late blight has been discovered in the wild potato species Solanum bulbocastanum. The RB (resistance to P. infestans from bulbocastanum) gene is also known as Rpi-blb1 and confers broad-spectrum resistance to late blight and maintains its effectiveness even under intense pathogen pressure. The RB protein specifically recognizes the presence of the P. infestans effector IPI-O. The metabolic function of IPI-O and its role in pathogen virulence remains elusive. Because of Phytophthora&#39;s ability to evolve quickly to overcome resistance, the question remains whether RB will provide adequate long-term control when widely deployed. In fact, virulent strains that can overcome RB have already been identified. Fortunately, these strains are not widespread and none have been identified within the US, which makes RB an extremely valuable resource for late blight resistance breeding. We have also turned towards identifying novel sources of resistance as well as understanding the recognition process mediated by RB with the expectation that variants of RB can still be used for long-term late blight control. This project will support ongoing efforts in the PI and co-PI labs to study the ability of P. infestans to overcome resistance through continual exposure to resistant germplasm. In order to determine Phytophthora&#39;s adaptive capabilities and develop a strategy for host resistance deployment, further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in recognition of IPI-O by RB. Our preliminary data indicates that the presence of IPI-O is ubiquitous among strains of P. infestans. However, allelic variants of IPI-O are able to suppress the resistance response mediated by RB, which allows some strains to overcome resistance. The major focus of this proposal is to characterize the molecular interactions that take place between IPI-O and host targets with a long range goal of identifying mechanisms that can be utilized to improve late blight resistance available to potato and tomato breeders. We expect that successful completion of our objectives will lead to the production of novel potato germplasm that is able to recognize a wider range ofP. infestansstrains."

Genetic diversity and adaptation to a variety of climates allows potatoes to be grown in more countries than any other food plant. In the US alone, around one million acres are planted annually with potatoes, rendering almost twenty million metric tons of tubers and more than 3.5 billion dollars in output value. This productivity could be further increased by breeding improved potato varieties or implementing agricultural practices that have higher yields with the same amount of inputs. Experiments with several plant species have demonstrated that, under some conditions, responses to herbivory can include enhanced photosynthesis, induced compensatory growth, and improved yields. In what is currently the best example of this phenomenon in a crop plant, infestation of potatoes by the Guatemalan potato tuber moth (Tecia solanivora) can significantly increase the size of uninfested tubers on the same plants. In certain potato varieties, mild tuber moth infestation (less than 10% of the tubers are affected) not only increases tuber growth and starch accumulation in greenhouse experiments, but also significantly increased marketable tuber yield at multiple field sites over 3 years. Understanding the environmental conditions, metabolic responses, and plant genetic mechanisms behind this increased tuber starch accumulation provides a unique opportunity to develop new methods for increasing agricultural productivity. It is likely that, in response to tuber moth feeding, some potato varieties alter their gene expression to increase photosynthesis and transport of carbon from the leaves to the tubers. To test this hypothesis, photosynthetic rate, nutrient transport, and tuber yield will be measured in several potato varieties, with and without tuber moth infestation. Concomitant analysis of gene expression in these plants may identify specific genes that are regulated in potatoes to increase carbon flow and tuber starch accumulation. Additional experiments will be focused on studying how fertilization and watering regimens affect potato responses to tuber moth infestation. Together, these experiments will identify new mechanisms that can be used to increase potato tube yield though altered agricultural practices, plant breeding, or genetic engineering approaches."

Potexvirus and potyvirus infection induces the expression of the bZIP60 pathway, a component of the unfolded protein response machinery that modulates cell death during pathogen invasion and abiotic stress. PVX TGB3 is a specific elicitor of the bZIP60 pathway and induces SKP1 and SGT1 expression, which are linked to the turnover of resistance proteins during host innate immunity responses. We will demonstrate that bZIP60, SKP1 and SGT1 are critical components of PVX and PVY infection and immunity processes. The specific objectives are: 1. Determine if bZIP60, SGT1 and SKP1 contribute to the replication, cell-to-cell movement, and disease related necrosis of PVX and PVY. 2. Examine whether IRE1, a stress sensor that activates bZIP60, is required for virus infection. 3. Develop a reporter system using promoters from BiP genes to assay gene expression during PVX or PVY infection. The impact of this project is the identification of key factors impacting virus susceptibility and resistance in potato. Potatoes are vegetatively propagated and without proper management virus incidence in potato can rise to devastating levels within a few years.

This finding presents an important question and a challenge: The question, from the herbivore&#39;s perspective, is under what conditions can the herbivore compensate for reductions in feeding and what are the costs of this compensation? The challenge however, is: How can we manipulate conditions to reduce prey compensatory ability and maximize the costs of predator exposure to maximize both the consumptive and non-consumptive effect of predators?Studying Colorado potato beetles, a major pest of potatoes, we will measure how plant resistance affects the non-consumptive and total effect of the stink bug predator on the beetle life time fitness and plant damage including effects on the next generation that is not exposed to predation.

Their knowledge of healthy foods was extensive. They developed sophisticated agricultural systems that gave us beans, corn, potatoes, squash, tomatoes, and many other foods (Keoke &amp; Porterfield 2003). Their knowledge of medicinal plants was also extensive. They could cure scurvy centuries before Europeans and more that 200 indigenous drugs they used have been in the pharmacopoeia of the United States since 1820 (Vogel 1970). Thus, it is hardly surprising that traditional diets and lifestyles allowed them to enjoy excellent health and freedom from chronic disease. The picture of American Indian / Alaska Native (AI/AN) health today is very different. AI/AN have among the highest levels of health problems of all ethnicities in the U.S. in each of these areas: overweight / obesity, diabetes, alcoholism, drug abuse, heart disease, suicide, family violence, tobacco use, life expectancy, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and more. Many of these challenges are compounded by extreme poverty.Fortunately, solutions are available. Research shows that culturally-based approaches to addressing these challenges among AI/AN are more likely to succeed than non-cultural approaches (Halpern 2007; Minkler &amp; Wallerstein 2003; Smedley &amp; Syme 2000). For example, in a recent study among the Pima, participants were assessed for ethnic diet-type preference - Pima, Anglo, or mixed. Those who followed the traditional Pima diet had higher intakes of complex carbohydrates, vegetable proteins, dietary fiber, insoluble fiber, and the proportion of total calories from complex carbohydrates and vegetable proteins. The risk of developing diabetes in the Anglo-diet group was 2.5 times as high as in the Pima-diet group and 1.3 times higher in the mixed diet group than in the Pima-diet group (Williams et al. 2001).In addition to their impact on obesity, poor food behaviors also play a negative role in the continuum of substance abuse. Research shows that AI/AN and others who drink the largest quantity of alcohol, even infrequently, have the poorest eating habits, while people who drink the least amount of alcohol have the best quality diets (Breslow et al. 2006). While many tribal agencies throughout the United States engage in work related to wellness through traditional plants and foods, there is often little collaboration between these organizations. Most are burdened by incredibly heavy workloads. As such, tribal health clinics, schools, commodity foods programs, elders&#39; center, and similar programs often focus on only their own turf. The conference for which we are seeking funding brings representatives of these programs together, giving them opportunities to teach and learn from each other while initiating ongoing relationships that will benefit all.As our Plants Program gained success and notoriety in tribal communities throughout the region, we recognized the need for an organization focused on sharing not only the successes and resources of our program, but also those of other similar programs making a difference in Indian Country. With support from a National Institute of Food and Agriculture grant, we established the NWIC Institute for Indigenous Foods &amp; Traditions in 2011. The Institute&#39;s mission is: By embracing ancestral knowledge and identifying successful models of change, we can build tribal community strength and resilience. The Institute serves as a connecting point for all entities that touch on the world of traditional plants and foods. By hosting an annual conference, the Institute fosters opportunities for tribal agencies and allies to partner and collaborate."

The potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans triggered the Irish Famine in the 19th century and remains a serious problem worldwide; and Phytophthora sojae is the second most destructive pathogen of soybean that causes an average of 200 million dollars annual loss in the U.S. To date, battling Phytophthora diseases is challenged by a lack of understanding of pathogenesis. A broad range of parasites, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, protozoa, insects and nematodes, subvert host immunity through the functions of effectors. These virulence proteins can enter host cells and directly manipulate specific physiological/signaling pathways in the hosts for the benefit of pathogen infection. Genome sequence analysis revealed an extraordinarily large arsenal of effectors produced by Phytophthora spp., however, the functions of the vast majority of Phytophthora effectors remain unknown. Recently, we identified two Phytophthora effectors that suppress RNA silencing in plant hosts (Qiao et al., 2013, Nature Genetics). RNA silencing is a universal gene regulation mechanism in eukaryotes through the activity of 20-30 nucleotide (nt) small RNAs. Remarkably, these Phytophthora Suppressors of RNA silencing (PSRs) significantly promote infection, suggesting that inhibiting host RNA silencing pathways is an essential virulence strategy of Phytophthora. These findings revealed a new perspective in Phytophthora-plant interactions that involves small RNAs as integral players in the regulation of plant immunity. Understanding the molecular basis of PSR functions will enable us to design novel and efficient control strategies against the severe Phytophthora diseases."

Experiments will evaluate beet leafhoppers as vectors of the purple top disease pathogen and potato psyllid as vectors of the zebra chip disease pathogen. We will determine the time needed for an uninfected psyllid to acquire the Liberibacter pathogen from foliage, and the time needed for an infected psyllid to transmit the pathogen to an uninfected plant. We will determine the relative susceptibility of potato cultivars to zebra chip disease by comparing disease incidence and severity in varieties of potato in field cages, with timed numbers of infective potato psyllids. Objective 3: We will develop a toxicant bait for attracting and killing wireworm larvae when applied to potato fields at spring planting to provide protection of tubers at the end of the season. Baits will be tested in the field to determine efficacy against wireworms."

The focus expands to provide production guidelines for the development of new potato markets that enhance rural economies in irrigated systems. Objective 1. Develop management strategies to enhance yields and quality of sustainable irrigated specialty crop production. Sub-objective 1.A. Determine the agronomic efficacy, effects on soil quality, greenhouse gas emissions, weed management and food safety of biofertilizers derived from bioenergy production of animal manures and municipal waste water treatment residuals to provide economic use of these byproducts as alternatives to synthetic fertilizers in potato based production systems. Sub-objective 1.B. Develop rapid non-destructive techniques for early detection of water and nutrient stresses in potato by hyperspectral imaging of the crop canopy. Objective 2. Develop management strategies for production of short-season high phytonutrient potatoes including the developmentally young potatoes termed ?baby potatoes÷ to improve farm profitability and diversity of production. Sub-objective 2.A. Determine optimum nitrogen fertilizer management to increase tuber set, yield of small tubers, phytonutrient levels, and to maximize efficacy of vine kill and skin set in early potato. Sub-objective 2.B. Identify and develop effective vine kill methods that improve and hasten skin set and enhance phytonutrient levels in early potato.Approach:   Hypothesis 1A. Application of biofertilizers derived from agricultural bioenergy production will provide plant available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and sulfur (S); reduce synthetic fertilizer application rates and improve weed management reduce greenhouse (gh) gas emissions and will not be a food safety problem. Laboratory, gh and field studies will evaluate and quantify the efficacy of manure-derived biofertilizers, biochar, and crystalline struvite to supplement synthetic P-fertilizers in specialty crop production. Chemical analyses will characterize N, P, K and S of each biofertilizer, soil concentration and plant-availability. Carbon (C) mineralization will be used to measure soil biological activity and soil C stability. Yield, tissue nutrient content and pre- and post-harvest root-zone soil nutrient levels will be used to assess nutrient use efficiencies. Economic analysis of amendments will be done using standard procedures for farm management cost and return estimates. Hypothesis 1B. Canopy reflectance of potato can be used as a non-destructive technique to predict water and/or nutrient stress. Gh water stress studies will be conducted. Hyperspectral images of the canopy will be measured weekly to estimate vegetative stress. Nitrogen stress experiments will be conducted at the ARS Research Field Station in south central Washington. Hyperspectral images will be acquired with a Hyperspec½ VNIR camera through the growing season. Responses of potato to different spectral bands will be used to develop vegetative stress indices. Hypothesis 2.A. Soil and plant N status affect timing and amount of tuber set, size, vigor of vine growth, phytonutrient levels, ease of vine kill, and skin set following vine kill in early potato production. Bintje and Ciklamen potatoes will be grown as an early crop at the ARS Research Field Station. Petiole N samples will be taken at weekly intervals until vine kill. Total tuber yield, numbers, and size distribution will be determined at harvest. Tuber size will be categorized into  38 cm diameter size classes. Phytonutrient assessments will identify N levels and vine kill methods that result in tubers with higher amounts of phenylpropanoids or carotenoids, anthocyanins, antioxidants, chlorogenic acid, aromatic amino acids, glycoalkaloids, reducing sugars and asparagine. Hypothesis 2.B. Vine kill method affects the level of vine kill, speed of skin set, resistance to skinning and phytonutrient levels in early potato. Mechanical, chemical, and combinations of the vine kill methods will be evaluated for vine kill, speed of skin set, and tuber yield, size distribution, and quality of tubers in the 25 to 38 mm diameter size classes. Mechanical treatments include flail chopping, undercutting, and rolling with a roller-crimper. Chemical desiccation tests include sulfuric acid, diquat, glufosinate, carfentrazone, and pyraflufen. Skin set will be rated after rolling tubers down a 2.2 m metal diamond grid ramp placed at a 13? angle to promote skinning. Resources in years 4 and 5 may be re-directed toward testing production of second crops following early harvested potato."

We will classify germplasm with morphological and DNA marker assessments. We will preserve germplasm by performing seed increase of at least 200 accessions per year yielding >10,000 seeds on the populations with lowest seed numbers and germination, testing for disease, and backup in the national base collection at Ft. Collins, CO. We will distribute germplasm free of charge to federal, state, corporate and private clients in the US and abroad. We will evaluate genebank germplasm through partnerships with ARS, state, industry, and foreign scientists with expertise in various specialties of potato research. We also aim to continue to discover and describe simple physiological and genetic traits in-house. We will particularly seek evaluation projects studying nutritional potential in exotic germplasm. Evaluation of the patterns of genetic diversity in the genebank will be done using DNA markers. As in the past, the empirical evidence gained will be used to modify genebank techniques so the best practices are in place for maximizing the acquisition, preservation, and evaluation of genetic diversity in the genebank."

Characters used for carrot descriptions will be obtained from the literature and used to reassess taxonomic boundaries. For molecular analyses, next-generation “targeted” sequencing technology will begin with a collection of 100 accessions of Daucus and outgroups with 90 orthologous DNA markers to 1) determine the generic limits of Daucus, 2) determine the interspecific relationships within the genus, and 3) determine the genetic diversity within and among the species. The data will be analyzed with concatenated analyses and analyses of individual loci with Bayesian analyses. As this project progresses we will be able to select a subset of the DNA and morphological markers that provide maximum discrimination of the species of carrot (and generic ingroups) that can then be used for more rapid assessment of phylogeny and diversity of a high-confidence, statistically well-supported phylogeny of many more carrot genetic resources present in the US National Plant Germplasm System. This will incorporate additional material collected in field explorations that are of problematic identity. Two monographic treatments are planned, one for wild potatoes of northern South America (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru). For Daucus, a shorter taxonomic treatment is planned to include keys and distribution maps.   For objective 2, if germplasm collecting regulations are relaxed for Peru, Solanum collections will be attempted in central and northern Peru. For Daucus, we will inquire of some of the larger world genebanks (VIR, IPK, PGRC, Vegetable centre in Taiwan) which may have Daucus germplasm not yet incorporated into the US collection. Herbarium specimens will be examined for species differences and locality data. Contacts will be made with floristic workers or germplasm curators in foreign countries to initiate collecting for Daucus. Collecting goals and analyses of distributional patterns will be made with GIS software to analyze distributional data to indicate gaps in the collections. The carrot collection has very poor herbarium specimen representation and this plan is to collect 100 herbarium specimens/year with a focus on the wild species. Collecting expeditions will involve cooperators at the National Germplasm Resources Laboratory (NGRL) to identify legal requirements and permit possibilities in different countries and obtain in-country contacts. The PI will present a collecting plan and seek their concordance and support from the root and bulb CGC, and submit collecting proposals to the NGRL and conduct collecting expeditions based on available permits and funding.  For objective 3, the PI will accumulate a literature database of references on core collections and diversity assessments of germplasm evaluations, with a primary focus on those relying primarily on neutral molecular markers but also including non-neutral markers, breeders’ opinions or genetic traits, as criteria to establish core collections. He also will assemble literature on the history and development of the core collection concept to reassess the core collection concept."

Research focuses on the development of potato varieties important for the irrigated production of the western U.S., with an emphasis on varieties with long tubers and russet skin. This market class of potato comprised 85% of potato production in the western states of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington in 2010 (National Agricultural Statistics Service, Potatoes 2010 Summary, September 2011) and is used for the production of frozen potato products such as French fries, as well as for fresh consumption as baking potatoes. The targets for resistance breeding will be the major diseases and pests that detrimentally impact potato production in the western United States, as well as newly emerging pest and disease threats. Several of the diseases and pests that plague western potato production are problematic for all U.S. potato producers. Therefore, potato germplasm and varieties with enhanced resistance originating from our program also will benefit potato producers outside the western United States. Over the next 5 years, the research objectives of our program are:   Objective 1: Develop enhanced potato germplasm and varieties for the most important market classes for the western United States, with emphasis on recurrent and emerging disease and pest resistance (late blight, Potato mop top virus, Potato leafroll virus, Potato virus Y, emerging cyst nematodes, and Zebra Chip), reduced sugar and acrylamide accumulation, reduced production inputs (nitrogen and water), and enhanced nutritional qualities (vitamin C and protein).  Objective 2: Devise marker-assisted selection (MAS) protocols to accelerate breeding for resistance to recurrent and emerging pathogens and pests (Potato virus Y, Potat  Approach: As this project’s research is non-hypothesis driven, no hypotheses are presented in the approach. Experimental approaches to be used include hybridization of breeding clones of species and their enhanced progeny from ARS collaborators with adapted parental material from our program using a modified backcross method to minimize inbreeding depression. Progenies synthesized will be screened for trait(s) of interest for genetic enhancement, as well as for acceptable agronomic characteristics to identify superior breeding clones having the desired traits of the wild species with better adaptation and agronomic characteristics. Seed amounts are adequate by the end of the 2nd field season to allow field evaluation of promising progenies in a randomized completed block design (RCB) relative to industry standards, with the number of replicates and locations of trials increasing in subsequent field years as a breeding clone advances in the project. Data analysis over years and locations consists of a mixed model ANOVA with repeated measures with fixed effects being clone, year, and their interaction. Random effects would be location, clone x location, block within location, and clone x block within location. The latter interaction would be the experimental unit for which the correlation structure across years would be incorporated in the model. Breeding clones with enhanced traits will be released as new varieties, or alternatively as germplasm for breeding if industry requirements for a new variety are not fully met. Marker assisted selection also will be utilized to accelerate breeding for resistances to viruses and nematodes that impact the western United States. Newly-released potato varieties and advanced breeding lines will also be assayed to determine susceptibility to potato tuber necrotic ringspot disease caused by Potato virus Y (PVY) strains. PVY strain isolates of the O, NTN, and N:O groups will be used to characterize foliar and tuber symptoms in North American cultivars and advanced breeding lines in U.S. potato breeding programs. These experiments will be conducted in a greenhouse secured to prevent aphid entry to eliminate cross-contamination from outside sources and the release of the PVY strains used in the research.   Breeding efforts include the “stacking” or “pyramiding” of an assemblage of desirable traits into a variety that proves acceptable to the potato industry. However, if the trait in question proves recalcitrant for effectively combining with other desired traits into an improved potato variety, then the following approaches would be taken: 1. The enhanced breeding clone would be released by the project as germplasm for use as parental material by other potato breeding programs.  2. Continued hybridization by this project of the enhanced breeding clone with potato varieties to obtain commercially-acceptable progeny having the desired multiple genetic enhancements. The number of progenies evaluated from these hybridizations would also be increased to improve the probability of success in identifying superior selections having the desired multiple traits."

Develop components for construction of intragenic citrus lines, products of direct genetic modification employing only native DNA sequences.    2. Use of potato Zebra Chip Disease as a model for evaluating a potential citrus Huanglongbing (HLB)-resistance transgene efficacy.  3. Develop and exploit extant molecular tools (15x genome of Carrizo that represents the best current citrus source of HLB tolerance) and Zebra Chip tolerant potato lines to identify potential Liberibacter disease tolerance/resistance genes with commercial applications.  Approach: In cooperation with the USDA/ARS U.S. Horticultural Research Lab (Fort Pierce, FL), identify and develop molecular tools for the construction of “intragenic” citrus. From citrus genome sequence data, identify sequences with homology to Agrobacterium T-DNA borders (P-DNA) and test them in a binary vector to determine efficiency in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of citrus. Using expressed gene data, identify both constitutive and phloem specific promoters, fuse them to reporter gene coding sequences, and transform them into citrus and evaluate expression profiles. Make the promoters and P-DNA tools available to the citrus research community.   Isolate a set of Carrizo-specific “R” (Nucleotide Binding-Leucine-Rich Repeat Proteins) candidate genes identified by genome sequencing and test their ability to provide HLB-tolerance by introducing them into HLB-sensitive citrus scions.   In cooperation with USDA/ARS Yakima Agricultural Research Lab (Wapato, WS), use potato ZC as a model system for identification of potential transgenic strategies for delivering HLB-resistance to citrus.  Introduce candidate ZC-resistance transgenes into potato and evaluate their efficacy in controlling Liberibacter infection and development of ZC symptoms. Candidate resistance genes to be tested include coding regions for antimicrobial peptides and “R” genes identified from the ‘Carrizo’ citrus genome. Implement strategies shown to be successful in potato by introducing identical transgenes into citrus. Construct “citrus” versions of successful transgenes, employing molecular components from the citrus genome. Introduce these genes into citrus and evaluate HLB susceptibility. In parallel, identify homologues of successful citrus “R” genes in the Solanum genome.

Genes that may be valuable for crop improvement are often not well characterized, they may be associated with undesirable traits, or crossing barriers hinder introgression from distant crop relatives. Changes in pathogen virulence and introduction of new crop pathogens can overcome available host resistance, leaving producers vulnerable to crop loss. Available cultivars may not adequately address producer and consumer needs for new crop uses and high-value alternative crops. This project focuses on determining the underlying genetic bases of important traits of tomato and pepper – including fruit quality attributes and resistance to recurring or emerging diseases - and deploying them as finished cultivars, breeding lines, and genetic stocks. Over the five year project period, the following specific objectives will be addressed.  Objective 1: Exploit homology between tomato and pepper to identify and transfer anthracnose-resistance from tomato to pepper, and release new pepper anthracnose resistant germplasm, along with molecular markers for marker-assisted selection.  Sub-objective 1A. Identify anthracnose resistance-linked markers and candidate loci in tomato and pepper.  Sub-objective 1B. Determine identity of species and relatedness of Colletotrichum isolates responsible for pepper anthracnose and relate these findings to knowledge of host/strain virulence specificity for isolates infecting pepper fruit. Objective 2: Identify and characterize genetic resistance to the emerging diseases Groundnut ringspot virus (GRSV) infecting pepper and Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) infecting tomato, and deliver/release appropriate materials to researchers and breeders. Sub-objective 2A. Identify and characterize pepper host resistance to GRSV. Sub-objective 2B. Identify and characterize tomato host resistance to PSTVd. Objective 3: Develop and release pepper  Approach: Next generation sequencing technology will be used for map-based cloning of anthracnose resistance loci from a recombinant, inbred line tomato population that ARS has developed. To bolster identification of candidate genes for anthracnose resistance, a proteomic survey will also be conducted using resistant and susceptible tomato lines. Markers developed from tomato will henceforth be utilized to identify resistance homologues in the pepper species C. baccatum. Resistance loci will be transferred to C. annuum using bridge lines that ARS has developed. Different Colletotrichum species have been identified as the causative organism responsible for recent outbreaks of green pepper anthracnose fruit rot in Ontario and Midwestern, Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic production areas in the U.S.  Isolate species identity and relatedness from these regions will be characterized to ascertain if these isolates share a common lineage. Initial screening surveys for GRSV resistance will focus on C. chinense, the species where resistance to the Tospoviruses TSWV and CaCV has been previously identified. Reported Tospovirus resistance and accession passport data will be assessed and a subset of the available C. chinense accessions will be selected to maximize coverage of the species’ native distribution range.  C. annuum land races and accessions representative of the distribution range of C. frutescens, C. chacoense and C. baccatum will be evaluated in a similar manner. Accessions that exhibit high levels of resistance will be crossed to susceptible genotypes to characterize the inheritance of resistance. Initial screening for PSTVd will focus on core collections established for wild relatives of the cultivated tomato. Core collections to be screened will include S. chilense, S. habrochaites, S. pennellii, S peruvianum, and S. pimpinellifolium. Initial screening will focus on a PSTVd variant isolated from an outbreak in tomato and a second variant isolated from potato with confirmed infectivity on tomato. Infectivity will be quantified using real-time PCR. Ongoing development of ornamental and dual-purpose ornamental/culinary pepper germplasm is carried out via breeding strategies that include backcross breeding for simple traits and pedigree and inbred backcross breeding for complex traits. Improved germplasm is evaluated in cooperation with collaborators and released by ARS. Initial germplasm screening for fresh-cut pepper will focus on accessions that bear fruit with thick pericarp. Using knowledge of market types and available passport data, C. annuum accessions will be selected from commercial sources and the USDA, ARS, Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit. Accessions with varied fresh-cut quality attributes will be selected to assess applicability of hyperspectral imaging for high throughput phenotyping of fresh-cut quality. Accessions with divergent fresh-cut quality will be intercrossed in a diallel mating scheme to evaluate combining ability for fresh-cut attributes. Superior accessions will be hybridized with sweet and hot pepper breeding lines and BC2 generation hybrids advanced for phenotyping and public release."

Objective 4: Determine available host-plant resistance and epidemiological parameters, and develop diagnostic tests for emerging pests and pathogens of potato such as zebra chip.  Approach: Objective 1: We will utilize molecular physiology approaches, including measuring gene expression, enzyme activity and metabolite pools by hyphenated techniques. Structural genes and regulatory genes will be assessed using transient assays or stable transgenics. The phenylpropanoid pathway will be a focus. HQT expression will be reduced using RNAi. LCMS will be used to assess differences in phenylpropanoids between wild type and silenced lines and the expression of at least 10-20 phenylpropanoid genes measured by qPCR. Another gene targeted for silencing will be dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR). LCMS and GCMS analysis will be used to examine how phenylpropanoid and primary metabolism is reprogrammed in plants with altered DFR metabolism. MYB transcription factors will be identified in silico based on phylogenetic and protein similarity with known transcription factors. Function will be assessed in transient and stable assays. Compounds that cause the hatching of potato cyst nematode eggs will be partially purified from root extracts using chromatographic methods.  Objective 2: Tuberling populations will be assembled and grown two successive seasons in the Klamath Basin of Oregon in unreplicated plots. Promising material will be analyzed for carotenoids, anthocyanins, antioxidants, and a range of other metabolites to select clones with high phytonutrient content. Statistically the data will be analyzed as a mixed model with locations, clones and interaction as fixed effects and reps within locations as random effects. We will use molecular markers to characterize hybrids and assure that we intercross only duplex Zep1 hybrids.  Objective 3: We will combine PVY extreme resistance and CRKN resistant germplasm. The genetic nature will be explored by determining segregation ratios in reciprocal crosses. Mitochondrial fingerprinting will be expulsed as a diagnostic genetic marker of the restored phenotype. Crosses will be made to select a less spiny version of  Solanum sisymbriifolium for use as a PCN trap crop. A. rhizogenes will be used to attempt to make a version of the plant with greater root mass. Hatching assays will be used to screen for other plants that may be a superior PCN trap crop. Crosses will be made to generate potatoes with resistance to Black dot and Powdery scab and evaluated in field trials with a randomized complete block design with four replications and ten plants per replication. The crown and root will be scored for degree of galling and sclerotia. The effect of micronutrient supplements on Verticillium wilt resistance will be assessed in field and greenhouse trials. Macro and micronutrients will be applied in-furrow.  Objective 4: Psyllids collected during the survey and additional insects collected in the Pacific Northwest will be subjected to high resolution melt (HRM) analysis of the cytochrome oxidase gene in order to differentiate genetic variants of the psyllid. Extracts will be tested by PCR methods reported in the literature at dilutions up to 1,000 to determine level of sensitivity and reliability of the various methods on different host plant tissues."

Determine activity, mechanisms of action, and improved means of implementation of selected biological and cultural practices for enhanced efficacy, utilization, and sustainability.  Approach: Our approach to improving crop productivity and enhancing economic viability for food production systems in the Northeast is through the development of improved biological and cultural management practices and cropping systems. There are many practices and amendments that have been previously identified, in ours and others research, as providing beneficial responses for these production systems. However, much research is still needed to determine the best ways to utilize and implement these practices in production agriculture. In our own previous research, through long-term cropping systems studies, we determined the areas that are the most crucial constraints to productivity in potato production systems, as well as some factors that were less important. Critical constraints were water availability, soil quality, and disease pressure, whereas previously studied criteria such as fertility and soil physical properties (which has already been well-worked out) were not critical factors. This proposed research is building directly on this previous research, further developing and refining management practices that have shown the greatest potential for reducing soilborne diseases, enhancing soil quality, and improving crop yields in a sustainable manner. Management practices of particular importance include the use of disease-suppressive rotation crops, cover crops, green manures, and biological control organisms.  Special emphasis will be placed on the biological processes involved and the role of soil microbial communities in developing disease-suppressive, yield-enhancing cropping systems."

The proposed activities will contribute new knowledge to answer this question. In the long-term, such a knowledge base may enable development of new methods for predicting the emergence of new infectious agents and for developing new anti-viral therapeutics. A universal structural feature of viral and subviral RNAs is the presence of many loops and bulges flanked by stems. These are often described as unpaired regions without specific structural and functional definitions. This project seeks to demonstrate that these regions in fact display structural features and mediate key functions. These include viral replication and systemic movement throughout the host. The project provides interdisciplinary training for undergraduate/graduate students and postdocs. Through collaboration with an inner-city high school, the project will also greatly enhance secondary education by involving participation of high school students from underrepresented groups including African American, African, Hispanic/Latino and women. Recent crystal structure studies on rRNAs and some other RNAs demonstrate that the vast majority of loops/bulges are highly structured three-dimensional (3D) motifs with well-defined geometry formed by non-Watson-Crick base pairs, and that these motifs often mediate RNA-RNA, RNA-protein and RNA-small ligand interactions. This project will test the hypothesis that 3D motifs in an infectious RNA function as a critical constraint on the evolution of RNA sequence variants. Towards this end Aim 1 will test whether Potato spindle tuber viroid RNA 3D motifs mediate replication and systemic trafficking and constrain the RNA sequence evolution. Aim 2 will test whether specific RNA motif-protein interaction is a major mechanism for the 3D motif constraint. The new principles and research tools developed from this project may significantly advance research in a number of emerging frontiers of RNA-based gene regulation in different organisms ranging from bacteria, to plants to humans. These include (i) mechanism and evolution of recently discovered noncoding RNA-templated transcription by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases to regulate gene expression, (ii) structural basis of gene regulation by recently discovered cellular noncoding circular RNAs, and (iii) mechanisms of RNA structure-mediated intercellular trafficking of cellular RNAs to regulate gene expression at the organismal level."

To understand the macromolecular structure and mechanical performance of these essential protective membranes, gene-silenced tomato fruits and potato tubers as well as leaves from several model plants will be targeted for study.  A coordinated protocol of biophysical measurements will link the biosynthesis of plant coverings with their molecular architectures and macroscopic attributes such as mechanical integrity and environmental persistence. The project can benefit food crop yields and recycling of plant litter, also aiding the design of paints, textiles, and coatings. Interdisciplinary training teams spanning high school through postdoctoral levels will conduct this research, which will also form the basis of an undergraduate laboratory curriculum for non-scientists.The long-term objective of this program is to transform the current phenomenology of protective plant cuticles and periderms into a comprehensive predictive scheme for the versatile barrier functions of hydrophobic membranes. In addition to benefits related to food crop protection and plant litter recycling, the project outcomes can inform the design of superhydrophobic paints, textiles, and coatings. Recent improvements in genetic, analytical, and biomechanical technologies are making it possible to achieve an understanding of plant cuticular architecture that spans length scales from molecular to macroscopic, development from biosynthesis to biodegradation, and mechanical integrity at the surface or in bulk. This project will examine the biosynthesis, macromolecular organization, and mechanical performance of cuticles and periderms from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants with known genomes. As a complement, the polymers that resist chemical degradation and modulate plant cuticular function will be identified structurally. Specific hypotheses will be tested to address several issues: specificity of two fruit cutin synthase enzymes; metabolic rerouting of gene-silenced potato tuber periderms; macromolecular organization of suberized potato cell walls; nanomechanics and tensile strength of cuticles and periderms, respectively; environmental persistence of cutins and suberins."

Voytas (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities)Senior personnel: Colby G. Starker (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities)In plants, genome engineering promises to advance basic research by linking DNA sequences to biological function. Further, genome engineering will enable plants' biosynthetic capacity to be harnessed to produce the many agricultural products required by an expanding world population. If successful, the outcome of this research project will be protocols and reagents for highly efficient plant genome engineering that will be deposited in public repositories to provide unrestricted access. With regard to outreach and training, the project will conduct annual workshops to teach scientists how to use DNA replicons and CRISPR/Cas9 reagents to efficiently create targeted genome modifications. Undergraduate and graduate students will also be trained in plant molecular biology.  Graduate students will have the opportunity to study in laboratories around the world, and thereby become part of the global effort to implement genome engineering for the advancement of plant biology. Recent advances in genome engineering make it possible to precisely alter an organism's genetic blueprint.  Applications of the technology are expansive, ranging from correcting genetic defects in humans (gene therapy) to understanding gene function in model organisms.  In plants, genome engineering promises to not only advance basic plant research but also enable the biosynthetic capacity of plants to be harnessed to produce the many agricultural products required by an expanding world population.  In this project, methods will be developed to efficiently engineer plant genomes.  One focus is to overcome a primary barrier for implementing this technology, namely the challenge in delivering genome engineering reagents to plant cells.  Here, geminiviruses - plant DNA viruses - will be developed as vectors for reagent delivery.  Because they have DNA genomes, geminiviruses are ideally suited to deliver the molecules needed to create targeted sequence alterations, including the sequence-specific nucleases that stimulate targeted genome modifications and the DNA templates that incorporate sequence alterations into the genome. Geminivirus-based replicons will first be optimized using tobacco as a model to undertake a variety of genomic modifications, including targeted mutagenesis, gene replacement and gene insertion. The replicons will then be used to carry out a similar spectrum of modifications in the closely related species, tomato and potato, with the intent of developing new crop varieties in these species with valuable traits.  In addition, a newly described class of sequence-specific nucleases - the CRISPR/Cas9 system - will be assessed for its utility for plant genome engineering. CRISPR/Cas9 reagents will be optimized for expression and activity in plants, and protocols will be developed to modify single and multiple plant genes simultaneously."

The number of taxa with a given trait is shaped largely by the transition rates toward and away from that state as well as the diversification rates for taxa with the trait.  This project will test the role of these macroevolutionary forces in shaping the distribution of red flowers in the potato family, Solanaceae.  Although red-flowered taxa are spread across 13 genera, they are extremely rare, accounting for only 1% of the roughly 2850 species in the family. Using phylogenetic, anatomical, and biochemical methods, this project will (1) identify the origins and mechanistic basis for red coloration in Solanaceae, (2) test the hypothesis that red flowers remain rare due to reduced rates of diversification, and (3) examine whether this effect is contingent on the developmental pathway involved.This research will bring new insight into the range of developmental pathways employed during convergent evolution and the extent to which those mechanisms affect the evolutionary success of lineages.  Moreover, the plant pigments targeted by this project have important health benefits for humans, and understanding their evolution in flowers may lead to increased potential for improving pigment content in related crop plants (e.g., potato and tomato). High school students, graduate and undergraduate researchers, and postdoctoral associates will be trained as part of this interdisciplinary project, which spans plant biochemistry to statistical comparative methods.  These trainees will also participate in local outreach events to promote interest in plant biology among K-12 students."

Temperature and rainfall can explain much of the year-to-year variability in the the timing of pest occurrence and outbreaks, and models have become essential tools to make predictions in order to follow through with informed management actions. Currently most pest modeling systems make use of up to a 7-day weather forecast, if any at all, to make future predictions. Beyond that, the models have typically used 30-year average weather, which in the face of rapidly changing climate, often provides a less useful prediction than other options. In fact the National Weather Service (NWS) has longer term weather and climate models that currently are relied upon for mostly qualitative guidance in many realms including agriculture. These NWS and similar forecasts have increasingly shown more skill (i. e. better performance vs. 30-year normals), as weather models and expertise in their application have improved in recent decades. We propose a process that will convert the NWS forecasts into quantitative (and thus usable for pest and crop models) data forecasts and link them with over 100 online models already in service for pest and crop management needs for the U.S. This will provide much more useful and skillful predictions for up to 90 days into the future. We will adapt the NWS forecasts into two versions: one version will be designed to help with temperature driven (degree-day) insect and crop development models. A second version will make use of rainfall patterns needed for moisture and temperature-driven plant disease models. We will test this new adaptive technology for several significant pest forecasting problems including the spotted wing Drosophila, which is a new invasive pest of many fruit crops throughout the US, for potato late blight disease forecasting in the Columbia basin of Washington state, and for U.S. mapping of multiple invasive species pest events, used for both integrated pest management and APHIS plant protection and quarantine (PPQ) pest survey programs. Together these applications will be used to test the potential for longer term forecasts and improving precision of models, and for reducing the uncertainty of agricultural decision making. This should lead to more informed, more profitable, and environmentally sound pest control and other farm planning decisions across a broad array of regions and cropping systems, including organic, sustainable and conventional production approaches."

Our overall goal is to reduce the impact of these tuber necrotic viruses by working with all sectors of the potato industry to develop and implement new practices leading to a healthier potato crop and higher farm income. Virologists and plant pathologists will develop improved diagnostic methods to rapidly determine the type of virus and amount of disease on a farm. Technologies will be transferred to growers and seed inspectors so they can better make appropriate disease management decisions. Host plant resistance to virus disease is the best management option, but few virus resistant potato varieties exist. Virologists and potato breeders will work in concert to develop molecular markers to shave years and considerable cost off the development and release of new virus resistant potatoes. Until virus resistant potatoes are developed, potato growers need short term options to better manage virus disease on the farm. Entomologists, vector biologists, plant pathologists, and horticulturists will work to better understand the factors contributing to the spread of viruses onto and within a farm, and how the viruses impact tuber quality and processing traits during harvest and storage. This information will lead to regionally appropriate disease management strategies, as well as reduce the amount of virus in the crop and its impact on tuber quality. Economists will conduct a cost-benefit analyses of existing seed regulations, as well as possible new regulations suggested by scientists, to help the potato industry decide whether changes in farm practices, seed certification programs, and national and state regulations are worthwhile."

Among the genetic improvements needed are better fresh market and processing quality, resistance to major environmental stresses, insect pests and diseases, more efficient utilization of water and nutrients, improved storability, and lowered production costs. The purpose of this research is to release and commercialize new potato varieties that will directly benefit all segments of the Northwest potato industry and indirectly benefit all US producing regions. The strategy is to identify traits, make crosses, and apply selection pressures that will increase the probability of developing varieties that can be produced and utilized more efficiently than existing varieties. Appropriate breeding goals include high yield, improved processing quality, genetic resistance to major pests and diseases, higher levels of resistance to stresses, increased nutrient use efficiency, improved human nutritional value, and high tuber quality. An additional environmental benefit comes with reduced use of pesticides, water, and fertilizers, which are normal byproducts of improved varieties. This major objective is accompanied by myriad minor objectives involving germplasmenhancement, germplasm production, selection procedures, disease and stress screening, variety trial design and conduct, seed increases, management studies, and commercial evaluations. Each objective is to be carried out by the Northwest institution(s) best equipped to complete the associated tasks.

These specialty crop growers operate on a narrow profit margin; the net cash income in MA was $5,093 per farm in 2012. MA farms are highly diversified; this trait mandates that growers have and maintain a high degree of working knowledge and expertise in pest biology and management across multiple crop systems. Lack of pest control could easily translate into loss of long-term sustainability for specialty crop agriculture in the Commonwealth. The appropriate use of pesticides, in combination with cultural and biological controls, will maintain the longevity of available pesticides, conserve natural enemies, and maximize environmental stewardship. This project will connect  boots on the ground  support that educates growers with hands-on instruction and traditional workshops with the development of an interactive web site that will be used for scouting and reporting.We will use a multi-level approach where we work intensively with individual growers to implement IPM practices on their diversified vegetable and fruit farms, work with multiple farms on IPM field trials to address specific issues, host growers meetings for large audiences on the farms where we work, and extend the information we gain from on-farm work to reach a large multi-state audience. We will implement an educational program focused on monitoring and managing emerging and established insects, weeds and diseases. To do this, we will establish mentoring and partnering relationships with individual farms, provide diagnostic services, develop traditional and web-based tools to deliver information, and establish participatory and demonstration research for crop/pest complexes identified by growers as presenting challenges for IPM implementation. As a result of our whole-farm and grower-directed collaborative approach to IPM problem solving, growers will gain understanding and confidence in cutting-edge, crop-specific strategies. They will learn how to &#39;put it all together&#39; to have success in both crop health and profitability."

Lso spreads among plants with the help of an insect vector known as the potato psyllid. ZC has caused millions of dollars in losses across the U.S., and is recently appeared in the Pacific Northwest. To date, no resistance to the disease has been identified among commercially-grown potato cultivars in the U.S. However, unique USDA-ARS genotyoes derived from the two potato species Solanum etuberosum and S. berthaultii has been reported to impact potato psyllid behavior. Transmission assays also suggest these developed genotypes may also have resistance to the pathogen as well. Moreover, potato cultivars from outside the U.S. may also provide resistance/tolerance, but with the exception of New Zealand cultivars, no screening for resistance to ZC has been conducted. This proposal has the objective of screening potato breeding clones as well as selected potato cultivars from outside of North America for their response to Lso and its associated psyllid vector. Genotypes identified as having resistance to the insect vector or bacterium will be hybridized with commercial U.S. cultivars. Identifying sources of resistance to ZC and incorporating them into the U.S. cultivars is a significant step towards developing integrated and sustainable management practices."

PP exhibits a marked preference for potato volatiles and trough feeding process changes composition of the volatile blend. Semiochemicals (host-plant volatiles) are commonly used to manipulate insect behaviors in IPM programs such as monitoring insect pest populations for timing of insecticide applications and control strategies such as attract-and-kill (Killing Stations). This research will be focused on the formulation of several previously tested plant volatiles that attract both sexes of PP. In preliminary tests in 2013 no-mess Yellow Sticky Traps (Alpha Scents) baited with kairomone-based lures attracted two times more insects than unbaited traps. The specific deliverables of this project include a potent long-range chemical attractant and an accurate and efficient trapping device for PP. We will use field behavioral assays to identify the best blends and release rates of plant volatiles. Reliable detection of psyllid presence prior to population outbreaks will allow for better timing of pesticide applications and may decrease unnecessary prophylactic treatments. We will also develop an effective Killing Station system that could supplement or reduce the need for multiple seasonal sprays of broadcast insecticides for PP. The input of broad-spectrum insecticides for pest management in potato and tomato fields has increased dramatically since the discovery of Zebra Chips - a disease that poses a serious biotic threat to these crops. Identification and improvement of plant-attractants and development of effective monitoring and attract-&amp;-kill devices for PP should improve management while concurrently reducing the need for broad-spectrum pesticide sprays.

The four project directors and their collaborators have the requisite experience, facilities, and stakeholder relationships to successfully complete these objectives. The expected outcomes from the one-year grant include the commercial release of new varieties, the selection of new breeding lines for further evaluation, new markers for marker-assisted selection, and preliminary data on the feasibility of using genotyping-by-sequencing for variety development."

The focus of this project is on sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.

In Arkansas, sweet potato production has been growing steadily with a 33% increase in area and forms an economically important crop of socially disadvantaged farmers. Efforts to increase sweet potato yield and tuber size through breeding remained largely unsuccessful because of inherent genetic barriers which restricted the exploitation of molecular markers and genomics-assisted selection. The advent of transcriptome sequencing has yielded a vast amount of sequence data such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) which potentially become functional markers. Therefore, the objectives of the proposal are to: 1. identify the candidate genes for tuber formation through comparative RNA-seq analysis; 2. identify the genomic regions involved in tuber-yield related traits through Genome-Wide Association Studies; 3. functionally validate tuber forming genes in sweet potato; 4. determine the role of modifiers in cultivar decline by ChIP-seq analysis, and 5. recruit and retain undergraduate /graduate students in genomics and biotechnology. Undergraduate/graduate students will be integrated closely with the investigators in transcriptome analysis, genome-wide-association studies and functional genomics; and we will train students in practical research applications so that they will gain experience in critical communications and presentation skills, and prepare them for future biotechnology careers."

The complex inheritance of autotetraploids limits the rate of genetic improvement as compared with diploids. While the use of genomic information has revolutionized diploid breeding, these successes are not transferable to autotetraploids. The primary goal of this proposal is to accelerate autotetraploid breeding by developing the capacity to predict complex traits with genomic information. To reach this goal we will 1) Optimize the use of next-generation sequencing to accurately call the number of homologous alleles (dosage) present at a given gene/loci; 2) Develop prediction models that incorporate genomic information with dosage, and; 3) Create user friendly softwares that incorporate these advances and train breeders in their use. This project is a unique collaboration among plant breeders from different species with expertise in genomics, who are united by the goal of improving the efficiency of variety development in autotetraploid crops. We expect then to benefit all alfalfa, potato, and blueberry breeding programs through the development and release of software and tutorials in newly created methods."

We will accomplish this bold goal with a team of three geneticists who have over 60 years of combined experience in potato breeding. This research project is needed because breeding at the tetraploid level is inefficient and slow. Potato breeding has not kept pace with advances in breeding strategies and genomics tools. The conversion of potato into a diploid crop capable of self-pollination will allow breeders to realize the genetic gains required for potato to maintain its role as a major food crop. We have at our disposal a dominant gene that allows self-pollination in diploid germplasm and we have demonstrated that vigorous and fertile inbred lines can be made in potato. In addition, we have created diploid potato hybrids with yield and quality comparable to that of major tetraploid cultivars. Our proposed project will generate 100 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from each of six genetically diverse founder parents carrying germplasm from wild and cultivated potato relatives. We will evaluate the RILs in field trials and create a dense set of DNA markers. The RILs will be provided to the US Potato Genebank as true seed populations, accompanied by the phenotype and genotype data. This RIL set will be a novel, powerful, and valuable public resource for the mapping of economically important traits and the development of markers for marker-assisted selection. In addition, we will create inbred lines of cultivated potato for use in DNA sequence analyses and the generation of additional inbred line germplasm resources such as introgression lines.

Potato production has steadily increased in recent years, primarily in developing countries. Potato tubers contain >80% water and thus need to be stored at cold temperatures to prevent sprouting, minimize disease losses, and supply the processing industry with high quality tubers throughout the year. Unfortunately, cold storage triggers accumulation of reducing sugars in tubers, a phenomenon referred to  cold-induced sweetening  (CIS). During potato chip and French fry production, reducing sugars react with free amino acids in a nonenzymatic Maillard reaction to produce brown- to black-pigmented products that are not acceptable to consumers. More problematically, the Maillard reaction also generates acrylamide, a neurotoxin and a potential carcinogen. In 2002, high levels of acrylamide were reported in carbohydrate-rich foods processed at high temperatures. Potato chips and French fries have especially high acrylamide contents compared to other carbohydrate-rich foods processed at high temperatures, which raised a worldwide food safety concern. Developing methods to reduce acrylamide in fried potato products has become an urgent requirement for the potato processing industry. Reducing sugars are major precursors in acrylamide formation. Thus, development and application of potato cultivars with CIS resistance will be the most effective approach to reduce acrylamide in processed potato products. We have recently discovered that the vacuolar acid invertase gene (VInv) plays the pivotal role in CIS. Suppression of the VInv gene in cold-stored tubers will effectively control CIS. The proposed research aims to understand why the VInv gene is naturally silenced in germplasm derived from the wild potato species, Solanum raphanifolium. Genetic and molecular techniques will be applied to dissect the mechanisms that control the VInv gene expression in these germplasm stocks. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop CIS resistant potato cultivars using the genetic resources from S. raphanifolium."

Cover crops reduce soil erosion and nutrient and chemical leaching and runoff, build soil organic matter, suppress weeds, break pest and disease cycles, and increase farmer income. Despite these benefits, adoption remains low. Irrigation BMPs conserve water by improved scheduling and crop monitoring, installing more efficient systems, reallocating crops and using deficit irrigation. Falling lake and stream levels in Wisconsin's irrigated areas have created demands for increased irrigation BMP adoption. Vegetable production is important in Wisconsin - the state ranks third in potato production, second for processed vegetables, and has significant fresh-market production. Wisconsin vegetable growers use cover crops and rely on irrigation, but do not widely adopt these BMPs, providing a study population of adopters and non-adopters.  Enhancing agricultural sustainability requires better understanding of how attitudes, beliefs and characteristics drive BMP adoption. Many researchers call for better integrating analytical frameworks across the social sciences, so this project will assess the empirical advantages of integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior into economic models of BMP adoption using a survey of Wisconsin vegetable growers.  Expected changes in knowledge among academics and extension specialists will include better understanding of how attitudes, beliefs and characteristics drive BMP adoption among vegetable growers. These changes in knowledge are expected to lead to changes in behavior among these outreach specialists to better improve outreach to vegetable and other growers and so increase the overall adoption of BMPs. Finally, expected changes in condition include development of research and outreach skills by a graduate student who will work professionally in the field, as well as improved environmental performance of vegetable producers due to increased adoption of agricultural BMPs."

An important part of molecular plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses is the massive reprograming of gene expression involving action of a large number of pathogen/stress-responsive transcription factors, which regulate the most important step of gene expression. WRKY proteins are plant-specific transcription factors with important roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. In nearly two decades since the report of the first WRKY protein, a large number of studies have focused on functional analysis of plant WRKY transcription factors. Arabidopsis WRKY33, a member of the ancestral Group I WRKY transcription factors from Arabidopsis, is important not only in plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens but also in tolerance to abiotic stresses. WRKY33 homologs have been identified in a variety of plants, suggesting that WRKY33-mediated disease resistance and stress tolerance are conserved. We have decided to functionally analyzed the two WRKY33 homologs from tomato because tomato is also highly susceptible to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen B. cinerea and, therefore, results of studies on SlWRKY33 proteins in tomato can be directly compared with those of AtWRKY33 in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, tomato is an important crop plant and the knowledge gained from the studies of the molecular mechanisms of plant disease resistance and stress tolerance can be exploited to develop new strategies for improve productivity of tomato and closely related crops such as potato. The WRKY gene family has expanded massively, with only a single member in the green unicellular algae C. reinhardtii to more than 100 members in many land plants. The expansion of the WRKY family likely reflects the complex adaptation mechanisms evolved in land plants and, consequently, elaborate regulation of a large number of plant genes in responses to harsh environmental conditions including desiccation, UV radiation and attack of microbial pathogens in terrestrial habitats. Comprehensive structural, functional and evolutionary analysis of WRKY33 homologs will lead to important insights into the evolution of plant WRKY transcription factors in particular and plant stress response pathways in general."

This is particularly true for pests such as the CO Potato Beetle (CPB) and Late Blight. Unfortunately, breeding for plant resistance is very pest-specific and tradeoffs between resistance to insect pests and pathogens could exist. Understanding those effects allows the development of Decision Support Systems (DSS) that forecast when conditions are conducive to pest occurrence and give growers the opportunity to minimize pesticide applications. In this project we will understand if current breeding practices are causing a tradeoff between resistance to an insect pest and an important pathogen and we will create an improved DSS that will inform growers about timely spraying regimes for pathogens as well as insect pests."

Furthermore, as a consequence of trait-based selection (mostly for quality traits) modern potato varieties often do not possess the genetic attributes that are critical for sustained productivity under sub-optimal environments marginalized by various biotic and abiotic constraints. Addressing these issues, the broad programmatic goal of this project is to contribute to the diversification of the genetic base of the cultivated potato by dissecting the genetic components of novel biotic and abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms in an elite group of Solanum species and landraces using the paradigms of functional and comparative genomics and network biology."

Potatoes rank as one of the four most important staple crops on a global scale and nematodes are one of the most important pathogen groups for this crop. Washington and Idaho produce 60-70% of the total potato yield in the United States. However, the major potato-producing regions in these states are widely infested with the Columbia root-knot nematode (CRKN), Meloidogyne chitwoodi. CRKN infection of potatoes causes severe quality defects on the tuber surface and can render entire shipments unmarketable, thereby inflicting massive economic losses to producers and rural economies. In addition, CRKN is a highly regulated quarantine pest. Current nematode control efforts are based on applying synthetic nematicides that are potentially harmful for the environment, costly and faced with increasing regulation. An ideal nematode control solution would be to cultivate resistant plants. However, CRKN isolates are known that overcome resistant potatoes, thereby complicating breeding efforts.This project will analyze the variability of diverse CRKN isolates to gain a better understanding of CRKN populations that are able to overcome plant resistance. CRKN morphology and genetic traits will be analyzed and compared between virulent and avirulent isolates. This is important because once a better understanding of CRKN variability is achieved, potato breeding efforts can be based on a more secure footing and take the whole range of nematode variability into account when screening for new sources of resistance. This would achieve the overall goal of this project, which is to develop novel sources of CRKN resistance that are stable, thereby reducing the need for synthetic pesticides to control CRKN in potato."

However, declining energy supplies and P mineral reserves, erratic fertilizer costs, and concerns about water pollution, has created incentives for improved efficiency. While we have developed management practices such as soil and plant tissue testing and improved fertilizer placement and timing, the possibility of genetic modifications to crops for improved fertilizer use efficiency has received little attention. More recently, it has been shown thatover-expression of type I H+ -pyrophosphatase AVP1 (AVP, Arabidopsis vacuolar pyrophosphatase) can enhance nutrient acquisition by crops. AVP1 over-expressing tomato (Lycopersiconlycopersicum L.) plants produced more shoot and root biomass than controls when grown under phosphate and nitrate limitations and accumulate more potassium in all conditions tested. Preliminary data we have collected show the potential for yields of AVP1 romaine lettuce (Lactucastaiva) to be maximized at less than 50% the P fertilizer required for conventional cultivars. The objective of this project is to evaluate the potential for using AVP1 modified crops for improved nutrient use efficiency under desert cropping systems. In addition to crops we have already modified genetically (potato (Solanum tuberosum) and cotton (Gossypium spp.), and romaine lettuce), we plan to incorporate the AVP1 trait into iceberg lettuce, a very large recipient of N and P fertilizer. Field studies will be conducted to test control plants and AVP1 modified plants under optimal and suboptimal fertilizer regimes. Fertilizer recoveries and fertilizer use efficiency will be determined and the efficacy of AVP1 modification as a strategy for improved nutrient use efficiency will be evaluated. We aim to demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits of using AVP1 modified crops. We anticipate the successful demonstration of this transgenic technology will ultimately benefit growers whose fertilizer costs are rapidly increasing. In the longer term, this project should benefit society at large as natural gas used to produce N fertilizer and P mineral reserves are finite resources in decline and air and water pollution associated with fertilization are of continuing concern."

Evidence has shown that some soils are naturally disease-suppressive, and some cultural practices can change the soil profile in ways that make it suppressive. Therefore I propose to study suppressive and conducive fields in different cropping systems. The approach is to characterize the microbial community structure and then drill down into the mostly likely subpopulations, i.e. Streptomyces, responsible for disease and suppression. Hence, it is hypothesized (i) that there are distinct rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities consistently associated with diseased and healthy plants, (ii) that the density and frequency of thaxtomin vs antibiotic producing Streptomyces populations correlate with disease and suppression, respectively, (iii) that the genome sequence of 48 selected suppressive and disease-producing strains will reveal genetic differences reflective of their different life histories and provide insight into their management, and (iv) that soil edaphic factors correlate with community structure, targeted functions, and disease. We will use high capacity rRNA gene sequencing to determine the bacterial, archaeal, fungal and streptomycetes communities; quantify disease severity, thaxtomin by LC/MS/MS and txtAB genes and their expression by qPCR to establish their relationship to disease and hence use as population markers. The findings will provide a foundation and research framework for biologically-based sustainable strategies for soilborne disease management."

The agricultural sector plays an important role in the state of Maine. Among various kinds of crops harvested in Maine, the two most important ones are potato and blueberry. The total economic impacts of the potato industry and the blueberry industry on Maine&#39;s economy are about $540 million and $250 million respectively. Maine potato production is ranked among the top ten in the U.S. and Maine is the top U.S. grower of wild blueberries. However, both crops are constantly threatened by natural hazards from different sources. Among them, pests and diseases cause huge economic losses every year. For potato production, significant hazards include the late bright disease and the Colorado potato beetle. For blueberries, the mummy berry disease and the blueberry spanworm also cause significant losses. Obviously, risks of these hazards are spatially correlated. For example, late blight from an infected garden can spread spores and affect commercial potato production miles away. Although biologists and soil scientists have already done extensive research on these pests and diseases, the spatio-temporal transmission mechanisms of these contagious hazards and associated economic costs of each hazard were rarely evaluated. Particularly, the idea to design financial instruments to hedge the risks of invasive species such as aphids and potato beetle have never been proposed. Given the above, my main research objective is to use quantitative approaches to model the risks of several specific hazards and their spatio-temporal dependence. Further, I will focus on pricing such contagious hazards and designing associated single-peril insurance products which would become an optional financial instrument to compensate for disastrous losses caused by pest or disease epidemics. The effectiveness and efficiency of current programs and policies for pest management and disease control will also be evaluated. Potential policy improvements may be discussed."

Furthermore, CRKN is considered a quarantined pest by several countries and infested tubers are not allowed entry which can cause disruption in trade. Therefore, tolerance for these nematodes in field soil is very low so growers routinely use soil fumigants to control their numbers. This research strives to manage CRKN without fumigants by screening selected varieties of rotation crops and green manure crops for their ability to suppress CRKN densities or support minimal reproduction. Low rates of other non-fumigant nematicides will also be tested.

While vitamins are commended for providing immediate human health benefits, numerous long term health-promoting roles have been ascribed for phytonutrients. In plants, phytochemicals provide necessary defenses against abiotic and biotic stresses to ensure healthy growth and development. Therefore, it is perceivable that manipulation of phytochemical profile can potentially improve crop yield and nutritional quality by protecting crops from diseases and by enhancing the nutritional value of foods, which are two key aspects of obtaining food security. Yet our knowledge of phytochemical biosynthetic pathways in crop plants is still very limited, presenting a major hurdle for crop improvement. The overarching theme of my research program is to elucidate the key genes/enzymes and regulatory mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis and accumulation of phytochemicals in plants. Phenolics, terpenoids and alkaloids are three major classes of phytochemicals based on structural classifications. This Hatch project entails understanding and manipulating phenolic and carotenoid (tetraterpenoid) biosynthetic pathways in several economically important crops, including pomegranate (phenolic), wheat (carotenoid) and potato (phenolic). The molecular and biochemical tools derived from our work can be directly applied to development of designer crops using traditional breeding and biotechnology approaches. This work will also have broad implications in enhancing the disease resistance properties and nutritional qualities of other crop plants that possess similar biochemical pathways."

A challenge to sweetpotato breeding programs is the trend in U.S. agriculture to reduce the use of pesticides and labor. Cultivars will need to have resistance to a wider range of diseases and tolerance to insect pests currently controlled by chemicals. Labor inputs can be reduced by the introduction of more durable, skinning resistant varieties; however, fresh market consumer acceptance is uncertain. A constraint in the breeding program is the inability to use genetic modification; consumer resistance is strong to genetically modified vegetables. The breeding program also needs to address a burgeoning processing industry with dedicated varieties. Prices producers receive for bulk sweetpotato have increased from $4 cwt to $12-$14 cwt since 2006. It is now feasible for a producer to economically devote significant acreage towards bulk sale and many have. Furthermore, production is becoming more efficient by using bulk harvesters and bulk storage techniques adopted from commercial Irish potato. Varieties for processing still must yield well and possess pest resistance; however, selection criteria can be relaxed for some traits. Many light skin selections with otherwise desirable attributes were previously discarded and can now be saved and evaluated. The opportunity also exists to breed for and save selections with rough and potentially more durable skin. These are likely less attractive on the fresh market, but have no bearing on the processing industry and may have value in reducing incidence of rhizopus soft rot and lessen moisture loss. These genotypes may tolerate rougher handling in harvesting operations and reduce the need for labor. The program must also develop early yield varieties to fit French fry processing supply deficits in late July and August before the new crop is harvested. The nascent dye industry is on the horizon. Processors are switching from artificial colorants to natural ones and sweetpotato anthocyanin is particularly stable and useful in many products."

Reports have documented considerable effects of sediment and nutrient runoff from the cropping systems and dairies on adjacent streams in the region. Southwest Louisiana is also among the most highly concentrated areas of oil and gas industries in the nation. Contaminants associated with petroleum production have the potential to affect the water resources of the region. Locating on the Gulf coast, the region encompasses one of the world&#39;s largest Chenier plains, a unique coastal formation that provides critical ecosystem functions. The vast and intrinsic waterways in the region serve as wildlife habitats and stopovers for migrating birds, attracting people from the region and nation to fish, hunt, and observe wildlife. There are, however, concerns over potential release of toxic chemical compounds from petrochemical production into the waterways and coastal estuaries. These include trace metals, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes and hydrogen sulfide, emissions of which can occur during oil production and refinery processes. These chemical compounds are known to have harmful effects on human central nervous system and aquatic life, and media contaminated with these chemicals have been found to include air, water, and soil. This project will conduct intensive testing of waters and sediments in the region&#39;s major rivers.

A promising alternative energy source is biofuels made from biomass. Currently, biomass-based fuel production research is mainly focused on oil crops, sugar-based crops and cellulosic materials. Microalgae show promise as both a biofuels and bioproducts feedstock. Microalgae can produce more oil per hectare than land-based crops (Chisti, 2008; Demirbas, 2009 and 2011), have higher growth rate with a shorter harvest cycle (Schenk et al. 2008), the capability to sequester carbon dioxide and grow on low value agricultural land; therefore, not competing with agricultural crop resources. Algae 2020 report (2011) concluded that the long-term development of a biomass-based biofuels industry requires diversification of products to help revenue streams an area of increasing research interest. New algal biofuel companies have recently emerged that are producing food ingredients from the remaining algal biomass, such as Solazyme Inc., a renewable oil and bioproducts company founded in 2010. Besides the accumulation of lipids for fuels, algae produce fatty acids, pigments, and carbohydrates of key interest due to their potential health benefits and use as food ingredients (Wijffels et al., 2010). For these reasons, studies on microalgae as a source for biofuels and by-products are steadily increasing (Chisti, 2010, Mata et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2006, Andrich et al., 2006, Sawayama et al., 1999, Feinberg, 1984).The corn and soybean industries have been capitalizing on the functional characteristics of individual components for several years. Corn starch, corn oil, soy proteins and soybean oil have been utilized as food ingredients. This research has resulted in huge increases in the production and sale of these commodities as well as added value through the development of functional food ingredients. Suitable treatments for chemical modification include various potentially hazardous chemicals. These methods are generally undesirable because of safety and nutrition issues. New research can also be done to find less chemical waste and residue producing methods for manipulating the functional characteristics of starches, then those that exist now. This work would also help minimize costs associated modified starch ingredient manufacture through development of simpler methods.About 28 % of the 1.2 million tons of sweet potatoes produced annually in the U.S. are grown in the South Central region (USDA ERS 2011). In Louisiana sweet potatoes had a 2010 crop value of $80 million and value-added production value of $142 million (Smith 2011). The canning process can result in 600,000 lbs of mainly starchy waste per day, at least half of which goes directly into lagoons for digestion, creating an environmental waste issue. U.S. rice brokens range from 12% to 24% of milled rice (Sage V Foods 2012) and are sold at greatly discounted prices at 60% of the value of head rice (Siebenmorgan et al., 2012). Finding new uses for these products will add value and reduce environmental issues. The modification of corn starch to produce functional food ingredients has resulted in value-added ingredients, which has driven the selling price of native corn starch from $0.20/pound to $2.50/pound for modified corn starch-based fat replacers. There is a potential of a 10-fold increase in the value of algae by-product, rice, and sweet potato flours, from the development of starch-based fat replacers and other ingredients such as resistant starch, through utilization of the same technology."

If proper sprout control is not maintained, significant and detrimental impacts will occur to tuber quality and the ability to store for extended periods of time is diminished. The primary method to control sprouting in storage is with applications of isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (chlorpropham; CIPC). Due to the potential food safety concern of utilizing a carbamate for sprout control, evaluating alternative compounds or means to reduce CIPC rates are needed. Unfortunately, no other sprout control product currently tested is as effective as CIPC. Therefore, consistency and reliability of alternative sprout control products must be evaluated. Sprout suppression and food safety are universal concerns and therefore warrant further investigation of newer strategies and tools for the potato industry. Chlorpropham is a highly effective sprout inhibitor in potato and an alternative product must be as reliable and effective for replacement consideration. A major objective of this research is to identify and evaluate novel means to suppress sprouting and/or develop programs integrating existing methods with novel means for sprout control. The United States potato industry exports fresh or raw potatoes. Some export regulations require CIPC or other sprout inhibitor to be applied to potatoes for phytosanitary considerations. The goal is to render the potatoes non-viable or non-productive in order to reduce the chance of pest transfer if subsequently planted in the importing country. It is necessary to document the role and efficacy of CIPC and other sprout inhibitor programs for the continuation and growth in export markets. A major goal of this project is to document the reliance of CIPC as a sprout inhibitor to minimize issues of transferring pests in exported potatoes."

Zebra chip disease, which is caused by the vector-borne pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso), was first reported in 2011 in potato production areas in Idaho, and is now of a major concern. This proposal is set to address four specific objectives: The first objective quantifies the level of susceptibility in four of the most commonly used wheat cultivars in Idaho, to BYDV infection, at different stages of plant growth. Variables used to measure the degree of susceptibility include visual assessment, titer quantification, and biochemical evaluation of the plant tissue.The next two objectives address the wireworm issue in small grains. A survey of wireworm species will be conducted to determine most damaging wireworm species in central and eastern Idaho. For the most damaging species, insect movement and the inflicted damage will be correlated with environmental variables to determine suitability and timing of different management approaches in order to achieve reduction in insect pressure.The last objective addresses Lso-plant (potato tuber) interactions post-harvest and during storage, in relation to the time of infection and vector density.

There are numerous well-documented occurrences known in plants and polyploidy appears to have been frequent throughout the evolutionary history of flowering plants. Polyploidy is known to generate morphological diversity, genetic diversity, diversity in reproductive biology, ecological diversity, and even functional diversity. The relationship between polyploidy and diversity is important in evolution and ecology of natural systems, but polyploidy also plays a very important role in the origin of many crops and is critical in some breeding programs of crop and ornamental plants. Many crop plants, including major crops in Michigan, are of polyploidy origin, or have resulted from breeding programs that involve polyploidy. Corn, many varieties of wheat, potatoes, many cultivars of apples, strawberries, blueberries and blackberries are well-documented examples. However, research on polyploidy has focused on just a few traits, and most studies focus on a single origin of polyploidy in a single taxon. Research is needed, then, to determine the breadth of changes resulting from polyploidy across the morphological landscape of the polyploid plants and whether polyploid events generate the same changes in plants--either within a species or in closely related species. This project will address these questions by studying morphological variation in a series of polyploid populations of three closely related species of Phlox. Each of the three species has diploid (two sets of chromosomes), tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes), and hexaploid (six sets of chromosomes)populations. We will measure numerous morphological characters in multiple populations of each ploidy of each species, generating the largest data set documenting morphological change in polyploid systems known. We will also study differences in reproduction and ecology (physiology) at one site where diploids and tetraploids are known to occur. These studies will help us gain a broader understanding of how polyploidy works in natural systems, which will inform applied researchers using polyploidy in plant breeding programs."

Another important seed borne disease is bacterial ring rot (BRR). Significant developments have taken place over the last several years in our understanding of the potato virus Y complex (PVY) which is now made up of not only the PVYo (ordinary strain), but also includes the PVYn (tobacco veinal necrosis strain) and the PVYntn (potato tuber necrotic strain) variants. In addition, more and more previously unreported viral strains, probably recombinants, with new and unknown capabilities continue to be discovered within U.S. seedstocks. The impact of PLRV (and the serious  net necrosis  tuber symptom that it causes) was greatly reduced by the advent of systemic insecticides, such as imidacloprid, that effectively control the aphid vectors of the virus. While the amount of PLRV in Idaho seed lots has not rebounded to high levels, there appears to have been a small but steady increase over the last three years. BRR is a disease that follows a cyclic pattern of boom and bust within the seed potato industry. The ebb and flow of this disease is due to a greater emphasis on sanitation during outbreaks followed by a gradual relaxation in sanitation over the next few years following the initial outbreak. Lax sanitation leads to resurgence in the disease and the cycle is repeated. New and far more powerful detection techniques in the form of Real-time PCR have given the industry the ability to detect this disease at levels unheard of just few years ago. The application of these new detection techniques combined with a constant emphasis on sanitation should allow the industry to break these seemingly inevitable cycles and put the disease into remission."

Pest management practices can be developed to delay and potentially avert evolutionary changes that otherwise reduce the efficacy of control measures. This proposal focuses on examining the environmental factors that limit the spread of adaptive genes among populations of the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) in the state of Wisconsin. In recent years, CPB evolved resistance to neonicotinoids in New York, Michigan and, subsequently, Wisconsin. I plan to measure genetic variation at a regional scale of the Midwest, to estimate the rate of gene flow among isolated populations of CPB. Genetic differences will be compared to measurements of environmental variation to identify landscape features that limit the dispersal of beetles. I will also measure resistance to neonicitinoid pesticides among beetle populations in Wisconsin, to provide a map of the geographical distribution of neonicotinoid-resistant populations. Genetic and resistance data will be used to model the potential spread of neonicotinoid-resistance in Wisconsin. Additionally, this project will identify genetic loci involved in pesticide resistance, by examining differences in genetic variation in resistant and non-resistant beetles. This has the potential to identify new gene targets for genetic control measures. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to identify mechanisms of pest resistance, and by understanding these mechanisms, to help promote new strategies of safe and effective control of insect pests. This will provide for global food security by mitigating pest impacts on plant health and production."

In addition, world travel and commerce have accelerated the dissemination of pest species, including plant-parasitic nematodes. Development and application of new diagnostic protocols for accurate identification of nematode species is beneficial and required for national and international regulatory and quarantine agencies relative to free trade and economics, as exemplified by recent trade restrictions on movement of potatoes due to findings of quarantine-status cyst or root-knot nematodes in US production areas such as Idaho. The nematology community has repeatedly advocated the need for funding support focused on the basic and applied research required to advance agro-ecologically sustainable alternative management approaches and accurate nematode detection and diagnostics. This project addresses these needs directly for the most important groups of plant parasitic nematodes. A major shift in nematode-management strategies is occurring, from almost exclusive reliance on soil-applied nematicides, to the use of combinations of alternative strategies such as crop rotation, host plant resistance, cultural manipulations and biological control (Ferris et al., 1992). An important difference from nematicides is that the alternatives are influenced directly by genetic variability existing in target nematode field populations. Hence, the successful use of alternatives requires more information to implement than nematicide-based strategies. Assessment and characterization of variability and adaptation extant in nematode populations and agro-environmental conditions influencing host-nematode interactions will assist in the successful application of alternative management approaches, in addition to guiding initial development and deployment of new strategies. For example, knowing the frequency of virulence genes in a nematode population will allow deployment of corresponding resistance genes and promotion of resistance durability, a major project focus."

The modified models will be evaluated by testing simulated responses at plant component and whole plant levels. The potato and corn models, along with a rye cover crop model, and existing models for soybean and corn, will then be used for assessment of the environmental consequences of agricultural management practices on carbon sequestration and nutrient balances. These practices include fertilizer applications, rotations, and cover crops. The specific sub-objectives are 1) to improve simulation of the above- and below-ground potato and corn processes in the areas of: (a) water and nutrient stress effects on growth, development, morphology, and yield, (b) response of root growth and activity (water and nutrient uptake) to soil nutrients (N, P and K), and, c) evaluate the new model components using experimental data; and, 2) intercompare crop and economic models and foster improvements in these models to increase their capability to utilize data from climate scenarios as part of AgMIP.Approach:   Mechanistic models for soybean (GLYCIM), cotton (GOSSYM), corn (MAIZSIM), and potato (SPUDSIM), have been developed in previous projects by this group. The proposed research will broaden the capabilities of the corn and potato models by utilizing data from experiments carried out in unique, state-of-the-art sun-lit growth chambers and field plots. Short and long term experiments will be employed to test hypotheses and develop algorithms for plant processes to be used in the computer models. Data collected by collaborators will be used to test and evaluate the models. A simple Rye model will be developed to simulate a cover crop during the fall-winter season. A computer graphical user interface will be developed using components from the existing software program, GUICS, to allow a user to simulate long term crop rotations over multiple growing seasons. Advanced data management capabilities will be added to the interface to help with interpretation and management of input and output data. Tools for weather generation and estimation of soil hydraulic properties will be added to the interface to provide a wide range of environmental conditions for assessment.

To achieve this, breeders cross a wild variety to a crop variety.  The result is called a hybrid, and it mixes genes from both parents. Most of the genes from the wild variety, however, are unsuited for agriculture and must be cast away. This is done by repeated crossing to the crop variety, coupled to selection for the trait of interest, a process called backcrossing that often requires as many as 10 years. This constitutes a dramatic bottleneck to developing new varieties.  Therefore, shortening the development time is particularly critical in the face of unexpected crop challenges when human sustenance depends on the rapid development of new, improved varieties. This project addresses this need. It aims at developing a method for rapid deployment of useful traits into crops, using potato as the experimental system. The collaboration between University of California-Davis and the International Potato Center will also train graduate and undergraduate students in genomic-based breeding.  The method developed will be applicable in many crop species and will be useful for both basic and applied research.  Haploid induction, a process that generates plants with a single genome instead of the two parental ones, can significantly shorten the time it takes to make new varieties. However, no methods have resolved the problem of overcoming linkage drag, the common, negative association of deleterious genes with desirable ones. The project team discovered a method to facilitate the transfer of selected genomic regions to a target variety, providing a novel solution to make breeding faster and more efficient. The work plan combines rapid testing in the model plant Arabidopsis with exploration of natural and engineered haploid inducer systems in potato to develop methods for rapid and simple introgression of new traits in crops. The specific objectives are to 1) Exploit and develop haploid induction systems in potato, based on the S. tuberosum phureja haploid inducer as well as on manipulation of centromeric histone H3. 2) Engineer introgression of defined chromosomal segments from a donor to a recipient genome using different types of recombination mechanisms. Useful potato and Arabidopsis lines produced by this work will be deposited in, respectively, GRIN NRSP-6 (http://www.ars-grin.gov/nr6/) and the ABRC (https:/www.arabidopsis.org/) stock centers.

While the impact of invasive pests and new diseases caused by pathogens can be dramatic, the more subtle impacts of native pests and diseases are poorly understood. For example, can native pathogens and pests help promote (rather than destroy) biodiversity by limiting the most common tree species, creating room in the forest for rare species that would otherwise be outcompeted? This project will focus on the role of native pathogens, called oomycetes, in maintaining tree diversity in an old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest. Oomycetes, or water molds, are highly destructive fungus-like plant pathogens, best known for causing the Irish potato famine in the 1850s. Though well known as agricultural pathogens, oomycetes are native to and abundant in many forests. However, almost nothing is known about their ecological roles in natural forests. This project will (i) document the oomycete species present in the Wind River old growth forest in southern Washington state, (ii) determine the ability of each oomycete species to attack or limit different types of tree species in the forest, and (iii) use modern genetic techniques to explore how oomycetes may adapt to different types of tree species. By integrating all this information, the researchers will develop a better understanding of the roles of oomycetes and other pathogens in forests. This understanding will improve management of natural ecosystems and the diseases that occur within them. The project will also train undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students.  An initial census of plants and oomycetes, using both culturing and culture-independent methods, together with genotyping of the plants and oomycetes, will lead to plant-inoculation experiments that will identify the host ranges of the oomycetes. Genome and transcriptome sequencing will examine the mechanisms by which narrow host range oomycetes may adapt to genetic diversity in the dominant host plant species, and will examine more deeply how broad host range oomycetes may adapt to a diversity of plant species in their habitat.  A particular focus will be on the role of endemic broad-host-range oomycetes, and how their interactions with dominant and non-dominant host species may differ. By integrating taxonomic, genetic, genomic and functional information about the oomycetes and plants at the Wind River site, two broad hypotheses regarding possible roles of oomycetes in influencing plant biodiversity will be tested. The two hypotheses are: (A) Narrow and broad host range pathogens may reduce the fitness of dominant hosts and so promote plant species and genetic diversity.  (B) Dominant hosts may benefit from the presence of broad host range pathogens due to superior resistance or tolerance to broad-host-range pathogens. Both (A) and (B) may operate independently for different species, or even strains, of pathogens."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Nathaniel Butler is  Enhancing genetic map resolution in diploid potato using sequence-specific nucleases.  The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Shelley Janskey.  Genetic improvement of crops is a vital aspect of agriculture that continues to challenge geneticists and breeders. Over centuries, crops have been domesticated to increase yield, but fully understanding the genetic basis for improving productivity remains an important area of research.  A major constraint for finding new traits is that many plant genomes are inherently limited by low rates of recombination, or exchange of DNA, during the fundamental process of sexual reproduction called meiosis. During meiosis, DNA from the male and female mix, break and then recombine in offspring, thus producing the basis for all the variation of life. This project will enhance the ability of plant DNA to recombine more frequently. Rates of recombination will be increased by engineering into potato the enzymes and components necessary for recombination. In turn, mapping of traits will be improved and new variation can be introduced into potato with the potential to greatly enhanced breeding capabilities of crop plants. Through seminars and local activities, high school and undergraduate students will participate in the project and will be trained in the new cutting edge methods of molecular genetics and genome editing.  This project addresses the problem of limited genetic map resolution in bi-parental populations through three objectives. The first objective is to genetically engineer events of diploid potato to express sequence-specific nucleases, TALENs and CRISPR/Cas and a natural nuclease, SPO11 using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The second is to evaluate TALEN and SPO11 events using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and in bi-parental populations using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). The third is to map the male fertility (Mf) locus and fine map the pigmented flesh (Pf) locus using CRISPR/Cas events. The results will shed light on the limitations of recombination in a crop species and provide a strategy for improving genetic map resolution. Student involvement will contribute to training the next generation of scientists to learn interdisciplinary approaches in molecular tools."

Duplication occurs when an offspring ends up with two copies of all of the chromosomes of its parents. Genome duplications have occurred frequently within the flowering plants (300,000+ species), and likely contributed to their success. Most agricultural crops are the result of one or more recent duplication events, including wheat, cotton, corn, potato, and sugarcane. Thus, the research will be of broad importance in agriculture as well as the study of biodiversity.Tolmiea (Saxifragaceae) contains one polyploid, T. menziesii that arose directly from the single diploid in the genus, T. diplomenziesii. Ongoing work found divergence both in abiotic niche preference and physiological water stress responses between diploid and autotetraploid Tolmiea. In concert with other ecophysiological investigations, this research will characterize the role autopolyploidy has played in the divergence of gene expression patterns using a common garden experiment consisting of multiple populations and multiple water-stress treatments. This study will: 1) provide insights into genome-wide patterns of gene expression in a natural autopolyploid compared to its diploid parent, 2) evaluate the variation and responsiveness of gene expression levels to the presence and absence of water-stress, and 3) use synthetic polyploid lines to determine whether these changes are the immediate effect of polyploidy or the result of subsequent evolution. This study will increase our understanding of gene expression changes resulting from autopolyploidy, and will provide valuable information for future breeding management and improvement of autopolyploid crops."

Disease outbreaks can very in their severity and their economic impact from instances such as, the Great Irish Potato Famine to fire blight outbreaks in apple orchards across the U.S. on year-to-year basis. This research aims to identify new components of the plant disease-signaling machinery that have been previously undiscoverable due to the technologies available at the time of the research. The principle investigator will work in collaboration with Dr. Yasuomi Tada at Nagoya University to utilized rapid purification of many plant proteins to determine novel protein-protein interactions.   In detail, with the help of Dr. Tada, and his team at Nagoya University, researchers will aim to identify novel interacting proteins using the Arabidopsis protein NDR1 as a target. Non-Race Specific Disease Resistance 1 (NDR1) has been previously shown to be involved in resistance to a variety of plant virulence mechanisms at the molecular level. The loss of the NDR1 protein creates plants that are susceptible to bacterial infection at high levels. It is hypothesized that additional interacting proteins, specifically in plant plasma membranes, are aiding in the cellular function of the protein NDR1, and this action is more governed by ?protein complexes? to initiate the cellular changes necessary for plant resistance to bacterial pathogens.

Many pathogenic fungi and oomycetes develop a feeding organ named the haustorium to extract nutrients from host plants. Such pathogens cause widespread and/or devastating crop diseases such as wheat powdery mildew and rust, potato late blight and sudden oak death, resulting in huge crop losses and tree damages worldwide.  In recent years, much has been learnt about the molecular mechanisms concerning plant immunity. However, how defense responses are executed at host-pathogen interfaces is poorly understood. Interactions between the model plant Arabidopsis (epidermal cell)and Powdery mildew (haustorium) provides a convenient single-cell system for addressing this challenging question. The project utilizes an Arabidopsis resistance protein that is specifically targeted to the plant-fungal interface as a unique tool to investigate the formation of the interfacial membrane, how that formation is coupled to immune signaling and protein trafficking to enable defense execution at specific subcellular sites. New information from this project should help elucidate the fundamental cell biology principles governing formation of and activities at host-microbe interfacial membranes, and yield new insight into novel intervention strategies to control plant diseases caused by haustorium-forming pathogens. The outcome of the host-pathogen interaction is determined at the extra-haustorial membrane (EHM), the host-pathogen interface. However, both the origin and biogenesis of the EHM and the molecular host-pathogen interactions at this interface are largely unknown.  The long-term goal of this project is to understand the biogenesis of the EHM and its role in host defense and fungal development. These investigators have shown that (i) a host resistance (R) protein named RPW8 from Arabidopsis is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted defenses via an unknown mechanism; and that (ii) RPW8 contains two putative basic residue-enriched motifs essential for EHM-targeting.  Therefore, RPW8 can be used as a unique tool to understand the host defense at the EHM, the origin and biogenesis of the EHM, and the EHM-oriented protein trafficking in the invaded host cell during haustorial development. Specifically, there are three major aims for this project. Aim 1 addresses how hydrogen peroxide is produced and accumulated in the host-pathogen interface during RPW8-mediated and basal resistance against haustorium-forming pathogens. Aim 2 is focused on characterization of a special protein (SNARE) complex that is engaged in the EHM-oriented vesicle trafficking. Aim 3 investigates EHM biogenesis and its role in host defense and fungal pathogenesis. A combinatory forward and reverse genetics approach, aided by chemical genetic assays and state-of-the-art confocal imaging will be employed to achieve the above three specific objectives. Novel and important knowledge from this project will significantly advance our current understanding of the cell biology and molecular interaction between plants and haustorium-forming pathogens, which should help design new strategies to control plant diseases caused by such pathogens in the future. The investigators will also continue to produce short videos of their work that can be disseminated and used for teaching."

Although much is known about the alteration of physiology and growth of plants exposed to pollutant gases, most of these studies are observational, from an ecological perspective, and do not address the possibility of using gaseous nitrogen to augment plant growth. If successful, this EAGER project will harness and exploit known molecular mechanisms of uptake and transport of soil N to facilitate these processes for airborne N. The results generated from this exploratory and high risk research may also point the way to similar strategies for N use in other species and for other important gaseous pollutants. This project will foster intellectual and technical exchange in U.S. and Africa in the area of molecular plant physiology to develop novel strategies for  pollutant  utilization in important crop species such as cassava, rice and potato. Certain air pollutants, including ammonia and nitrogen dioxide, are absorbed by leaves and are potential sources of nitrogen (N) needed for plant growth. However, plants did not evolve to take up these compounds from the air, and even if the nutrients are absorbed they may not be utilized correctly. Indeed, it has been noted primarily by ecophysiologists and forest biologists that these aerial nutrients stimulate shoot growth under certain conditions. However, it is also the case that the newly formed organic compounds are not transported out of the leaves, sequestering not only the absorbed N, but much of the carbon (C) derived from photosynthesis. As a result, root growth is inhibited, leaving the plants susceptible to drought and other stresses. In addition, the edible parts of crop plants, including tubers, do not benefit from nutrients if they stagnate in the leaves. To address this challenge, this EAGER project will develop and test novel molecular strategies for increasing the absorption and transport of aerial-derived nitrogenous compounds in potato, cassava and rice using select candidate genes identified in model plants such as Arabidopsis. All data and resources developed in this project will be available to the public. DNA sequences will be deposited at GenBank."

This bacterium is classified into 5 races that are based loosely on host ranges, and into 5 biovars, which are based upon their differential ability to utilize a panel of carbohydrates. While Race 1 is endemic to the Southern United States, Ralstonia solancearum race 3 biovar 2 (R3b2) is not known to occur naturally in the U.S. and therefore is considered a select agent. R3b2 can devastate crops, leading to major economic losses worldwide: global damages in world potato crops alone from R3b2 are estimated to be over $950 million per year, which is why its quarantine is crucial for protecting American agricultural interests. Presently, visual inspections remain the primary way to monitor agricultural imports for this disease. Asymptomatic plant material, however, easily could allow R3b2 to breach U.S. borders. There have been, in fact, at least two recent cases of R3b2 infestations being traced back to geranium imports from Kenya and Guatemala, exemplifying the need for an early detection system to be in place at U.S. ports of entry. Available tests are not fast enough to conduct large-scale inspections, nor are they sensitive enough to detect asymptomatic plant material. In addition, most of the tests require dedicated laboratories able to conduct complex assay procedures. In the recovery plan for Ralstonia solancearum race 3 biovar 2, which was drafted as part of the National Plant Disease Recovery System, the USDA lists one of the  Highly important  research priorities as:  explor[ing] novel diagnostic techniques to detect R3b2 quickly and at low concentrations, such as ... highly sensitive antibody-responsive cell culture systems.  PathSensors, Inc. has responded to this research priority by proposing to build a multi-well diagnostic device using CANARY&reg; technology.CANARY&reg; technology is a cell-based biosensor technology that demonstrates unprecedented performance in terms of speed, sensitivity, and ease-of-use when compared with other standard detection technologies. The USDA has invested over one million dollars to develop a CANARY&reg; biosensor cell line to detect Ralstonia and the USDA CPHST Laboratory in Beltsville, MD, has used this biosensor to achieve one of the lowest limits of detection of any CANARY&reg; biosensor based, or other type, assay for the detection of Ralstonia, achieving an LoD of 3 cfu from infected potato slices. PathSensors, Inc. intends to add its expertise to the USDA&#39;s efforts to develop efficient sample preparation methods to achieve similar results with geranium stem samples. Instrumentation and sample processing steps need to be optimized, however, in order for CANARY&reg; technology to be used efficiently at plant testing stations. To maximize the benefits of CANARY&reg; technology, we must develop a new multiplex instrument platform as well as a simple and rapid means for plant sample preparation and introduction to the biosensors. The instrument system will consist of commercially available parts linked together and controlled through an integrated computer software system. Once the optimum sample process steps have been established, the user will be led through all steps of the assay via a computer software program. Positive or negative sample identifications will be provided by processing the CANARY&reg; light output signal through an automated detection algorithm.Upon its completion, this system can be deployed and used in survey programs, field labs, and diagnostic testing facilities. Moreover, this system will be made available to exporters to assure their plants are pathogen-free prior to shipping. After developing a multi-well diagnostic device, PathSensors, Inc. will further adapt the system for use with other existing plant pathogen CANARY&reg; cell lines, such as those for Phytophthora and Citrus leprosis virus."

The Pacific Northwest (PNW) states of ID, WA and OR, home to the bulk of US potato production, were initially thought to be safe from this threat; the pathogen was unknown here and its potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli) vector was thought to be rare. A surprising, widespread zebra chip outbreak in PNW potatoes in 2011 was followed by discovery of both year-round-resident and apparently migratory psyllid populations. The specific source of pathogen-carrying psyllids in our region nonetheless remains frustratingly unclear, perhaps reflecting the complexity of vector-pathogen ecology in our unique climate, ecological context, and cropping systems. To fill these knowledge gaps, we propose to (1) map the full range and spatiotemporal patterns of crop and non-crop host-plant use by vector and pathogen, and determine how this is impacted by climate; (2) deploy cutting-edge genomics approaches to infer fine-scale movement of psyllid and bacterium into and across the region; and (3) use this knowledge to build predictive, GIS- and weather-based models of disease risk delivered to growers through an easy-to-use mobile decision-support tool.

Root knot and lesion nematodes are the most significant pests of potato production. Currently, in many production areas, including the Northeastern states, nematodes are managed by prophylactic application of fumigants or nematicides prior to planting. For example, in 2010, 75% of potato production area in Washington State was treated with fumigants for the control of nematodes. The benefits of applying fumigants for potato production in the Pacific Northwest area have been estimated at $783,901 annually. Fumigants and nematicides have a high environmental impact quotient, often have suboptimal efficacy, are subject to enhanced biodegradation following repeated use, and represent a substantial expense to growers. The continued management of nematodes using prophylactic application of fumigants and nematicides is not sustainable and critically threatens the continued viability of potato production within the United States estimated to be worth approximately $3,993,815 (/$1,000). Moreover, manipulating nematode populations prior to potato through cover cropping and rotation to non-hosts does not provide sufficient control due to the differential host status of cover crops for mixed nematode populations and other soilborne pathogens, retention of low populations still above damage thresholds, and a high frequency of susceptible crops within the rotation. The risk-averse nature of growers which has directly led to the prophylactic application of fumigants and nematicides for nematode control is a direct function of the high crop losses incurred. However, in many cases, growers may be applying fumigants and nematicides unnecessarily and making false positive decisions with adverse effects on crop returns, beneficial soil micro-organism populations, and with the potential for off-site deleterious environmental effects. This behavior is perpetuated due to the predominantly antiquated methods of nematode population enumeration which is laborious and time consuming. These factors often deter growers from obtaining an estimate of nematode population densities. This project aims to enhance the utility of pre-plant nematode population estimation by developing methods of higher sensitivity than the traditional approach. This will lead to more accurate predictions of crop damage on a within and between field basis and decreased frequencies of prophylactic fumigant application when not fully justified. This will also enable growers to make reliable and robust decisions on nematode management by pesticide applications. Further resolution of the spatial variability of nematode populations within fields will lead to an assessment of the viability of a zone management approach to further reduce pesticide usage."

My sabbatical goal is to become proficient in the DSSAT cropping systems model to produce actionable information for farmers and farm advisors about (a) likely vulnerabilities of current potato and grain production systems to climate change and weather variability, and (b) potential diversification strategies to improve resilience, including crop rotation diversification and crop-livestock integration.To gain proficiency with DSSAT, I will spend six months at the Agricultural Research Institute of Chile to learn from and collaborate with Dr. Patricio Sanda&ntilde;a, an expert in the ecophysiology of potatoes and grain crops and experienced user of crop simulation models including DSSAT. We will conduct vulnerability assessments for rainfed potato, wheat, field peas, and potato-grain rotations in Maine and Chile, and investigate how longer rotations and improvement in soil quality from integrating livestock affect yield stability and profitability. I will use this information to engage farmers in collaborative modeling to explore their questions about likely climate change impacts and ideas for reducing climate-related risk. The ability to use DSSAT to explore  what if  questions in both research and outreach settings will provide me with a unique and much needed capacity to advance climate change adaptation and resilience in my region."

TSWV is distributed worldwide, damaging over 1,000 plant species including important commodities such as tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, peanuts, potatoes and many ornamental plants. TSWV and related tospoviruses are considered emerging diseases because in recent years new species have been described, while the plant host range and geographical limits have expanded for established species. The western flower thrips (WFT) is the most efficient TSWV vector and it is an economically important pest in greenhouses and field crops. The management of thrips pests is difficult because populations of WFT have developed high levels of resistance to many insecticides. Transgenic plants are recognized as promising options for tospovirus management. We propose to exploit and elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) and dynamics of transgenic expression of a TSWV glycoprotein for control of tospovirus spread by WFT. TSWV depends exclusively on its thrips vector for plant-to-plant movement; therefore we propose to disrupt the disease cycle by interfering with the early events of virus transmission by the vector. Disruption of virus entry into the vector will prevent insect transmission or greatly reduce transmission efficiency and thus, stop the transmission cycle. TSWV entry into the thrips vector is mediated by the molecular interaction between the virus protein GN, which serves as a viral attachment protein, and the thrips midgut. Based on our recent finding that TSWV-infected tomato transgenics that express GN inhibited TSWV acquisition and transmission by WFT, we aim to determine the mechanism(s) of reduced acquisition from these transgenic plants, determine the efficacy of these transgenics to prevent spread of other related tospoviruses, and define the region of the GN protein that binds to thrips midguts. The outcome of this proposed work will bring us one step closer to our long-term goal of developing novel, sustainable, and biologically-based strategies for controlling TSWV in agricultural croplands and greenhouses."

Colonization relies at least as much on a pathogen&#39;s capacity to reproduce using host biosubstances as on overcoming host defenses. Little is known about how pathogens perceive and obtain nutrients, and how metabolism varies between infection styles. This proposal addresses these issues in two members of the taxonomic group known as oomycetes, namely Phytophthora infestans (potato late blight) and the Pythium ultimum (potato leak). Both cause important diseases on plants, including on the same host, potato tubers. However, the two species employ different strategies: P. infestans causes little host damage until the late stages of infection, and is believed to take up nutrients using special organs known as haustoria, while Py. ultimum is believed to obtain nutrients by killing the cells of the host plant, and then absorbing the nutrients that are released.Our work will focus on two aspects of nutrition: how nutrients are acquired by P. infestans and Py. ultimum during plant infection, and how the nutrients such as sugars, nitrate, and amino acids are metabolized by those species. The work will be interdisciplinary and will employ the tools of cell biology, genetics, bioinformatics, and biochemistry. The research will test concepts in plant-oomycete interactions that are based largely on dogma, such as that oomycete haustoria are enriched for transporters and that P. infestans kills the cells of its host late in disease. It will also lead to innovative approaches for protecting plants from biotic stress by identifying pathways in the pathogen that may be targets for agrochemicals or plant-based solutions."

Experimental evidence suggests that dietary anthocyanins can reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, two critical factors in the pathogenesis of IBD. In the US, there is a growing interest for color-fleshed potatoes that can serve as an important delivery vehicle for dietary anthocyanins. Although dietary anthocyanins have a poor bioavailability, they may still affect gut inflammation due to direct contact and metabolism in the gut. However, the interaction between anthocyanins and gut microbiota in exerting anti-inflammatory properties in the gut remains somewhat elusive. In this proposal we propose to determine (1) the extent to which white-, purple- and red-fleshed potatoes suppress gut inflammation and oxidative stress in acute and chronic models of murine colitis, (2) the ability of gut bacterial metabolites formed from color-fleshed potatoes to suppress inflammation using conventional and germ-free mice, and (3) the extent to which color-fleshed potato diets alter inflammatory potential of the gut microbiota.This project, if successful, will delineate the interaction between gut bacteria and anthocyanin and provide mechanistic data to support the anti- inflammatory role of color-fleshed potato anthocyanins in reducing colitis. It might also improve the economic value of the crop because of the health functionality."

Although Verticillium wilts are primarily managed through rotations with asymptomatic hosts, the efficacy of these rotations has been extremely inconsistent depending on the field and/or growing region. The research proposed here intends to be proof-of-concept that one mechanism by which an asymptomatic rotational crop such as oat can impact disease severity in a subsequent potato crop is through a change or shift in the pathogen population composition. This genotypic shift results from the endophytic interaction between the asymptomatic host and the pathogen. To address this hypothesis we will use a combination of field, microbiological and genetic analyses. Replicated field microplots will be infested with specific mixtures of V. dahliae genotypes and subjected to an oat-potato rotation. We will then monitor shifts in genotypic diversity due to the endophytic interaction of the fungus with the asymptomatic rotational crop oat. The genotype shift in soil V. dahliae populations will be identified based on the quantification of the frequencies of the genotypes present in soil based on Illumina sequencing of SNPs diagnostic for each genotype. We will also monitor disease development to make correlations between genotype shifts and disease suppression."

Potato acreage in ND ranks in the top three and total production is among the top three or four states, depending on the year (Anonymous, 2013). Additionally, added value to the states&#39; potato production comes from the two French fry production facility and multiple wash plants that pack and nationally distribute fresh market potatoes. ND is the second largest seed potato producer, much of which is exported out of state to other potato producing regions. Clearly, potato production is a major economic factor among agricultural commodities in the state, and ND plays an integral part in the US potato production market.Potato diseases are an extremely important yield and quality-limiting factor for this crop. A significantly higher percentage of the variable cost inputs into the potato crop are directed at disease management compared to other crops grown in ND. A primary reason for this is that the crop is vegetatively propagated. There are approximately 150 diseases that affect potato, of which 30-40 are economically important, all of which can be harbored in or on the tuber. Plant diseases that would normally not be a problem in a true seed crop such as wheat, soybean, corn or dry edible beans are transmitted and harbored by the potato tuber, making diseases of the crop a major economic constraint and very difficult to control.In 2006 and 2007, potato producers in ND and MN lost in excess of $8 million due to storage rots, leak and pink rot and approximately $12 million to bacterial ring rot (RD Offutt, Co., Simplot, Inc., Lamb-Weston, Inc; personal communication). The cost of controlling Verticillium wilt by soil fumigation with metam sodium is estimated to cost growers in ND and MN approximately $25-28 million (estimate provided by the manufacturer, AmVac, Inc.). This clearly illustrates the need to improve our understanding of these diseases, their management and the means to predict their development. In addition, new and emerging diseases occur all the time in potato production, such as the recent immigration of the new viruses PMTV and TRV into the U.S. and the development of ZC caused by a very primitive bacterium. We must be prepared to address such disease issues as they arise.Research performed by this project has made significant progress in the management of potato diseases that improve the profitability and sustainability of this crop to ND producers and to the value-added constituency. However, due to the nature of the crop and susceptibility of the major potato cultivars to many diseases, further progress is needed to insure continued productivity of the crop to the region and the U.S. Much of the future progress will be directed at providing immediate disease development strategies that are research-based and through the development of cultivars that resist disease."

Humans have distributed different strains of R. solanacearum around the world, but different strains rarely occur in the same field and have never been found in the same plant, for unknown reasons. American strain K60 makes several proteins, called bacteriocins, that inhibit other R. solanacearum strains, including a strain called Race 3, which causes potato brown rot and geranium wilt. Race 3 is listed as a federal Select Agent quarantine pathogen because it poses a serious threat to U.S. agriculture. Strain K60 outcompetes Race 3 in both stems and rhizospheres of tomato plants. To better understand the role of bacteriocins in competitive fitness and exclusion of this major pathogen, we propose to: 1) Characterize the biological functions of K60&#39;s bacteriocins using biochemical and mutational analysis; 2) Determine the role of bacteriocins in the competitive fitness of R. solanacearum on host plants, using defined mutant strains. To explore the feasibility of using bacteriocins to control potato brown rot and exclude Race 3 from imported geranium cuttings, we will: 3) Construct and test bacteriocin-expressing potato and geranium lines. Together, the proposed experiments will both elucidate the basic biology of the abundant bacteriocins produced by R. solanacearum and develop a novel approach for controlling a significant threat to American agriculture."

With 80 pounds of tomatoes consumed yearly by each American, tomato is the 2nd most popular home garden plant, and field crop. The annual tomato production in the US is a 25 billion dollars industry with additional $800 million worth tomatoes imported from Mexico. Distribution of the tomato products to northern states is not only costly, but also contributes to the pollution of environment. Among 7,000 of tomato cultivars, only a very few cultivars have been introduced to the northern latitudes with short-season growth. Most cultivars are adapted to high tropical and subtropical temperatures and take 60 to more than 95 days to mature. Many heirloom tomatoes face challenge to grow in short-season areas such as northern part of Minnesota, Dakotas, and Wisconsin. Even if the tomato plants survive, their fruit quality may be poor due to failure to ripen, or low yield. To maximize fruit quality, tomato cages are used to support growing branches and fruits, which require additional labor and production cost for growers. The obstacles of environment, available cultivars, and maintenance cost have discouraged home gardeners and commercial growers for investing in tomato production. We commit to fill these gaps by breeding for dwarf, high-yield, cage free, short-growing season tomatoes for potted plants, home gardens, and large scale vegetable farms with the potential for machine harvesting. These cultivars can also be used to improve specific traits such as taste through addition of extra copies of tomato chromosomes. Tomato is not only a staple crop, but also an excellent model organism amendable to anther culture, gene introduction and has vast genetic resources, which make it the ideal system to develop novel plant breeding methods. The aneuploid breeding technique we propose to develop through this project has potential for a major breakthrough for future plant improvement. The method to develop stable aneuploid germplasms without involvement of genetic modification in the final products is acceptable by consumers for both organic and sustainable agriculture. Expected outcomes including a series of novel stable aneuploid genetic stocks will contribute to the diversity of tomato cultivars for cool, short-season locations. The methods of breeding aneuploid tomato varieties could be applied to the improvement of other crops, such as potato, turfgrass. Students, growers, educators, and research scientists will be trained through carrying out this project."

In the US alone, tomato production and processing is a billion-dollar industry, ranking at par in terms of yield and consumption with potatoes among commercial vegetable crops. Tomato production represents a large proportion of Indiana&#39;s vibrant vegetable industry. Indiana is second in the nation in the production and value of processing tomatoes. Studies for developing fundamental knowledge base in reference to breeding, genetics, and genomics are essential that will allow enhancing fruit quality, appearance, taste and phytonutrient content of fruits. Tomato is now featured among the foremost crop-plant models in horticultural crops for understanding and controlling fruit ripening and enhancing phytonutrient levels via molecular genetics approaches (Mehta et al., 2002; Giovannoni, 2004). Reverse genetics has allowed reducing biosynthesis or perception of ethylene to improve fruit shelf life (Giovannoni, 2004). However, impaired ethylene production may have compromised the organoleptic fruit flavor. We have shown that enhancing the levels of polyamines greatly improves nutritional and processing fruit quality, and vine life of fruits (Mehta et al., 2002; Mattoo et al., 2006, Mattoo and Handa, 2008; Nambeesan and Handa, Unpublished results). We have discovered that co-silencing a ripening specific lipoxygenase (LOX) decreases membrane breakdown, maintains fruit texture and extended period shelf life of ripe tomato fruits (Kausch et al., 2012). Increasing expression of one of the small heat-shock proteins significantly improved processing attributes of tomato fruit (Handa, unpublished results). Pyramiding these genetic engineering modifications in one genotype holds promise to improve fruit shelf life, flavor, and nutritional quality and processing yield."

Genome sequences of many plant pathogens are available and hold the promise of discovery of new plathogen-plant interaction genes and mechanisms, more sophisticated and specific means of pathogen detection, and ultimately better control strategies. Our ability to use these genome sequences is limited by incomplete understanding of which genes are involved in interaction with plants and incomplete understanding of the function of many genes. We developed a computational tool to predict which genes contribute to host-microbe interactions and have identified several hundred potential new contributing genes in an important bacterial pathogen of potato. This project is dedicated to experimentally tesing the predictions of this computational tool and refining the tool to generate more accurate predictions."

When high populations of potato leafhopper are not controlled, large reductions in alfalfa yield and forage quality occur. Currently available potato leafhopper resistant cultivars have glandular trichomes and generally do not need to be sprayed with insecticide. Unfortunately, these cultivars yield less total season forage than most conventional cultivars, except midsummer when PLH are at damaging levels. Leafhopper resistant cultivars first marketed were shown to have higher forage quality, thus partly compensating for lower forage yield. Currently, a limited number of newer potato leafhopper resistant cultivars are available to producers and the forage quality of these cultivars has not been tested and none of these cultivars were bred specifically for the Northeast USA. The overall research objectives are to develop potato leafhopper resistant, high forage quality alfalfa cultivars from New York adapted alfalfa populations and to evaluate current potato leafhopper resistant cultivars for forage quality and yield. Field grown space-plants will be established and superior plants selected for potato leafhopper resistance and forage quality. These plants will be interpollinated to develop new cultivars with improved traits. Trials of current cultivars will be established and measured for forage yield and quality, and for potato leafhopper resistance. The overall goal of this project is to test and develop potato leafhopper resistant alfalfa cultivars with improved yield and forage quality for New York producers."

The manner in which the food material responds to this deformation can be described in rheological terms, but this may or may not relate to the sensations derived by the eater. Rheology relates to the bulk behavior of a material, in relation to itself, when exposed to externally applied stresses, based on its structure and composition. Energy applied to the material during mastication meets resistance to deformation and the resulting resistive forces are sensed by the eater, however crudely, as thickness, toughness, chewiness, etc. Interaction of oral structures and surfaces with each other during mastication introduces another source of energy exchange and sensation. These interactions are frictional in nature, and can be evaluated through Tribology; the study of interacting surfaces in relative motion. As oral structures / tissues approach each other during the masticatory cycle, the friction caused by the food material sliding along the surfaces or the surfaces themselves coming into contact is sensed and adapted to. Conversely, a food material may act as a lubricant preventing the contact of oral surfaces, imparting its own sensation. A third mode of energy transmission is energy transmitted through the material to its surroundings via acoustic waves. These vibrations may be sensed as sounds if they are transmitted directly through open air to the ear of the eater, as in the case of biting into an apple or crunching a potato chip. Similarly, a sensation similar to, but discrete from sound occurs through conduction of vibration through oral structures and tissues (i.e. bone conduction). The composite of all these modes of energy transfer are sensed and integrated simultaneously or in some combination with respect to oral processing time by the eater to form the experience of food texture. A holistic approach that simultaneously measures multiple or all modes of energy transmission in a simulated oral processing environment may yield an improved model for food material evaluation in relation to consumer liking / acceptance."

Glutein is akind of protein which is one of the two basic components of wheat grains, and the other is starch. When wheat flour proteins glutenin and gliadin come in contact with liquid during baking, gluten is formed, which gives important properties to regular dough such as the sticky effect and flexibility. However, gluten is responsible for wheat allergies, which is one of the eight most common food allergies in the United States. Gluten also causes celiac disease, which is an auto-immune disorder where the body attacks itself when exposed to gluten. This project aims to develop foods that are gluten-free from the four Micronesian local foods. Gluten-free foods that are safe for people with celiac disease are also safe for those who are following a wheat-free diet due to specific food allergy."

Not only can these pathogens be detrimental to crop production, but their presence may impact the ability to export these crops to out-of-state markets in the future. Many states and nations are developing agricultural security programs that will restrict the importation of propagative materials that are not certified to be free of known pathogens. As such, the overall goal of this project is to develop pathogen-free germplasm of vegetatively-propagated crops important to Hawaii. To achieve this, we will use modern sequencing technologies to identify pathogens that are infecting taro, sweet potato, and other vegetatively-propagated crops important to Hawaii. With this information, assays for their detection will be developed and shared with diagnosticians and other researchers. Cryotherapy and shoot-tip culture will be used to eliminate pathogens from select varieties of taro and sweet potato, and the detection assays will be used to evaluate their pathogen status. The horticultural characteristics of regenerated varieties will then be evaluated and demonstrated to growers and other stakeholders. The cultivation of clean taro and sweet potato germplasm has the potential to dramatically increase the production per unit area of these crops. In addition, establishing detection assays and pathogen elimination protocols will increase Hawaii&#39;s agricultural security by identifying and eliminating exotic pathogens from incoming germplasm."

During 2007-2012, potatoes accounted for roughly $102 million in farm-gate revenue, ranking 2nd for vegetables after sweetpotatoes. We are the nation&#39;s 3rd largest producer of spring potatoes averaging 16,000 acres per year and our growers fill an important niche in the eastern US potato production/ chip processing system. New varieties are one of the highest priorities for growers. &#39;Atlantic&#39;, the predominant chipping variety grown in NC was bred and selected in Maine. While it is a good variety for northern growers, in the mid-Atlantic and southern regions it suffers from internal heat necrosis (IHN), an internal tuber defect that occurs due to high temperatures. Severe IHN in a shipment of potatoes can result in an entire load of potatoes being rejected by processors, which occur yearly in NC. Therefore, there is great need to develop improved varieties free of IHN for the mid-Atlantic and southeastern US. Another concern of the industry is the need for high value specialty potatoes for production by small-scale growers who are primarily concerned with direct marketing their fresh market table stock potatoes.The primary goal of the NC State University potato breeding project is to identify new potato varieties for use in the mid-Atlantic and SE US. We use a multifaceted approach to develop new varieties because we have limited resources. As a USDA-NIFA NE1231 Regional Potato Variety Development Project member, we evaluate all advanced lines from potato breeding programs located in the NE US. Most major varieties, including Atlantic the dominant chipping variety in the, have passed through this system. This variety, which occupies ~50% of NC&#39;s acreage, generated over $22 million in NC farm-gate receipts during 2012. We have also developed early-generation selection projects with the USDA-ARS, Cornell University and the Univ. of Maine and we are a key player in collaborative early-generation potato selection trials supported by the US Potato Board (USPB) and the US Snack Food Association. This National Chip Processors Trial (NCPT) trialing system and is national in scope and the program is designed to identify and commercialize as rapidly as possible new potato varieties.To provide information on the potato varieties evaluated and/or developed by the program we have developed three online potato databases, which are on our project website at http://potatoes.ncsu.edu/. The NCSU Potato Database is populated with data collected on all lines trialed by our program since 1995. The NE1231 Potato Variety Development Project Database is a regional database with agronomic data from eight eastern US states and three Canadian provinces. While the NCPT Database contains all the data collected from at the 11 chip trial locations in the US. Each of these databases was created using an interface that allows users to dynamically generate one-page summaries of varieties in a printer friendly format. This web-resource is becoming increasingly popular, and is often used by potato growers seeking timely information on varieties.Through our collaborations with the potato breeding and seed production programs located throughout the US, we are developing new varieties better suited to our production conditions. Indeed, NC is recognized by our industry and scientific collaborators as a key site for the evaluation of potatoes in the southern US. Continued efforts to develop new potato clones will contribute to the development of a more economically and ecologically sustainable potato production system in the mid-Atlantic and SE US."

To remain competitive, NC&#39;s growers need new varieties and new marketing options. Traditional varieties need to be early and attractive, while specialty-type varieties popular with ethnic consumers need to be white- or cream-fleshed with a higher dry matter content and semi-sweet in flavor. Processing-type varieties for chips, fries, and QSR products, a rapidly increasing market sector in the US, need to be higher in dry matter content, orange, and sweet, but with low levels of browning during processing out of long-term storage. All new varieties need to be high yielding, and resistant to diseases and insects to promote a economically sustainable, environmentally sound production system.The NC State sweetpotato breeding program has developed a diverse research portfolio to acheive impact. We have active projects focused on using old and new breeding tools to develop traditional, processing, specialty, ornamental and industrial sweetpotatoes to meet the near- and long-term needs of the industry. To ensure that our efforts remain relevant and that new varieties are suitable for real world conditions and adopted as quickly as possible by farmers, we initiated our Grower Participatory Breeding Project. The GPBP is a partnership between researchers, extension agents and sweetpotato farmers. It is supported by NC SweetPotato Commission, and it has enabled us to significantly increase the number of materials evaluated by the program on-farm.Our breeding approach has been successful. About 85% of NC&#39;s sweetpotato crop is planted to the variety Covington, released by our program in 2005. Covington has experienced remarkable growth due in part to increased awareness of the nutritional properties of sweetpotatoes and the production of value-added products by the potato processing industry. Based on USDA NASS figures, NC farmer&#39;s harvested ca. 53,000 acres of sweet potatoes in 2013. The acreage was down 9,000 acres from 2012, but we still produced over 47% of the nation&#39;s crop, and our yields averaged 200 cwt. per acre matching the record high set in 2011. Using USDA NASS crop value estimates, the farm-gate value for &#39;Covington&#39; in 2013 for NC was ca. $146 million. &#39;Covington&#39; is also being grown in other states and accounts for roughly 40% of the US sweetpotato crop, with the total US value exceeding $250 million. Further, because the storage life of Covington is superior, it has also quickly become the sweetpotato of choice for the lucrative sweetpotato export dominated by NC growers.Like Covington, our award winning ornamental sweetpotatoes (OSP) are also outstanding in the marketplace. During 2012, we released two new lines &#39;NCORNSP-016SCC&#39; and &#39;NCORNSP-017SCBG&#39;, which will be marketed as &#39;Sweet Caroline Copper&#39; and &#39;Sweet Caroline Black Galaxy&#39;, respectively. Our OSP breeding partnership with Proven Winners, LLC was launched in 2009 and we now market 17 OSP varieties under the PW brand. Over 4.75 million of our OSP plants were sold in 2013, up 118% from 2010. On a consumer level, using $4/plant to estimate consumer sales, we estimate that our ornamental sweetpotatoes have generated almost $17 million in receipts last year for a wide range of large to small greenhouse, nursery and floricultural businesses.To address opportunities emerging from advances in agricultural biotechnology, we continue to explore the feasibility of producing bio-based renewable resources from industrial sweetpotatoes (ISP) along with Drs. Jonathan Schultheis and Dr. Truong (USDA-ARS/Dept. of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences). NCPUR06-020, our 1st industrial-type purple-fleshed sweetpotato to be released is an example of this effort. This variety is a high anthocyanin sweetpotato bred as a source of natural colorant with functional food properties for the food processing industries. It has released as a feedstock for a color extraction process and we expect that this natural colorant will be marketed nationally and internationally. Currently, most sweetpotato-based colorants are obtained from China and Japan, and this NCSU-NC industry collaboration represents a significant  in-sourcing  opportunity for US bio-based industries."

The narrow genetic base of cultivated commercial mints combine with multiple risk factors to threaten the continued production of this important specialty crop. Peppermint and spearmint are sterile polyploid hybrids that are not amenable to conventional breeding for crop improvement. All commercial mints are vegetatively propagated as clones with no genetic diversity. This is analogous to the potato introductions to Ireland from the new world, and mint production in the United States is decreasing due to the advancing of the plant disease Verticillium. This contributes to low productivity and a high susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stresses. Additional risk factors include high production costs and low oil prices due to competition from low cost yet lower quality foreign oil. Genetic improvement of mint is necessary for the long-term sustainability of this important U.S. specialty crop. This can be achieved by leveraging recent advances in high throughput sequencing and gene identification to direct mint variety improvement through non-transgenic genome-enabling breeding. Without initiating these approaches there is little hope for varietal improvement or the survival of the mint industry in the U.S. Loss of this valuable crop, and the heritage associated with both the production of mint and the various products that are made possible by American peppermint production, is unacceptable."

Added value is produced from the three fry production facilities (two in North Dakota, one in Minnesota), a dehydrated flake factory and multiple wash plants that distribute fresh market potatoes nationally. North Dakota ranks among the top three states for seed production; 80% is exported out of state. Potatoes are a major agricultural commodity in North Dakota, and have a major impact on US potato production markets for seed, processing and tablestock. The potato breeding program has been successful in the release of healthy potato cultivars with wide adaptability for the benefit of North Dakota, our region and nationally. The cultivars released from this program are recognized nationally and internationally. This is due in part to the cooperative efforts of potato scientists in the Plant Sciences and Plant Pathology Departments. This project actively collaborates with the NDSU potato breeding program for production of disease free parents and seed for increase and trials, and development of germplasm with resistance to dry rot, late blight and blemish diseases. It is desirable and critical to maintain this working relationship for the continued release of potato cultivars accepted by the industry. Potato diseases in both the field and storage are an extremely important yield and quality-limiting factors. Losses are common annually, and often can be significant, as they were in 1999 when over $98 million of potatoes were lost in storage due to late season infection by late blight. Similarly, the red-skinned tablestock potatoes that our area is noted for, is impacted negatively by blemish diseases in storage that dramatically reduce the marketability and profitability of this commodity to North Dakota producers. Newly emerging diseases continue to be found requiring immediate research efforts. Disease management input costs are a major part of potato production in North Dakota and other areas, partly because potatoes are vegetatively propagated to maintain varietal stability.The sugar beet industry of North Dakota and Minnesota leads the USA in sugar production and is a viable and profitable industry in our region. The direct and indirect economic impact to North Dakota is considerable by any measure. Because all beets are grown by contracts, yield and quality must be consistent. Disease has a major impact on reducing both yield and quality of the sugar and by products produced. Disease management through the use of fungicides and disease resistant cultivars is important in times of increasing input costs. Management of two important diseases, Cercospora leaf spot and Fusarium yellows, has been successful but because the pathogens causing these diseases have the ability to change and adapt to new situations, continued research on understanding the biology and management of sugar beets is critical for sustainability of the sugar beet industry in North Dakota and MN."

This will be achieved by conducting research within two themes: (i)  mind the gap  and (ii) pre-plant risk quantification for monocyclic diseases. Research within the first theme seeks to quantify the impact of biotic factors on the gap between attainable and actual yield to reduce loss from diseases and enable the economic values of disease management programs to be calculated and fully realized. A strong focus of this work will be to design disease management strategies with a holistic focus, including considerations of edaphic factors such as manipulating the environment, varieties, plant density and rectangularity, the role of seedborne inoculum on epidemic initiation, residues, and off-target implications. Research conducted within this theme will also seek to characterize the variability of selected pathogen populations, such as fungicide resistance, virulence and aggressiveness of isolates, and variation using molecular markers, to make assessments of the durability of current disease management recommendations. Factors affecting disease epidemics and processes responsible for crop loss, such as depicting the spatiotemporal attributes of epidemics, characterizing spread from inoculum sources, and implications for risk predictions will also be studied where applicable.Research on the epidemiology of the following diseases will be conducted within this theme:White mold, caused by the fungus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, which causes substantial annual losses in a range of processing and fresh market crops annually. White mold has been rated among the highest priorities for research by members of the New York State Vegetable Research Council and Association for at least 10 years.Cercospora leaf spot, caused by the fungus, Cercospora beticola is one of the most prevalent and important diseases affecting processing and fresh market beet production in New York State. Resistance to the fungicide, azoxystrobin, has been reported within the C. beticola population, substantially limiting the management options for this disease.Dissecting the disease complex affecting lima bean production for processing which is increasing in area in New York State. Characterization of the spectrum of diseases affecting lima beans is vital for the development of holistic disease management strategies and continued realization of actual yield. This second theme will focus on improving the quantification of risk for soilborne diseases by developing pre-plant DNA-based soil tests. Tactical decisions for disease management made by growers and industry are currently integrated functions of crop loss risk, driven by personal experience and assumptions of the ubiquitous presence of disease inoculum. In this way, the majority of decisions surrounding pesticide application for soilborne diseases prior to planting are often routine and prophylactic. This work will develop highly sensitive and species-specific tests that can inform management decisions based on coupling of epidemiological damage thresholds. This research will also inform management recommendations for specific diseases to consider the variable importance of seed or soilborne inoculum for a range of diseases. Enhanced knowledge of soilborne disease risk may reduce the need for prophylactic pesticide application prior to planting and better inform crop rotations. Research to quantify the utility of this approach will initially focus on:Root-knot nematode (RKN) (Meloidogyne hapla) in potato and carrot. Prophylactic fumigation is currently being used as one of the major tools for soilborne diseases of potato, in the absence of quantitative information on pathogen populations. One of the major targets for fumigation is root-knot nematode. Damage and threshold relationships for root-knot nematode in carrot will also be quantified."

What is needed is a greater understanding of how these predators reach diet-choice decisions when facing diverse prey communities. Using DNA-based prey detection methods and working in the fields of cooperating potato growers, we have been tracking predation of Colorado potato beetle and green peach aphid pests by predatory damsel and big-eyed bugs. We have found that both predators are surprisingly effective at locating and capturing aphids and potato beetles when these prey are exceedingly rare, and that attack rates on the pests remain robust even when non-pest prey are abundant. Thus, both predators exhibit surprising fidelity to these pests as prey. Here, we propose to examine one possible explanation for these unexpected real-world predation patterns, which is that predators choose prey based on nutritional concerns and so covet nutritionally-valuable prey species. We have 3 objectives:1. Assess the nutritional value of a wide variety of common pest and non-pest prey in potato fields,2. Examine whether more-equitably distributed (even) prey communities, typical of organic potato fields, benefit predators by providing them with more diverse and balanced diets, and 3.

The drop in Russet Burbank acreage has been accompanied by an increase in the production of new varieties such as Ranger Russet, Russet Norkotah, Alturas and Umatilla Russet. One of the driving forces behind this trend is the need for producers in this region to improve production efficiency to remain competitive.The need for more rapid adoption of new potato varieties has recently been heightened due to public debate about sustainability in agriculture, nutritional issues relating to human health, and climate change. One of the best ways to meet consumer demands for more sustainable potato production practices is through adoption of new potato varieties with increased pest and stress resistance. Processed products account for over 65% of the 116 lbs per capita consumption of potatoes in the U.S. In 2002, acrylamide (a suspected human carcinogen) was identified in carbohydrate rich foods processed at high temperatures, including French fries and other processed potato products. Acrylamide forms in a chemical reaction between the amino acid asparagine and reducing sugars, and both of these compounds naturally occur in potatoes. In response to guidelines issued by the FDA targeting reduction of acrylamide in food, the processing industry has encouraged breeding programs to identify low-acrylamide potato varieties. However, the amount of acrylamide found in processed potato products depends not only on the variety, but also production environment, management practices, storage conditions, and processing methods. Research is needed to better understand how to manage low-acrylamide varieties to produce processed products that meet FDA guidelines. It should be noted that potatoes are also a rich source of nutrients such as antioxidants that have positive health attributes. Many of these nutrients are associated with pigments in the skin and flesh of highly colored potatoes. Efforts are currently underway to increase the nutrient content of potatoes through breeding and biotechnology. Increasing the nutritive value of potatoes by itself does not guarantee that consumers will choose to purchase new varieties with these attributes. Skin color and brightness are key attributes that draw consumers to these novel potatoes. Enhancing skin color may also improve nutrient content as the skin is a primary location for many phytonutrients.Potatoes have become an important source of food in developing countries, especially in tropical regions. It has been estimated that climate change will increase average global temperatures by up to 5.8oC over the next 100 years. This will lead to a shift in production towards higher latitudes and an increase in the need for heat and water stress tolerant varieties. The potato production region in southwest Idaho provides a good location to select for stress tolerance due to the relatively mild winters and long, hot summers. This project will evaluate new potato varieties for adaptability to southwest Idaho and develop management information to help growers more effectively adopt new varieties."

In some years, areas of Spain and Russia have lost up to 80% of their potato crops because of damage that these worm-like animals have caused. North America has managed to escape the worst of this, but recent outbreaks of these worms have occurred in counties of Idaho, Oregon, and New York. We have chemicals that can reduce their numbers, but these are toxic to work with, and expensive to apply. One of the recommended responses when these nematodes are detected is to stop planting potatoes, eggplants, and tomatoes in those fields for 7-15 years. For several decades now, Europeans have employed an additional practice to shorten this time: in place of potatoes, farmers there have tried planting a  trap species , such as an undomesticated plant called litchi tomato, that attracts and then kills nematodes in the vicinity of its roots. This plant can reduce the time needed to  sanitize  a heavily infested field by 2.5-4 years. The purpose of this research program is to investigate what makes this plant resistant and determine whether the genes creating this resistance can be improved upon or transferred to other plants to make better trap species, or possibly transferred to potatoes to make plants that no longer require agrochemical intervention. Towards this end, we will first identify, sequence, and in some cases, clone, trap species genes that turn on or off when nematodes invade since genes that behave this way are typically involved in the defenses that plants use to cope with an infection, and second, to alter current protocols for genetically engineering plants so that we can use them to alter the genome of the trap species. The first aim will yield a publically available DNA sequence and clone library for most genes in the previously unstudied litchi tomato genome. The second aim will yield improved procedures for introducing genes into species that in the past have proven difficult to transform. The second aim will allow us to verify whether the genes we identified in the first aim are truly involved in resistance. The ultimate goal of these two aims is to produce a better trap species and a nematode resistant line of potatoes so that we will no longer have to choose between broadcasting an environmental poison, or suffering low potato yields in the event that potato cyst nematodes continue to spread throughout the United States."

We will pursue testing of winter wheat and dry bean as new varieties and experimental lines become available. For example, Colorado State University has been developing upright varieties of dry bean, which offer advantages in terms of disease control, drying, and harvesting. In 2014, irrigated malting barley averaged 145 bu/acre and met or exceeded all the quality standards for malting. We will continue testing malting barley for its yield potential, quality, and economic viability. There is a lot of interest in industrial hemp but information about its adaptability or potential benefits for southwestern Colorado is lacking. We will test several industrial hemp varieties in 2015 to evaluate their performance and adaptation to our environment. One opportunity that may generate additional income for growers in southwestern Colorado is the production of virus Y-free seed potatoes. Potato Y virus (PVY) is a serious threat to potato production in the San Luis Valley and even though potatoes have been grown sporadically in southwestern Colorado on a small scale, it is conceivable to find isolated areas where the likelihood of PVY infestation is small. We will explore this possibility as well as the potential to produce specialty potatoes, which may have additional benefits compared to conventional (e.g., white-fleshed) potatoes. Regardless of the crops grown, water is the most limiting factor to crop production in southwestern Colorado. There are approximately 169,000 acres of irrigated land in southwestern Colorado but water availability fluctuates from year to year. For example, there were severe irrigation water shortages as recently as 2013. We will continue developing management practices and strategies to conserve water and optimize its use efficiency. The emphasis will be on alfalfa, which is the largest irrigated crop in southwestern Colorado and the one that uses the most water compared to other field crops. We will determine the effects of water stress on alfalfa stand, dry matter, and time of recovery. Even though irrigation accounts for a significant percentage of crop production in southwestern Colorado, dryland farming is still important. Constraints include low and erratic precipitation, low soil organic matter, wind and water erosion, and low yields. We will test cover crops as an environmentally friendly way to enhance soil quality and health and to reduce soil erosion. Cover crops will be grown during the fallow period in (winter) wheat-fallow, wheat-bean, and wheat-safflower-fallow rotations. We will monitor soil moisture, soil fertility, soil erosion, weed infestation, soil biological activity, and crop yields and returns. We will identify cover crop mixtures and management practices that will enhance the sustainability of dryland farming in SW Colorado and SE Utah. The information generated by this project will be shared with a large audience via field tours and workshops, social media, annual technical reports or bulletins, journal articles, and presentations at relevant events. Success will be measured by how well the research and outreach objectives are met and by the impact this project will have on the sustainability of crop production in southwestern Colorado."

It is estimated that climate change will result in up to 32% losses in US potato yields over the next 30 years unless measures are taken to improve plant tolerance to conditions like drought stress. About 18% of the potato crop is lost each year due to damage to potato tubers both during and after harvest and other post-harvest issues.The human body is covered with skin that protects our bodies from external elements and pathogens and helps our bodies to retain moisture, nutrients, and other important components. A  skin  with similar functions also covers potato tubers. One of the major components of the potato skin is a complex polymer called suberin. Suberin is also produced as scab-like structures in potato wounds and some types of  bruises . In fact, all plants produce suberin to cover wounds. These scab-like structures and bruises make potatoes less desirable and marketable as food, with significant economic impacts for farmers and consumers alike. Similarly, a waxy layer, the cuticle, covers all aboveground organs of plants (leaves, stems, etc.). Plant cuticles also include a lipid polymer component, cutin. Prickly pear cacti and plant species native to arid climates have a particularly thick, waxy, and impermeable cuticle that is critical for retention of water in dry environments. Prickly pear cacti species are very promising as a low water-input crop for Nevada as they can be grown on lands otherwise unusable for food crop production and they have great potential as bioenergy and forage crops.Despite their significant protective roles, very little is known about how plants synthesize and assemble cutin and suberin. Even less is known about how plants make these polymers during stressful conditions such as drought. Virtually nothing is known about the genetics and biochemistry of prickly pear cuticle biosynthesis.The goal of this research is to obtain a fundamental understanding of the genetic and biochemical basis of how potatoes make suberin and the genetic basis of cuticle biosynthesis in prickly pear.This research addresses the following NAES research priorities: drought, climate change, and food production (Climate Change, Economic Development with Emphasis in Rural Communities, Global Food Security and Hunger including Agricultural Production in a Semi-Arid Environment, and Sustainable Bioenergy; http://www.cabnr.unr.edu/NAES/rfp/RFP2015.pdf). Understanding the genetic basis of cutin and suberin deposition will support engineering and breeding plants to better withstand conditions that affect semi-arid climates like that in Nevada. Specifically, this research will help to improve an important Nevada commodity crop, potato. It will also support the development of prickly pear cactus as a specialty crop for Nevada that has great potential to create new jobs in agriculture and improve Nevada&#39;s economy. This research will also provide information for the design of improved biopolymers for food packaging and other industrial applications."

Scientists are also always looking for more effective compounds. A concern with all insecticides is their specificity. Most insecticides are highly toxic to insects but also have some toxicity towards other species. The goal is to develop insecticides which are highly toxic to the desired target species and not very toxic to non-target species. One of the newest groups of insecticides are the neonicotinoids. They attack the nervous system of insects but are much less able to attack the nervous system of mammals. These insecticides have become the most widely used in the world. Because of their versatility in application, they are used in a variety of farmland crops such as cereal crops, canola, potatoes and horticulture vegetable crops, fruits and vineyards. Neonicotinoids are also sold as garden sprays for flowers and vegetables. Recent studies however have shown that these compounds can be toxic to some non-target organisms, including honey bees and birds. Honey bee colony collapse has been attributed to the use of these compounds which appears to cause the bees to become disoriented. Honey bee disorientation and migratory bird migration may be effected similarily. We will conduct a literature search to look for similarities between the two and access whether the avain model developed in our laboratory (homing pigeon model) is a suitable for studying the effects of these neonicotinoid compounds on bees."

Sustainability of crop production in semi-arid and arid regions of the Western U.S. is threatened by limited water availability, which results in increasing competition from urban development, environmental restrictions, and energy production sector. Altered geographic distribution, intensity, and frequency of extreme climate events (such as heat and drought), and the recently approved water rights will continue to present challenges for agricultural producers in terms of water resource use and socio-economic stability. This phenomenon is compounded by the inefficient use of precious irrigated water due to the lack of solid scientific knowledge and clearly demonstrated methodologies for water and nutrient conservation.Nitrogen fertilizer is the principal (and the most costly) nutrient input, yet its use efficiency is only about 40 -50% in most U.S. agricultural operations. Thus, 50-60% of N fertilizer applied to cropland is not used by the crops and is lost to the environment. Low N use efficiency (pounds of N applied per bushel of crop produced) are resulting from a loss of applied N from the soil - plant system via various pathways including gaseous plant emission, denitrification, leaching, surface runoff and volatilization. An increase of N use efficiency in cereal production, by just 10 %, would translate into savings of about US $5 billion annually and, substantial improvement in environmental quality. Improving N use efficiency in cereal crops is a challenging task that encompasses the ability to accurately estimate a crops need for N and developing nutrient management practices that would provide the best return from fertilizer application.Wheat is an integral crop for Western U.S., where it is grown as a main cash crop or as a vital rotational crop in combination with other high-value crops such as vegetables. There is an urgent need to develop more efficient nutrient management strategies in order to maximize wheat grain yields and enhance grain quality.Advanced crop canopy sensors utilize the optical characteristics of plants and their associated vitality and health properties. The newly emerged hyperspectral remote sensing entails acquiring images in narrow and continuous spectral bands; these sensors are very useful for detection of specific characteristics and differences in vegetation. The recent technologies such as high-resolution multispectral sensors, hyperspectral digital cameras, spectroradiometers, and other optical sensors could play an important role in managing nutrients within the crop production systems. The specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum - i.e. narrow bands - have shown significant improvement in accuracy of discrimination capabilities among various types of plant stresses. Accurate and timely information regarding both water and N status obtained with remote sensors can be of tremendous help for irrigation and fertilization decision making. The proposed study aims to demonstrate that sensor-based technologies, utilized in combination with traditional practices such as soil testing and evapotranspiration (ET) monitoring, can substantially improve the management of N and water use.This study will serve as an initial step in developing robust practical sensor-based water and N management methodology for a variety of key crops grown in semi-arid regions. This project will enable us to identify the most valuable environmental and plant measurements for developing such a methodology. Agronomy Advisory Committee and Fertilizer Tax Advisory Committee are two key stakeholder groups in Idaho and Montana, respectively, advising University research and extension faculty. These two groups, as well as several commodity groups (Idaho Wheat Commission, Idaho Barley Commission, Montana Wheat and Barley Commission) have highly supported this proposed collaborative project. Addressing sustainability of crop production and food security in the context of continuously rising fertilizer costs and water limiting environment has been identified as the primary objective by many of these stakeholder groups.In close collaboration with wheat producers, we choose to conduct the field studies in Southern Idaho (where wheat is grown as a primary rotational component in cropping systems dominated by potatoes, sugar beets and seed crops) and Northwestern Montana (where exceptionally high yield and exceptional quality wheat is a primary cash crop).The project incorporates research and education is focused on: 1) conducting a field study for determining the minimum N and water requirements for optimum wheat grain yield and quality, 2) developing a sensor-based system for identifying - and distinguishing between - N and water stresses, 3) developing an empirical model for predicting wheat grain yield and protein content in varying water x N interactions, 4) developing water and N use recommendations for growers based on the developed model, and 5) deliver extensive educational outreach programs (workshops, field demonstrations, scholarly and educational materials) focused on water and nutrient conservation and utilization of sensor-based technologies.Expected outcomes: 1) developing grower recommendations derived from scientifically sound and robust model based on locally obtained data; and 2) improved grower understanding of how sensor-based methodologies can be successfully utilized for improving the efficiency of water and nutrient use."

This process also includes testing of new protocols to improve functionality. One goal is to identify molecular markers that can take advantage of the polyploidy nature of potato and wheat. New technologies will be evaluated and utilized to increase the functionality of existing and new markers. Molecular markers can be used for many purposes and will be developed with these uses in mind. Markers can aid in the identification of plants with a particular gene of interest, and also identify plants with more than one gene. They also increase our understanding of complex traits.

About 90% of these farms are classified as small farms where producers often live and want to manage pest problems with minimal risk to their families and the environment.This has created an opportunity to develop site-specific integrated pest management (IPM) and biological control tactics that will be adopted. Additionally, chemical pesticides have become too expensive for use in many situations and ineffective in others, particularly if there are outbreaks of non-nativepests.In response to this opportunity,this Hatch Project is designed to provide integrated pest management (IPM) tactics and systems that emphasize augmentation and conservation biological control, so that agricultural production can be more profitable and sustainable, while protecting human health and the environment. The project encompasses four complimentary sub-projects: 1) Enhancing the use ofnatural enemies byimproving colonization, rearing, quality control, distribution, release, and evaluation methods, 2) Improving the conservation of natural enemies on diversified small farms by developing effective natural enemy habitats, 3) Testing IPM tactics for managing arthropod pests of root and tuber crops, and 4) Advancing IPM and biological control of vegetable pests under the umbrella Hatch Project,  Management of Arthropod Pests of Vegetables. This research is needed to produce high quality natural enemies efficiently, includingformulation, preparation, and packaging of enhanced diets, delivering better rearing materials and environments, increasing automation of rearing processes, and providing alternative transportation options. Post-production research on handling, release and evaluation of natural enemies is crucial and researchers, suppliers, and customers will jointly develop efficient product quality control assessments. Research will be conducted on conservation of beneficial insects on diversified small farms by developing habitats designed to attract and support them in association with fruit and vegetable crops. This research also will identify the pest and beneficial insects found in sweet potato fields of North Florida.The benefits of this research will beeffective, economical, environmentally safe, and sustainable IPM tactics to protect these crops and farms from existing and new invasive pests."

Sub-Objective 1-1:  Determine changes in tuber meristem cytokinin content and expression of genes encoding cytokinin biosynthetic enzymes during dormancy progression.  Sub-Objective 1-2: Determine changes in the expression of cytokinin-responsive histidine kinase genes and the acquisition of cytokinin sensitivity during tuber dormancy progression.  Sub-Objective 1.3: Determine changes in cytokinin content and the expression of genes encoding key cytokinin metabolic enzymes in tuber tissues following mechanical wounding.  Objective 2: Quantify nitric oxide release during potato storage and handling and determine nitric oxide involvement in tuber dormancy progression and wound-healing.  Sub-Objective 2.1: Determine the release and role of NO in potato tuber dormancy exit.  Sub-Objective 2.2: Determine the release and role of NO in the potato tuber wound-healing response.  Objectives 1 and 2 build upon research findings secured during the previous project cycle and address current knowledge gaps in the regulatory processes controlling tuber dormancy progression and wound healing.  Approach: Worldwide, the potato ranks fourth among the major food crops.  Global potato production exceeds 364 million metric tons (FAOSTAT, March, 2013) and U.S. production exceeds 437 million cwt (USDA-NASS, January, 2013) of which over 400 million cwt worth an estimated $2.01 billion are harvested in the fall.  Over 70% of the fall potato crop is placed into storage for year-round use.  Unlike other major food crops, potatoes are stored in a fully hydrated and highly perishable form.  Postharvest losses routinely approach 10% of the stored crop and occur through both physiological and disease-related processes.  Two of the most important physiological processes affecting potato storage and market quality are dormancy/sprouting and wound-healing. Despite the severity of these losses,  management strategies and technologies employed to combat these problems were empirically derived, are several decades old and do not effectively meet today’s consumer or industry demands to control damage, minimize physiological deteriorations, and reduce disease problems.  Further improvements in postharvest storage technologies are hindered by ignorance of the biological mechanisms underlying these physiological processes.  The goals of this project are to identify critical molecular, biochemical and physiological mechanisms controlling tuber dormancy/sprout growth and wound-healing and, ultimately, to genetically, chemically, or physically manipulate these rate-limiting processes to develop improved methods to maintain potato nutritional and processing quality during storage.  Specific goals are: 1) Identify the cognate processes that control cytokinin content and activity during postharvest storage/wound-healing, and 2) Determine the involvement of nitric oxide in tuber dormancy progression and wound-healing."

Examine the impact and sensitivity of resistance management options for major insect pests of southern row crops through simulated modeling.  Approach: Insect management guidelines are generally static from year to year regardless of crop prices, costs of insecticides and yield potential of the crop.  We plan to summarize published information for bollworm, tarnished plant bug, and stink bugs and develop economic injury level probability distributions using Monte Carlo simulations.   On-farm field evaluations across the Mississippi Delta will evaluate economic returns and environmental sustainability of different insecticidal control strategies in soybean and cotton.  Commercially available and experimental sweet potato varieties will be planted annually and the economic impact of insect and nematode control in sweet potato will be examined.  The impact of current insect management strategies in southern row crops on populations of pollinators and beneficial insects will be examined in production fields. The surrounding habitats of each field will be documented for plant community composition, focusing on blooming plants that may be of interest to pollinators. Each of these fields will be sampled using a combination of sampling techniques.  Community structure will be compared between cropping systems, and related to insecticide applications. We plan to evaluate acute and sub-lethal toxicities and synergistic/antagonistic interactions of honey bees to commonly used pesticides.  An examination of gene regulation in honey bees associated with immunity, adaptation, detoxification, digestion/metabolism, and stress-related genes will be conducted after exposure to pesticides with techniques such as real-time PCR , RNAseq or microarrays.  Hemipteran and lepidopteran phytophagous pest populations are highly mobile within the landscape and use a variety of weeds and crops as host plants. To examine landscape influences on these insects, the landscape composition surrounding historic and current collection locations will be quantified using Cropland Data Layers (CDLs).  Using these CDL layers, buffer zones will be generated around locations. Output data will be tabulated to produce total area of habitat type included within each buffer area and will be related to data collected on insect populations using appropriate statistical analyses.  SIMRU will continue to examine susceptibilities of hemipteran and lepidopteran insect pests collected from locations across the Mississippi Delta with a variety of assay methods which may include topically treated diet, residual contact bioassays, glass vial bioassays and a feeding contact assays using floral foam.  Insects from original collections will be preserved for molecular analysis using genetic markers.  When colonies of any of the pest groups have reduced susceptibility to the tested insecticides, efforts will be made to preserve the colony under a selected and non-selected sequence of exposures to the insecticides of interest We propose to develop rapid bioassays to predict the effectiveness of an insecticide application on a real field population of insects.  To examine predictive values of laboratory assays on actual field populations, a plot sprayer will be used to deliver a range of formulated product rates on targeted insects."

Although the actual cause is still unknown, determining the totalirradiation dose is invaluable to ensure the products are processed within the safe limits. Among the methods establishedfor the detection of irradiated foods, analysis of 2-alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBs) with GC-MS and analysis of cellulosicand carbonate radicals with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy serve as the most promising approachesto determine the irradiation history in pet food products. The goal of the proposed research is to develop GC-MS and EPRtechniques coupled to quantify the formation of specific irradiation markers and to determine the total amount ofirradiation treatment in pet foods and treats. We will carry out the project in two parts: the first three years will bededicated to development and validation of testing methods; the last two years will be the comparison and field-testing ofthe validated protocols for evaluation of the irradiation history in pet food products. In the first part of the project pet foodproducts, including chicken jerky treats, sweet potato treats, dog chews (beer, lamb), bones, hoofs and pig ears, will beirradiated from 0.1-75 kGy with either a Cesium-137 source and electron beam (e-beam). The formation and stability ofvarious 2-ACBs (i.e., 2-DCB, 2-TCB, 2-TDCB) will be evaluated using GC-MS techniques based on our previous worksin collaboration with Vet-LIRN and USDA labs. In parallel, formation and stability of carbonic and cellulosic radicalswill be evaluated by using EPR analysis in both low mobility and high mobility environments. Complementary to EPRmeasurements, irradiation-specific DNA damage will also be investigated by using qPCR analysis. The analytical andphysical methods will be validated for different product formulations with varying lipid composition, moisture content,presence of glycerin, vegetables, phytochemicals etc., and extraction methods, such as hexane extraction, solid phaseextraction (SPE), solid phase microextraction (SPME), soxhlet extraction. The chemical and thermal stabilities of thespecific irradiation markers will be analyzed over a temperature range (20-80 °C) and at least one year of storage at roomtemperature. In the second part of the project, validated protocols will be tested on commercial irradiated pet foodproducts available in the market.

Overall, at the end of the project we will propose validated and tested protocols, which can be usedas standardized techniques to quantify the irradiation doses in various pet food products."

One set of metabolic reactions thought to occur only in the cytoplasm is glycolysis, the chemical reactions that generate cellular energy. In this project, the PI will investigate a deviation from this well-accepted textbook definition of glycolysis in Oomycetes, a group of plant and animal pathogens, in which part of glycolysis is proposed to occur in mitochondria. The project will provide a better understanding of the origins and diversity of these metabolic reactions in the potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans. The novel oomycete metabolic pathways that will be studied also represent potential targets for inhibitors that can be exploited to develop new disease control strategies. This will yield economic and environmental benefits, raise the sustainability of agricultural production, and increase food security. The project also supports scientific education and the training of a diverse workforce through the participation of graduate and undergraduate students at a Hispanic-Serving Institution.Our current understanding of glycolysis is based largely on a few model organisms. This project focuses on the role of mitochondria and metabolic compartmentalization in that organelle in glycolysis, using as a model the potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans. This filamentous eukaryotic microbe is a member of the oomycete group of the stramenopile kingdom. Since the evolutionary history of stramenopiles is distinct from that of classic model organisms, this project will shed light on the origins of mitochondria and diversity. The first objective of the project is to study glycolytic enzymes that are found in oomycete mitochondria. The classic view is that glycolysis takes place in the cytosol, but enzymes representing the payoff phase of glycolysis are predicted to also occur in oomycete mitochondria. These novel enzymes will be studied by localizing the relevant enzymes using fluorescent tags, silencing their genes, and assessing their activity. The second objective of the project is to examine P. infestans mitochondria more broadly with a goal of identifying other novel pathways in the organelle. The research will integrate evolutionary biology, cell biology, biochemistry, and molecular genetics."

Every day we comprehend hundreds of sentences that we hear or read but have never encountered before, and we produce hundreds more. Yet our success at these many acts of communication belies the difficulty of the task: language is rife with ambiguity, our attention is limited, our environments may be noisy, and we often have incomplete information about the shared knowledge and beliefs of the people we engage with. This ability, unique to our species, poses profound challenges for our scientific understanding of the capabilities of the human mind.  Deepening our understanding of these capabilities requires a combination of ideas and methods from linguistics, psychology, and computer science. Advances in this area help lay the groundwork for improvements in natural language technologies such as document summarization, paraphrasing, question answering, and machine translation, and in better identification, diagnosis, and treatment of language disorders.Within this broader research enterprise, this project focuses on the  edge of the lexicon , elucidating the conditions under which a linguistic expression begins to get stored in the mind of the native speaker who uses it, and the consequences of the expression being stored as a holistic unit. Native speakers know both productive rules that license and allow interpretation of phrases and sentences that they have never before encountered and a rich inventory of lexical items that can be combined through these productive rules. Many of these lexical items are individual words, but there is evidence that specific, frequent multi-word expressions, such as  meat and potatoes  or  large majority  may also get stored in the lexicon. This project combines artificial intelligence-based computational models, large linguistic datasets, and controlled psychological experimentation to explore the edge of the lexicon, probing how direct experience with specific multi-word expressions leads to their being stored in one's mental lexicon, how such storage is reconciled with productive knowledge in language comprehension and production, and how these expressions emerge and change over time."

The proper ?healing? or ?curing? of potatoes to fortify their protective skin with the natural polymer suberin is critical for the storage of potatoes. Potato tubers with non-cured bruise or wound areas are much more susceptible to disease development and water loss. The long-term storage of potatoes allows consumers to be supplied with fresh potatoes and potato products (chips, French fries, etc.) year round. By analyzing the regulation of the synthesis and deposition of suberin, this project will provide insight on the fundamental processes underlying the potato skin healing or curing process. This will enable the reduction of post-harvest yield losses and the development of tools and germplasm for breeding efforts aimed at improving tuber storability. Even a marginal reduction in post-harvest storage losses would significantly improve economic return for potato producers and distributors. The project includes as outreach the development of public resources for the scientific and academic (Grades 9-12) communities, and the training of students from underrepresented groups.Part 2: Technical abstract: Suberin is produced In higher plants during normal development and in response to stresses like wounding. Despite its nearly ubiquitous presence, the regulation of suberin deposition remains enigmatic, yet its better understanding has positive agricultural implications. For example, an improvement in the proper deposition of wound suberin, which is critical for long-term storage of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum), would result in a significant reduction in crop loss during storage. The overall objective of this research is to decipher the transcriptional networks that regulate suberin biosynthesis, to enable the development of potato lines with improved wounding and storability. The transcription factor AtMYB41, identified by PI Kosma, and additional factors acting on suberin biosynthesis will be used as a springboard to define the transcriptional networks that regulate suberin deposition, with an emphasis on wound suberization. In parallel, the molecular basis of potato wound suberin production will be investigated using comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of potato cultivars that differ in suberization and storability. The end goal is to manipulate loci underlying differential wound suberin production by combining transcriptomics and SNP genotyping for targeted breeding approaches aimed at improving tuber storability. The project includes public resources and outreach activities for students from underserved groups."

Some of these specialized metabolites have well established roles, including protection from diseases and insects and attraction of beneficial partner organisms. Some are used by humans as medicines and environmentally safe pesticides. The metabolic pathways for only a small fraction of these compounds are well understood, leaving much to learn about how plants produce this enormous diversity of products. This research will focus on specialized metabolism in the Solanaceae (nightshade) family, which includes the important crops tomato, potato, peppers and eggplant and in which a great diversity of natural products is documented. The overarching goal is to develop computational and experimental approaches to discover new plant chemicals and to find the genes that plants use to make small molecules that are valuable for agriculture and human wellbeing. The project outcomes will expand the understanding of the biochemical and genetic mechanisms by which plants produce different classes of specialized metabolites. This research will support breeding and transgenic approaches to improve specialized metabolite synthesis in crop plants to increase resistance to disease and insects and enhance crop value; it will also develop new methods for combining computational and experimental approaches in the study of metabolism. The project outreach activities include summer research for undergraduates from under-represented groups, training of faculty for primarily undergraduate institutions with substantial minority enrollments, and a summer program for science outreach to adults.Part 2: Technical abstractThe identification of genes involved in specialized metabolism is of great importance, since changes in these genes provide a basis for lineage-specific chemical diversity. This project will provide quantitative assessments of the differences between specialized metabolism genes and other genes. The predicted portion of the genome devoted to specialized metabolism within the Solanaceae will be tested using hypothesis-driven experimental approaches. This analysis of the Solanaceae family, which includes important crops as well as models in plant ecology and evolution, will establish a paradigm for computationally predicting and experimentally validating specialized metabolism-related genes across the plant kingdom. The project will take advantage of the rapidly increasing plant genome and transcriptome resources in the Solanaceae to define computationally the characteristics of genes encoding specialized metabolic enzymes. The computational approaches will be coupled with analytical chemical methods, including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, to discover specialized metabolites and to guide the identification of candidate genes encoding enzymes that produce novel metabolites. In vitro protein biochemistry and functional genomics methods will be employed to validate gene candidate functions, and to improve the accuracy of the computational methods.

Fluent multilingualism has become an increasingly important skill; and whereas children seem to attain fluency with relative ease, adults experience persistent difficulty becoming proficient in a second language. Though instruction helps, its effectiveness is ultimately limited by our understanding of why learning a second language is so difficult for adults. Mastering grammatical gender, in particular, has proven a great challenge. Unlike English, some language cannot use determiners like  the  with any noun. Spanish, for example, uses the definite determiner  el  for  sun  but  la  for  moon ; using the wrong determiner with a noun is considered a grammatical error. For second language speakers, learning to use words like  el  and  la  with the right nouns when speaking and comprehending poses a great challenge. This can lead to misunderstandings, sometimes embarrassing ones, like telling someone that you met  la papa  (the potato) when you really meant to say that you met  el Papa  (the Pope). Research also shows that native speakers use grammatical gender information to help make comprehension easier. Second language learners, on the other hand, have difficulty using grammatical gender in this manner. In order to identify ways to make learning a second language more successful in general, we must first determine what makes learning specific features like grammatical gender so challenging. This project aims to understand why adult second language learners suffer persistent difficulty with grammatical gender. It has two primary goals: 1) to determine how different ways of learning a second language can make adults more or less successful at using grammatical gender, and 2) to understand if and when adults can use grammatical gender information to ease comprehension in a second language. Two experiments will be conducted to address these goals. The first will examine the brainwaves of native and second language speakers of German while they read sentences. The second experiment will teach native speakers of English and German an artificial language that uses grammatical gender. Nouns and their gender words (like  el  and  la ) will be learned in two different ways. After learning, the researchers will record participants' eye movements while they comprehend sentences. Together, these experiments will allow the researchers to determine if and when adult language learners use gender information to ease comprehension; the research will also identify whether particular ways of learning lead to better and more effective use of grammatical gender information, like native speakers. The outcomes of this research will therefore not only help identify the source of second language learners' problems, but will also provide clear and direct practical evidence for language teaching, with the ultimate goal of providing sustained societal gains in multilingualism and its associated social and economic benefits."

Prior work demonstrated that plant genes like those known to confer resistance to pathogens are the targets of a set of  microRNAs --suppressive regulatory RNAs just 22 nucleotides in length. These microRNAs are believed to function as master regulators of a very large family of protein coding disease-resistance genes, and part of their activity is to trigger the production of additional small RNAs (21 nucleotides in length) that have an unusual, regularly spaced pattern, or  phasing  of biogenesis. The regulation of this gene family, and several others targeted by microRNAs in the same way, is a new paradigm for microRNA function. The investigators have identified these small RNAs as conserved in many crop plants, including soybean, an alfalfa relative, tomato and potato. The aim of this project is to investigate this novel gene regulatory circuit to understand its function in plants, its role in plant defenses or beneficial microbial interactions, and whether it can ultimately be developed as a tool for improving plants or altering plant-microbe interactions to reduce disease or improve beneficial interactions. The project will utilize methods that include plant genomics, plant cell biology, plant-microbial interactions, and RNA analysis. The expected result is the dissection and understanding of a novel and complex gene regulatory mechanism. The broader impacts of the project range from a local impact on the training of students and a post-doc who will be directly involved in the project, to national and international impact to the scientific community in the databases and web tools that the project will release."

Depending on the plant, the number of flowers that form on reproductive branches, known as inflorescences, can vary substantially. Discovering the genes responsible for this species-specific diversity, and understanding how these genes work together to control flower production, is a major focus in plant biology with direct relevance for crop improvement. In tomato and its close relatives in the nightshade (Solanaceae) family, such as eggplant, pepper, and potato, flower production on each inflorescence varies dramatically, from a solitary flower on a single branch, as in pepper, to dozens of flowers on many branches, as in several wild tomatoes. This project will take advantage of variation in flower production found in tomato to study a group of genes that are required for generating multi-flowered inflorescences, and thus the familiar  tomatoes-on-the-vine  architecture characteristic of all tomato varieties. By mutating these genes using new gene-editing technology, it will be possible to dissect how the proteins encoded by these genes control precisely when, where, and how many flowers and fruits are produced on each tomato plant. Results from this project should reveal new flower-production genes and their modes of action, which can then be targeted for modification using both classical and modern genetic tools to improve yields in tomato and many related crops. Additionally, an outreach program at an inner-city middle school will educate young students on the process of genetic engineering to help shed popular misconceptions about genetically modified food.All above ground plant growth originates from shoot meristems, small populations of stem cells that give rise to vast architectural diversity, particularly in inflorescences. At the heart of this diversity lies a critical, yet poorly understood, process of meristem maturation. A major question in plant development is how timing of meristem maturation, and thus inflorescence and flower production, is controlled in different plants. Compared to knowledge on meristem maturation in other model plants, much less is known in tomato and related Solanaceae, despite representing the widespread sympodial growth habit. Recent work in tomato has exposed a new maturation program, defined by a novel transcriptional regulator encoded by the TMF gene. This project integrates genetics, genomics and biochemistry to study the mechanisms by which TMF and its interacting protein partners regulate meristem maturation. In Aim 1, TMF transcriptional co-factors will be studied genetically, molecularly, and developmentally. In Aim 2, transcriptional targets of TMF and its expression network will be explored by integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. In Aim 3, TMF family members will be characterized using CRISPR/Cas9. This project comprises a first molecular mechanistic study to understand how meristem maturation is fine-tuned to quantitatively control flower production in sympodial plants. The findings should reveal new principles of meristem maturation that can enable modulation of inflorescence architecture and flower production to benefit agriculture."

Differences in floral traits are well known to reduce reproduction between species when they attract different pollinators; this study also addresses how such differences may affect success of other reproductive stages, including the survival of hybrids.  The flowering plants (Angiosperms) form the foundation of agriculture as well as many of the Earth's ecosystems. This study will advance our understanding of how differences in floral traits may first arise, and how those differences may reduce or prevent reproduction between distinct species. This project will also provide research experiences for undergraduates, including those from groups underrepresented in STEM fields.	This work will employ Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) Mapping to identify genomic regions associated with floral trait differences and multiple reproductive barriers between two species by genotyping an existing hybrid population that has already been phenotyped for these traits. These genomic regions will help determine the genetic basis and evolutionary history shaping floral traits and reproductive barriers in this system. In combination with existing gene expression data from relevant floral and reproductive tissues, the study will also identify candidate genes controlling these processes. These are key steps in understanding the mapping between genotype and phenotype, which is of fundamental importance in both basic and applied biology.

Current efforts to improve crop yield in sweet potato are focused on a small number of breeding lines. Wild relatives of crop species can also be an important source of genetic material for crop improvement, but the evolutionary relationships between sweet potato and its wild relatives are currently unknown. This project will use genomic data to reconstruct evolutionary relationships between sweet potato and its wild relatives, and shed light on the genetic changes that have contributed to the evolution of the carbohydrate- and vitamin-rich storage root in cultivated sweet potato. Root characteristics and genetic variation are poorly known for wild relatives of sweet potato and this project will provide a greatly improved understanding of the potential of wild relatives for sweet potato breeding programs. The project will train one graduate student and several undergraduates in laboratory techniques.  Results from the research will be integrated within new teaching materials for middle school, high school and undergraduate students that emphasize the domestication process and importance of diversity in crop breeding programs.This research will characterize the timing of whole genome duplication events within sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and closely related species, and test whether these events are linked to the evolution of storage roots in the group. Numerous studies have implicated polyploidy as a major driving factor in the evolution of complex phenotypes; however, few studies have linked whole genome duplication events with the evolution of novel root traits. This study will apply modern phylogenomic methods to estimate relationships within the Ipomoea batatas complex and reconstruct the history of polyploidization and storage root development in the group. Genetic markers developed through gene capture and Restriction site Associated DNA Sequencing (RADSeq) technologies through this research will be useful for germplasm stock centers characterizing and preserving diversity within sweet potato and across the Ipomoea batatas complex. These findings will advance sweet potato breeding efforts, including recent work to develop productive and robust cultivars for Africa."

The proposed new technology will make functional food ingredients from natural raw materials and improve sustainability compared to other thickening, suspending, or hydrocolloid ingredients sold today, e.g. pectin, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and/or carboxymethylcellulose.  The production yields, as measured by the amount of final product produced from a given amount of raw material, is two to three times greater compared to common hydrocolloids while the raw materials are fibrous byproduct streams made from juice and/or food production that would otherwise be waste or used for other low value purposes.  The raw materials are also available globally in sufficient quantities at reasonable prices even during periods of cultivated crop shortages.  Despite the abundance of waste plant materials from food processing, they have limited use in foods due to economic, sensorial (taste, texture, smell) and technological constraints, e.g. water holding capacity, suspending properties, mouthfeel, without intense chemical modification, which the proposed technology will overcome. Of the $1.2 billion addressable market for hydrocolloid ingredients used for suspending and thickening purposes, there is a $240-360 million market demand for competitively priced ingredients with the properties outlined in this project and a successful commercialization of this fiber based technology platform will meet this demand.  The technical objectives of this Phase I research project are to commercialize a transformational, highly functional, low cost, and clean label new fiber platform that remains stable without chemical, microbiological, or sensory degradation over time in food and beverages such as juice, soup, mayonnaise, and salad dressing.  Typical usage rates of the proposed fibers are expected to be less than 1% yet having a significant technical function, e.g. suspending, thickening, emulsification, in the final food or beverage product.  Rheological and sensory comparisons to other hydrocolloids ingredients will demonstrate the effectiveness in a range of applications.  Due to its natural composition, the fiber platform will withstand alkaline and acidic conditions ranging from pH 2-10, be thermally stable up to 100 oC, and withstand multiple freeze/thaw cycles.  Raw materials will contain native pectin levels from 15-45%, galacturonic acid levels of 5-20%, and will be sourced from citrus, sugar beet, and potato production processes.  The proposed fiber platform will produce suspending and thickening power three to four times greater than current thickeners, which will result in a lower use rate, cleaner taste, and lower cost."

The proposed research will broaden the capabilities of the corn and potato models by utilizing data from experiments carried out in unique, state-of-the-art sun-lit growth chambers and field plots.  Short and long term experiments will be employed to test hypotheses and develop algorithms for plant processes to be used in the computer models.  Data collected by collaborators will be used to test and evaluate the models.  A simple Rye model will be developed to simulate a cover crop during the fall-winter season.  A computer graphical user interface will be developed using components from the existing software program, GUICS, to allow a user to simulate long term crop rotations over multiple growing seasons.  Advanced data management capabilities will be added to the interface to help with interpretation and management of input and output data.  Tools for weather generation and estimation of soil hydraulic properties will be added to the interface to provide a wide range of environmental conditions for assessment.

This project plan describes research to improve implementation of biologically based tactics for non-pesticide management of insect pests and weeds. The goals will be achieved through acquiring a better understanding of the pest species biology along with the interactions between host plants and natural enemies to support the development of optimized approaches, technologies and strategies for control of a variety of targets. One area of research will address improvement of techniques to enhance release success and increased efficiency of establishment and impact of biological control insect species against invasive weed species, specifically targeting the air potato and Chinese tallow. A second area of research focuses on the development of an integrated vegetable cropping system for control of whiteflies using a “push/pull” pest management approach. A vegetable crop system will be assessed using ‘push’ components consisting of naturally repellent plants or plant compounds, in conjunction with ‘pull’ components that consist of trap crops and refuge plants that naturally harbor whitefly predators. The potential use of parasitoids for reduction of the impact of corn silk flies on sweet corn will also be examined. A third area of emphasis is on the protection of U.S. native cacti from the invasive Argentine cactus moth and the Harissia cactus mealybug complex. Control of the Argentine cactus moth will be assessed through the use of a mating disrupting pheromone along with a potential exotic parasitoid. Control of the Harissia cactus mealybug complex will be based on developing an understanding of the species complex composition, alternative host plant reservoirs and potential parasitoids. The outcomes of this research project will improve the sustainability of agricultural production, reduce reliance on pesticides and  reduce the environmental degradation caused by invasive pest insect and weed species."

The objectives of our project are listed below.   Objective 1: Determine differences among diverse haplotypes of potato psyllid found in the Pacific Northwest in vectoring capabilities, fitness traits, and overwintering capabilities.  Subobjective 1A: Determine if psyllid haplotypes differ in fecundity, development rates, and coldhardiness capabilities. Subobjective 1B: Determine if psyllid haplotypes are equally rapid at transmitting Liberibacter to potato, and examine whether all haplotypes can transmit the pathogen from mother-to-daughter (transovarial transmission) and from male-to-female during mating.  Objective 2: Determine suitability of non-crop plant species for development, reproduction, and overwintering of potato psyllid and as potential reservoirs of the zebra chip pathogen in the Pacific Northwest.  Subobjective 2A: Compare suitability of non-crop host plants for development, fecundity, and overwintering success among haplotypes of potato psyllid. Subobjective 2B: Compare host preferences of psyllid haplotypes. Subobjective 2C: Develop molecular methods to determine which host species are sources of psyllids colonizing potatoes. Subobjective 2D: Determine whether non-crop Solanaceae are suitable hosts for the pathogen causing zebra chip.  Approach: Objective 1: Our hypothesis is that haplotypes differ in biological traits that determine their respective risks to growers as vectors of the zebra chip pathogen. Methods to determine how haplotypes differ in biology will involve: 1). Laboratory-based rearing trials to compare haplotypes in fecundity, egg fertility, and developmental rates; 2). Use of a cold-temperature programmable bath to estimate lower lethal temperatures of each haplotype; 3). Use of electrical penetration graph technology combined with potato grow-outs to estimate how rapidly the zebra chip pathogen can be transmitted by each haplotype; 4). Mating assays between infected and uninfected psyllids to determine if the pathogen is transferred between psyllids during mating; 5). Molecular assays of offspring from infected vs uninfected mothers to determine if all haplotypes transfer the pathogen from mother to offspring.  Objective 2: Our hypothesis is that different species of non-crop hosts of potato psyllid will vary in how suitable they are to potato psyllid and to the zebra chip pathogen.  Moreover, different haplotypes of the psyllid will vary in what species they prefer for egglaying, and in what species are most suitable for psyllid development and survival.  Methods to examine plant suitability to potato psyllid and to the zebra chip pathogen, and to compare suitability of different plant species among the psyllid haplotypes will involve: 1). Standard rearing assays with each haplotype on targeted plant species to determine fecundity and development rates on the different plant species; 2). Choice tests with each haplotype to determine whether haplotypes all prefer the same plant species for egglaying, or whether haplotypes differ in preferences; 3). Development of molecular methods to detect the DNA of specific plant species within the guts of field-collected psyllids, and a comparison of gut contents among field-collected psyllids of the different haplotypes; 4). Inoculation trials to determine whether our targeted plant species are suitable hosts for the zebra chip pathogen, and to determine whether all haplotypes of the psyllid transmit the pathogen to all targeted plant species."

The role of A. alternata in the EBC and its response to fungicides and cultivars is unclear. With appropriate selection and timing of fungicides, and cultivar resistance, both diseases, referred to as the early blight complex (EBC), may be managed. However, effective single-site mode of action fungicides often becomes over utilized and resistance develops. We will survey Alternaria species over space and time to elucidate the composition of the EBC and pathogen populations will be screened for multiple fungicide resistances to assess regional and/or management differences. Disease and pathogen responses on potato lines of varying resistance backgrounds will be analyzed and we will refine a PCR-based resistance assay to aid in outreach efforts for prescriptive management.

This is of particular concern for Potato virus Y (PVY), which remains a persistent problem in potato production. Infection with PVY is responsible for up to 90% rejection for seed potato certification in Wisconsin. Since there are essentially no chemical options to prevent viral infection, genetic resistance remains the most sustainable strategy for combating these major agricultural pests. However, viral populations often evolve rapidly, which leads to breakdown of host resistance and pose a serious challenge to the durability of the resistance-based strategy. There is, therefore, a critical need to elucidate the molecular mechanism that determines this most common form of plant resistance to viruses. We generated potato cultivars that over-express a mutated factor to mediate resistance against PVY. However, it is important for efficacy and durability of such resistance to understand the determinants of the breakage of resistance during infection. Our long-term goal is to assess the sustainability of the eIF4E-mediated resistance as a disease control strategy against PVY under the constant pressure of emergence of more virulent strains. In this study, we aim to analyze the possible determinants of breakdown of eIF4E-mediated resistance from two angles: eIF4E expression level (using high through put RNA sequence to reveal the genome wide transcriptome of the different transgenic lines and their relative level of expression) and virus genetic variability (sequence analysis of plant viral population). The long-term goal of this project is to mitigate crop losses to viral pathogens by understanding the molecular basis of viral resistance, in particular the molecular mechanisms of resistance breakdown."

Problem or knowledge gap. The cause and abatement of the physiological disorder intumescences is not well understood. It can cause a variety of problems, depending on severity. Photosynthetically-active leaf surface area is reduced, and water relations within the plant may be affected (Pinkard et al., 2006). The negative impact to the producer is twofold. First, severely intumescent plants appear to be diseased which reduces aesthetic appeal and therefore decreases salability and product value. Second, leaves with extensive intumescence coverage will lose the ability to function physiologically over time, which leads to leaf senescence and eventual plant death if left unchecked (Rud, 2009). The disorder occurs across a range of food (tomato, pepper, potato, etc.) and ornamental crops (ipomoea, cuphea, etc.) that are produced in protected environments.B-1. Problem or knowledge gap. The use of soluble organic fertilizers is gaining in popularity in greenhouse production, partly because a new consumer focus on purchasing products that are produced with sustainable practices is driving the industry to move away from inorganic fertilizers. In the United States, growers who use hydroponic systems such as nutrient film technique (NFT) to produce food crops are increasingly exploring the use of organic nutrient sources. Use of organic fertilizers results in need for different nutrient management strategies by growers for several reasons. For example, traditional electrical conductivity (E.C.) measures on water-based extracts (SME, pour thru, and 2:1) do not always provide reliable information about potential salt load in the root medium because non-decomposed organic components are not measured with this instrumentation. Another example is that the unusual ratios of N:P2O5:K2O in organic fertilizers may or may not contribute to nutrient imbalance and deficiency when application rates are based on N content of the fertilizer. Finally, because the nitrogen form in organic fertilizers is ammoniacal prior to nitrification, effect on root medium pH in soilless mixes is not well understood. As an increasing number of producers are using organic nutrient sources, knowledge of how to optimize their use is needed.C-1. Problem or knowledge gap. Recruiting and retaining an adequate number of undergraduate students has been a concern for many horticulture departments around the United States. Increasing student exposure to floriculture as a career at the middle and high school levels is a potential way to facilitate talent recruitment into our industry. Exposure to floriculture as a career must begin well before college admission. One recruitment opportunity to impact student career choices in floriculture is through the Future Farmers of America (FFA) Career Development Events (CDEs), typically hosted by the state&#39;s land grant institution. Other opportunities include partnering with 4-H and Youth Extension Agents who deliver 4-H Discovery Days programming."

The Colorado potato beetle (CPB) is the major defoliating pest of potato and is difficult to control because it is resistant to &gt;50 insecticides. Although there is a local and national industry providing biocontrol agents for such pests, most of the information on the efficacy of these agents comes from research measuring their consumption rate (often in the laboratory). However, research shows that by only measuring consumption, we are missing at least half of the effect of predators on pests and crop damage. In research funded by federal capacity funds, we demonstrated that the mere presence of a stink bug (Podisus maculiventris) predator (no prey are consumed) reduces plant damage by CPBs by 33%. The odors released from stink bugs causes this reduction in beetle feeding.We are now developing a method that uses odors from predators to enhance the effectiveness of existing predators. Stink bug predators naturally occur in potato fields, but not at densities high enough to provide sufficient pest control. By applying stink bug odors to plants, we can increase the beetle&#39;s response to naturally occurring predators and potentially further decrease crop damage. To determine if this approach will work, we must take a regional approach, testing whether Colorado potato beetles from across the northeast decrease feeding in response to odors from their predators and whether this enhances biocontrol. This addresses Multistate Objective 1  Conservation of existing natural enemies. "

Because of the rapid development in genetic science, new varieties can be developed very quickly, but performance of these new varieties, including yield, resistance to drought, diseases, and insects, and the effects of environment on the performance need to be checked through direct measurement in field. Unfortunately, currently available in-field measurement technologies are slow and inaccurate. Therefore, new technologies for fast and accurate need to be developed.At Kansas State University, we have developed two phenotypers during the past three years - a vehicle-based and a hand-held platform. The common feature of these platforms is that they can take field data very rapidly. The phenotypes can measure canopy greenness, leaf temperature, and plant height, and all the measurements can be registered to accurate blocks using GPS receivers. The handheld phenotyper ( Phenocorn ) uses only a few inexpensive sensors and allows operators to hand-carry it through the field. Since 2014, this phenotyper has been used in two developing countries, Mexico and India, for phenotyping.With these experiences, we will design and construct a robotic phenotyper that will allow autonomous or semi-autonomous operations. During day time, shade can be pulled down to prevent the effect of sun light on the optical sensors. The robotic phenotyper can also operate overnight. A user-friendly interface will be developed to allow people to use the phenotyper with limited training.The sensors we will test on the robotic phenotyper will include the following: 1) sensors to measure the shape, size, and biomass of the above ground portion of the crop. This includes various types of cameras, lasers, and ultrasonic sensors. 2) Sensors to measure the underground portion of the crop. This is especially important for root crops, such as sweet potato. Electromagnetic sensors and ground penetrating radars may be used for this purpose. 3) Sensors to detect crop stresses due to drought, disease, and insect infestation. The Greenseeker and infrared temperature sensors may be used for this purpose. 4) GPS receivers to determine the locations.Using these sensors, some important features will be detected during various crop growth stages. Using wheat as an example, these may include the time when tillering begins, when first node appears, when the flag leave becomes visible, and when flowering begins. Features detected for different varieties can then be compared and the varieties with the best performance selected.The developed technologies can also be used in site-specific farming, where field measurement can be used to determine rates for water, fertilizer, and pesticide applications."

This sector is always the largest one in Maine. Among cash crops harvested in Maine, two most important ones are potato and blueberry. Potato generates over $300 million annual sales and provides over $112 million income to Maine residents (Planning Decisions, 2003). Maine is the top U.S. grower of wild blueberries. Among livestock industries, the Maine dairy farms have a direct economic impact of about $570 million dollars every years and contribute $25 million dollars to the government taxes. As the biggest natural resource industry in the state, the timber industry has a total economic impact of 8 billion dollars annually. My study will investigate various types of industries within Maine&#39;s agricultural and resource sector, including dairy, potato, blueberry, timber, fishery, aquaculture and etc.However, this sector faces continuous challenges from numerous sources, among which natural hazard and financial constraint are two most significant ones. Natural hazards include disease and pests causing a huge amount of losses, such as mastitis of dairy cows, late blight and Colorado potato beetle on potatoes, spruce bud worm in timber trees and red tide in fisheries. Further, the owners of agricultural and natural resource operations also need to handle financial risks constantly. Often the fluctuating prices of inputs and yields are their biggest concern. For example, in 2010 a nationwide drought caused dairy feed cost to skyrocket while the milk price dipped. As a result, during that year many dairy operations suffered from significant financial losses and a fair amount of them went out of business.To hedge above mentioned risks, many risk management tools are provided. For example, crop and livestock insurance programs are widely adopted to provide safety nets to guarantee farmer&#39;s yields and income. To protect farmers from unstable prices, private market instruments such as futures are also available. In addition, some specific government programs are targeted to reduce certain risks, i.e. Southern Pine Beetle Prevention Program offered by US Forest Service. Although so many instruments are available, their effectiveness and efficiency still heavily depend on farmer&#39;s perceptions, preferences and willingness to pay for the associated risks.Given the above, my main research object is to evaluate the risks faced by the producers and elicit their associated risk preferences. Further, I will focus on quantifying producers&#39; productions and assessing their financial sustainability with uncertainty. The effectiveness and efficiency of current programs and policies for risk management in both private and non-private markets will be evaluated. Potential policy improvements will also be discussed."

Emerging infectious diseases are caused by pathogens that have increased in incidence, geographical or host range; have changed pathogenesis; have newly evolved; or have been discovered or newly recognized. The potential for the emergence of new pathogens through hybridization, global migration, and accidental release due to expanding agricultural activities and trade, as well as increased concerns about deliberate release via agrobioterrorism, underscores the importance of research on the development of new methodologies to monitor and analyze spread of pathogens on the landscape level. The objectives of this research are to study the population biology and evolutionary history of Phytophthora infestans on potato and tomato and develop improved diagnostic assays for Phytophthora species in order to improve management of plant diseases."

Several associated factors are (1) the critical need to find an organic source of methionine, an essential amino acid (protein building block) for poultry production, (2) the extraordinary consumer acceptance and call for more organic poultry products, (3) the extreme loss of nutritious by-products from harvesting, processing and distribution of horticultural byproducts, (4) the enormous need to reduce deposition of waste in landfills and contribute less to environmental damage, (5) continuing increased production of organic corn and soybean and (6) the ever present void of a comprehensive database coupled with an efficient technological process to formulate diets quickly and inexpensively. These factors are discussed below. Organic source of methionine. The national list for organic poultry feeds ingredients permits use of DL-Methionine, DL-Methionine-hydroxy analog, and DL-Methionine-hydroxy analog calcium (CAS #&#39;s 59-51-8, 583-91-5, 4857-44-7, and 922-50-9) at two pounds per ton for layers and broilers and three pounds per ton for turkeys. These synthetic products are allowed due to lack of a suitable organic methionine source. Beans also contain methionine. A combination of mostly organic cowpeas known as black-eyed peas (but actually a bean) and other beans (black, kidney, Great Northern) can be mixed with organic by-products (remaining after processing of fruits, grains, nuts, seeds and vegetables) and organic corn and soy to produce diets for broilers (meat-type birds), laying hens and turkeys. Many beans are high in anti-nutritive factors that may be difficult to digest by poultry. Therefore, we will use various procedures to remove anti-nutritional factors while maintaining most of the protein/methionine content. There is a continuing upward trend for consumption of organic poultry meat, eggs and their products in the U.S. Approximately 2.0% of the food supply and 1.0% of U.S. cropland is devoted to organic production of food. Some experts suggest that the organic food markets grew by 15 - 20% in previous years and upwards of 40% of U.S. consumers favor some organic food products. With 19% of national organic farms and 36% of all sales, CA, the leading agricultural state, also leads the nation in organic production of food. The state produces 14%, 47%, 58% and 14% of the organic berries, fruits, tree nuts and vegetables, respectively, for the US. CA is the second largest producers of organic chicken and laying hens and the first in production of organic turkeys.Poultry, found in many retail and conventional groceries, leads in the sale of organic meats. As the most popular organic meat, it is purchased by 73% of shoppers. Its domination of the meat market is due to a short production cycle, low price and mostly integrated production in comparison to beef or pork. Price, due to production costs, continues to outstrip demand; thus, organic poultry products remains out of reach for many in the US population. Use of organic horticultural by-products to replace part of the organic corn and soy could reduce the overall production cost. Moreover, in conjunction with beans, organic by-products can be used to improve the quality and efficiency of meat and eggs production. Many discarded by-products contain antioxidants that retard the deterioration of lipids (fats) and cholesterol in feed, post-mortem tissue and possibly in humans. For instance, &alpha;-tocopherol can be fed to broilers in diets containing tomato pomace, be stored in cell membranes of poultry muscle tissue during growth and remain in meat after processing to prevent lipid oxidation during storage, heating and freezing. Lycopene from tomato pomace can be stored in egg yolk Chlorogenic acid is an antioxidant in sweet potatoes while apples skins, another novel feed ingredient, contains more antioxidants than in the flesh of the fruit. Many  second rate  berries, larger fruits, broccoli stems/ leaves meal and nuts also contain valuable nutrients and antioxidants that could be stored in poultry meat and eggs and ultimately consumed by humans. Indeed, feeding nutrients such as antioxidants to broilers and layers, followed by tracking their deposition in meat and eggs, then monitoring their uptake in humans has received some attention by the medical profession; however, this area of research has not been sufficiently explored. Loss of nutritious by-products. Ranking third in production of fruits after China and India, the US is fourth in production of vegetables following China, India and Brazil. For US raw and processed fruits, vegetables and grains, about 23.4%, 25.4% and 32.0%, respectively, were wasted from production to consumption in 2010. While there is no separate data for loss of organic material, it is easy to realize that the loss of organic by-products will increase with demand for organic food.Reduction of depositions in landfills is a significant benefit from our research. When managing waste of any type, disposal in landfills is the seventh and last method listed after all others. Even with technical advances, post-harvest food loss remains a great concern in CA. Because CA leads the nation in the production of many fruits and vegetables, the lost in by-products is not manageable except for deposition in landfills. Increase in production of organic corn and soy. Corn and soy are major sources of protein for poultry. Feed costs for mostly corn and/or soy is 65 - 70% of the total financial input for production. With the demand for more organic poultry, use of these important crops can be extended if feed for organic poultry include organic beans and by-products. Need for extensive databases. Presently, researchers substitute one novel feedstuff for corn or soy for each investigation - a very slow process while the proof of concept for feeding by-products has been proven many times. Thus, an up-to-date database for by-products is under development in the PI&#39;s laboratory. This information is being coupled with the Nutrient Requirements of Poultry (1994) and updated information from poultry nutritionists across the"

Weeds, such as junglerice, have readily acquired resistance alleles and genetic mechanisms allowing them to sustain herbicide application, compete with the crop, and even mimic the crop. More interestingly, their abiotic stress response systems (drought tolerance, submergence, heat/temperature tolerance, etc.,) are often elite in comparison, because of longer periods of selection in the local environments. These genes, pathways, and expression networks and how these intersect are currently profound gaps in our understanding of how adaptive genetics of weed species intersects with environment and management practices. Improving crop production systems by tailoring the genetics of breeding germplasms for specific environments and studying the crop AND the surrounding weeds, is a sustainable solution to meet the growing challenges of agriculture and global sustainability.Because chemicals are highly effective in managing weeds, it has become the most popular option of weed control. However, with constant usage of herbicides in row crops, vegetable, and turf industry, very often these labeled herbicides cause significant injury on the crop itself, resulting in major yield loss. One of the good examples is tomato (Lypersicon esculentum), which is grown on over 444 acres across 627 farms in Mississippi (USDA, 2012), and although the crop is primarily grown in a plasticulture system (Pan et al., 1999), weeds are still a major problem in tomato production. Major weeds in tomato are yellow nutsedge, purple nutsedge, large crabgrass, and Palmer amaranth (Webster 2002). Among these weeds, yellow and purple nutsedge are the most problematic, causing significant yield losses and decreased fruit quality. Herbicide options in tomato are limited, and only a few are highly effective on nutsedge. These few herbicides that are labeled in tomato, show significant injury on the crop. Moreover, injury from herbicides drifted to greenhouse tomatoes leads to deformed fruits and yield reduction. Therefore, developing crops having tolerance to already labeled herbicides, and to herbicides that can potentially be drifted will improve quality and yield of the crop, and at the same time provide effective weed control.Row crops most commonly grown in Mississippi are cotton, soybean, corn, rice; while some commonly grown vegetables are tomato, sweet potato, and cucumber (USDA, 2012). In all of these crops, weed management has always been a major challenge to the growers. And with the introduction of herbicide-resistant crops technology, weeds are continuously exposed to selection pressure that results in weeds adapting to herbicide stress. Moreover, with the changing cropping systems that came along with the herbicide resistant technology, weeds have also found a way to adapt to the changes, thus rendering the herbicide-resistance technology ineffective. A survey conducted to determine how weed complexes have changed over time with change in management practices, showed that most of the weeds have evolved growth requirements and herbicide tolerances similar to the crop they infest (Loux and Berry 1991; McWhorter 1993). It would therefore be interesting to study how long the weeds take to evolve resistance to a particular herbicide. This will allow us to predict the time it takes herbicide-resistance technology to become ineffective since its commercialization. The objectives of the proposal will be to (1) develop a rapid assay to detect herbicide resistant weeds populations (non-destructive), identify mechanism of resistance, characterize competitive traits, biotic and biotic stress tolerance in weeds; (2) study the evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds; (3) develop herbicide tolerant crops."

Specialty crops are those that are grown in small acreage relative to major crops (apples, canola, corn, cotton, grain sorghum, grapes, rice, oranges, soybean, sunflower, turf, peanuts, potatoes, sugarcane, tomato, tobacco, and wheat). Specialty crops encompass minor use fruits, herbs and spices, tree nuts, ornamentals, and minor use vegetables. Because of their small acreage, and the large expense in registering pesticides, there is hardly no economic incentive for biological or chemical pesticide companies to develop the necessary database required for registration of their products on specialty crops. The need for pesticide registration in specialty crops and minor uses led to the formation of what used to be called the Interregional Project #4, or the IR-4 Project. Today, the Specialty Crops and Minor Use Program has expanded to also include pesticides needed to protect public health such as control of mosquitoes and ticks. Including all secondary impacts, the IR-4 Project is anticipated to support research and industry sales to support 104,650 U.S. jobs and increases annual gross domestic product by $7.3 billion (Miller and Leschewski 2012).The IR-4 project facilitates the examination of pesticide ingredients, crops and locations where pesticides will be used, the manner of use, and potential impact on consumers and nontarget organisms. The project helps ensure that any pesticide registered for specialty crops fall below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) allowed by EPA for food and feed. Recently, the IR-4 Project has provided about 50% of field and residue data for EPA&#39;s annual work plan and new clearances. About 70 - 80% of IR-4 Project&#39;s effort supports the registration of reduced-risk pesticides, thereby reducing the risk to human and environmental health relative to existing, or recently de-registered products (Viray and Hollingworth 2009; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2001a). Reduced risk pesticides are applied at lower rates than the older compounds; thus, volume of chemicals uses in fruit and vegetable production.The IR-4 Project has three programs: 1) Food, 2) Ornamental Horticulture, and 3) Biopesticides and Organic Support. Minor-use food crops (vegetables, melons, fruits, and tree nuts) comprise about 25% of total agricultural food crop production, worth about $33 billion annually. Without available modern pest management tools, losses of food and income are high.This proposed project is under the Food Use Program. The Food Program works with growers to establish minor-use, food crop priorities that instruct the Food Program on which commodity-pesticide registration projects to pursue."

Apio is one of the most traditional food crops for the central region with a large demand. Apio, containing approximately nine percent of protein, vitamin A precursors, and having four times more calcium than potatoes, is the most wanted root crop for the food industry because of its complex of starches, oils, mineral salts and easy digestibility. The central region was able to produce enough apio to cover internal and external demands before 2004 when the incidence of the corm rot disease caused from 50 to 100% yield losses. Each season the farmers experience less production and less availability of disease-free propagation material while the import of apio keeps increasing. Currently, the farmers lack an effective control for apio&#39;s corm rot disease. The objective of this project is to provide alternatives for the control of the disease and to increase the production of apio in the central region. Our long-term goal is to provide a stable source of income for our farmers, producing enough apio to cover in-house demands and its industrialization. This project aligns with one of the goals of the Department of Agriculture: to ensure food security and to promote local crops as an alternative source of nutritional food."

Among various kinds of crops harvested in Maine, two most important ones are potato and blueberry. The total economic impacts of the potato industry and the blueberry industry on Maine&#39;s economy are about $540 million and $250 million respectively. Maine potato production is ranked among top ten and Maine is the top grower for wild blueberry in the states.However, both crops are constantly facing challenges from different sources. Among them, the impacts of government programs, market integration and risks of different management practices are often overlooked. For example, a large share of farmers have been utilizing insurance instruments offered or underwritten by USDA to hedge risks because of various hazards such as late blight disease and potato beetle in potato production. However, the cost and return of these programs to Maine farmers have rarely been visited before. Moreover, Maine wild blueberry farmers are always concerned with blueberry prices. An important determinant of the price is whether and to what extent the (wild) blueberry markets are integrated. In addition, although the management practices of Maine wild blueberry operations have been studied by many of my colleagues, the associated economic risks and returns have never been thoroughly evaluated.Given the above, one of my main research objective is to adopt quantitative approaches to evaluate the insurance programs covering potato and blueberry productions. Second, I will use multiple time series to assess the market integration of blueberries. In addition, I will use simulation methods to compare the risks and returns among farms of different sizes or using management practices."

Scientists are also always looking for more effective compounds. A concern with all insecticides is their specificity. Most insecticides are highly toxic to insects but also have some toxicity towards other species. The goal is to develop insecticides which are highly toxic to the desired target species and not very toxic to non-target species. One of the newest groups of insecticides are the neonicotinoids. They attack the nervous system of insects but are much less able to attack the nervous system of mammals. These insecticides have become the most widely used in the world. Because of their versatility in application, they are used in a variety of farmland crops such as cereal crops, canola, potatoes and horticulture vegetable crops, fruits and vineyards. Neonicotinoids are also sold as garden sprays for flowers and vegetables. Recent studies however have shown that these compounds can be toxic to some non-target organisms, including honey bees and birds. Honey bee colony collapse has been attributed to the use of these compounds which appears to cause the bees to become disoriented.Honey bee disorientation and migratory bird migration may be effected similarily. We will conduct a literature search to look for similarities between the two and access whether the avain model developed in our laboratory (homing pigeon model) is a suitable for studying the effects of these neonicotinoid compounds on bees."

Thus, high glycemic carbohydrates are often described as  bad foods  and some groups propose that diets of  low-carb  or  no-carb  promote health. Idaho ranks as the third-largest Western agricultural state, producing more than $2,300 million in crop sales in 2013. Misconceptions about dietary carbohydrates affect agricultural economics. For example, the consumption of potato has declined since the mid 1990&#39;s. However, glycemic carbohydrates are an important energy source. For example, dietary glucose is the major energy source for the brain and is critical during brain development. Our previous studies, along with those of others, show that glucose produced slowly from carbohydrate digestion in the distal small intestine, triggers beneficial physiological responses related to satiety. However, very little is known about the kind of starch and the starch molecular structures that result in slow and consistent glucose release. In fact, the techniques to accurately measure this type of glucose have not been established. In this proposal, we will examine various crop-sourced starches for their fine structure, determine the relationship between structure and sustained dietary glucose, and develop an efficacious method to measure sustained dietary glucose. The findings will advance molecular and physiologic knowledge about starch and contribute to the development of healthy food carbohydrates."

Among the 135,920,000 cwt of harvested potatoes produced in Idaho in 2014, more than 50% are used for making frozen fries, and about 4% are used for making potato chips (National Potato Council 2014). For potatoes that are processed, fry quality is very important, among which fry color is the number one attribute that consumers desire, followed by fry texture (Agblor and Scanlon 2000, Laza et al. 2001).About fry color problems for potatoes Sugar end defect and stem-end chip defect are the most common color issues for potatoes processed for frozen fries and chips, respectively (Thompson, et al. 2008, Wang, et al. 2015). Sugar end defect (SED) is characterized by low starch content and high reducing sugars on the basal (stem) end portion that leads to dark color on the French fries after processing; stem-end chip defect (SECD) is a physiological disorder where there are regions of localized discoloration on the potato chip along the vascular tissues at a position corresponding to the tuber stem end. Both SED and SECD can cause substantial losses (up to 50% and 25% respectively on an annual basis) to growers due to crop rejection and for processors due to reduced recovery rate and product downgrade, therefore, finding approaches to mitigate those two color issues are of paramount importance to the Idaho potato industry.Sugar end defect The occurrence of malformed tubers has been correlated with SED (Nielsen and Sparks 1953). Temperature was the most critical factor in the development of both poorly formed tubers (knobby and chain-shaped) and SED (Bodlaender et al. 1964; Eldredge, et al. 1996). Chain-shaped tubers are due to a cessation of growth under heat stress and resuming when favorable conditions return. Knobby tubers are associated with high temperature that causes stimulated growth of lateral buds in one or more eyes. Both chain-shaped and knobby tubers are considered  culls  that are unsalable or devaluated due to their reduced tuber quality. A typical example is Russet Burbank, the most commonly planted variety in the U.S., which yields a high percentage of misshapen tubers often with SED after undergoing a short period of heat stress during the early tuber bulking stage. These off-standard tubers impact the variety&#39;s marketable yield and therefore cause financial losses. In comparison, varieties from the Northwest (Tri-State) Potato Breeding Program have successfully shown increased resistance to SED (such as Blazer Russet, Umatilla Russet, Clearwater Russet, Payette Russet), together with good yield and better grade. This raises the question of whether the ability of tubers to retain acceptable tuber growth and yield under heat stress conditions is associated with greater resistance to the sugar end disorder. Investigating this association between maintenance of tuber type and reduced SED would aid breeding programs in selection of new varieties that have good yield/grade as well as SED resistance. This will benefit both the growers and processing industry by producing tubers with not only higher recovery rate but also desired processing qualities such as color and texture.Stem-end chip defect Research conducted by Dr. Paul Bethke&#39;s group at UW-Madison has indicated that: 1) under controlled-environment, exposure of chipping potato plants to short periods (3 to 14 days) of high day and night air temperatures (35&deg;C and 29&deg;C respectively) heat stress during the growing season can cause SECD development on tubers during harvest; 2) little SECD was observed in chips prepared at harvest from both control (25&deg;C day temp and 18&deg;C night temp all season long) and heat-stressed tubers; 3) high incidence of SECD was noticed from heat-stressed, but not control, tubers after 30 or more days of storage under 13&deg;C; 4) heat stress increased tuber glucose and fructose contents on the stem end, and stem-end acid invertase activity increased as SECD severity increased; 5) different genotypes varied greatly in susceptibility to heat stress induced SECD. For example, Nicolet and Pike have shown consistently low SECD incidence across years, whereas heat-stressed Snowden and CO95051 are more prone to develop SECD during storage. However, there are yet-to-be answered questions: which stage of tuber bulking is more critical for the heat stress to induce SECD? Does vine kill affect heat-stressed tubers to increase SECD during storage? How does heat stress affect SECD development if tubers are grown under field conditions? What is the underlying physiological mechanism of resistance to SECD for some genotypes (e.g. For the SECD resistant genotypes, is there higher activity of acid invertase inhibitor)? Does SECD development affect tuber dormancy length during storage? These questions will help better understand mechanisms of SECD development and thus are useful to identify production management strategies, such as irrigation timeline, soil temperature monitoring, and so forth to control and mitigate the SECD problem for growers.About the texture of potato products To ensure a year-round supply of good quality potatoes for processing, most potatoes need to be stored in controlled climate warehouses (Bussan, et al. 2009). Maximizing the values of the stored potatoes requires harvesting tubers at peak maturity, which can result in improved storage quality and longer storability. Maturity usually refers to four distinct processes that occur as the potato crop approaches harvest: vine maturation (or senescence), chemical maturation (sucrose reaches minimum level to result in optimal fry color at harvest and during storage), physiological maturation (dry matter content reaches maximum level), and physical maturation (skin set is reached) (Bussan, et al. 2009). Specific gravity (SG) is directly related with dry matter content of the tubers. High dry matter contents for fry processing can result in processed products with mealy and fluffy texture that are preferred by consumers (Duk, et al. 2002). Desired range of SG for good processing quality is 1.080-1.095. The overall SG of a truck load or storage lot is required to be within this range, and additionally low variability or consistent values between each individual tuber is needed. For fry processing potatoes, a wide range in dry matter content will make it difficult to acquire uniform processing products, leading to reduced overall quality. Figure 3 shows two cultivars with different tuber-to-tuber SG variability at harvest.Little research has been done with regards to individual tuber SG variability change of cultivars from contrasting maturity classes over the growing season and how it is related with tuber maturation particularly chemical and physiological maturation. Information from this study will be beneficial for both potato growers and processors. Results will be helpful for growers because they may adjust their vine kill timing in order to obtain high yield and storage potential, reach maximum maturity, while having low individual tuber variability for optimal overall quality. Processors can also use the information to select cultivars that demonstrate more uniform fry product texture between tubers. Findings from this research will be communicated through various publications and presentations to the potato industry."

Other significant crops grown in Idaho include sugar beet, dry and snap beans, peas and other cool-season food legumes. Virus diseases cause significant losses in these crops and require monitoring and managing virus disease problems. Viruses, in particular aphid-transmitted Potato virus Y (PVY), are especially damaging in potato, a vegetatively propagated crop where special potato seed certification programs are employed to mitigate effects of degenerating virus diseases. Leafhopper-transmitted Beet curly top virus (BCTV) is one of the main problems for sugar beet and bean production in Idaho, and in other Western states with dry climate. Two more viruses are important in beans in Idaho, in addition to BCTV, both transmitted by aphids and through seed: Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) and Bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV). Three aphid-transmitted viruses are of a major concern in peas, Pea enation mosaic virus, Bean leafroll virus, and Pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV). Understanding the infection cycle, virus-host interactions, transmission, epidemiology, and strain composition of these viruses affecting major Idaho crops facilitates development of more profitable and sustainable management strategies for crop protection and production."

(1) Properties will help to optimize RF pasteurization for destruction of Salmonella. Temperature distribution data will assure uniform heating throughout the product. The models will use physical properties, heating rate, and uniformity index to in optimization of the RF process. The high water activity research on packaged beef steaks and ground meat will be used for optimizing the process for food safety and quality of those products. Extraction and microencapsulation of phytochemicals from cherry and other juices will help in evaluation and further digestion of encapsulated and modified products to be used for health benefits. The human digestion system will provide realistic information on stability and bioavailability of phytonutrients. (2) Process development to investigate RF heating protocols for pasteurizing food powders, including corn flour, spices, and corn flour. Conditions will be optimized including heating time, temperature, and methods to improve the heating uniformity. The properties studied at different frequencies and moisture contents will be used in mathematical models to correlate composition of food materials and further used for heating predictions. In case of high water activity food, the effect of thickness and endpoint temperature (55 - 75&deg;C) on quality of non-intact beefsteaks cooked in a RF oven will help in producing good quality safe product. Physicochemical characteristics affect doneness but thickness could affect cooking time, heating rate, cooking and drip losses. Validation of pathogenic and nonpathogenic E. coli using RF heating in a model will be conducted. Thermal inactivation of pathogenic and nonpathogenic E. coli in packaged non-intact steaks heated up to 60&deg;C or 65&deg;C will be carried out. A study for the USDA-FSIS cooking guidelines at 63&deg;C holding at room temperature for 5 min will be performed. The cooking protocol developed will have a practical relevance for the industry. Radiant wall (infrared) heating has shown promise for producing crisp products that mimic the taste and texture of fried foods but are baked. Our previous research on potato strips will provide guidance to further refine this method for IR cooking of breaded chicken nuggets. Instrumental and sensory studies will provide information for adaptation of this technology. The same unit is being used for blanching peanuts at different moisture contents in 1.5 min whereas the hot air systems take up to 30 min. The shelflife and sensory quality of blanched and roasted peanuts will be further studied. (3) Development of microencapsulation technologies for bioactives and their absorption in human GI tract will produce functional ingredients and evaluate their bioavailability. We will use different encapsulation methods and wall materials for novel encapsulation incorporating enzyme inhibitors. The methods will include gelation and spray drying, and the wall materials will be calcium alginate, maltodextrin, arabic gum, and whey protein isolate. This study will develop strategy to better control the release rate for improved efficiency. Our preliminary trials have indicated that polyphenols bind with proteins and enzymes present in stomach, which results in a loss of inhibition activity. It is expected that encapsulation will mask the bitter flavor that are associated with polyphenols. Release properties of microencapsulated enzyme inhibitors in the stomach and intestine, as well as the efficiency of enzyme inhibition will be studied. This will demonstrate how microencapsulation technique enhances efficiency of different enzyme inhibitors. We will also study method to encapsulate phytochemicals with different targeted enzymes into one microcapsule to obtain a synergistic inhibition effect. We will study efficiency of a series of the phytochemicals and digestive enzymes. The effect of food matrix and other components present in the GI tract on efficiency will be investigated. Both static and dynamic in vitro trials using the human gastric simulator (HGS), dynamic intestinal model (DIM), and the new integrated GI model will be involved. Reaction rate of polyphenol-enzyme interaction will be studied. The release of polyphenols from food matrix and its transportation and transformation during digestion will be studied. This study will provide information of the enzyme inhibition efficiency of different phytochemicals as affected by food matrix and nutritional components. Enzyme inhibition efficiency of anthocyanins as affected by extraction and preparation methods. The antioxidant and enzyme-inhibitory activities of blueberry anthocyanins extracted with different methods that use acetone, ethanol and methanol have been studied. Similar research will be conducted with cherry products and the crude extracts will be purified by column chromatography. The purified ethanol extract yield the highest total anthocyanin content, total phenolics content [TPC] and enzyme inhibitory activity. The purified extracts can be freeze-dried into anthocyanin powder. However, the enzyme inhibitory function of rehydrated methanol and ethanol extract are lost. Results of future study will provide useful information in optimizing anthocyanin preparation methods for improved biological activity. Methods to improve the efficiency of the Nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and NFC gels in absorbing oils present in human GI tract will be investigated. NFC can be converted into gel, a light and high porosity material with strong oil absorption as observed in our preliminary study. NFC and NFC gel can be further modified to incorporate strong hydrophobicity that will enable the selective oil absorption ability. During digestion, the NFC/NAP will be released in the stomach and intestine, absorbing oils present in the GI tract and reducing absorption. The oil-containing NFC/NAP will pass through colon until excretion in feces from the human body. Specific studies will include the preparation of nanocellulose, surface modification of NFC to incorporate hydrophobicity, and in vitro and in vivo digestion trials to evaluate the oil absorption capacity and stability of NFC materials in GI tract. The results will provide evidence about the efficacy of using NFC and NAP to treat and prevent obesity, and give suggestions and recommendations about the optimum condition for production of NFC/NAP, surface modification, and incorporation of NFC/NAP into foods."

The technology is suitable for areas of intensive agricultural crop production as well as the production of biomass crops on marginal lands for sustainable biofuel and bioenergy production. The development and demonstration of nitrogen fixing endophytic bacteria suited for corn and important agricultural crops provides a means to improve yields while decreasing environmental impacts of soil applied nitrogen fertilizers such as generation of greenhouse gases and negative impacts to surface waters.The interior of many plant species provides habitat for a wide range of bacteria and fungi that benefit the plant host by increasing nutrient acquisition and stress tolerance. The term  endophyte  was coined to describe these internal microbes that spend a significant part of their life cycle within plants and do not cause disease. A subset of these endophytic microorganisms fixes atmospheric nitrogen into the usable forms of ammonia and nitrate within the plant. Such microbes are termed diazotrophs, and have been found in major food crops including rice, maize, sugar cane, and sweet potato. Although diazotrophic endophytes can promote growth by producing phytohormones, it has been demonstrated that significant amounts of fixed nitrogen can be provided by them as well to improve plant growth.Successful completion of this project will demonstrate specific benefits of nitrogen fixing endophytes in larger scale greenhouse and small plot field studies and form the basis for large scale field demonstrations and production in Phase II including manufacture, delivery and application methods compatible with current agriculture production techniques. The development of which will provide farmers with increased profits as nitrogen requirements are decreased. Additional benefits resulting from the overall decreased dependence and usage of nitrogen fertilizer sources will occur in improved water quality and decreased greenhouse gas production."

However, transferring plantlets from tissue culture vessels to the propagation trays is extremely time consuming and labor intensive. It is the major obstacle in crop production. The purpose of this projectis to design and produce a prototype which can efficiently transfer plantlets to propagation trays which can then be transplanted to the field.The apparatus produced here has potential of developing precision machinery on transplanting automation. The prototype we propose includes the frame, clamp/prong assembly, prong actuators and sensor, and straight line mechanism and sensor. Different prong types will be tested prior to the construction of the apparatus. Plantlets will be used to determine the performance of prongs and detailed data will be recorded and analyzed. Responses of plants to the different design of prongs such as survival, growth and development will be evaluated. Initially we propose to use this apparatus and techniques on plantlets of potatoes and raspberries because of their economic and cultural importance to Alaska. Alaska is the only state in the U.S. with agreements to produce lab-tested disease-free seed potatoes for export to China and Taiwan, the largest seed potato market in the world. Raspberry is an important part of native diets. The equipment and protocols developed in this project will streamline mass production of potato seed stocks and raspberry propagation materials in Alaska. This system can easily be adapted to other crops where micropropagation plays a significant role in the production."

In the Recovery Plan for Ralstonia solancearum Race 3 biovar 2, which was drafted as part of the National Plant Disease Recovery System, the USDA lists one of the  highly important  research priorities as:  explor[ing] novel diagnostic techniques to detect R3b2 quickly and at low concentrations, such as ... highly sensitive antibody-responsive cell culture systems.  To continue to meet this call PathSensors, through Phase II funding, will further develop the instrumentation and assays to fully integrate the testing system into a diagnostic lab setting for high throughput sample processing.CANARY&reg; (Cellular Analysis and Notification of Antigen Risks and Yields) is a cell-based biosensor technology that demonstrates unprecedented performance in terms of speed, sensitivity, and ease-of-use when compared with other standard detection technologies. The USDA has invested over one million dollars to develop CANARY&reg;. The USDA CPHST Laboratory in Beltsville, MD has used the Ralstonia biosensor to achieve one of the lowest limits of detection (LoD) of any biosensor-based, or other type of assay, for the detection of Ralstonia, achieving an LoD of 3 cfu from infected potato slices. Using PathSensors&#39; engineering and design expertise, we developed instrumentation that uses commercially available, off-the-shelf parts linked together and controlled through an integrated computer software system. Users are led through all steps of the assay via a computer software program. Positive or negative sample identification will be provided by processing the CANARY&reg; light output signal through an automated detection algorithm.To further commercialize this product, we intend to refine both our sample preparation methods and the user interface. We will also expand the catalogue of diagnostic assays by adapting this technology to current and existing plant pathogen assays such as tests for Phytophthora spp. and Citrus leprosis virus. In addition, PathSensors will develop a new biosensor for detecting the causative agent citrus greening disease, Candidatus Liberibacter spp. Citrus greening disease or Huanglongbing (HLB) is the most significant disease to threaten citrus production worldwide. The disease is widespread in both Brazil and Florida and is currently spreading to Texas and California. Once infected, citrus orchards are usually destroyed or become unproductive within eight years. The University of Florida reported that citrus greening has cost Florida&#39;s economy over $4 billion and 8,000 jobs, with losses of up to 30-40% of the expected citrus crop. To stem the spread and increase surveillance potential, a fast, high throughput assay needs to be developed for citrus greening. The instrumentation developed during Phase I answers this need and, to this end, we have partnered with Dr. John Hartung at USDA-ARS to incorporate his antibodies into the HLB assay.To build the confidence in the developed system, PathSensors will have third party diagnostic labs test and verify the performance. Upon validation, this system will be deployed and used in survey programs, field labs, and diagnostic testing facilities. Furthermore, this system will be made available to exporters to assure their plants are pathogen-free prior to shipping. Finally, PathSensors will further adapt the multiplex system for use with other existing plant pathogen CANARY&reg; cell lines, such as those for Phytophthora and Citrus leprosis virus."

With funding from the Community Food Project Grant, there will be an immediate increase of 20%-30% of the supply of fresh food during the first year into Kansas City&#39;s most impoverished neighborhoods.The center of this project is Ivanhoe; the poorest neighborhood in the Lower East Side of Kansas City, Missouri. A statistical overview of the community targeted for this project; an inner-city community of ~10,000 in the neighborhood of Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe has a density of 5,186 people per square mile. Approximately 63.8% of Ivanhoe Southwest&#39;s population has an annual household income below $25,000 which means that most residents live in low-income households. The neighborhood is 90% African-American and most of the population has only attained a high school degree, which suggests that this is a poorly-educated neighborhood. Roughly 40% of the land in Ivanhoe is vacant or abandoned.This Community Food Project is to help Good Natured Market overcome obstacles in order to get as much healthy, local food as possible into homes in Kansas City&#39;s vulnerable communities through increased food inventory, site improvements, promotion, EBT incentives and memberships. This initiative will directly lead to significant, measurable sales increases. This program is vitally significant because it addresses a problem that is plaguing inner-cities throughout the United States.Inner-cities have very few grocery stores; what is still the only source of food is the local convenience store. The only thing convenient about it is the location. There are very few healthy items you can buy at such stores, usually a few loaves of white bread, milk, and eggs. Limited access to affordable quality fresh food in many urban areas all over American has increased the problem of childhood obesity and diabetes. There is a direct link to the startling numbers of childhood obesity, juvenile diabetes, as well as diabetes developed in adults years later, after growing up in food deserts. In 2004 study from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found, $1 could buy 1,200 calories of potato chips and 875 calories of soda, but only 250 calories of vegetables and 170 calories of fresh fruit. This is why we must look at accessibility and affordability if we want to change what people are eating in the urban areas.Good Natured Family Farms, the workhorse extention of the 501(c)(3) Kansas City Food Hub (AKA The Food Conservancy) is vastly experienced in providing healthy, local food to Kansas City residents, specifically minorities and low-income persons. Effective relationships, partnerships, and strategic use of federal and private foundation grant funds for worthy causes have led GNFF&#39;s small-farm, marketing alliance of over 150 farmer members to become a premier provider of local, healthy food to vulnerable populations.Additionally, GNFF has pioneered a nationally-recognized Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) pilot and many other food-related projects. GNFF&#39; mission is to support local farmers and to provide access of wholesome, fresh food to needy populations. As such, GNFF has developed many strong, working relationships and linkages with community-focused organizations in the Kansas City region; a few examples: Bistro Kids and Treat America to bring fresh, wholesome foods to kids, University of Missouri, Beans&amp;Greens, Menorah Legacy Society, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, United States Department of Agriculture, Ball&#39;s Food (Hen House and Price Chopper stores), Sysco Food Distribution, and many more.What will be interesting to note and track during this project&#39;s time period:  To what degree will making fresh food more available and affordable in inner-city communities change the food choices of this targeted population?  The year-end evaluation, which includes a customer survey, plus sales tracking from the upgraded scanning computer, will help to enlighten us in this query.The Final Report will include significant data collected throughout the year on how better eating habits are linked to fresh food availability and affordability - and the effectiveness of using a clergy coalition in promoting and encouraging its inner-city parishioners to use Good Natured Market&#39;s generous EBT incentives for fresh food."

Some of the more intractable problems are soilborne diseases, in particular those caused by nematode-virus or nematode-fungal complexes, which can significantly reduce productivity and longevity of plantings. For example, Tomato ringspot virus and Tobacco ringspot virus, which are vectored by dagger nematodes, cause losses multiple fruit crops. Strawberries suffer from black root rot (BRR), caused by root lesion nematode, Rhizoctonia fragariae and Pythium spp. Since perennial fruit crop plantings require a substantial investment and there are no proven post-plant controls, prevention is critical. Chemical fumigation works but is costly and toxic to the environment. Thus the long-term goal of this integrated research-extension project is to develop environmentally and economically sustainable approaches to managing root lesion nematodes and BRR in strawberries and dagger nematodes that vector nepoviruses in grapes, blueberries, raspberries and peaches. The specific objectives are to: 1) Evaluate biofumigation and anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) for control of plant-parasitic nematodes, nepoviruses and black root rot (BRR), 2) Evaluate compost teas and cull-potato ferment for control of plant-parasitic nematodes, nepoviruses, and BRR, 3) Evaluate nematode-resistant grape rootstocks, peach root stocks and blueberry cultivars for resistance to dagger nematodes and nepovirus transmission; and 4) Conduct economic analysis of alternative approaches and share results with stakeholders.

The industrialization and population growth in underdevelopedcountries where large quantities of fossil fuel reserves are located will lead to increased future demand and price of crude oil.The expected future increase in demand and consequent rise in prices of the finite fossil fuel reserves (in spite of replenishmentby successful exploration or reserves growth) will result in volatility in the fossil fuels market and political instability in thedeveloping countries and energy insecurity in developed countries if world-wide demand outstrips supply. In addition, increasingthe use of fossil fuels will exacerbate catastrophic climate change that results from the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) intothe atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. Biofuels and specialty chemicals from renewable agricultural feedstocks providean alternative green chemistry CO2 neutral production to traditional fossil fuels routes and will also significantly reduce theNation&#39;s future dependence on foreign oil. The proposed research builds on the search for renewable agro-based feedstocksthat do not compete with food which can be economically exploited for production of biofuels and specialty chemicals. Tubers ofyellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) a persistent weed in many vegetable, potatoes, corn and oats fields have beenselected for exploitation of their triglyceride content. Energy crops such as switchgrass and alfalfa have been selected forexploitation of their seeds as sources of triglycerides in addition to using their biomass for pyrolysis into bio-oil for upgrading intotransportation fuel. Integrating the extraction of the non-edible oils for biodiesel production with pyrolysis of the extracted seedssolids to bio-oil would increase the overall yield of renewable bio-fuels from the energy crops.The Roy G. Perry College of Engineering and the College of Agriculture and Human Sciences (CAHS) as Colleges in a landgrantinstitution follow the tradition of dedication to achieve excellence and relevance in teaching, research and service. TheCollege of Engineering consistently ranks among the top ten producers of African-American engineers and the College ofAgriculture and Human Sciences prepares underserved student leaders in agriculture, nutrition, and human sciences who havemade significant contributions to the workforce of the state of Texas and the nation as a whole.

The largest crops by acreage are potato, lettuce, sweet corn, watermelon and tomato. Major vegetable crops in the Solanaceae family include potato, tomato, and pepper; this family is the third most economically important food crop plant taxon (solgenomics.net/about/about_solanaceae.pl). Tomato and pepper contribute to human nutrition and food security in the US. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruits and products made from fruits contribute significantly to the US dietary intake of lycopene, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and tocopherols (vitamin E); these antioxidants have been reported as possessing cardio-protective and chemo-preventive activities. Pepper fruits are a rich source of carotenoids (provitamin A) and ascorbic acid, and also supply several B vitamins in the human diet. Tomatoes are consumed fresh or processed (as sauce, paste, diced, juice, etc.) and are an excellent source of nutrients for humans. Peppers (Capsicum annuum) are also consumed fresh or as processed products (as sauces, salsa, diced, roasted, dried and ground). Over the past century, numerous methodologies and technologies have been developed and adapted by plant breeders to expedite cultivar development. Recently, genomics technologies, such as DNA-based markers and genome sequencing, have provided breeders the means to select plants with the desired traits based on their genotype, a process known as marker-assisted selection (MAS). Genotyping has become increasingly high-throughput and cost-effective, with major technical advances in genotyping platforms and data management significantly reducing the costs of employing MAS. Despite rapid advances in genomics, in-field trait phenotyping remains a major bottleneck for crop cultivar breeding and wider implementation of MAS and genomics-facilitated breeding. The manual trait phenotyping process is costly, labor- and time-intensive, and often precludes repeated measurements on the same plants, or plots of plants, over time. Cultivar breeding programs require phenotyping of thousands of plants grown in field locations typical for commercial production of the crop. Multiple traits, some of which are genetically complex (e.g., yield, fruit quality, abiotic stress tolerances), must be assessed for each plant, family or line in breeding populations in order to accurately identify and select superior plants or families that can be developed into cultivars. Traits of major importance in both tomato and pepper include fruit yield, color, size and shape. Other key traits in both crops include leaf canopy cover (to prevent fruit sunburn), days to maturity, plant size (architecture), and drought and heat tolerance. Depending on the end uses of the fruits, other traits may be of importance. For example, in processing tomatoes, red fruit that is square-round in shape with high soluble solids (Brix) content are desirable, as is determinant plant habit for mechanical harvesting. In fresh market tomato, desired fruit shapes, sizes and color vary by market class (e.g., beefsteak, plum, cherry, heirlooms, etc.) and the plant architecture may range from determinant bush to indeterminate vine-types that are trellised and repeatedly hand-harvested. In pepper, target fruit traits for breeding depend partly on whether the peppers are sweet (non-pungent) or hot (pungent), and if they are used fresh, dried, ground or in processed products. Sweet pepper pod types include bell, pimento, Cuban and squash, while pungent (hot) pepper pod types include cayenne, jalapeno, serrano, ancho, pasilla, New Mexican and others. Fruit colors in pepper can vary from green to red, purple, yellow and orange. Pod types are distinguished by their shape as well as by color, pungency (heat) level, aroma and/or flavor; these categories are used by the pepper industry to identify the correct pepper for the proper (end) product. Climate change is projected to reduce crop yields and increase the frequency of extreme weather events in major food producing regions including the arid western United States. Efficient breeding of crop cultivars that are productive and resilient in a changing climate is needed to address this major threat to food security. The current labor-, cost- and time-intensive manual methods of evaluating (phenotyping) traits in field-grown crop plants are a major bottleneck in plant breeding that slows progress. Efficient use of genomic tools (including high-throughput genotyping) in breeding cannot be implemented at the required scale and speed without a transformational change in approach to in-field trait phenotyping. Development of new technologies and approaches for efficient high-throughput in-field phenotyping methodologies are urgently needed by plant breeders to achieve rapid development of new crop varieties to meet the threats of climate change and provide food security for a growing population. The developmental pace of in-field phenotyping technology lags behind that of genomics technology. As a consequence, trait phenotyping in the field is a significant bottleneck for efficient breeding of crop cultivars. The development and application of technologies that result in accurate, high-throughput plant phenotyping in the field would serve to accelerate breeding crop cultivars. More recent developments in sensors, machine vision and machine learning techniques, higher resolution digital cameras, massively parallel data processing power and other applicable technologies have now paved the way to enable high-throughput in-field plant phenotyping (HTPP) in the field to benefit food crop breeding programs. In this three-year project we will focus on the development and deployment of automated, smart HTPP systems to accelerate breeding of new and novel vegetable cultivars adaptable to climate change. We will focus on tomato and pepper, important members of the Solanaceae family of vegetable crops (i.e., tomato, pepper, eggplant, potato). Tomato and pepper have similarities in breeding objectives for a number of plant and fruit traits of importance to growers, consumers and processors. Longer term (beyond this project timeframe) we plan to adapt the HTPP technologies and methods that we develop for tomato and pepper to other important food crops."

Potato possesses four copies of each chromosome, making it more difficult than usual to incorporate desirable agronomic traits, such as disease resistance and yield,during the breeding process. This trait of possessing more than two copies of each chromosome, called polyploidy, also makes it difficult to identify the genes and genetic variants underlying traits of interest. To simplify the system and make genetic studies more feasible, one strategy that can be utilized is the production of potatoes that possess only two copies of each chromosome, called dihaploids. Potato dihaploids are made by fertilizing the target plant with a special group of potatoes known as in vitro pollinators. Once the pollination is performed, the eggs from the target plant develop with only half the number of chromosomes as a usual potato plant. This makes them far easier to use in genetic studies, and they can also be used to incorporate genetic material from wild potato that only possess two copies of each chromosome and are otherwise incompatible with cultivated potato. During the formation of dihaploids, some genetic material is sometimes incorporated from the pollinator plant into the mother plant. This outcome is undesirable, and the proposed projects seek to identify the prevalence of this phenomenon in two dihaploid populations generated from the common potato cultivars Atlantic and Superior. The project will also utilize the dihaploid populations from these plants to study, on a genome-wide scale, how changes at the genetic and epigenetic level influence agronomic traits in the field and expression of genes at the molecular level. The studies, altogether, will contribute to the community&#39;s knowledge of how dihaploid production works andprovide the potato breeding community withmore fine-scaled knowledge on how variation in the potato genome contributes to observable trait differences between different plants."

In humans, dietary carotenoids act as precursors to vitamin A, as well as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, protecting against a myriad of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and age-related macular degeneration. Cereals are generally poor sources of carotenoids compared to fruits and vegetables, but since cereals make up the majority of the human diet an increase in cereal carotenoids could have a significant impact on human nutrition. Sorghum is one of the world&#39;s largest produced cereal crops and a staple food for millions of people in semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In the United States, it is primarily used in animal feed, but is increasingly used in specialty food products, especially those that are gluten free. Efforts to improve the nutritional quality of sorghum grain have relied primarily on traditional plant breeding, a process that can take years before a line is ready to be released. Marker-assisted breeding (the use of genetic markers to select for a trait of interest in crop breeding) can vastly accelerate the development of biofortified crops.The ultimate goal of this research is to provide genetic tools that will help breeders rapidly develop high-carotenoid sorghum varieties. To this end, we will quantify grain carotenoid concentrations in hundreds of sorghum lines using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), a gold-standard technique for quantifying compounds. Since HPLC is a time-consuming and expensive technique, we will develop a high-throughput method for measuring carotenoid concentrations using near-infrared spectroscopy, a technique that predicts the concentration of a compound by reflecting near-infrared light on the whole grain. We will identify the genomic regions containing genes that control carotenoid concentrations using a genome-wide association study (GWAS), a method that scans the genome for associations between carotenoid concentrations and variations in single nucleotides. Finally, we will identify the nucleotide variations responsible for carotenoid variation by sequencing candidate genes that were identified through GWAS. The allelic variants can then be used as markers for marker-assisted breeding to develop high-carotenoid sorghum varieties that will benefit human health."

Imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, is commonly used for control of L. decemlineata, but many populations of L. decemlineata have begun to show increased imidacloprid resistance. Studies have demonstrated that L. decemlineata up-regulate detoxifying enzymes in the presence of insecticides, resulting in varying degrees of resistance in geographically distributed populations. We hypothesize that it is not solely the presence of the insecticides that leads to increased resistance, but rather a combination of multiple factors, including the application of fungicides on potato crops. In this study we seek to uncover whether the use of fungicides leads to cross- resistance to insecticides and may have an additive effect. With the proposed USDA AFRI ELI postdoctoral fellowship, we will determine the effects of fungicidal exposure on L. decemlineata and whether exposure to fungicides leads to increased imidacloprid resistance, whether fungicidal exposure leads to overexpression of genes that are up-regulated in response to the imidacloprid, and the correlation between geographic distribution of resistance and the presence of fungicides. Completion of the research objectives will advance the sustainability of crop production by revealing the underlying causes which lead to imidacloprid resistance in L. decemlineata and will reduce the need for increasing pesticide application. Controlling pesticide resistance in L. decemlineata is vital to ensure the economics and security of potatoes, as well as limit pesticide release into the surrounding environment."

Potatoes grown in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, account for approximately 57% of the total US potato production making it an extremely important production region. The primary causal organism of PED, Verticillium dahliae, is ubiquitous in the PNW and across all US production regions. In any given year, V. dahliae, is estimated to reduce crop yields by 10-15%, but losses can be as high as 50% if environmental conditions promote disease. The black dot pathogen C. coccodes may also be involved in the PED complex and can reportedly reduce yields by up to 30%. Importantly, potato growers must either manage the PED using soil fumigation, which is expensive, or endure yield loss each year due to PED. The value associated with either the cost of control or yield loss due to disease make PED one of the most important disease threats to potato production. Impact of PED can be reduced through multiple cultural control tactics, including crop rotation and nitrogen and irrigation management, but the amount of control is variable and sometimes low when compared with the economic return associated with chemical control by soil fumigation. Thus, current management of PED relies almost exclusively on soil fumigation which is the only control tactic that provides consistent disease control. Within the potato industry there is an interest develop alternative management strategies for PED, and other soilborne diseases currently controlled using soil fumigants.This project seeks to improve the management of PED by increasing our understanding of the mechanisms that may be leading to reduced efficacy of soil fumigants, enhancing our abilities to estimate yield losses due to soil-borne pathogens by developing reliable sampling methods and accurate action thresholds, and by evaluating currently available and new environmentally compatible strategies, new bio-rational pesticides, for PED management. To do this we will be combining data from multiple sources generated in both the private and public sectors and from a combination of experimental and survey studies. We have worked closely with grower cooperators to generate some of the data sets that will be used for validation of our methodologies. Some large data sets, previously generated, will also be used to refine sample strategies for soil borne pathogens and improve field-level estimates soil born pathogen inoculum. These outcomes will allow potato growers to select crop rotations that result in reduced pathogen persistence in the soil and subsequent disease severity and enhance management by allowing for more accurately estimation of inoculum density and need for fumigation. If effective, bio-rational products can be quickly adopted by growers using optimized best management practices. This, in turn, will reduce the exclusive reliance on soil fumigation for PED management with the potential to reduce cost of crop production and negative impacts to human health or the environment that may be associated with the use of soil fumigants."

Although the actual cause is still unknown, determining the totalirradiation dose is invaluable to ensure the products are processed within the safe limits. Among the methods establishedfor the detection of irradiated foods, analysis of 2-alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBs) with GC-MS and analysis of cellulosicand carbonate radicals with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy serve as the most promising approachesto determine the irradiation history in pet food products. The goal of the proposed research is to develop GC-MS and EPRtechniques coupled to quantify the formation of specific irradiation markers and to determine the total amount ofirradiation treatment in pet foods and treats. We will carry out the project in two parts: the first three years will bededicated to development and validation of testing methods; the last two years will be the comparison and field-testing ofthe validated protocols for evaluation of the irradiation history in pet food products. In the first part of the project pet foodproducts, including chicken jerky treats, sweet potato treats, dog chews (beer, lamb), bones, hoofs and pig ears, will beirradiated from 0.1-75 kGy with either a Cesium-137 source and electron beam (e-beam). The formation and stability ofvarious 2-ACBs (i.e., 2-DCB, 2-TCB, 2-TDCB) will be evaluated using GC-MS techniques based on our previous worksin collaboration with Vet-LIRN and USDA labs. In parallel, formation and stability of carbonic and cellulosic radicalswill be evaluated by using EPR analysis in both low mobility and high mobility environments. Complementary to EPRmeasurements, irradiation-specific DNA damage will also be investigated by using qPCR analysis. The analytical andphysical methods will be validated for different product formulations with varying lipid composition, moisture content,presence of glycerin, vegetables, phytochemicals etc., and extraction methods, such as hexane extraction, solid phaseextraction (SPE), solid phase microextraction (SPME), soxhlet extraction. The chemical and thermal stabilities of thespecific irradiation markers will be analyzed over a temperature range (20-80 °C) and at least one year of storage at roomtemperature. In the second part of the project, validated protocols will be tested on commercial irradiated pet foodproducts available in the market.

In food science, the crystallinity of starches within potatoes and pasta directly dictate bioavailability of the stored energy content. In renewable energy, biochemical degradation of biomass is greatly affected by the degree of crystallinity. Biomineralization also relies on careful control over crystal phase, often resulting in selection of metastable structures. In pharmaceutical materials, physical solid state form can profoundly affect bioavailability and drug efficacy. Reliably measurement and monitoring of how crystal forms and transforms requires tools capable of reporting crystalline content at low levels. With the support of this grant, Professors Simpson and Bouman work closely with their industrial partners to develop fast and sensitive imaging tools to do just that.  Through close partnership with AbbVie and Formulatrix, the developed approach is expected to bring impacts in pharmaceutical formulations development and other areas, such as pretreatment of biomass for energy conversion and artificial biomineralization.  In addition to working with their undergraduate and graduate students closely on the project, professor Simpson also organizes an intensive summer short-course program on nonlinear optics that more than 160 students have participated in the past ten years. Professor Simpson plans now to produce short videos on the topics discussed at the short course program and makes it available to a much broader audience through YouTube.  In the present work, Professors Simpson, Bouman, and their groups work on reducing the detection limits of Raman spectroscopy by several orders of magnitude to enable analysis of glassy metastable assemblies, targeting detection limits in the parts per million (ppm) regime. Three complementary approaches are pursued to achieve this objective, all of which center on signal to noise enhancement through background reduction. In the first, SHG is used to rapidly identify regions of interest for targeted Raman analysis, building on the inherent speed and selectivity of SHG for chiral crystals. In addition, a dynamic sampling strategy is adopted for analysis of the SHG-inactive components of formulations, in which spatially sparse sampling informed by the preceding set of outcomes is used for efficient hyperspectral imaging reconstruction. Finally, a spectral sparse sampling strategy for beam-scanning imaging using a photomultiplier tube array allows low-noise measurements for hyperspectral Raman imaging. Complementing these spectral characterization approaches, triboluminescence detection will be developed for fast screening. All efforts greatly benefit from close partnership between collaborators working in pharmaceutical formulations development (AbbVie) and instrumentation companies (Formulatrix) positioned to transition innovations in the research laboratory to viable commercial products. While the primary focus of the work is on metastable systems of relevance to industrial collaborators, the results of this work provides a foundation for expansion to other metastable biological assemblies, including pretreatment of biomass for energy conversion, crystallinity in edible products, and fundamentals of biomineralization.  Professor Simpson organizes a week- long intensive program, Chautauqua on Nonlinear Optics for graduate student from research groups worldwide. The program focuses on in-depth understanding of the theoretical and practical fundamentals of nonlinear optics and aims to build a community operating within a common framework for performing and interpreting nonlinear optical measurements."

However, the impact of auxin on bacterial plant interactions is not well understood.  This project seeks to better understand the mechanisms through which auxin promotes disease caused by two plant pathogens: Pseudomonas syringae, the causal agent of bacterial speck disease of a variety of plants, and Dickeya spp., the causal agent of bacterial soft rot, an important pathogen of potato. Previous research has found that auxin plays multiple roles during P. syringae pathogenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana, including suppression of host defenses and regulating pathogen gene expression. The current project will focus on three questions: i) How does auxin produced by P. syringae impact host biology to promote disease susceptibility? ii) How does auxin impact expression of P. syringae virulence factors?, and iii) Does auxin production by Dickeya contribute to disease on potato? The results of this project will be an improved understanding of the roles of auxin during pathogenesis of P. syringae and Dickeya spp. As both pathogens infect a large number of crops, knowledge gained through this work will serve as a foundation for understanding other important plant-pathogen interactions to facilitate the design of more effective disease control strategies. In addition, since these studies include the investigation of a pathogen, Dickeya, that is of immediate concern to U.S. potato farmers, results will provide pertinent information that can be used to enhance disease management practices and provide new targets for broad range disease control.Technical Paragraph:Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a naturally occurring form of auxin, promotes growth of P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (PstDC3000) on A. thaliana.  IAA, in addition to being a plant hormone, is also a microbial signaling molecule that many plant-associated microbes synthesize and/or respond to. Thus, IAA can potentially act through several different mechanisms to promote pathogenesis, including suppressing host defenses, altering host physiology, and directly impacting pathogen biology. The primary goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms through which auxin promotes the virulence of PstDC3000 during infection of A. thaliana and other hosts. The multidisciplinary collaboration between the two research groups engages the complimentary expertise in the two labs and will utilize bacterial genetics, state of the art global transcriptional analysis and metabolic profiling to further understanding of the roles auxin plays in regulating plant-pathogen interactions. The results of this study will be transformative, as they will be instrumental in the discovery of determinants involved in plant-microbe interactions.  The project will provide valuable new insight into the signaling molecules and events regulating pathogen and host gene expression during infection. Specifically, the project has the following objectives: 1) Investigating the direct effects of auxin on PstDC3000, 2) Identification and characterization of PstDC3000 mutants with altered sensitivity to auxin, 3) Investigate the roles of P. syringae-derived auxin during pathogenesis, and 4) Investigating the contribution of pathogen-derived auxin to virulence in agriculturally relevant plant-pathogen interactions."

Research focuses on the development of potato varieties important for the irrigated production of the western U.S., with an emphasis on varieties with long tubers and russet skin. This market class of potato comprised 85% of potato production in the western states of Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington in 2010 (National Agricultural Statistics Service, Potatoes 2010 Summary, September 2011) and is used for the production of frozen potato products such as French fries, as well as for fresh consumption as baking potatoes. The targets for resistance breeding will be the major diseases and pests that detrimentally impact potato production in the western United States, as well as newly emerging pest and disease threats. Several of the diseases and pests that plague western potato production are problematic for all U.S. potato producers. Therefore, potato germplasm and varieties with enhanced resistance originating from our program also will benefit potato producers outside the western United States. Over the next 5 years, the research objectives of our program are:   Objective 1: Develop enhanced potato germplasm and varieties for the most important market classes for the western United States, with emphasis on recurrent and emerging disease and pest resistance (late blight, Potato mop top virus, Potato leafroll virus, Potato virus Y, emerging cyst nematodes, and Zebra Chip), reduced sugar and acrylamide accumulation, reduced production inputs (nitrogen and water), and enhanced nutritional qualities (vitamin C and protein).  Objective 2: Devise marker-assisted selection (MAS) protocols to accelerate breeding for resistance to recurrent and emerging pathogens and pests (Potato virus Y, Potato leafroll virus, and potato cyst nematode) that impact the western United States.   Objective 3: Characterize foliar and tuber responses of potato varieties to infection by newly identified strains of Potato virus Y (PVY), and identify new sources of resistance to these new strains."

Although the actual cause is still unknown, determining the totalirradiation dose is invaluable to ensure the products are processed within the safe limits. Among the methods establishedfor the detection of irradiated foods, analysis of 2-alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBs) with GC-MS and analysis of cellulosicand carbonate radicals with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy serve as the most promising approachesto determine the irradiation history in pet food products. The goal of the proposed research is to develop GC-MS and EPRtechniques coupled to quantify the formation of specific irradiation markers and to determine the total amount ofirradiation treatment in pet foods and treats. We will carry out the project in two parts: the first three years will bededicated to development and validation of testing methods; the last two years will be the comparison and field-testing ofthe validated protocols for evaluation of the irradiation history in pet food products. In the first part of the project pet foodproducts, including chicken jerky treats, sweet potato treats, dog chews (beer, lamb), bones, hoofs and pig ears, will beirradiated from 0.1-75 kGy with either a Cesium-137 source and electron beam (e-beam). The formation and stability ofvarious 2-ACBs (i.e., 2-DCB, 2-TCB, 2-TDCB) will be evaluated using GC-MS techniques based on our previous worksin collaboration with Vet-LIRN and USDA labs. In parallel, formation and stability of carbonic and cellulosic radicalswill be evaluated by using EPR analysis in both low mobility and high mobility environments. Complementary to EPRmeasurements, irradiation-specific DNA damage will also be investigated by using qPCR analysis. The analytical andphysical methods will be validated for different product formulations with varying lipid composition, moisture content,presence of glycerin, vegetables, phytochemicals etc., and extraction methods, such as hexane extraction, solid phaseextraction (SPE), solid phase microextraction (SPME), soxhlet extraction. The chemical and thermal stabilities of thespecific irradiation markers will be analyzed over a temperature range (20-80 °C) and at least one year of storage at roomtemperature. In the second part of the project, validated protocols will be tested on commercial irradiated pet foodproducts available in the market. Eventually, we will compare and contrast the results obtained from physical andanalytical techniques. Overall, at the end of the project we will propose validated and tested protocols, which can be usedas standardized techniques to quantify the irradiation doses in various pet food products."

The process of domestication is essential for producing nutritious foods that can be grown, harvested, stored and eaten. It is an interactive process, with humans transporting and cultivating desirable species, thus creating the base of the food chain and a great diversity of plant forms. The common potato, for example, was domesticated over 7,000 years ago in the high Andes and is now the third most important crop in the world, comprising over 4,500 varieties. And although domestication has occurred and been studied in hundreds of species, only a few plants native to North America were ever domesticated and none of those are from west of the Mississippi. Recent evidence, however, suggests that a novel potato species, known as the Four Corners Potato (Solanum jamesii Torr.) was manipulated by ancient people sometime during the last 12,000 years. The tubers might have been an important food and energy source because of their nutritional qualities, reliable productivity and ability to persist in the soil. Furthermore, populations of this species now occupy atypical habitats among and within the great pueblos of the Southwest, evidence that indigenous farming practices included this species. Therefore, a collaborative archaeological and biological approach is well-suited to provide insight on the initial stages (use, transport and manipulation) in the domestication process. In the broader context, detecting these stages will challenge understanding of foraging strategies and a long-established scientific paradigm regarding agricultural origins and food choices among hunter-gatherers in North America by identifying the Four Corners as a hitherto unknown center of plant domestication. There are no other places in North America that can claim such a long heritage with a local food. Dr. Lisbeth Louderback, Natural History Museum of Utah (University of Utah) and Dr. Bruce Pavlik, Red Butte Garden and Arborteum (University of Utah), along with colleagues at the USDA Potato Genebank, Ohio Northern University, and Utah Din Bikyah, will test the hypothesis that tubers of a native potato (Solanum jamesii Torr.) were used, transported, and manipulated sometime during the Holocene in the American Southwest. Use will be characterized by examining the microscopic residues of potato starch that persist on groundstone tools from archaeological sites in the Four Corners region. Genetic and population techniques will be used to identify the unique signatures of transport from one place to another in the ancient world. The evidence for possible manipulation will be gathered using chemical and physiological analyses, in addition to genetic markers, to detect selection for taste, cold tolerance and the loss of tuber dormancy. Finally, the fading traditions of the Four Corners potato, kept alive into the 21st Century by the very last generation of knowledgeable stewards, will be documented. Tended only in a few fields by Native Americans and pioneer descendants, this project hopes to generate a new interest and a new sense of stewardship for this remarkable plant species.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying Phytophthora pathogenesis and, based on this knowledge, develop durable resistance in potato and other important crops. As such, this project will not only provide insight into basic biology of plant-pathogen interactions but also directly benefit US Agriculture. Broader impacts of this project include providing interdisciplinary training to postdoctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduate students on cutting-edge technologies of genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology. It will also reach out to stakeholders, such as potato growers, by informing them with the latest findings and technologies on developing disease resistance in crops.This project is funded jointly by NSF and by NIFA/USDA.Phytophthora employs a large arsenal of virulence proteins, called effectors, to facilitate infection. Directly manipulating plant cellular processes, effectors play an essential role in the arms race with the hosts. An overall understanding of effector functions and the molecular mechanisms underlying their diversification and adaptation is critical to implement durable resistance. This project is based on the exciting discovery that a large number of Phytophthora effectors contain tandem repeats of a conserved structural module, which tolerates a high level of sequence flexibility. Using a combination of genetic, molecular biology, and biochemical approaches, this project will test the hypothesis that this conserved module may serve as a basic building block to enable effector evolution for novel activities and thereby contributing to virulence. Furthermore, plant defense mechanism targeting this conserved module may enable effective resistance against the destructive Phytophthora diseases. The goals of this project are: 1) elucidating the role of this conserved structural module in Phytophthora effector function and evolution; and 2) identifying resistance genes that recognize this conserved structure of Phytophthora effectors from wild potato species. The outcome of this project will make major advancement in the fundamental understanding of Phytophthora diseases. This project is translational because the resistance genes identified from wild potato accessions may be incorporated into elite varieties in order to confer resistance to late blight. These genes could also be used to confer sustainable resistance to a broad variety of Phytophthora species.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most crops grow from true seeds, potatoes are vegetatively propagated and multiplied for several years in the field. Without proper management, disease incidence in potato can rise to devastating levels within a few years. PVX and PVY are significant viruses that gravely impact potato yield and marketability, and economically impact producers. The global spread of necrotic PVY strains has created new challenges for producers. There is an urgent need to advance the knowledge of genes in potato responding to virus disease. The overarching, long- term goal is to improve potato resistance to PVX and PVY infection. This research will uncover the mechanisms of how plants can respond to virus stress and adapt to challenging environments. This research will investigate a key set of stress response genes that protect plants against drought and virus infection. This research will also explore how a set of proteins known as BiPs suppress disease and determine how these can be used to provide protection against virus infection. We will use this information to improve potato production strategies and effective breeding practices. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central hub for responses to adverse environmental challenges in plants such as virus infection, heat, chemical, osmotic, and salt stress. The physiological consequences of prolonged low-level ER stress include constrained plant development and productivity, whereas chronic stress can result in death and crop losses. Three well known monitoring/sensing pathway use the transcription factors bZIP60, bZIP28 and/or bZIP17 to activate cellular adaptive responses. They coordinate the transcription of molecular chaperones, including the ER lumen binding protein (BiP). It is well known that Arabidopsis plants overexpressing certain BiP isoforms display greater tolerance to virus infections and heat and osmotic stresses. The central hypothesis motivating the project is that bZIP60, bZIP28, and bZIP17 differentially up-regulate expression of BiP isoforms that ameliorates ER stress and cell death regulation in solanaceous plants, such as potato and tobacco. The research team will test a model in which ER stress sensors and BiP isoforms are engaged in N. benthamiana and potato to provide cellular protection against virus infection.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the actual cause is still unknown, determining the totalirradiation dose is invaluable to ensure the products are processed within the safe limits. Among the methods establishedfor the detection of irradiated foods, analysis of 2-alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBs) with GC-MS and analysis of cellulosicand carbonate radicals with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy serve as the most promising approachesto determine the irradiation history in pet food products. The goal of the proposed research is to develop GC-MS and EPRtechniques coupled to quantify the formation of specific irradiation markers and to determine the total amount ofirradiation treatment in pet foods and treats. We will carry out the project in two parts: the first three years will bededicated to development and validation of testing methods; the last two years will be the comparison and field-testing ofthe validated protocols for evaluation of the irradiation history in pet food products. In the first part of the project pet foodproducts, including chicken jerky treats, sweet potato treats, dog chews (beer, lamb), bones, hoofs and pig ears, will beirradiated from 0.1-75 kGy with either a Cesium-137 source and electron beam (e-beam). The formation and stability ofvarious 2-ACBs (i.e., 2-DCB, 2-TCB, 2-TDCB) will be evaluated using GC-MS techniques based on our previous worksin collaboration with Vet-LIRN and USDA labs. In parallel, formation and stability of carbonic and cellulosic radicalswill be evaluated by using EPR analysis in both low mobility and high mobility environments. Complementary to EPRmeasurements, irradiation-specific DNA damage will also be investigated by using qPCR analysis. The analytical andphysical methods will be validated for different product formulations with varying lipid composition, moisture content,presence of glycerin, vegetables, phytochemicals etc., and extraction methods, such as hexane extraction, solid phaseextraction (SPE), solid phase microextraction (SPME), soxhlet extraction. The chemical and thermal stabilities of thespecific irradiation markers will be analyzed over a temperature range (20-80 °C) and at least one year of storage at roomtemperature. In the second part of the project, validated protocols will be tested on commercial irradiated pet foodproducts available in the market. Eventually, we will compare and contrast the results obtained from physical andanalytical techniques. Overall, at the end of the project we will propose validated and tested protocols, which can be usedas standardized techniques to quantify the irradiation doses in various pet food products."
