Additionally, concerns over environmental quality in many areas of the country warrant a shift to more resource-efficient farming practices. Forage legumes have the potential to improve on-farm nutrient cycling, nutrient management, soil health, and enhance pasture nutritive value. Moreover, introducing legumes may result in decreased soil erosion due to utilization of improved grazing methods required to enhance the persistence of legumes. Rotational grazing, for example, reduces soil-erosive potential and provides more uniform distribution of nutrients through animal excretion. Despite obvious advantages of systems containing forage-legume components, research questions for introducing legumes are as follows: (1) What are cost-effective establishment methods for selected annual and perennial legume species (2) What is the long-term persistence of perennial and annual legume species (3) Is the inclusion of annual and perennial legumes into grazing systems cost-effective and environmentally sustainable in the light of current synthetic N fertilizer prices and other external farm inputs We seek to answer these questions simultaneously by initiating three separate studies on these subjects and will also incorporate an outreach component. While these projects will be conducted independently from each other, they complement each other by providing key information to stakeholders."

Growers and processors rank the diseases caused by these pathogens as a top threat to production and long-term viability, especially to Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae group vegetables (cucumber, pumpkin, squash, melon, tomato, pepper, eggplant) and most recently Fabaceae group vegetables (lima, snap and wax beans). Recent losses have become so large (individual growers have reached $2 million) that the economic viability of the vegetable industries in many states is at risk and a larger, coordinated multi-state research effort is needed. Researchers in Michigan and California will collaborate with industry partners to achieve these goals through a multi-disciplinary effort. Sub-objectives include developing fast method to detect and quantify pathogens in plant, soil, and irrigation water using PCR-based technology, developing novel production strategies (appropriate cover/rotational crops, biofumigants), identifying cultivars with genetic tolerance or growth habits that reduce disease, and optimizing the efficacy of fungicidal products (identifying effective active ingredients, optimal application, timing). Researchers linked with processors, packers, extension agents, crop consultants, and growers will deliver the research advances to the field via laboratory open houses, newsletters, and field meetings. The rate of adopting project recommendations will be measured. Through these activities, this project will be further integrated into multi-functional research and education activities that address complex pest management priorities."

We have developed and are field-testing the first transgenic American chestnut trees expressing a resistance-enhancing transgene, oxalate oxidase. The RFA question addressed:  Is there an effect above and beyond what might occur with an organism that has similar traits, but was developed using other technologies  To make this comparison, we will examine ectomycorrhizal colonization, insect herbivory, tree growth, photosynthesis rates, and leaf litter decomposition among our transgenic American chestnut trees relative to a standard panel of hybrid chestnut trees produced by traditional breeding techniques, wild-type American chestnut trees, and timber-type Chinese chestnut trees. Two different field conditions will be examined, open orchards and stands thinned to simulate commercial shelterwood cuts. The overarching hypothesis is that there will be no significant difference between the genetically engineered trees and similar trees produced by conventional breeding. This project represents an initial phase of research that examines the effects of transgenes in juvenile trees on the important ecological components listed above. The next phase of research would include additional studies on pollen drift and nut viability when the trees mature. The American chestnut is an  American heritage  tree because of its importance to our country's history, society, and environment. Therefore this research could lead to a unique forest restoration program. Another important outcome will be a methods paper giving regulators tools for evaluating the impact of other genetically engineered trees on mycorrhizal fungi, insect herbivory, and tree growth."

In Wisconsin we have developed the foundation for biointensive IPM education. We are now proposing to develop specific educational tools which will enable growers to integrate biointensive IPM strategies into existing production systems. Wisconsin fruit and vegetable growers are particularly vulnerable to FQPA since risk calculations are higher for crops that are consumed directly rather than as processed products. The processing sector has undergone rapid consolidation in the past decade, leaving only two locally-owned processors in the state. Other than on-farm processing, apple growers have no processing options. Also, given the small acreage of fruit and vegetable crops as compared to grains or pasture in Wisconsin, they represent a small market and hence there is little incentive for agrochemical companies to pursue registration of pesticide alternatives, which requires costly risk assessment studies. . The overall momentum of the eco-potato and eco-fruit projects has been extremely strong as many things have been accomplished such as the continuation of the marketing effort, enhancements of the Collaboration standards, improvements of resistance management protocols, database implementation, grant coordination and expansion of the use and development of educational tools for growers. We have worked with numerous faculty, industry representatives, potato and other commodity organizations, and environmental organizations to export the agricultural model for targeted and industry-wide change. In Wisconsin, this work is expanding to other vegetable crops, such as carrots, peppers, beans and peas. Furthermore, we have enhanced the ecological portions of the Collaboration by working with national and local environmental organizations and expanding our research with University of Wisconsin faculty by involving their expertise, research and education into the project. We need to maintain this strength while exporting the model of industry-wide agricultural changes through the use of policy and communication efforts. The University of Wisconsin is an appropriate site for this project because of the proven capacity to complete this project; the talent of its faculty, staff and students; its long history of commitment to outreach; and the vulnerability of Wisconsin growers to further restrictions on pesticide use. The UW is able to play a unique coordinating role between state and federal agencies, non-profit organizations, and private businesses to attain the project objectives."

The general public is becoming increasingly concerned about pesticide residues in food, toxic effects of chemicals on non-target organisms, and environmental contamination. Developing and evaluating alternative practices that are ecologically sound, economically feasible, and acceptable to growers will be a high priority. This project will achieve these goals by: 1) developing and evaluating microbial pest control agents and botanical products for control of insect pests and plant pathogens on vegetable and specialty crops, such as collard, cucumber, squash, and edamame edible soybean; 2) developing integrated pest management practices for leafy greens in South Carolina that reduce losses to bacterial diseases, and 3) evaluating cucurbit rootstocks for resistance or immunity to Fusarium wilt and for use in seedless watermelon production. These objectives will be achieved through carefully planned research projects carried out at Clemson University's Coastal Research and Education Center in Charleston, SC, at the Calhoun Field Laboratory organic farm in Clemson, SC, and in grower fields throughout the state. Scientists at Clemson University already have identified many insect viruses and botanical materials for testing against pests. Data will be analyzed with appropriate statistical techniques, and results will be published in refereed journals and communicated to Extension agents and growers. All approaches emphasize conservation of indigenous biological control agents and sustainable agriculture. This project will immediately focus on research and technology transfer for developing sound pest management options."

The resulting forecasts will be delivered through web-based systems and will be available to growers on a daily update basis. Risk forecasts can improve crop quality while at the same time reducing fungicide use by allowing growers to improve the timing of fungicide applications. Our goals in reducing fungicide use are of increasing product quality, limiting expenditures, and reducing the amount of chemical released to the environment. We will examine and quantify the accuracy, economic and environmental impacts, and usability of crop disease risk forecasts at both the synoptic and mesoscale (different weather forecasting scales) in the various regions of the U.S. By selecting three very different crop species (peanut, barley, potato) each heavily dependent upon fungicide sprays for the prevention, avoidance, and management of disease in various regions of the country (southeast, northern Great Plains, Great Lakes region), we plan to capture the overall potential of such forecasting systems for widespread use in the U.S. New technologies in the form of improved National Weather Service forecasts (since 2004) and access to high performance computer workflows give us the opportunity to exploit these advances funded through large government technology grants (the LEAD project alone cost $11.5 million) for the benefit of both major and minor agricultural commodity groups. The ultimate goal of any forecast system is reduction of uncertainty that can negatively influence decision making by users. In the case of disease risk forecasting for agriculture, decisions by the target group of users can negatively impact our food supply, environment, and economy by increasing use of pesticides. Increasing accessibility to forecast information through free, thoroughly tested forecast services in the web environment has the potential to dramatically decrease uncertainty in a variety of crop systems. In this project we examine three crops in three regions of the country, but the implications of the project's results are much more far reaching. Many crop diseases have similar meteorological triggers based on temperature and moisture requirements that may be mined from available forecasts. For a number of years, growers, stakeholders , commodity associations, crop consultants and land grant specialists have been requesting disease risk prediction models for all the major crops in the U.S. through Pest Management Strategic Plans. The public availability of weather forecasts and the improved infrastructure to promote the use of these forecasts make this the time to examine usefulness of forecasting as a national priority in agriculture."

Indonesia also suffers from simialr problems and in Tahiti production is now greatly reduced. Political instability also has an effect on agricultural production. The ability of Hawaii growers to produce a consistant supply of high quality vanilla will help to stabilize the market. Vanilla production holds high potential since a fairly large amount of vanilla can be produced in a relatively small area, characteristic of Hawaii's agriculture. This makes this an ideal project for displaced sugar cane workers and others interested in growing a small crop or agrotourism crop. It is also a crop that will greatly compliment locally produced macadamia, coffee, and cocoa. It is clearly one of the more high potential crops for diversified agriculture in Hawaii."

While largely ignored, soil animals like earthworms, ants, and rodents are ubiquitous and vertically mix the soils they inhabit. Soil mixing, the PIs propose, has far reaching impacts on the rates of mineral and carbon cycles because soils are defined by steep vertical gradients in the concentrations, compositions and dynamics of minerals and organic matter. Whereas weathering is most intense at or near soil surface, weathering susceptible primary minerals are more abundant nearer to underlying parent materials. Organic matter is most abundant at the soil surface, but minerals stabilizing the carbon are more abundant in the depth. Earthworms, by vertically mixing soils, would substantially reduce the limiting conditions by transporting primary minerals to the soil surface and organic matter to depth and thus may accelerate the release of inorganic nutrients from mineral weathering and the sequestration of organic carbon in soils. The proposed research employs a well-characterized earthworm invasion chronosequence in a National Forest in Minnesota to address the sustainable managements of national forests under the threat of exotic earthworm species. The PIs will test the hypothesis by: (1) measuring depth profiles of elemental, mineralogical and organic matter properties in soils that vary with earthworm species composition and abundance, (2) calculating vertical mixing rates from depth profiles of atmospherically fall-out radionuclides activities, (3) quantifying mineral weathering rates from captured soil solutes and changes to mineral properties, (4) quantifying organo-mineral complexation rates and the turnover times of organic matter and lastly the rates of carbon sequestration."

It can infect cucumber, melon, squash, pumpkin, tomato, pepper, eggplant, lima, snap and wax bean crops, and has recently been found to infect Fraser fir, a Christmas tree crop. Michigan is the number 1 producer of pickling cucumber and squash and ranks among the top 10 in the USA for the production of fresh market cucumber, snap bean, bell pepper, pumpkin and fresh market tomato. Michigan cultivates nearly 83,000 acres of Phytophthora-susceptible vegetables worth $148 million and 7,600 acres of Fraser fir worth $10.6 million. Phytophthora can be easily spread across and within agricultural regions via water. Phytophthora management is complicated by its large host range and lack of known disease resistance in vegetables. Phytophthora can last for 10 or more years in soil and it is common for growers to experience complete crop loss in some fields. Some strains of Phytophthora have mutated to become resistant to key fungicides and have colonized an estimated 25% of the acreage in the Michigan growing region. Disease outbreaks occur yearly and recent losses have become so large (up to $32.5 million) that the economic viability of these Michigan industries is at risk. This project seeks to reduce losses suffered by Michigan growers and stakeholders by developing integrated management strategies that emphasize cultural methods and environmentally friendly practices. Research will include investigating ways to limit the spread of Phytophthora; identifying and developing cultivars that are resistant to Phytophthora disease; investigating soil amendments, mulches, crop rotation and water management as new techniques for managing Phytophthora; and testing fungicides, biological control agents and new chemistries for disease control. Phytophthora management recommendations for growers will be developed from research results and demonstrated in on-farm trials and presented at extension meetings."

Vegetables are important food and cash crops in Georgia with 34 different vegetable crops produced in the state and a farm gate value of more than $828 million in 2006. Georgia leads the nation in production of fresh-market cucumbers, squash, and watermelon, and is among the top four states in production of bell pepper, cantaloupes, and snap beans. Phytophthora blight, caused by Phytophthora capsici, has become a devastating disease in recent years in the production of watermelon, bell pepper, squash, cucumber, and several other vegetable crops in Georgia. The efficacy of current strategies for management of Phytophthora blight is limited. No conventional measure has shown to provide consistent and effective suppression of the disease when environmental conditions favor the development of the disease. While fungicides containing the active ingredient mefenoxam provide some level of control of P. capsici, the efficacy is impaired by the presence of mefenoxam-resistant strains of the pathogen. Due to the destructive nature of the disease and lack of efficient control measures, growers are often forced to abandon production of certain vegetable crops once the field is severely infested. Development of alternative or complementary approaches for effective management of the disease is highly desirable. This project is to evaluate new and/or alternative disease management approaches and integrate the most promising ones for more effective management of Phytophthora blight on vegetables. The objectives of this proposal are: (1) To evaluate the efficacy and application method of new and promising chemical and biological fungicides for control of Phytophthora blight. (2) To screen Brassica spp. and other cover crops that produce general biocides for control of Phytophthora capsici. (3) To evaluate the efficacy of systemic acquired plant resistance (SAR) in control of Phytophthora blight on vegetables. (4) To determine host range, genetic diversity, and survival of P. capsici in Georgia. (5) To develop and implement best management strategies integrating cover crops, chemical and biological control agents, SAR inducers, and resistant or tolerant genotypes in management of the disease. Successful completion of this project will permit the development of environmentally sound strategies which would, significantly reduce losses resulted from Phytophthora capsici in vegetable production; maintain safe food supply; and increase the sustainability of the vegetable industries in Georgia and the U.S."

Two new peach populations, each containing about 200 progeny of four diverse peach parents, will be used in conjunction with another fully characterized population (of about 160 progeny) to dissect the genetic inheritance of these traits and to locate genes or DNA fragments associated with them. The peach parents are `Dr. Davis', and `Carson' (standard canning peach cultivars), and `F8,1-42' and '98,13-17' (exotic breeding lines with almond background). New recently developed instrumentation will be used to measure the target traits to link them with molecular markers for the genes controlling them in peach genome. New high throughput technologies will be employed to obtain large amount of DNA sequences of `Dr. Davis' and `F8,1-42', discover and characterize single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA markers in all progeny populations that are associated with target traits for breeding peach cultivars with improved quality.

The plants developed in this project will allow the future production of unlimited numbers of nonidentical mutant lines. The collection will be made available to the community as a resource for genetic and functional genomic studies. To facilitate identification, characterization and validation of gene and mutant phenotypes, molecular and bioinformatics tools will be developed. Molecular and phenotypic data will be stored in a database. Characteristics that make diploid strawberry an ideal fruit crop for genomic studies include: small genome size, short generation time, efficient genetic transformation technologies to generate the collection, and facile vegetative and seed propagation. Comparative bioinformatics analysis and databases constructed for the project will facilitate strawberry gene annotation and link results across rosaceous fruit crops (e.g., apple, pear, cherry, peach, almond, raspberry). The generation and mapping of a knockout mutant collection of strawberry will have a significant impact on functional genomics research and gene discovery in fruit crops. Comparative genomic studies and gene characterization performed with homologs of genes identified in this project will expand its impact to other fruit species and contribute to future improvement of fruit quality, health benefits and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress. The phenotypic database and seed stocks from mutant lines will be made available to the scientific community via the Strawberry Biological Resource Center (SBRC) created at VBI and mapped gene regions will be placed on a public database [the Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR)]. This will provide an important resource for scientists to leverage the knowledge gained from this proposal to other crops."

For decades, unpredictable episodic outbreaks of aphids and the diseases caused by viruses they vector have severely reduced yields of pea and lentil crops in this region. Adapted dry pea and lentil varieties lack resistance to the two most prevalent viruses, Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) and Bean leaf roll virus (BLRV), each vectored by the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Growers, therefore, typically either prophylactically apply the organophosphate insecticide dimethoate to suppress aphids even when the realized risk of virus infection is low, or they avoid spraying and instead leave the crop open to catastrophic loss when infection risk is high. We address this problem with three integrated research and extension outreach components. The first develops IPM decision tools for producers. These include deriving a virus risk assessment system for pea and lentil based on monitoring immigrating aphids for virus (using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction based detection of viral RNA) and incorporating meteorological data to predict the intensity and timing of aphid flight activity. This first component also develops economic injury levels for direct aphid injury as well as indirect injury caused by the aphid-vectored viruses, and tests alternatives to dimethoate for reduction of indirect injury when indicated. The second component accelerates ongoing efforts to breed resistance to BLRV and PEMV in adapted pea and lentil varieties. These varieties will reduce the need to treat aphids for one or both viruses. The third component educates producers about the IPM tools developed and engages these producers in project activities and product development. The principal investigators include virologists, breeders, entomologists and extension educators from two universities in Idaho and Washington and the USDA-ARS. Results and IPM recommendations will be disseminated via the world wide web, grower newsletters and listserves and workshops. The virus management decision support system will be maintained with industry funds under the guidance of the PD after the project's completion. The project addresses issues covered in the Pest Management Strategic Plan for Pulse Crops. The project also directly addresses RAMP program goals to enhance the development and implementation of innovative IPM strategies for multi-crop food and fiber production systems on an area-wide or landscape scale."

With only 1,664,934 hectares of total land area, an overwhelming 47.99% and 46.94% of this area is managed for conservation and agriculture, respectively. Agriculture shares many boundaries with natural areas, having very little buffer within this confined island setting. From the time when humans first colonized these islands; many ecosystem changes have resulted from anthropogenic activities and exotic weed introductions often associated with agriculture. Despite these influences, native and contemporary civilizations view nature conservation and agriculture as congruent sustainable activities in land management. This project operates with the mission of ensuring coexistence between these two land uses. While many research initiatives appropriately strive for long-range goals and future technologies, this project will address a wide range of contemporary situations with applied research and extension for developing readily adoptable and cost-effective outputs in weed management. In the first objective, rapid-response strategies will be developed for suppressing exotic pasture grasses that occupy abandoned pastures being transitioned back to native forest ecosystems. In the second objective, native plant species utilized in conservation will be evaluated for potential utility as cover crops in agriculture. Finally, the third objective is an integrated multi-discipline project to promote and demonstrate an integrated pest management system that stabilizes agriculture production areas to become more resilient to pest invasions. While this system will not be demonstrated with native species, it will utilize a scientifically-characterized legume sunn hemp (Crotolaria juncea), which is not considered to be an invasive weed in the Hawaii Weed Risk Assessment protocol. The outcomes of this project will create opportunities to increase diligence in land management styles that will nullify current extreme detriments resulting from invasive weeds and future conflicts between conservation and agriculture."

In 1970, cash receipts from vegetables, melons, fruits and tree nuts were just under $5 billion. Currently, cash receipts from these same crops are approximately $31 billion and they will exceed $42 billion over the coming decade. As cash receipts from the sector have expanded, the contribution to overall U.S. farm income has also grown. Given the reliance on farm income as a measure of the health of the agricultural sector, it is increasingly important to have the ability to make projections about the fruits and vegetables sector. This will allow for more robust projections for farm income, which are particularly important given the current financial pressures in agriculture. The importance of modeling fruits and vegetables extends beyond the producer. It is also important to assess impacts on the consumer side. In the last 20 years, per capita consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables has increased 30%. Currently, the average consumer spends approximately 17% of their food at home budget on fruits and vegetables. The market structure of the fruit and vegetables sector is very complex. The number of different products, production regions, import/export policies, market orders and delivery system issues are only a handful of the difficulties faced in examining the sector. At the retail level, cross commodity effects must be taken into account. As a result, changes or adjustments in the market for a particular commodity will have impacts on other commodity. NFAPP and FAPRI at Missouri are working together in an effort to address these issues."

Correlation between nitrogen fixation ability to other plant characteristics will provide clues to characteristics important for modern varieties. Varieties developed with higher nitrogen fixation will be beneficial to all growers and may reduce the need or amount of fertilizer applications in all systems. Although common beans are not recognized as major nitrogen fixers when compared to other long-season legumes, they do have the ability to fix a large proportion of their nitrogen needs from the atmosphere.

This proposal will also use genetics and molecular markers to study specific traits for breeding optimal quality beets and the introgression of traits of new sources of sugar beet cyst nematode resistance. Quality has specific meaning in the sugar beet industry, that of reducing sucrose loss during processing and recovery.

The consumption of a plant-based or bioactive compound rich diet has been associated with a reduced risk of chronic human illnesses such as certain types of cancers, inflammation, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, developing whole foods rich in bioactive food components that optimize well-being is the most reasonable and logical approach to improving the health of `at risk' Americans. One approach towards increasing the dietary intake of antioxidants is to increase the levels of these bioactive compounds in fruit and vegetables. Identifying the genetic and environmental factors that control the synthesis and accumulation of these compounds is a necessary step towards a dietary approach for management of some of the nation's important health problems. It is also important to evaluate the chemistry (isolation, identification and structural elucidation) and biology (in vitro and in vivo bioactivities, mechanisms of action, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of bioactive compounds for their potential health benefits to humans. Pecans and other nuts have received particular attention because of their high content in bioactive, health-promoting phytochemicals, including monounsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, phenolics, minerals, and fibers. However, little is known about how to optimize the health benefits of pecans. This research will examine the cardiovascular health benefits of pecan tannins from different varieties by characterizing the inhibition of human LDL oxidation and antiplatelet aggregation properties and the possible mechanisms involved. Neither surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy achieves long-term remission for many breast cancer patients. New dietary therapeutic approaches, in combination with standard chemotherapies are needed. The resulting data will provide valuable new information about synergistic interactions among standard chemotherapy with citrus limonin to minimize the side effects of chemotherapy. Agronomic strategies may significantly modify and/or improve the phytochemical concentration and profiles in cool season crops (onion, spinach and carrots). These crops are economically important in south-west Texas markets with a total combined value of over $100 million in 2006. The effect on yield and quality of cool season crops remains largely unknown when grown under precision irrigation with nitrogen fertilization using slow release nitrogen compounds."

Project Impact Historically, Native Americans developed and utilized natural wild plant preparations(as foods and medicines)that sustained healthy lifestyles, ward off infection and disease handed down and preserved only through oral teaching (language)from generation to generation by Tribal Elders. This project addresses the high priority health maintenance and longevity concerns of tribal nations,need to preserve and validate traditional ecological knowledge about indigenous plant resources. Our bioexploration approach is designed to enable and empower tribal leadership and community members with hands-on, experiential science discovery about their own indigenous traditional resources,to link tribal youth to the knowledge and traditions of the elders. 2. Project Justification Native Americans have used endemic plants for subsistence foods, fibers and medicinal applications. Native Americans developed and farmed corn, beans and squash which they traded along the river systems (Calloway, 1999). Other plant staples included berries (chokecherries, juneberries, currents, buffaloberries and cranberries), wild turnips, wild ginger, wild onions, pink-flowered plant. Previously demonstrated, in the United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) Tribal Colleges Grant (On the fringe of survival: How the wild environment gives native berries the edge for protection of Tribal people's health), wild berries conferred significant phytomedicinal benefits to Native Americans. These wild native berry species (chokecherry, buffaloberry, juneberry, and cranberrybush), demonstrated significant capacity to counteract the symptoms associated with Type II diabetes and the broader pathological condition known as metabolic syndrome (Kraft et al. 2008). The above-noted publication, revealed particularly-potent hyperglycemic properties from the cranberrybush extracts, and a subsequent, in-depth set of experiments on this berry species is now underway (Kraft et al., in preparation). This new proposal assesses potential mechanisms of bioactive activity of traditional medicinal plants, indigenous to the Upper Missouri River region, their novel benefits for human health. This project will recruit youth to acquire hands-on, experiential science training using native plant materials, and forge linkages between Tribal elders and the younger generations leading to enhanced preservation, appreciation, and knowledge validation for native resources. c) expected results Outcomes from this project, in terms of scientific results and social interaction,from the first stages of youth and elder collaboration to initiate the project and streamline the selected list of target plants. Based on our recent past investigations on native endemic species in the Upper Missouri River region, we have strong confidence that the experiments will yield previously undocumented, insights into the bioactive mechanisms and health value of these plant resources."

The first objective is to develop detection methods for residues of two commonly allergenic foods - buckwheat and pistachio. This group has previously develop detection methods for peanut, milk, egg, other tree nuts, soybeans, shrimp, clam, mustard, and lupine so these two additional methods help to complete the set needed by the food industry. The industry can uses to determine if its cleaning practices are sufficient or whether the use of shared equipment presents potential hazards to allergic consumers. The new buckwheat and pistachio assays will give food processors sensitive and specific techniques to detect inadvertent contamination of their raw materials and finished products with residues of either of these allergenic foods. Ultimately, the antibodies used in the pistachio detection method may be useful in the development of a multi-plex tree nut ELISA as we already have antibodies for walnut, almond, hazelnut, pecan, and cashew (but Brazil nut, macadamia nut, and pine nut are also missing). The second objective relates to the refinement of methods for the assessment of the potential allergenicity of genetically modified or other novel foods. These methods are needed to assess the potential risk and prevent the unintended introduction of a major allergen or protein that would likely cause allergic cross-reactions in some consumers. Bioinformatics approaches (computer assisted sequence comparison analysis) have been developed as one of the most important tools to identify potentially allergenic proteins. AllergenOnline is a public database created through the efforts of the Food Allergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP) at the University of Nebraska. The database provides a publicly available, searchable list of protein sequences of known allergens and bioinformatics strategies useful in comparing these sequences to those of novel proteins. FARRP will continue to screen the literature to identify new allergens so that the list can be annually updated. This database is used by academic and government scientists developing genetically engineered and other novel foods, by regulatory officials in many countries, and by the agricultural biotechnology industry in a key step in the overall allergenicity assessment process. As part of this project, we will assess the validity of the search criteria of 35% identity over any 80 amino acid segment as a predictor of allergenicity through serum testing of legume allergic subjects, using allergic sera. IgE-binding proteins will be separated, identified, and compared to known allergens in the database."

The proposed and recently initiated research will explore areas to improve sustainability of various production systems. Some will be organic, others will be conventional production. Several cover crop studies presently underway will be continued. Trials are already underway on two farms. They will be continued through the end of 2008, the termination date for a NE SARE Partnership project that was secured to provide additional support for this work. The focus of cover crop studies will be to reduce weed pressure on cash crops in the rotation and improve soil fertility. Increasing nitrogen production from legumes in an age of increasing energy costs will be a necessity. The OFR coordinator will continue to provide guidance to a county extension educator for a dairy feeding study begun in 2007. The focus of this effort is to demonstrate that through reducing the amount of protein fed lactating dairy cows, animal performance can be maintained and possibly improved while reducing the feeding cost of milking cows. The project is being conducted on ten farms. A Pennsylvania Soybean Promotion board funded project will be continued during 2008 to evaluate when soy stand loss occurs and to learn of the benefits for using soy seed treatments. Stands in marked plots will be sequentially counted to document when loss is occurring. Should results indicate that most loss occurs prior to emergence or early establishment, most likely because of disease, this may indicate a need for increased use of seed treatments or other means to limit the impact of these pests. Supported with a NE SARE Research and Education grant, researchers from Penn State and Rodale Institute will continue a project that seeks more consistent performance for farmers who want to grow heavy cover crops and use the relatively new concept of crop rolling to control them. The OFR program is supporting this project through three on-farm sites in PA, NY, and MD. Proven and experimental practices/treatments will be utilized on these private farms to demonstrate the potential for this technology to reduce or eliminate the use of herbicide in a subsequent corn or soybean crop. The recent large increase in fertilizer prices, especially nitrogen, has prompted strong promotion of several products that are added to N fertilizer to reduce losses to volatilization and leaching. Two on-farm studies will be conducted to complement one being conducted at the experiment station to quantify relative efficiencies of N utilization when urea is treated with commercially available products. This project will likely be repeated in 2009 and 2010. Other areas of research are identified as the on-farm research coordinator continues to discuss production problems and possibilities for collaborative research with producers, county and state Cooperative Extension personnel, PASA organizers, and representatives of other agencies."

Future farming in this region under energy-constrained scenarios must focus on increasing the energetic net gain associated with N inputs. A new class of crops, the pulses (annual grain legumes), are poised to play a major role in diversifying cropping systems in the NGP, due to their inherent profit potential, and due to farmer perceptions of meaningful N contributions to their wheat crops. Area devoted to pea and lentil crops increased several fold in the NGP over the past decade and may increase further. There are two key limitations related to using pulse crops to offset N fertilizer. First, N contributions from pulse crops are difficult to estimate accurately, especially in the short term. It will be important to investigate pulse crop effects in the medium- (and long-) term to better understand their role in conditioning cropping system energy budgets, and especially with respect to changes in soil stasis in the form of embodied soil N supply. The role of pulse crops in conditioning soil organic N stasis is being hotly debated and must move toward resolution. Second, and perhaps more important, some agroecozones within the NGP do not receive sufficiently consistent rainfall to permit annual cropping, and are reliant on fallow - wheat systems. There may be an unmet opportunity to `green' fallow in a more sustainable fashion, with the use of annual legume green manures (LGM), if the balance between soil water use and N contribution can be managed to be energetically and economically favorable. However, optimal tactics for managing this water use - soil N balance are not understood. Unresolved questions relate to tactical tillage (perhaps within reduced till systems), seasonality and duration of LGM growth, and optimal LGM species. The major objective of this study is to determine the energetic and economic worth of legume crop inclusion in semiarid wheat-based cropping systems. Using an energy budget approach we will quantify the potential for offsetting a portion of N fertilizer use, with a special emphasis on using legume green manures in conventional cropping systems. Results from this effort, combined with previous work, will aid producers in adapting their cropping systems to best meet production and ecosystem service goals. Ecosystem services that will be provided are reduced greenhouse gas concentrations, improved soil quality, and improved water quality. Quantification of the `significance' of this research can be estimated with limited precision. For example, it will be possible to chronicle increases in pulse crop and LGM acreage in the NGP (and elsewhere), and not difficult to estimate associated energy savings. Although it would not be known to what degree this particular research project was responsible for enacting this change, the potential impact on agricultural sustainability is very large."

S. However, since 2000, it has been expanding range to the north and east, and now is found in corn as far east as Ohio. Although they are not economic pests in all areas of their expanded range, there is increasing interest in information about monitoring procedures, and economic injury levels for this insect. Previous research on other ear feeding insects indicates that insect injury is a contributing factor to fungal growth and mycotoxin development on the grain, however this relationship has not been examined for the western bean cutworm. There is little published information available to design statistically reliable sampling plans, or identify valid economic thresholds. In the absence of research-based recommendations for western bean cutworms, there is a potential for growers to react to an emerging pest with inappropriate use of insecticides, not based on local conditions as assessed by scouting and use of valid economic thresholds. The research outlined in this proposal is designed to provide that needed information. Results from this project will be published in referee articles, presented at professional society meetings, incorporated into our extension programs, and shared with colleagues through regional technical committees such as NCC 205 and NCERA 201 (of which Hunt and Wright, respectively, are active participants). We will consider conducting a regional teleconference workshop, similar to past workshops on soybean aphid and corn rootworms sponsored by the North Central IPM Center, if there is interest, as another way to transfer from research results from this project to end users across the region. Western bean cutworms were identified by the North Central IPM Center in their August 2006 newsletter as an `IPM issue  which has arisen since the Field Corn Pest Management Strategic Plan (Pike 2002) was published. The Regional USDA Technical committee, NCC 205: Ecology and Management of European Corn Borer and Other Lepidopteran Pests of Corn, identified in its project proposal that western bean cutworm is an increasingly important pest, and is among a group of insects not affected by many Bt corn hybrids which may be favored by the reduction in broad-spectrum insecticide usage. They identify research on insects such as these, as a priority to evaluate if `pest replacement' may occur with widespread use of Bt corn hybrids. This research project addresses all three goals of the NC IPM Competitive Grant program: improve the economic benefits related to the adoption of IPM practices; reduce potential human health risks from pests and the use of pest management practices, and reduce unreasonable adverse environmental effects from pests and use of pest management practices. It is also addresses the Research Needs identified in the National Road Map for IPM; develop economical high-resolution environmental and biological monitoring systems to enhance our capabilities to predict pest incidence, estimate damage, and identify valid action thresholds."

Dry or dry edible beans (DEB) are produced in the U.S. on 1.7 million acres by nearly 11,000 farms with estimated sales at $1.8 billion. Production occurs in fourteen states and includes fifteen different varieties of beans. However, dry bean diseases can dramatically reduce yield, quality of harvested beans and therefore, greatly affect grower profits. White mold in particular is a key pest of dry beans in Michigan. Serious losses can occur when weather conditions are favorable for disease development and disease organisms are present. Except for the driest seasons, 100% of crop acres are at risk and up to 40-50% can be affected, with yield losses as high as 50% occurring within 2 weeks late in the growing season. Under irrigated production in California and the Northwest, losses can be 100%. Intervention with chemical treatments at early flowering suppresses white mold but does not completely eradicate the disease. Generally growers are delighted to obtain 50% suppression of white mold with a single fungicide application but of course, growers also expect to have a yield increase over untreated crops. An additional spray treatment can provide extra protection but more often than not, two applications of current fungicide products for dry bean is cost prohibitive. Identifying a novel fungicide that is cost-effective for two applications would be highly advantageous; especially for use in fields with a history of disease and during periods of prolonged and/or heavy rainfall particularly at time of flowering. Moreover, nearly all labeled fungicides are listed as carcinogens or suspected carcinogens and some have high chronic toxicity. Many are either highly toxic to fish/ aquatic life (Topsin, Blocker 4F, Switch) or have issues of pathogen resistance (Rovral, Endura and Switch). Topsin-M, Rovral and Ronilan are on the California list of  Known Carcinogens and Reproductive Toxicants . Blocker 4F is listed in California as a toxic air contaminant. Due to the serious health and safety issues related to these products, re-registration under the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) could be jeopardized or severe restrictions could be implemented. Hence, growers seek safer, less costly products to effectively control white mold infestations. It is anticipated that EPA registration for most, if not all, of the experimental ingredients will likely include acute toxicity testing and minimal (if any) chronic toxicity trials on animals; i.e., teratogenic and carcinogenic studies. Use of more environmentally friendly products by growers would lower consumer risk. The discovery of alternative chemicals that protect food safety would agree with some of the goals for sustainable agriculture and protect quality of life. Pesticides obtained from renewables and not derived from petrochemicals would also be in the public interest."

Feral hog populations are spreading across the United States with little resistance from the private and public sector, causing considerable damage in their wake. We are suggesting control by a means not currently used in the United States, but has been shown and analyzed elsewhere to be the most cost-effective means of control-baiting with a lethal toxicant. Although feral hogs are protected as a game species in some states, their damage is well-known by those who are in direct contact with them: farmers, ranchers, federal and state wildlife managers, forest managers, city and county municipalities, and other private organizations and citizens. Damage has occurred in agriculture and silviculture and feral hogs represent a means of disease transmission to livestock. Physical damage includes rooting of pastures, forests, vineyards; consumption of crops (milo, corn, wheat, rice, peanuts, and potatoes, etc.); land erosion; and preying upon calves, lambs, and kids. More recently, as the populations increase at an alarming rate, concern has shifted to disease transmission. Feral hogs harbor diseases and parasites that can be transferred to livestock including: foot and mouth disease, pseudorabies, cholera, trichinosis, African swine fever, brucellosis, leptospirosis, salmonellosis, anthrax, ticks, fleas, lice, and various flukes and worms. Many of these diseases could be used in bioterrorism attacks and greatly threaten the livestock industry as a whole. Upon live-capture, tests will be initiated to determine a viable bait formulation that can be tested in the field and in the future be available to consumers as a market bait. The bait will add another tool and technology to a growing problem by supplying the public and private sectors with a cost-effective solution."

Bee disappearances threaten the production of nuts, berries, fruits, and vegetables. We will focus on the relevant ecotoxicology of honey bees with regard to their recent die-off referred to as Colony Collapse Disorder and to the declining health of honey bees in general. Honey bees are exposed to an average of five or more different pesticides in the pollen they collect and to high levels of acaricides in comb wax of their hives. This represents a new high level for pesticide residues in pollen collected by bees and is reflective of materials used in current agricultural practices. We propose to examine the toxicological and behavioral consequences of acute and sublethal pesticide exposures to honey bees from both dietary and in-hive encounters. We will use our data on pollen and comb wax levels to select relevant doses of the commonly encountered neonicotinoid, organophosphate, carbamate and pyrethroid insecticides used on major crops and in-hive as acaricides. We will cooperate with two current projects to provide pesticide residue quantification to further correlate the possible causal role of pesticides in Colony Collapse Disorder. We will determine if pesticides are involved in compromising the honey bee immune system, thereby increasing susceptibility to diseases. We will also determine if combinations of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and common formulation surfactants provide synergism for the most commonly encountered pesticides, and if these result in lower lethal and sublethal levels of toxicity to bees than currently predicted from pesticide labels. We will further determine if some of these sublethal effects modify associative learning in bees, and if they are detected by or modify the normal functioning of the contact chemosensory cells of bees and their resultant behaviors. Focusing on major pesticide and adjuvant exposures will unravel novel directions for maintaining honey bee health, and permit new avenues to safe, selective pesticides for in-hive mite and alternative pest control."

Scientists and stakeholders working with peanut will participate in the development of a strategic plan for an integrated multidisciplinary research approach toward solving major stakeholder and consumer concerns on an international scale. This International Peanut Genome Initiative will strive to develop a better understanding of the peanut genome structure, to apply advances in genomics to enhance crop productivity, increase crop protection from diseases and pests, and improve crop product safety and quality. Coordination among international peanut research communities, plus interaction with other legume genomics communities such as Glycine max and Medicago truncatula, should effect better utilization of limited resources available for research. Establishing collaborative working relations across geographic areas also will enable timely solutions that are needed to ensure an adequate future supply of safe and nutritious peanuts for food, feed, and fuel applications.

Furthermore, as farming practices change, new biotechnologies are adopted, the number of degree-days per season increases with global warming, rate of invasions by exotic species increases, and new crops are introduced (e.g. as feedstocks for biofuels) it is likely that secondary pests or previously innocuous species from within the order will emerge as important pests. There is therefore an ongoing and pressing need to better understand the genetics, evolution and ecology of pest Lepidoptera. Meeting this need is often hindered by significant and well-known difficulties in obtaining satisfactory molecular markers for Lepidoptera. We have devised a technique that uses the power of massively-parallel, next-generation DNA sequencing to identify and assay genetic polymorphisms that we refer to as SIRRL (Sequencing Individuals in Reduced Representation Libraries). SIRRL has the potential to circumvent many of the problems that have limited and frustrated the application of molecular markers to the study of Lepidoptera. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated the soundness of the SIRRL method in principle. In this proposed project we will optimize SIRRL using the European corn borer (ECB) as a test case, including evaluating the utility of SIRRL for both linkage analysis and population genetics studies. Additionally, we will demonstrate its utility in two pest Lepidoptera for which little or no genetic resources are currently available. In addition to development, demonstration, and verification of this new type of marker for use in Lepidoptera, the particular markers generated in this project for the three pest species tested will be of immediate benefit to scientists studying them. Robust, co-dominant markers for ECB will be useful in efforts to map genes involved in resistance to Bt-toxins and to characterize gene flow between geographical populations, as well as between various races. Additionally, we will test the applicability of SIRRL to the western bean cutworm (WBC), a corn pest growing in importance as it invades the Midwest. Genetic markers for WBC will enable application of population-genetics tools to advance our understanding of the range expansion process and to characterize population structure in this species. Finally, we will test SIRRL as a tool to generate markers for Blastobasis repartella, a lepidopteran identified as a potential future pest of switchgrass with no prior genetic characterization. A likely early application of genetic markers in this species will be base-line population genetic structure and gene flow analysis to inform the development of management strategies."

Our long-term goal is to enhance the understanding of the biology of agriculturally important hymenoptera species through genomics. We cannot realize the full potential of the genomic data generated using USDA and other funding sources without integrating the data and providing data mining tools that are easily utilized by biologists and agricultural researchers. This project addresses these informatics needs by incorporating new hymenoptera sequence data into the Hymenoptera Genome Database (HGD), performing computational analyses to identify sequences that are common between species, and developing new software tools for querying and downloading datasets."

It is well known that the ECB consists of multiple population types that vary in a suite of fitness-related characters that determine patterns of gene exchange and outbreak dynamics in field populations. The work that we propose builds on our previous efforts to define the genetic structure of the ECB, and to map the genes that encode these ecologically-relevant phenotypes. Our immediate goal is to characterize the transcriptome of the ECB and to quantify gene transcript abundance. To accomplish this goal, we will use next-generation technology to sequence ECB transcriptomes derived from multiple tissues, developmental stages, and individuals differing in trait values.

Use of nitrogenous fertilizers has both economic and environmental costs. A mutually beneficial association between leguminous (bean-family) plants and a group of nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria collectively called ?rhizobia? enables the use of atmospheric nitrogen by plants. This association results in root nodules where rhizobia bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen for use by the plants and obtain carbon in return. Biological nitrogen fixation in root nodules of agriculturally significant legumes such as soybean can alleviate the use of chemical fertilizers and therefore is of high significance to US agriculture. Understanding the process of root nodule development might enable us to enhance biological nitrogen fixation and/or utilization. The first step is to identify and characterize novel cellular components involved in nodule development. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of recently discovered regulatory RNAs whose role in nodule development is largely unknown. This project aims to identify and characterize the role of selected miRNAs in nodule development by examining when and where they are expressed, what happens if they are mis-expressed, which targets do these miRNAs regulate and what roles those specific targets play during nodule development. Knowledge from the project might enable biotechnological manipulation of nodule development and biological nitrogen fixation and help sustainable production of food grains."

S. have increased concerns of Salmonella contamination, survival, and infectivity in or on products with reduced water activity. These products may become contaminated with Salmonella at one or more stages of pre-harvest, harvest, processing, or storage. The organism does not normally grow in low-moisture environments but some serovars can survive for prolonged periods. Salmonella encounters a myriad of stressful conditions in the food production chain that can trigger specific and general stress-protection systems that render cells more tolerant to stress and promote persistence in the environment or food. One interesting response to stress is the formation of filaments that can reach >100 I?m in length. Much of the basic biology of filamentation is unknown including triggers, production on foods, survival characteristics, and virulence. The formation of Salmonella filaments is significant to food safety because under favorable conditions the filaments will form septa and divide the filament into multiple, typical cells that can impact estimations of pathogen numbers, the effectiveness of intervention practices (i.e., critical control points), and risk assessments. This proposal will study Stress-Induced Filamentous Salmonella (SIFS) on fruits, nuts, and vegetables and specifically determine there: 1.) pathogen load assessments and persistence on foods, 2) formation and characterization, 3) mitigation measures, 4) infectious dose and virulence. This project will provide fundamental information on stress response in Salmonella that impacts persistence on fruits, nuts, and vegetables and define effective harvest and/or production practices that prevent formation or inactivate these stress-induced cells."

The meeting is held at 2-year intervals and for the last 30 years has been the premier forum for announcing and presenting the most compelling and novel scientific discoveries relative to the molecular events that mediate how plants and microbes interact. The meeting content considers both pathogenic and symbiotic associations. Reports will include those relevant to: fungal, bacterial, viral, and nematode pathogens; endophytic interactions; nitrogen-fixing and mycorrhizal symbioses; and even some unusual associations, like parasitic plant-plant interactions. Past Congresses have marked the announcement of seminal research breakthroughs, including but not limited to: the molecular basis of the Rhizobium-legume signaling system; identification of the role that Vir genes play in Agrobacterium T-DNA transfer, cloning and identification of pathogen avr and host resistance genes, Type III secretion system in pathogenic bacteria; molecular fundamentals of the innate immune response; complete genome sequencing of bacterial symbionts and pathogens, viral RNAi gene silencing, whole genome transcript analysis of the infection process; cloning and characterization of the mycorrhizal phosphate transport and symbiosis genes, and practical applications of fundamental knowledge in disease control. The Congress format will consist of international authorities contributing to overview plenary symposia, followed by invited speakers at more specific parallel (concurrent) symposia, and poster presentations. In order to maximize conference time and potential, an integrated conference style is proposed, permitting joint sessions of interest to microbiologists, geneticists, pathologists, biochemists, physiologists, and agronomists. Mornings will be devoted to Plenary Symposia, while in the afternoons concurrent sessions will be held. Poster sessions will take place in the evenings. Although focusing on the fundamental underpinnings of molecular plant-microbe interactions, the meeting will not overlook how fundamental advances can be translated into crop improvement, disease control, enhanced agricultural sustainability, and heightened understanding of plant development. An important and unique function of the MPMI Congresses is to bring together groups of scientists that otherwise do not cross paths. For example, researchers on symbiotic fungi (mycorrhizae) and symbiotic bacteria are both regular participants at MPMI Congresses, which is significant in light of the recent discovery that the same plant genes are involved in both interactions. Another example of interdisciplinary interactions that occur uniquely at the Congresses is between researchers in the areas of microbial/plant and invertebrate/plant interactions - the same class of plant genes that confer gene-for-gene resistance to bacteria and fungi are also involved in resistance to nematodes and aphids."

The repertoire of G-protein components in plants is relatively simple, with the presence of only two possible heterotrimers in Arabidopsis and rice, versus hundreds of possible trimeric combinations in animal systems. However the plant G-protein components are involved in diverse pathways including phytohormone signaling, cell division, ion channel regulation, environment sensing and biotic and abiotic stress responses of plants. These data have led to the hypothesis that the plant G-proteins integrate multiple signals to optimize overall growth and development under any given condition. Most of our knowledge of plant G-proteins comes from studies of gene knock-out mutants in Arabidopsis and a mutation in rice G alpha gene. Pharmacological evidence support the roles of G-proteins in soybean growth and development, defense response, nodulation and nitrogen fixation, however no biochemical or molecular-genetic data exist to date to validate these observations. Our analysis of soybean sequences has identified four G alpha, four G beta&#61472; and six putative G gamma subunits in its genome, predicting ninety-six possible heterotrimeric combinations and making it the most diverse G-protein network known to date in plants.

The bacteria role is to fix the nitrogen necessary for the legume host growth. To establish the symbiosis, the rhizobium must counter the plant defenses including toxic reactive oxygen species. The same molecules involved in plant defense also control the number of bacterial nodules and the extend of their productive useful life. The bacterial machinery that helps coping with the plant defenses is constituted mainly by secreted metallo-enzymes. Rhizobium species have an unusually large number of genes that code for metal transporting ATPases. These transport ions and heavy metals out of the bacteria. We hypothesize that these metal transporters are required to synthesize metal containing proteins essential for the interaction between rhizobia and plants. Consequently, these metal transporters would have a central role in the process of symbiosis likely affecting crop yields. This is relevant since pollutants such us cadmium, mercury, or nickel can easily inhibit these transporters. To study the roles of these enzymes we will use Sinorhizobium meliloti and alfalfa plants as experimental systems. The role of these proteins in nodulation and nitrogen fixation in alfalfa plants will accessed by measuring the plant growth and mass and the presence of these proteins in the bacteria during the plant growth. The metal transported by each particular protein will be determined using biochemical approaches. Finally, their role in metal loading of the secreted proteins and/or maintaining normal metal levels in the rhizobia will be established. Results from these studies will contribute to understanding not only the legume-rhizobium symbiosis, but also the mechanisms of plant defense that are critical during pathogen-plant interaction."

During extension meetings, telephone calls, and visits with the PIs on this project, these stakeholders and the associated commodity boards have expressed concerns over the growing number of weeds that have become difficult to control with glyphosate. Glyphosate has been the primary herbicide used for weed control in these high-value specialty crop systems for decades and this dependence continues to grow. For example, from 2002 to 2007 the proportion of acreage treated with glyphosate increased from 81 to 110% in stonefruit orchards and from 116 to 144% in tree nut crops indicating multiple applications per year in many cases. Similar increases in glyphosate use were noted in citrus orchards during the same period. Loss of this herbicide as an effective weed management tool due to glyphosate-resistant weeds has already begun to have negative economic impacts, based on conversations with growers, managers, and PCAs. The negative impacts will undoubtedly increase with time unless resistance management strategies are developed and implemented soon. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop economical and environmentally sound strategies for managing glyphosate-resistant weeds and for preventing further evolution and spread of glyphosate resistance in agroecosystems that provide tree fruits and nuts, and wine, table, and raisin grapes. To accomplish this goal, we will assess the abundance, distribution, and perceived threat of glyphosate-resistant weeds, and conduct an economic and environmental impact analysis comparing weed management with and without glyphosate. Together with information for a subset of species on the mechanisms, inheritance, and origins of resistance, and the effect of plant growth stage on glyphosate response, we will evaluate the tradeoffs of different resistance management strategies in terms of financial and environmental costs and their influence on the further evolution and spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds in orchards and vineyards. Alternative resistance management strategies and their tradeoffs will be demonstrated and communicated to orchard and vineyard owners, managers, and workers, pest control advisors, pest consultants, and others through demonstration plots established in affected areas, extension presentations, 'Weed Schools', and online and popular press articles. The effectiveness of the research and extension activities in providing stakeholders with useful information on resistance management will be evaluated and used to improve research and extension education programs on glyphosate-resistant weeds."

Additionally, research results will be used to calibrate and validate the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) for organic grain cropping systems. Results will be presented in classroom and Extension programs and publications to facilitate producer involvement in self-development of water quality enhancement techniques. National environmental benefits include the reduction of crop nutrient losses, soil erosion, and pesticide transport; and improved security and quality of the food system."

It is a particularly recalcitrant disease: Scab has defied the efforts of breeders to identify good sources of resistance and contradicted the control strategies promulgated by plant pathologists. Furthermore, new scab causing species are emerging around the world. The potato is by far the most economically important host; however Streptomyces scabies causes scab on radish, carrot, turnip and beet. Peanut wart also is caused by this, and other, scab-causing species; this disease has been reported from Israel and Africa, but not yet from the U.S. The complete genome sequence is now available for S. scabies, allowing us to decipher how this pathogen senses the host plant and deploys its arsenal of virulence proteins. We will use a combination of bioinformatics and functional studies to identify regulatory genes which are important for pathogenicity in S. scabies. We will then characterize the regulatory networks for a subset of these genes and examine gene expression in S. scabies in response to highly susceptible and moderately resistant to potato scab. This research will offer a detailed picture of the interactions that between S. scabies and its host, providing a roadmap for the development of novel potato scab control strategies."

As fuel costs for industrial nitrogen fertilizer production rise, our reliance on SNF in legumes as an integral part of sustainable agricultural systems will likely grow. Therefore, it is important for us to understand at the biochemical and systems levels how SNF works, what limits it, and how we might use molecular breeding approaches to improve it in the future. Transporters, especially those located in the symbiosome membrane (SM) surrounding nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, are believed to play key roles in SNF and may in some cases limit SNF. By deciphering the roles of SM and other membrane transporters in legume nodules, this project will help to identify which transporters limit SNF and, therefore, which will be good targets for biotechnolgy to enhance SNF and create superior legume varieties in the future."

The economic viability of the U.S. tree fruit industries is now under serious threat. Rising labor, energy, water and land costs, rapid spread of pests and disease, and consumer demand for high quality and environmentally safe products pose real challenges to our global competitiveness. Overcoming these challenges requires the development of improved cultivars which contain desirable traits such as resistance to pathogens, superior fruit quality, and machine harvestability. To do this, we need to identify the genes associated with the traits of interest and assess their heritability; identify DNA markers so we can screen the genes/traits in existing varieties; create new crosses; identify the crosses that have successfully inherited the traits of interest; and then evaluate their performance under different environmental conditions. The research in genomics, genetics and breeding is generating large-scale datasets that require access to bioinformatics capabilities for analysis, archiving, integration, and interpretation. Translating this data into knowledge that can be used by experts in genomics, genetics, breeding, and production requires the development of a robust and high-throughput computational and database platform. Tree Fruit Genome Database Resources (tfGDR, www.tfgdr.org) will build on the existing capabilities of the Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR, www.rosaceae.org) and will provide a standardized, integrated, user-friendly specialty crop database platform for tree fruit to facilitate efficient collection, analysis, and translation of genomics, post-genomics, genetics, and cultivar performance data into solutions for tree fruit industry production and processing problems."

Version 1 of the Pecan IPM Toolbox was also completed and available for upgrade. The revision/upgrades proposed are: 1. Revision and improvement of the information presented to the public on the real-time PNC Decision Window interactive map to aid decision-making; 2. Revise and upgrade the current interface of the Pecan ipmPIPE platform with the Producer-Cooperator Network to allow Producer-Cooperators to directly enter their real-time PNC data onto the password and fire wall protected Pecan IPM Decision Support System (PIDSS) Manager file on the Pecan ipmPIPE server; 3. Continue the process of tailoring information in the Pecan IPM Toolbox, in particular, and other platform components in general, to reflect information relevant to specific regions of the pecan belt. The principal component we propose to develop in Obj. 3 is an interactive map that a platform user can click on a specific geographical location and view the arthropod/pathogen/nutrition/pecan phenology profile that is relevant to that location and then further query the profile for more detailed information on pests, practices, etc that they want and need to aid their decision-making. These proposed revisions and upgrades will improve the development and delivery of pecan IPM to the pecan industry belt-wide. This is expected to improve stakeholder adoption of information technology for use by the pecan industry: We anticipate: 1. scientists will develop more deliverables tailored for application in this medium; 2. producers will increasingly participate more actively in IPM efforts through cooperating in data gathering, etc. in areas of mutual interest, and 3. stakeholders will increasingly adopt this web-site as a major source of pecan IPM information. This will result in better IPM practices that limit treatments to when they are needed, reduce costs and expose producers, consumers and the public to less risk in both economic and environmental terms."

This project focuses on the importance of N partitioning and interacting metabolic processes for biomass and seed production in soybean (Glycine max). In contrast to most plant species that acquire N from the soil, soybean and other legumes are able to directly utilize N2 from the atmosphere and fix it in special organs (nodules) in the root. Thus, they can grow even in absence of N fertilization. Following fixation in soybean nodules, the N is reduced to allantoin that is translocated to leaves and then to seeds for embryo development and synthesis of storage compounds. Ultimately, biomass and seed production are dependent on these N transport processes. Using molecular, biochemical, cell-biological and physiological approaches we will examine proteins that are involved in transport of allantoin throughout the plant and determine their importance for plant productivity, seed yield and seed quality. We have isolated two allantoin transporters from soybean that will be studied with respect to their cellular function. We will further analyze plants repressing and overexpressing the transporters in soybean to elucidate their role in N partitioning and their significance for biomass production. We aim to dissect the consequences of manipulation of N transport on biochemical processes and pathways, especially carbon and N fixation, assimilation and metabolism. The final goal is to develop tools for improving productivity and quality of important crop plants by manipulating organic N partitioning."

Plants are a rich source of basic sugars, proteins, and lipids essential for our normal growth and development, and supply vitamins and minerals required for many of the basic cellular processes necessary for life. Legumes are considered to be some of the healthiest foods in our diet. Although some provide the full complement of 15 minerals required for human metabolism), levels of the minerals vary among crops within the family. Among legumes, common bean are consumed by humans more than any other crop. Health benefits from eating beans are numerous and include reducing the blood cholesterol and sugar levels which in turn prevents or alleviates certain types of cancer, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Diets rich in zinc and iron, two micronutrients abundant in bean, can delay the onset of AIDS. Recent research has shown that beans significantly reduce the onset of breast cancer, colon cancer, and biomarkers for heart disease risk. PURPOSE. The Common Bean Coordinated Agricultural Project (BeanCAP) will strengthen the bean research, education, and extension communities by focusing on the genetics and genomics aspects of nutrition in this important food crop. The research component will translate current and newly developed genomic information into markers with broad utility to improve any trait of interest among the various bean market classes grown in the United States. The markers will be used in the first ever nation-wide project to define loci controlling a large collection of nutritionally important traits at both the species and market-class-specific levels. Each breeding program can then design the best strategy for the nutritional improvement of the market classes they work with. A genotyping service will support all public US breeding programs improving traits of local importance. Low cost markers that leverage the information from the high throughput marker screening will be developed for the long-term improvement of common bean. The marker and phenotypic data generated by this project will be organized along with all available genetic map, marker, and loci data into a database that is fully operable with other legume databases. The extension component will develop WWW-deliverable learning communities and learning sites that focus on the theme  Nutritional Genetics and Genomics: Healthy Foods from the Field to the Table.  These sites will inform educators and the public about the biology, genetics, and genomics of nutrition. High quality, narrated animations will be the primary learning tool. The educational component of the BeanCAP will also initiate a modern plant breeding training program focusing on early career recruitment and practical breeding/genomics training that illustrates, as an example, how the integration of genomic and phenotypic data can be used to improve nutritional traits in plants. This will provide a stream of students interested in filling the plant breeding human resource pool."

A major factor is the relatively high age of beef heifers at the time they have their first calf. To optimize productivity and economical returns, heifers should be bred to calve at two years of age. Age at puberty is an important factor if heifers are to be bred to calve at two years. Age at puberty is influenced by body weight and age which are primarily influenced by level of nutrition and cattle breed. The main pasture forages in Florida are too low in vital nutrients for adequate heifer growth development without supplemental feeding. In addition, due to hot and humid conditions, most cattle in Florida have some Brahman breeding. Brahman cattle typically reach maturity at a later age than other common breeds. Thus supplemental feeding would be of even greater importance for cattle with Brahman breeding. Supplemental feeding typically involves the use of high energy (i.e., corn, cereal by-products) and high protein feeds (i.e., various oil seed meals) which are imported into Florida and the Caribbean region at considerable cost. In contrast, locally grown legume forages may be able to provide the needed extra nutrition at a lower cost. Legumes are characterized by high concentration of protein and carbohydrates, and are highly digestible. Unfortunately, legumes that do well under the tropical/subtropical conditions encountered in Florida and throughout the Caribbean Basin are scarce. Several possible warm season legumes were recently evaluated as supplements to bahiagrass hay in trials with lambs at the University of Florida. Perennial peanut (Arachsis glabrata; PP) performed the best. Thus PP hay could be a good supplement feed for growing beef heifers. Two trials, done over consecutive years, are proposed to evaluate PP hay as a supplement feed to growing beef heifers fed free choice bermudagrass hay. The heifers will be place on experiment shortly after weaning (7 to 8 mo of age) and taken off the feeding phase at breeding (5 to 6 mo later). The PP treatment will be compared to a treatment with concentrate (corn and cottonseed meal mix; positive control) supplementation and a treatment with no supplementation (negative control). Blood samples will be taken weekly from all heifers to measure progesterone in order to determine attainment of puberty. We hypostasize that the supplementation of perennial peanut hay will result in similar or even better growth and attainment of puberty versus supplementation with a concentrate feed. It is anticipated that the reproductive productivity of young beef cattle females during the critical first three years of age can be improved by the use of locally produced perennial peanut forage as a supplementary feed. A typical beef cow in Florida will produce nine calves over her lifetime. Breeding heifers to calve as two year olds could increase that figure to 10 calves, an extra $500 gross income per cow."

It is based on the fact that all insects require sterols, and that plant-feeding insects typically obtain sterols from their food plants. Exploiting this need offers a novel, target-specific and environmentally friendly approach for controlling insect pests of agricultural crops. Currently there are few, specific strategies for controlling sap-feeding hemipteran pests. This proposal explores the potential of using plants with modified sterols. These sterols are not harmful to vertebrates (including humans), or parasitoids, but preliminary data indicate they are deleterious to sap-feeding hemipterans, particularly aphids. We have three objectives. The first is to identify sterols that negatively affect aphids. Here performance of green peach aphids reared on tobacco plants with modified sterols, and on artificial diets supplemented with various sterols, will be correlated with the profile of sterols consumed. Supplementary experiments will be conducted using soybean aphids and pea aphids. The second objective is to establish whether the modified sterols are deleterious for two major non-aphid hemipteran pests, whiteflies and tarnished plantbugs, by analysis of performance on modified tobacco plants. The final objective is to assess the range of hemipteran pests suitable for control by sterols by determining the sterol profile of some 20 additional hemipteran pest species, including glassy-winged sharpshooters and cotton fleahoppers. Our results will likely lead to the development of transgenic crops, containing modified sterols, needed to manage hemipteran crop pests."

Its outcomes will assist in the reduction of fugitive particulate matter emissions during agricultural tillage operations, increase industry sustainability, and improve overall air quality; 2) race horse musculoskeletal injuries, which threaten the horse racing industry's vital part of California's economy. Musculoskeletal injuries are the most common and costly injuries-disease sustained by racing horses. The impact of this research may allow for a decrease in the frequency of catastrophic breakdowns and death of racing horses and contribute to the long term viability of California's racing industry. 3) California's persistent and reoccurring drought conditions place the long-term viability of otherwise promising high value permanent planting such as trees in serious jeopardy. The impact of this research while focused on pistachios, if proven effective and economical in pistachios, will likely be applicable to walnuts and almonds, which alone account for about 10% of California's acreage and represent an even larger share of the agricultural economy. If the experimental spray being studied is effective, it will be of great importance in sustaining existing acreage of permanent plantings with limited water supplies. Any significant practice that can minimize water consumption (or minimize the impacts of deficit irrigation) will have large impacts on energy (due to pumping), yields, and local/state economics. 4) Avian influenza viruses which are the most devastating of viral diseases and threaten the California poultry industry's economic viability, annual sales in excess of $2.5 billion, and employment opportunities for more than 25,000 people who collectively earn more than $250 million each year. Development of an effective immunization against the avian influenza virus, which is being studied, will significantly improve the California poultry industry's sustainability and long-term economic competitiveness. : 5)California food processors are under significant pressure to reduce processing and by-product handling costs as well as their environmental impacts. The cost of process water disposal doubles when it must be sent to a municipal sewage facility for primary and secondary treatment.

This research will assist in developing best management practices for economically and environmentally sustainable production of forage crops and land application of process water and bio-solids."

Considering the high adoption rate and that virtually no ECB population recruitment occurred in Bt corn, there is a real potential for off-site suppression of this important insect pest. We propose here that there are significant off-site effects of Bt corn with indirect environmental, yield and productivity benefits on other crops that have not been determined. Using several lines of evidence, we will document and measure the off-site community effects of Bt field corn use on ECB populations and assess the environmental, yield and productivity benefits in terms of reduced insecticide use and environmental risks in vegetable crops, such as sweet corn, peppers, and snap beans that rely heavily on insecticides to control ECB as a major pest. Evidence to support our hypothesis of off-site suppression will be derived from analyses of new and existing databases, with metrics reflecting changes in ECB populations during periods before and after introduction of Bt corn. Information sources will include: 1) annual moth activity data from light trap monitoring; 2) annual fall survey data of overwintering larvae; and 3) larval infestation levels in the untreated controls of existing insecticide trials and current levels in sentinel field plots. To estimate the yield benefits for sweet corn, snap beans, and peppers due to ECB population suppression, a hierarchical model will be developed to link measures of ECB population density to crop damage and yield loss for both the pre- and post-Bt periods. Reductions in insecticide use will be based on ECB moth flight data comparing probabilities and frequencies that moth flight numbers exceed action thresholds for pre- and post-Bt corn years. Separate analyses will be performed for each state/region with varying rates of Bt corn use. To capture the environmental benefits of estimated reductions in insecticide use, we will measure environmental impacts using the environmental impact quotient (EIQ) and the more recent multi-attribute toxicity factor MATF. The proposed research addresses environmental assessment needs noted under Program Area 4 subsections of the BRAG FY2009 RFA, which includes assessment of benefits resulting from reduced environmental risks accrued by the adoption of currently commercialized Bt corn. It also will illustrate a methodology to help federal regulators address the comparative environmental assessment of costs and benefits of IPM systems involving Bt or other transgene technology that have similar off-site suppressive effects on target pests. Results will contribute significantly to our understanding of how the deployment of Bt corn has altered the population dynamics of a major target pest and impacted the pest management practices used in other crop systems."

These techniques will ultimately be incorporated into potato production systems. Outreach and education targeted specifically at biologically based IPM and ecosystem production methods are essential to promote adoption by growers. In Wisconsin we have developed the foundation for biointensive IPM education. We are now proposing to continue the educational efforts which will enable growers to integrate biointensive IPM strategies into existing production systems. The overall momentum of the Collaboration has been extremely strong with many accomplishments such as the continuation of the marketing effort, enhancements of the Collaboration standards, improvements of resistance management protocols, database implementation, grant coordination and expansion of the development and use of educational tools for growers. We have worked with numerous faculty, industry representatives, potato and other commodity organizations, and environmental organizations to export this agricultural model for targeted and industry-wide change. In Wisconsin, this work is expanding to other vegetable crops, such as carrots, peppers, beans and peas, and is now also expanding to fruit crops. Furthermore, we have enhanced the ecological portions of the Collaboration by working with national and local environmental organizations and expanding our research with University of Wisconsin faculty by involving their expertise, research and education into the project. We need to maintain this strength while exporting the model of industry-wide agricultural changes through the use of policy and communication efforts. The success of the adoption of biointensive IPM programs by growers will be measured utilizing the measurement system previously developed by the Collaboration. At the conclusion of this project we expect to have completed detailed performance evaluations for a range of reduced-risk pest management alternatives. We will use this information in the educational activities and materials to provide growers with detailed efficacy and economic analysis of various alternatives which can be used by individual growers to refine their pest management practices to more biologically based, less toxic practices. The marketplace rewards which have been generated through the eco-labeling project in Wisconsin have also created a favorable climate for our biointensive IPM strategies to be adopted throughout the region. We are confident that growers see the potential for value-added marketing as a mechanism to offset declining commodity returns in traditional markets. The WWF/WPVGA/UW Collaboration will continue its outreach, stakeholder participation, and national policy efforts to increase dialogue on using market-based incentives to advance growers' use of biointensive IPM and reduce reliance on high-risk pesticides."

Overcoming these limitations requires rapid development and deployment of new cultivars with improved characteristics that meet dynamic industry, market, and consumer preferences. Despite successes achieved by plant breeders using classical approaches, tremendous opportunity exists to accelerate and expedite cultivar development through marker-assisted breeding (MAB), particularly for rosaceous crops, as breeding and testing cycles for these perennial species require costly, labor-intensive management and are often long-term (e.g., tree fruit and nut species). RosBREED will provide a vertically-integrated set of practices (molecular marker enhancement, high-throughput genotyping, integrated data management, discovery and validation within breeding germplasm) across the breeding and supporting research community. This project will explicitly leverage the forthcoming genomic sequence information and translate it into application in apple, peach, strawberry and sweet and sour cherry breeding for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of U.S. breeders to improve high-priority fruit quality traits (such as taste, texture, and appearance). This integration of modern genomics tools with traditional breeding approaches will transform crop improvement in Rosaceae, significantly improving profitability of U.S. rosaceous crop industries and contributing to increased consumption and enjoyment of these fruit, nut and floral products. This project seeks to identify breeding trait targets based on knowledge of what industry sectors and consumers value, thereby increasing new cultivar adoption. Extension activities will result in the delivery of genomic and socio-economics information to accelerate the adoption of MAB in both core and non-core Rosaceae crop breeding programs. Continuously updated content will be delivered via individual and small group tutelage by project participants, two distinct short course modules, regional technical workshops, and national participatory workshops. RosBREED has joined the existing Plant Breeding and Genomics eXtension Community of Practice and will utilize this web-based platform to exchange and disseminate information to ensure widespread availability and access, and thereby enable technology transfer and understanding."

One of the most economically important groups of oomycetes are PHYTOPHTHORA species, which attack vast range of plant hosts, causing rots of seedlings and the roots, stems, leaves and fruits of mature plants. The economic damage to crops in the United States by PHYTOPHTHORA species is estimated in the billions of dollars, and worldwide it is many times this. PHYTOPHTHORA PARASITICA Dastur (syn P. NICOTIANAE Breda et Haan) is a devastating pathogen with one of the widest host ranges of any described PHYTOPHTHORA species, infecting more than 100 genera of plants. Economically important hosts include solanaceous crops (tomato, pepper, eggplant, potato, tobacco), many orchard tree crops (citrus, walnut, almond, pistachio, papaya, peach, plum, apricot, apple, pear, macadamia, avocado, guava, pomegranate), tropical fruits (pineapple, banana, durian, passionfruit), oilseeds (sesame, safflower), vegetables (cucurbits and Brassicas) and many ornamental plants. The most important economic losses in the United States are to the tomato, citrus, tobacco and nursery industries. Comparing the genetic repertoire of P. PARASITICA with those of three other sequenced PHYTOPHTHORA species, two that have a narrow host range and one that has a broad host range, will provide important insights into the genetic basis of host range and host specificity, which will be valuable in designing strategies for protecting wide ranges of crops against PHYTOPHTHORA infection. Comparison of the genome sequences from P. PARASITICA with those of P. INFESTANS, with which it is evolutionarily similar, will significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms of evolution of host range. In particular, understanding the mechanisms underlying wide host range will help understand the broad host range forest pathogen P. RAMORUM, that causes the sudden oak death disease in California."

Although this disease is well documented, limited information is available concerning which species of Pythium and Phytophthora are most responsible for disease damage. Understanding the etiology of Pythium blight on snap bean and other hosts is necessary to achieve disease control. The first objective of this research is to establish the causal agent(s) of Pythium blight, examining variation in strains collected from different hosts and locations. To date, several isolates were collected on the Eastern Shore of Virginia and attaining additional isolates is necessary to establish the primary causal agent nationwide. Current isolates were identified to species using morphological characterization, and confirmed by molecular techniques. Most isolates were identified as Pythium aphanidermatum using both methods, and variation in virulence on multiple hosts will be determined. The potential variation in sensitivity within this pathogen population to fungicides will be evaluated. Sensitivity has not been reported in isolates from vegetable crops, and will be tested in vitro and in vivo. Preliminary research was conducted to develop field and greenhouse inoculation methods of Pythium blight on snap beans for fungicide sensitivity screenings. This research aims to increase our understanding of the causal agent(s) of Pythium blight and its possible variation in sensitivity to effective fungicides."

Factors affecting infiltration, survival during long-term storage, and inactivation during cleaning, conditioning, shelling, drying, and roasting will be studied. Results of these studies will be used for risk model development and for development of outreach training and publications. Information gained from this research will reveal the adequacy and appropriateness of practices currently used in the nut industry in terms of controlling and eliminating Salmonella in inshell nuts, nutmeats, and roasted nut products.

Investment in specialty crop research, education, and marketing is critical for the maintenance and expansion of these crops as a vital component of Indiana agriculture, particularly, in the southwestern part of the state, which has unique agroecological characteristics for growing specialty crops. Additionally, such investments will serve as an engine for economic growth by generating new opportunities, diversifying production systems, reducing impacts of production practices on the environment and improving the nutritional quality of diets. Specialty crops grown in Indiana include a variety of horticultural crops such as fruits and nuts, vegetables, ornamentals and organic agronomic crops, including new crops such as botanicals and medicinals. Importantly, the geographic and climatic conditions in southwest Indiana make it ideal for fruit and vegetable production as well as greenhouse production of nursery crops. Expanded capacity there would fill a production niche between crops grown in Florida and Arizona from the south and Wisconsin and Michigan from the north. Furthermore, approximately 40% of the nation's population lives within a 500-mile radius of Vincennes and Evansville, making same-day distribution of fresh produce and floricultural crops feasible. With an increase in specialty crop production, there will be a need for a well-educated, technically savvy workforce. Purdue University has had a long partnership with Vincennes University, and together the two institutions could offer degrees, courses, and training to prepare students to enter the workforce, thereby enhancing economic development and jobs creation in the region. Purdue University has a long-term presence in southwest Indiana with its Southwest Purdue Agricultural Center (SWPAC) located at Vincennes. This Center has maintained two to three research and Extension staff who have supported the fruit and vegetable industry, primarily melons and stone fruit. They have also worked with Vincennes University's agriculture program to teach courses and to train students at SWPAC in production management practices. The opportunities to promote production, processing and marketing of specialty crops in southwest Indiana have only been met partially, and the potential for enhancement of such efforts is tremendous, with its concomitant significant impact on the economy of the region. The emphasis on specialty crops and local production will become even more important as increasing energy costs limit availability of affordable and fresh produce from distant locations. Expanding the capacity of the SWPAC will serve as the research and extension engine that will drive the growth of specialty crop production in southwest Indiana, while the processing and marketing of specialty crops will greatly increase the overall economic growth of the region."

Never before has the safety of the food supply in the United States commanded more attention from consumers and state or federal food safety regulatory agencies than today. Since 2006, major Salmonella outbreaks traced back to peanut butter, tomatoes, breakfast cereals, cantaloupes, dry pet food, and pot pies have been major foci of epidemiological investigations. Two of these outbreaks, those involving peanut butter and tomatoes contaminated with Salmonella, received extensive national and international media coverage. While not implicated in these outbreaks, poultry and poultry products historically have been viewed as major vehicles for human food borne illness caused by the bacteria Salmonella and Campylobacter. Commercial poultry are considered among the largest reservoirs of both Salmonella and Campylobacter in all of animal agriculture. In order to meet the emerging challenges for ensuring and improving the safety of poultry and poultry products entering the human food supply, five M.S. students (three supported by this proposal and an additional two from matching institutional resources) will be trained through a specialized multidisciplinary program of graduate study in the Poultry Science Department (POSC) at Texas A&M University. POSC has a well established history in conducting responsive poultry food safety research. POSC faculty members (full-time, associate, and adjunct members) are active in identifying current trends and future needs related to improving the safety of poultry and poultry products entering the food supply. Graduating Fellows will receive a Master of Science in Poultry Science. The program is specifically designed to recruit, retain, graduate, and place M.S. students from underrepresented groups to meet the current and emerging challenges of maintaining and continuing to improve the safety of the food supply that is important to the health of the population of the U.S. The graduate program of POSC has a proven track record of preparing M.S graduates for careers in industry, federal government, or further graduate studies.

Poultry are extremely sensitive to aflatoxin B1 with turkeys being more sensitive than chickens. Later research discovered that poultry are the most susceptible food animal species to the toxic effects of aflatoxin. Based on epidemiological data and knowledge of liver biochemistry it is suggested that humans fall somewhere in the middle of this lethality range. Lethality in humans has also been documented. In 1974, nearly 10 per cent of 1,000 patients died from suspected acute aflatoxin poisoning. Aflatoxicosis outbreaks (2004) in eastern Kenya resulted in 317 cases and 125 deaths. Specific medical implications of aflatoxin are related to their carcinogenic properties. Aflatoxin is listed as a Group I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. It is has been demonstrated in animal species to be the most potent liver carcinogen known, and is implicated as a cause of human primary heptatocellular carcinoma. This form of cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in China, Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia and causes at least 250,000 deaths annually worldwide, especially in developing countries. The human body also metabolizes aflatoxin to several compounds including aflatoxin M1 which is secreted in both mother?s milk and urine. Studies in Africa confirm infant exposure to aflatoxin via mother?s milk as well as the ability of aflatoxin in blood to cross the human placenta. Approximately 4.5 billion people around the world are exposed to virtually unregulated amounts of the toxin on a daily basis. The substance is so toxic that it is one of 19 contaminants along with mercury and DDT for which the US Food and Drug Administration imposes strict tolerance levels with only trace amounts allowed. In addition to the health impact of detecting the mycotoxins early, there is a significant economic impact. The Midwest drought in 2005 triggered an outbreak of poisonous aflatoxin at thousands of corn farms, spurring regulators and food companies to greatly expand testing of grain and milk. During the last US drought, many dairies were forced to dump aflatoxin-contaminated milk from cows fed corn contaminated with this toxin. The concern for aflatoxin-contaminated corn led company officials at the Quaker Oats breakfast cereal plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to assay every truckload of corn entering the plant for aflatoxin. The value of this solution is evident by the fact that two major grain storage companies are committed to serve as beta test sites for the product."

IR-4 priority settings, crop profiles, and Pest Management Strategic Plans are not available for summer fallow. As zero tillage practices become more common, herbicide use will continue to increase. Currently, mechanical tillage is the only practical alternative to chemical fallow. However, tillage decreases residue cover, resulting in increased soil erosion. Strategic grazing of grain stubble and weeds by sheep offers an alternative to traditional stubble and weed management, and no-till biomass reduction for seed bed preparation with the added benefit of not negatively influencing soil nutrient cycling or increasing erosion potential. In addition, sheep grazing summer fallow may significantly reduce use and thus selection pressure for glyphosate resistant weeds by precluding the need to control weeds with glyphosate. Our goal is the profitable incorporation of sheep into grain production systems to reduce pesticide and fossil fuel use in fallow and stubble management. Our objectives are: 1: Compare two cropping systems and three management systems on: Above ground and seed bank weed and volunteer crop community composition, The crop systems are 1) Continuous spring wheat. 2) Three year rotation, spring wheat ? spring planted forage pea/hay barley intercrop? summer fallow in a three year rotation with each component present every year. Within each crop rotation, the management systems are: 1) No-till with sheep grazing to manage summer fallow, crop residues, and to harvest the forage crop; 2) Minimum tillage with herbicides use to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage for seed bed preparation; 3) Conventional Tillage used to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage used for seed bed preparation. 2: Using production and input data, compare profitability and cash flow of our two crop rotations and three management systems. We will publish and communicate to both academic and producer clientele results and potential economic and biological advantages of incorporating sheep grazing stubble and weeds into sustainable grain farming systems. Our preliminary results indicate no differences for grain yield among summer fallow systems. Our interdisciplinary team of scientists anticipates a positive long term biological and economical outcome from the integrated system of weed management by sheep grazing, and significant reduction in herbicide use in the Northern Great Plains. The proposed system encourages profitable cooperation between diverse agricultural enterprises by linking a source of inexpensive feed for sheep producers with a successful pest control method for grain farmers."

Unfortunately, continuous cropping coupled with intensive tillage has resulted in compacted soils, reduced water infiltration, and increased soil erosion. Including a sod grass, such as bahiagrass or bermudagrass, into the crop rotation ameliorates some of the negative impacts of intensive peanut and cotton production and results in increased yields with reduced inputs. The overall objectives of this multi-state project are to: 1) develop and compare the economic and environmental benefits of conventional and sod-based farming systems using conservation tillage systems, 2) quantify the positive impact that sod based rotations have on soil health, pest reduction, sustainable farm production, and soil carbon sequestration, and 3) refine and promote production practices in a sod-based rotation which result in significant yield increases associated with decreased inputs. This project has the potential to improve producer income and stimulate rural economy in the Southeastern US. Furthermore, this project leads to sustainable production practices that benefit the environment by reducing nutrients losses, reducing nutrient inputs, sequestration of carbon, and reduced dependence on water resources for irrigation."

One of the defining features of legumes is their ability to form a root symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia. A significant property of the symbiosis is its host specificity, which is controlled at multiple levels involving both rhizobial and host genes. Understanding of the host genetic control mechanisms involved in determination of host specificity will enable breeding for enhanced nitrogen fixation in crop legumes and facilitate the study of the molecular ecology of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. A number of single dominant genes (e.g, Rj2, Rj4 and Rfg1) that restrict nodulation with specific rhizobial strains have been identified in soybean since 1960s. These dominant genes restrict nodulation through recognition of incompatible rhizobial strains, resembling those `gene-for-gene' interactions between plants and pathogens. The observation that the Rj2 allele is located within a disease resistance (R) gene cluster on the soybean linkage group J has led to the speculation that the dominant nodulation restriction genes may encode plant R proteins that play an important role in limiting the host range of rhizobia. The goal of this project is to map and clone the soybean genes Rj2 and Rfg1, taking advantage of the availability of genetic and genomic tools in soybean. Cloning and characterization of these genes will not only provide novel insights into the evolution of host specificity in legume nodulation but also contribute to our understanding of the similarities and contrasts between pathogenic and symbiotic plant-microbe interactions."

Building on our years of promising research on dielectric heating of WPM in collaboration with scientists at USDA, wood products labs in Canada, and in consultation with regulatory agencies, our goal is to produce the necessary information to support a formal submission to and approval by the IPPC (International Plant Protection Convention) of radio frequency (RF) as an alternative to MeBr for treatment of WPM and other wood commodities. Currently there are only two accepted treatments [MeBr and conventional heat treatment (HT)] and HT cannot replace MeBr for many applications. At the same time that these measures were approved, the IPPC identified, as a matter of urgency, the need to adopt further treatments for use under the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures. The objectives of this proposal are to demonstrate that RF is equally, if not more, effective for killing pests in wood compared with MeBr, less costly, and environmentally superior to currently available treatments. We will define the lethal temperatures for killing pests under worst-case scenario conditions, using this information to develop and verify a proposed treatment schedule. The economics and life cycle analysis of RF will be contrasted with MeBr and conventional HT. Outcomes will be delivered to end users and appropriate regulatory authorities through extension and outreach efforts. This proposal is in response to CUN 11: Food Processing Plants and Post-Harvest Use by NPMA for Facilities, Commodities, and Objects. As stated in the CUN, MeBr is used on an as-needed basis for trailer fumigations of product or packaging material. Currently, about 80% of all pallets fumigated with MeBr are treated as unitized loads with product for pre-shipment purposes. The remaining 20% are fumigated prior to shipment to the pallet customers, as IPPC-compliant pallets. In addition to reducing MeBr use for WPM used in international trade, the work proposed here will develop the baseline RF efficacy data against a variety of pests in wood, which can be translated into processes specific to food products such as grains and nuts. The outcome will be an approved alternative treatment to replace MeBr fumigation for wood products used in world trade, which will vastly reduce MeBr emissions into the atmosphere."

Michigan cultivates 81,350 acres of Phytophthora-susceptible vegetables worth $143 million and 7,600 acres of Fraser fir worth $10.6 million. Phytophthora can be easily spread across and within agricultural regions via water. Phytophthora management is complicated by its large host range and lack of known disease resistance in vegetables. Phytophthora can last for 10 or more years in soil and it is common for growers to experience complete crop loss in some fields. Some strains of Phytophthora have mutated to become resistant to key fungicides and have colonized an estimated 25% of the acreage in the Michigan growing region. Disease outbreaks occur yearly and recent losses have become so large (up to $32.5 million) that the economic viability of these Michigan industries is at risk. This project seeks to reduce losses suffered by Michigan growers and stakeholders by developing integrated management strategies that emphasize cultural methods and environmentally friendly practices. Research will include investigating ways to limit the spread of Phytophthora; identifying and developing cultivars that are resistant to Phytophthora disease; investigating soil amendments, mulches, crop rotation and water management as new techniques for managing Phytophthora; and testing fungicides, biological control agents and new chemistries for disease control. Phytophthora management recommendations for growers will be developed from research results and demonstrated in on-farm trials and presented at extension meetings."

We will explore the potential to create effective mulches from pure preparations and mixes of shredded recycled newspaper and dried cover crop residues that can be grown on site. Our objective is to develop mulches using readily available materials and tools, that can be easily spread on the soil surface (i.e., around growing vegetables), and, which, after wetting, bond to themselves to create an impenetrable barrier against weeds. Shredded newspaper, when wetted, has been shown in previous research to have this tendency, but it is not known how to prepare a mulch to ensure that the mulch fragments will bond to each other, creating a solid barrier. We will determine the influence of different preparation methods on mulch cohesion including the width and length of mulch fragments and the amount and force of watering the mulch after it is spread on the soil. We will also determine if mixing shredded newspaper with plant residues that naturally suppress weeds through the release of chemicals that are toxic to germinating weeds (i.e., allelochemicals) increases weed control compared to newspaper alone. In addition, we will determine to what depth mulches need to be applied to control annual and perennial weeds that emerge from organs of different types and sizes (i.e., seeds, tubers, bulbs, etc.) so that appropriate mulch rates can be selected according to the types of weeds present. Mulches of different composition and with different physical characteristics can influence permeability to water and thus soil moisture, the spread of fungal spores to crop leaves through rain splash from the soil surface, and the availability of soil nutrients for crop growth as mulches are decomposed by soil microorganisms, which consumes nutrients. We will test the effect of mulches prepared from different materials on their overall effects on the growth of vegetables, including heirloom tomato, Edamame soybean, and sweet potato. These species have different growth habits (upright, trellised, or spreading), nutrient needs, and susceptibility to disease. Finally, we will do a budget analysis to determine the most cost-effective mulches, considering the costs of preparing, applying, and weeding (if needed) the mulches, and the expected return from crop sales. Our expected outcomes are 1) development of new sustainable, cost-effective, and user-friendly weed control strategies; 2) an improved scientific understanding of the physical characteristics required for a mulch to prevent weed emergence; and 3) the development of guidelines for the small farmer on how to prepare and apply mulches at a minimum cost to achieve good weed suppression and also build soil quality."

The most serious in the region are Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) and Bean leaf roll virus (BLRV) both of which are vectored virtually exclusively by the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Klein et al. 1991, Clement 2006, Clement and Eigenbrode, 2007). Aphid outbreaks and virus disease epidemics occur intermittently and unpredictably in pea and lentil in the region threatening the viability of the industry. The most recent epidemic occurred in 2005. Although occurring in 6- to 9-year intervals their cause is unknown. Virus prevalence among years in the Palouse is greater during aphid outbreaks but not consistently so. In non-outbreak years, severe injury from virus disease can still occur in individual fields. Current practice for aphid control and virus reduction is to treat aphids aggressively with dimethoate when virus risk is considered high. Growers currently have no quantitative way to assess this risk, however, and rely on inspection of plants for symptoms and their own perceptions of risk. Other growers, seeking to reduce inputs try to avoid treating for aphids, leaving the crop open to virus injury. When virus is not suspected, insecticides are often used to prevent direct injury by pea aphids and simultaneously to treat for pea weevil (Bruchus pisorum). Insecticide-use decisions currently depend on simple rules-of-thumb (Homan et al. 1992), based on opinion rather than quantitative guidelines. These recommendations do not provide producers with loss models or economic thresholds that account for crop value, insecticide costs and crop yield potential. Critically absent are economically justified recommendations taking into account the effects of pea aphid as a vector of viruses. The primary purpose of this project is to provide necessary economic information for formulation and implementation of coordinated, virus-forecast based, pea aphid control strategies with the goal of reducing the industry?s vulnerability towards PEMV and BLRV. The key for such management strategy is that if producers knew in advance when severe epidemics of PEMV and BLRV were likely to occur, and whether their particular fields were prone to infection, they would be forewarned of the need to apply recommended vector control measures to manage these viruses. Alternatively, if risks were known to be low, growers could manage the aphids as direct pests, reducing pesticide use and concomitant environmental and economic impacts. However, it is important that such forecast based conditional management strategy be economically justified. The model will be based on profit maximization framework and will produce optimal, cost minimizing, strategies for PEMV and BLRV virus control.

Since January 1, 2008 the United States recalled over 60 meat and poultry products equating to 150 million pounds for pathogen contamination alone. Traditionally meat and poultry have been the primary products affected by product recalls, with Escherichia coli O157:H7 in red meat representing the bulk of the pounds recalled. Unfortunately, we are now seeing the traditional pathogens of concern for red meat becoming pathogens of concern for horticulture products. Examples are the discoveries of E. coli O157:H7 in spinach and Salmonella Typhimurium in peanuts. In the past year, over 3,900 peanut containing products have been recalled as a result of a S. Typhimurium outbreak at one processing plant alone. Food Safety recalls affect the producer, processor, and consumer. In the best case scenario it is only an economic hardship that the processor and producer have to bear. In the worst case scenario it results in a company shutting its doors, people losing jobs, a tax base being lost by the community and state, and people losing their lives. Research is being conducted to find processes and technologies that will mitigate the negative impact harmful bacterial pathogens, toxins, and allergens have on our food supply. It encompasses investigations of on-farm treatments to reduce E. coli O157:H7 in both animal and fresh cut vegetable products. It seeks alternative techniques to further reduce this and other equally harmful pathogens/toxins in food products during processing. Finally, it also includes investigations into the development of rapid state-of-the art methods to detect pathogens/toxins/allergens in foods before they make it to the consumer's table."

Many of Kentucky's family farms have been highly dependent upon tobacco as a primary source of income. But the number of farms growing tobacco in Kentucky declined 72% from nearly 30,000 in 2002 to 8,112 in 2007. The market value of tobacco sold in Kentucky in 2008 was $382 million, down from $674 million in 2000. Many of Kentucky's farms are small, averaging 164 acres, compared to the U.S. average of 418 acres. There were 85,300 farms in the state in 2008. According to the 2007 census, 67 percent of all Kentucky farms sold less than $10,000 worth of agricultural products. Interest in alternative crops, including horticultural enterprises, has risen dramatically. This interest continues to increase because of the tobacco quota buyout. Horticultural crops offer Kentucky growers potential alternatives. A number of farms have successfully initiated commercial vegetable enterprises. Other farms are seeing the potential success of horticultural crops, but many lack the technical knowledge and management skills for immediate success with these production/marketing systems. Kentucky's grain producers are searching for ways to improve the market value of the crops they grow. Examples of potential specialty grain types include edamame (green vegetable soybean) and soft white winter wheat. An emphasis on bioenergy has increased the need for research on a variety of crops that have potential for energy production, including hulless barley, sweet sorghum, and biomass crops such as switchgrass. Growth in the organic food industry has led to a need for research on organic production of both horticultural and grains crops. This project is designed to develop and deliver Kentucky farmers the knowledge they need to assess new crop opportunities. Eleven horticulture and specialty grains projects will be conducted by researchers at the University of Kentucky as part of this overall New Crop Opportunities, KY, project. The New Crop Opportunities Center will feature a Web site for 24-hour access to information on new crops for Kentucky, including the horticultural and specialty grains crops that are the focus of the Center's research. Center staff will answer questions from Extension agents and farmers, and will distribute new crop information at field days and conferences. The Center will facilitate the packaging of information from its research and other sources for dissemination. The expected outcomes/impacts of this project will be an increase in knowledge among Kentucky farmers and county extension agents about production and marketing systems for a variety of new crops. This increase in knowledge should allow farmers to make informed decisions about which new crops to try, and how to market those crops, based on information available on the Center's research projects, as well as through its crop and marketing profiles. Anticipated benefits include greater profitability for Kentucky's farmers as they successfully transition to a variety of crops that are new to them."

The proposed and recently initiated research will explore areas to improve sustainability of various production systems. Some will be organic, others will be conventional production. Several cover crop studies presently underway will be continued on several farms. They will be continued through the end of 2008, the termination date for a NE SARE Partnership project that was secured to provide additional support for this work. The focus of cover crop studies will be to reduce weed pressure on cash crops in the rotation and improve soil fertility. Increasing nitrogen production from legumes in an age of increasing energy costs will be a necessity. The OFR coordinator will continue to provide guidance to a county extension educator for a dairy feeding study begun in 2007. The focus of this effort is to demonstrate that through reducing the amount of protein fed lactating dairy cows, animal performance can be maintained and possibly improved while reducing the feeding cost of milking cows. The project is being conducted on ten farms. A Pennsylvania Soybean Promotion board funded project will be initiated during 2009 to develop a soybean network in PA of growers who seek to conduct their own on-farm evaluations. They employ some of the latest computerized planting and harvesting mapping capabilities. Coupled with aerial photography, these tools will aid in the identification of yield and profit-limiting factors in soybean production. Researchers from Penn State and Rodale Institute will continue a project that seeks more consistent performance for farmers who want to grow heavy cover crops and use the relatively new concept of crop rolling to control them. The OFR program is supporting this project through three on-farm sites in PA, NY, and MD. Proven and experimental practices/treatments will be utilized on these private farms to demonstrate the potential for this technology to reduce or eliminate the use of herbicide in a subsequent corn or soybean crop. The recent large increase in fertilizer prices, especially nitrogen, has prompted strong promotion of several products that are added to N fertilizer to reduce losses to volatilization and leaching. Two on-farm studies will be conducted during 2009 to complement one being conducted at the experiment station to quantify relative efficiencies of N utilization when urea is treated with commercially available products. A dairy cropping systems trial, supported by NE SARE, will commence during 2009 at the Agricultural Experiment Station at Penn State. Components of this study, overseen by the OFR program, will be tested on several smaller dairy farms. The OFR coordinator will assist project leaders in recruiting farmers to serve on a project advisory panel. Other areas of research are identified as the on-farm research coordinator continues to discuss production problems and possibilities for collaborative research with producers, county and state Cooperative Extension personnel, PASA organizers, and representatives of other agencies."

There are the Three Sisters: corn, beans, and squash, grown together by the Haudenosaunee, and lodgepole pines, used as the framework for dwellings in the West. Less well known are the varieties of sage and cedar used in the blessing ceremonies of the Potawatomi and Ponca, or the medicinal herbs used by the Creek or the Cherokee. Many of these native plants are in decline. The threats are numerous: introduced pests and diseases, habitat destruction, competition from exotic weeds, misuse of pesticides, inappropriate harvesting. USDA's website, www.plants.usda.gov, lists several thousand plants that are threatened or endangered at the federal or state level. There are 260 plants listed as culturally significant. A comparison of the two lists finds several dozen that are both culturally important and threatened or endangered. Many native plants receive scant attention from breeders and growers. There is little incentive for commercial ventures to put research dollars into projects that have low potential return. Many plants, however, have more than monetary value. They are part of the natural and cultural heritage of this nation and they serve an important part in maintaining the integrity of the ecosystems that sustain native wildlife. The benefit of diversity is one of the cornerstone concepts in ecology. An ecosystem made up of many different species provides stability and a synergistic energy to a habitat. For instance, differences in the timing of plant germination, growth rates, flowering, and fruit/nut/seed production among different species, provides food for a wide variety of wildlife across the growing season. The loss of a wide diversity of plants in favor of a few opportunistic growers diminishes our natural landscapes. This two-year study will investigate new techniques for the propagation of red elm, gray alder and russet buffaloberry. All three of these plants are of cultural significance to Native American tribes because of their medicinal properties. All three of these species have low reproductive rates and subsequent declining populations. Red elm is an upright tree of 60 to 70 feet. It is used to treat skin conditions such as boils, burns, and inflammation. Poultices made from the gummy secretions from the elm's bark were applied to infected wounds. Red elm is also used in traditional medicine to treat respiratory conditions, coughs, and as an eye wash. Gray alder is a tree or shrub used to treat anemia, as a compress or wash for sore eyes, for internal bleeding, sprains, bruises, flux and piles. Russet buffaloberry is a shrub or small tree with dark gray, sometimes spiny branches. The fruits are red and berrylike. It has therapeutic value in treating amoebic dysentery, angina pectoris and malaria. This project will apply cutting-edge propagation techniques to try to improve seed germination or cutting establishment success for these three species. The success of this propagation enhancement project will be determined by the development of new techniques that will help ensure the long term survival of these culturally significant species."

Frequency of insecticide applications to manage sucking bugs (stink bugs and plant bugs) in cotton has increased from 1/ha in 1992 to 3/ha in 2005. To reverse this trend in cotton and other crops, improved control strategies of stink bugs are needed, which require a better understanding of the ecology of the main stink bug species. This work will (1) provide key information on the ecology of the main stink bug pests and their natural enemies in the Southeast, and (2) evaluate a method for substantially reducing insecticide use to manage stink bugs in cotton, a major susceptible crop in the Southeast United States. To determine the qualitative and quantitative changes in populations at the spatial scale of the farmscape, both stink bugs and their natural enemies will be sampled on their main crop hosts (cotton, soybeans, corn, peanuts and wheat) and alternate host plants. A holistic approach to stink bug management is needed, as these insects develop on a sequence of hosts and crops throughout the season. The spatial and temporal dynamics of stink bugs and their natural enemies across the farmscape in both South Carolina and Georgia will be studied (objective 1), which will lead to improved sampling as a function of within field location and surrounding vegetation. GPS coordinates of fields and sampling locations will allow the use of geostatistical methods. A major concept of studying stink bugs at the farmscape scale is to consider simultaneously the source and sink effects of a variety of habitats and crops. The second objective will evaluate in-field border applications of insecticide in cotton to manage stink bugs. We know that stink bugs infest cotton fields from the edge first, and then move towards the interior of the field. Rather than applying insecticides over the entire field, applications will be made only for border populations upon first signs of damage, which may prevent the need to treat the entire field. Stink bug densities and associated injury to cotton bolls will be recorded throughout the season. The pesticide savings would be important from the perspective of reducing active ingredient applications, reduced time to make applications, and finally conserving natural enemies by not treating the entire field. The cost effectiveness of this management strategy will be assessed. This project will address two priority areas defined by the Southern Region Information Exchange Group for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (SERA003-IPM) in 2007: (1) Managing sucking bugs using ecological approaches, (2) Development of decision aids for management of pests for all crops. The objectives of this multistate proposal with an integrated approach fit well with the goal of the National IPM Program as presented in the IPM Road Map:  to improve the economic benefits of adopting IPM practices and to reduce potential risks to human health and the environment caused by the pests themselves or by the use of pest management practices.

Both issues concern agricultural producers and processors locally. Finally, the African and US field experiences are integrated with training in the new Community, Environment and Development major in the College of Agricultural Sciences at Penn State.

The principal impediments to identification and removal of unsafe food include the lack of rapid food pathogen detection methods, a cumbersome inventory-traceability system, and the inability to identify the source of the problem requiring correction. Recent instances of food contamination stemming from Salmonella contamination in the field (spinach and tomatoes) and during plant processing (peanuts) have emphasized the need for new detection methodologies. The research being conducted under this grant seeks to address these contaminations with introduction of the Magnetoelastic Phage-Based Biosensor. These biosensors are smaller than particles of dust, wireless, require no on-board power, are biodegradable, and are inexpensive. These biosensors may be sowed onto plants in the field and then analyzed to detect the presence of pathogens such as Salmonella or Bacillus anthracis on the leaves of crops such as spinach and tomatoes. New phage-based detection technologies with anticipated detection limits several orders of magnitude better and with shelf-lives up to five times longer are also being investigated. The goal is to improve our ability to detect naturally or deliberate contaminations of our food supply through improved sensor and information technologies."

Through the close interaction with stakeholders, teams are formed to prioritize key IPM issues, identify gaps in research and extension, develop and deliver information, knowledge, and practices through workshops, field meetings, hands-on demonstrations, and web-based outreach. Short- and intermediate-term outcomes will be measured using audience survey, knowledge acquisition methodology, web-based survey instruments, interviews and product use patterns. Long-term impacts may be measured using Pesticide Use Reporting, water and air quality monitoring via partnerships with other public agencies. UC IPM programs have always targeted the goals represented by the National IPM Roadmap. Our current activities focus on the development and delivery of economic and environmentally sound IPM systems to limit human and environmental risks caused by pest management activities. This has required a close partnership with water boards, water coalitions, CDPR, and USDA NRCS, local municipalities, water agencies, and the UC Master Gardener Program. Smith-Lever 3(d) IPM funding has been an important part of the resource base to support the development and delivery of IPM in California.

Pest problems may severely impact yield and quality any given year, threatening the economy of the state and region, and export capacity. Examples: Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley resulted in several billion dollars loss to the state's economy from 1993-2005 (Nganje et. al., 2004; McMullen, 2005); other pests impact crops each year (Sugarbeet Research and Extension Report, http://www.sbreb.org; ND Crop and Pest Report (http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/aginfo/entomology/ndsucpr/index.htm). ND producers use pesticides as one management tool to combat pest outbreaks. For example, in 2004, 45.4% of cropland was sprayed with herbicides, 2.3% with insecticides, and 5.4% with fungicides (Pesticide Use and Pest Management Practices Survey in ND, 2004). This survey also showed that ND producers increased their use of IPM practices, such as use of field scouting and forecasting models, between 2000 and 2004 surveys. ND has a short growing season and a harsh winter climate. Citizens place high value on urban plantings which can survive the winter and which are relatively free of pest problems. A recent electronic questionnaire about urban IPM needs, sent to extension educators in 8 states of the High Plains region, including ND, indicated that almost 40% of their pest questions. This IPM project addresses those critical needs, by coordinating a statewide IPM program, providing collaborative efforts in pest management education across two states for two key crops, wheat and soybean, by demonstrating the value of integrated strategies for controlling a key disease of wheat, Fusarium head blight, by supporting the valuable resource of the NDSU Diagnostic Lab that services agriculture, homeowners, and the ornamental industry, and by increasing the outreach capabilities of the Urban IPM programs."

Alabama currently has active IPM programs in the following key commodity areas/settings: agronomic/row crops (e.g., grain crops, soybeans, and peanuts), cotton, fruit and vegetable crops (e.g., citrus, peaches, tomato, cruciferous crops, and organic vegetable production), fire ants, and school/community IPM. We have active applied research programs and have established a team of extension/research IPM specialists with expertise from across all pest disciplines in most of these areas. General IPM-related activities in Alabama include evaluation and training of clientele, stakeholders and extension agents on IPM tactics, and applied research. Survey programs are active in most areas to detect introduced and exotic pests. The project will allow the IPM Coordinator to continue to perform the numerous duties related to the position including communication, outreach, and program administration. The project will facilitate increased IPM implementation in our established IPM programs in agronomic crops, cotton, fruit and vegetable crops, and School IPM, as well as support expansion of the program into new areas such as IPM support for pest diagnostics and IPM partnerships in wide-area pest monitoring and reporting systems. It will also support increased collaboration with Alabama's 1890 institutions (Alabama A & M and Tuskegee Universities). The project will enhance the goals of the National IPM Roadmap by enhancing timely access of growers and other stakeholders to IPM information and fostering communication among IPM stakeholders. Expected outcomes of this program include increased adoption and implementation of environmentally friendly and economically sustainable IPM tactics and programs in Alabama, increased profitability of Alabama farms, reduced pesticide residues in foods, reduced pesticide use in schools and housing, reduced potential for human health risks from pests and pesticides, and a safer environment."

Its direct impact will be an increase in the number of urban students, particularly Latino and other low-income students, matriculating from CPHS to Pierce and increasing the diversity of the state and Nation?s agriscience workforce. Pierce and CPHS have a continuing relationship. The college conducts an active concurrent enrollment program on the campus of CPHS each semester designed to increase the likelihood that CPHS students will move from high school to college. This is especially important as Latinos are 82% of the 08/09 general student body and 63% of the EVS student body. A report in the September 29, 2007 edition of the Los Angeles Times details the growing deficit of highly trained agriscience workers. Universities that 25 years ago produced numerous agriculture professionals now struggle with declining enrollment (a 40% decrease in the last 5 years) at a time when a large portion of the agricultural workforce is nearing retirement. All the literature and the strategic direction setting from both the California Community College System Office and the California Department of Education point to the value and importance of concurrent enrollment in establishing a college-going culture at high schools. Recent state budget cuts have forced the CSU and UC systems to reduce the number of incoming freshman they accept beginning in fall 2009. This, along with tuition increases, has strengthened Pierce and other community colleges? role as the gateway to higher education. The key innovative aspect of the ACUS project is to increase access to college agriscience programs and high-wage, in-demand agriscience professions through concurrent enrollment and enrichment activities for urban students. California is the world?s fifth largest supplier of food and agricultural commodities, and for more than 50 years has been the No. 1 state in the Nation in cash farm receipts; in 2006 its $31.4 billion in revenue represents 13.1% of the U.S. total. California?s agricultural abundance includes 400 different commodities including about half of U.S.-grown fruits, nuts, and vegetables. California?s agricultural exports were nearly $9.8 billion in 2006. In 2006, 24% of California?s agricultural production was shipped to more than 150 countries. California needs a highly educated agricultural workforce to maintain and grow this complex and economically vital industry. ACUS will expand on the interest in the field that students have shown by choosing to attend the EVS Magnet program. ACUS enrichment activities (field trips, guest speakers, conference attendance) are designed to capture students? imaginations, enabling them to envision themselves in an agriscience profession. This, in combination with the normal high school curriculum and Pierce credit courses, we believe, will open educational and professional opportunities for these students."

Preventing macadamia nut quick decline, where trees die within 2-3 months after initial yellowing and browning of leaves occur, is not fully understood. Hawaii has the potential to be a major supplier of tropical fruits; however, a consistent supply, reliable production methods and management practices are of paramount importance to achieving that potential. The livestock industry in Hawai`i has dramatically changed in the past decade due to many factors, including stricter waste management regulations. The requirement of zero pest tolerance to meet quarantine requirements in floriculture often necessitates use of extreme pest control methods that may pose higher risks to human health and the environment in order to ensure a cost benefit (i.e., no rejected export shipments). The purpose of the Hawaii IPM Program is to address these issues by demonstrating the most efficacious protocols available to date that also provide long-term benefits of reduced risk to human health and to the environment, and overall economics, and to measure the impact of our methods of delivery (field day and demonstrations, field guide and other publications) on adoption by our stakeholders."

The economics and scientific knowledge are now in place for the BOB to become a commercial pollinator, but only if large populations of the bees can be supplied. One obstacle in raising these bees is that, at a minimum, 25% of the female bees allowed to emerge from their nests in an orchard will disperse from the intended pollination site. Dispersal can be greater (over 50%) when bees emerge from cocoons that were removed from their nests. Purpose In 2008, AgPollen conducted two field trials that showed that a BOB nest component could attract bees to construct more nests at a given site. For this project, we will build on that information using field and lab experiments. In California we will conduct two studies, one on almonds and one during propagation on wildflowers. In Utah, a third field trial will be conducted in an apple orchard. The nest component volatile chemicals will be extracted and identified. This will allow us to test various concentrations, fractions, and individual chemicals in our field tests. Chemicals will also be tested using a technique that can detect whether or not the bee can sense a particular chemical with its antennae. This research will seek a chemical or mix of chemicals that could be developed into a lure that will make nests more attractive to female BOBs."

These core skills include pest identification, crop staging, scouting techniques, and general management practices. Some information is applicable to more than one cropping system (i.e. agronomic and vegetable crops). However, growers and consultants in several cropping systems need customized training. To achieve these trainings, educational programs for scouts, growers, and consultants that utilize classroom training, in-field, hands-on training, field days and demonstration plots will be delivered by the UW IPM Program. 2) Advanced IPM Knowledge: Growers and consultants need crop-specific IPM information to implement daily pest management decisions. A few current examples of needed management information include information on western bean cutworm, foliar fungicide use on corn, insect management in cucurbits, weed management and reduced reliance on organophosphate insecticides in cranberries, and pest management training in nursery settings. 3) Efficient IPM Programming: Cost effective and safe pest management is essential to the profitable production for all of the diverse crops grown in Wisconsin. The UW IPM Program efficiently coordinates IPM activities by providing leadership with industry groups including WI Integrated Pest and Crop Management Technical Advisory Committee, Wisconsin Association of Professional Agricultural Consultants, and Certified Crop Advisors to advance IPM educational opportunities in Wisconsin. The UW IPM Program also collaborates with other University of Wisconsin campuses to teach IPM scout training classes and other training programs. The overall benefits of the IPM Program are to increase agricultural profitability while minimizing environmentally hazardous pest management practices. Benefits include basic education that provides the skill set necessary for students and crop advisors to implement IPM practices. Applicator training will reduce pesticide spills and mishaps, which will directly reduce environmental impacts and improve applicator safety. The core IPM educational programs will provide the basic skills necessary for all crop consultants and growers to improve/protect profitability and limit the environmental impacts of pest management. Advanced training sessions provide decision making tools to make economically sound decisions; information on pesticide use timing and proper selection to ensure greatest economic benefit if/when used; and resistance management techniques that reduce overall amount of pesticides used."

It's rich, tasty flavor is a high-valued food additive. Although 15.4 acres of black walnuts yield approximately 4 billon pounds of raw nuts annually, only about 20 million pounds are commercially processed. With low economic incentives and small processing capacity, growers lack motivation to harvest. However, the growers can potentially enjoy great economic gain if these black walnuts can efficiently sorted. The USDA's very strict standards allow no more than 0.05% shell or foreign material by weight in any grade of shelled nuts. With very similar physical properties between the shells and meat, an effective method of automatically differentiating the shell from the meat needs developing, particularly for black walnut processing. This research will develop a hyperspectral fluorescence imaging technology to solve the challenging problem of distinguishing between nut fragments from nut meat which are much similar in physical characteristics. This technique utilizes the fluorescence emitted light responses under hyperspectral wavebands and high-dimensional imaging algorithms to identify the shell fragments and nut meats. Further, this automated dynamic system technology will enable the removal of nut shells from the nut meat non-destructively for quality and safety nut products. This research will lead to a valuable technology which allows growers to recoup economic benefit from their black walnuts."

The primary Reservation population centers include the communities of Worley, Plummer, Tensed and DeSmet. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe has an abundance of natural resources such as lakes, streams, timber and farmlands. The Tribe established a Farm Enterprise in 1970, their current operation includes about 6,000 acres and produces wheat, peas, lentils, rapeseed and bluegrass. The local educational system faces many challenges. In 2007-2008, the graduation rate for Native American youth on the Reservation was only 28% (Idaho State Department of Education). The school district has failed to meet Adequate Yearly Progress on state achievement tests for five consecutive years and is now dealing with state sanctions. Tribal leadership is concerned about keeping the youth involved in land-based and environmentally related activities and careers. Among American Indians 25 years and older on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation in 2000, 26 percent had no high school diploma and 6 percent had a bachelor's or college degree. However, the Tribal Department of Education has seen an increase in tribal members enrolling in education, and there are currently 60 tribal members receiving financial support for their pursuit of associates', bachelors' and graduate degrees. Only one of these recipients is pursuing a degree in an environmentally-related field. Anticipated Outcomes by Objective: The overall goal is to increase the quality of life on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation primarily through agriculture and natural resource education and life skills development for youth and adults. 1. Youth will have improved workforce skills that will increase their competitiveness in the job market; youth will choose careers in science, technology and natural resource fields and continue their education beyond high school; Youth will have increased cultural competence. 2. More families will grow their own food; families will have increased income from their land; improved natural resource and environmental stewardship will be demonstrated by community action. 3. Indian people will not lose their land; fractionation of Indian land will be reduced; there will be an increase in the number of individuals who have a will or estate plan. 4. Communities will have improved economic stability as reflected in population demographics, higher employment rates, planning, laws and ordinances that ensure long term community sustainability; communities will have completed a comprehensive plan; increased University outreach activities on the reservation. 5. Community leaders will be more inclusive in decision making process; reduced demand for community services (low income); families will have reduced expenses related to maintaining a home/property; youth and adults will reduce their debt (credit) load; there will be an increase in community collaborations, networking, and partnerships; improved communication among community residents, organizations and agencies."

It is a high yielding, protein-rich perennial, with well defined agronomic practices, seed industry support, and extensive translational genomics resources in the closely related model species Medicago truncatula. A major disadvantage, however, is its potential for causing pasture bloat due to excessive rumenal fermentation of dietary protein to methane. Bloat occurs when ruminants are fed high protein forages such as alfalfa that lack proanthocyanidins (PAs) in their aerial portions. By binding to protein and slowing its rate of rumenal fermentation, modest amounts of PAs in forages reduce the occurrence of bloat and at the same time promote increased dietary protein nitrogen utilization in cattle and sheep. The economic impact of the development of a  bloat-safe  alfalfa will be enormous for ranchers and producers in the US. However, classical breeding approaches have failed to introduce PAs into alfalfa foliage, and the problem will likely require a biotechnological solution. This is, unfortunately, limited by our lack of understanding of PA biosynthesis and assembly. The present proposal attempts to overcome this limitation by translating molecular genetic discoveries on PA biosynthesis in the model legume Medicago truncatula to alfalfa. In particular, we will test novel hypotheses for the mechanisms underlying the transport of the PA building blocks to their site of polymerization (the cell vacuole), and their subsequent polymerization into PAs."

The program priority addressed is the molecular mechanisms of communication between symbiotic, nitrogen-fixing bacteria and legume plant hosts. These bacteria, rhizobia, invade the roots of legume plants, induce these plants to form a nodule to house them, and establish a symbiotic interaction. In this symbiosis, the bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that the plant can utilize and the plant provides the bacteria with fixed carbon compounds produced by photosynthesis. This symbiosis is critical for agricultural productivity in crops such as alfalfa, soybean, and pea. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which this symbiosis develops is required for improving the symbiotic interaction and ultimately for transferring the plant symbiotic genes to non-legume crops, such as rice and wheat. We are probing the molecular mechanisms of communication between the bacterial symbiont and its plant hosts by studying mutants of the bacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti, that are unable to produce the important polysaccharide succinoglycan, and as a result are unable to invade host plants. We will focus on the role of exoK, a glycanase that is required for succinoglycan modification and specifically required for invasion of one host (Medicago truncatula) but not another (alfalfa). We will also study M. truncatula mutants to determine how the plant responds to succinoglycan to facilitate invasion. These M. truncatula mutants are being screened as part of a collaborative effort to establish genetic tools in this plant, in which our laboratory is participating."

We expect to release new cultivars with EFB resistance derived from 'Gasaway' for planting in Oregon hazelnut orchards, and for trials elsewhere. New sources of genetic resistance to A. anomala. New seedling populations segregating for EFB resistance from several sources within C. avellana, and populations segregating for resistance from other Corylus species. We will identify and propagate new selections with EFB resistance from various sources and establish trials. New information on the genetic control of disease resistance from various sources. We will integrate Extension and outreach activities by our four institutions, and more effectively deliver outcomes to stakeholders across the US. Economic analyses will answer on-going questions concerning the feasibility of growing hazelnuts for various end uses. Numerous other synergistic activities will arise from this program. For example, Arbor Day has an extensive network. By joining forces with OSU, Rutgers, and UNL, ADF will be able to enhance the science-based information they relay to their members, which will lead to a more knowledgeable membership base and likely will help increase membership.

The research phase of this project will explore host plant resistance to leaf spot using conventional and transgenic approaches. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop peanut cultivars with sufficient resistance to leaf spot so that farmers can reduce their expenses and so that less pesticide is applied to the environment. Plant breeding is the art and science of developing improved plant varieties. Thomas Jefferson said  The greatest service which can be rendered any country is to add a useful plant to its [agri]culture . Although Mr. Jefferson was speaking of new plants, not yet cultivated in agricultural enterprises, the idea is valid for modern plant breeding. Modern plant breeding seeks to improve existing crops by introducing new varieties which produce more grain, are more tolerant of diseases, and/or which have improved nutritional qualities. Plant breeding is practiced in both the public (University and Government) and private sectors primarily by individuals with post-graduate degrees in the plant sciences. Surveys have shown that the majority of plant breeders (about 2/3) in the US are employed in private industry. It is also apparent that investment in plant breeding in the private sector is growing. During the period from 1966 to 1997, research expenditures for public sector (State Agricultural Experiment Stations [SAES] and the USDA-Agricultural Research Service [ARS]) plant breeding were largely unchanged whereas expenditures in the private sector rose about ten-fold. As a result, the number of scientists employed in the public plant breeding declined by about 21% from 1994 to 2001. While the demand for plant breeders in the private sector increased, the ability of US universities to train graduate students qualified for such positions has decreased. Several studies over the past 20 years have documented a reduction in the number of plant breeders employed within State Agricultural Experiment Stations and the shrinking capacity of those institutions to train graduate students as a result. Unlike decades ago, when most students entering agricultural majors had lived or worked in farming operations, many today have no experience in agriculture and only limited awareness of the many careers within this vast field of science. For example, many students entering agricultural majors at the University of Florida have no previous experience in agriculture. Our project will help to address the need for education within the pre-collegiate system and will focus on middle and high school teachers and students."

As zero tillage practices become more common, herbicide use will continue to increase. Currently, mechanical tillage is the only practical alternative to chemical fallow. However, tillage decreases residue cover, resulting in increased soil erosion. Strategic grazing of grain stubble and weeds by sheep offers an alternative to traditional stubble and weed management, and no-till biomass reduction for seed bed preparation with the added benefit of not negatively influencing soil nutrient cycling or increasing erosion potential. In addition, sheep grazing summer fallow may significantly reduce use and thus selection pressure for glyphosate resistant weeds by precluding the need to control weeds with glyphosate. Our goal is the profitable incorporation of sheep into grain production systems to reduce pesticide and fossil fuel use in fallow and stubble management. Our objectives are: 1: Compare two crop systems and three management systems (in 3 year rotation only) on: a) Grain and forage production b) weed composition, c) Population dynamics of two problematic weed species, d) Nitrogen cycling, e) Abundances and diversity of pest and beneficial insects associated with different crops, bordering crops(annual, perennial, and fallow), and fallow treatments, g) Abundances and activities of pollinators associated with alfalfa and flowering weeds. The crop rotations are 1) Continuous spring wheat - long term project control. 2) Three year rotation, spring wheat - spring planted forage pea/hay barley intercrop- summer fallow in a three year rotation with each component present every year. Within the three year rotation the management systems are: 1) No-till with sheep grazing to manage summer fallow, crop residues, and to harvest the forage crop; 2) Minimum tillage with herbicides use to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage for seed bed preparation; 3) Conventional Tillage used to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage used for seed bed preparation. 2: Using production, input data, and peer reviewed published results to compare profitability and cash flow of our two crop systems and three management systems. 3: Conduct `on campus' field demonstrations and cooperate with local high school to include student field and lab work in sustainable ag in the biological sciences. Publish and communicate results and potential economic and biological advantages of incorporating sheep grazing of stubble and weeds into a sustainable grain farming system. Our interdisciplinary team of scientists anticipates a positive long term biological and economical outcome from the integrated system of weed management by sheep grazing, and significant reduction in herbicide use in the Northern Great Plains. The proposed system encourages profitable cooperation between diverse agricultural enterprises by linking a source of inexpensive feed for sheep producers with a successful pest control method for grain farmers."

Export of U.S.-grown lentils to Sri Lanka was chosen as the focal point for this proposed project since recent research and data indicate that there exists a greater potential for expanding lentil exports to this country market in the South Asia due to the increasing income and greater preference for lentils. Although U.S. lentil growers have increased their share of the Sri Lankan market (valued at $52M in 2007), they have not fully exploited it. Given this potential export opportunity, this project aims to understand the value chain and develop appropriate marketing strategies that are crucial in achieving a competitive edge in the Sri Lankan market."

Once in a dried or reduced water activity state the bacterium becomes much more heat resistant, making effective decontamination measures technically challenging. Here in the U.S., suspected contamination of dried products and ingredients frequently leads to a large number of recalls, which in recent years has included such products as nuts, dietary supplements, fermented sausage, pet food, tea, cereals, snack foods and herbs and spices. The recent outbreak of salmonellosis attributed to contaminated peanut butter has served to illustrate the complexity of the food supply chain. The proposed work will use microbiological challenge studies and new molecular tools to study the stress response of Salmonella during desiccation and rehydration prior to and during industrial thermal processing. This work will provide important data on the heat resistance of Salmonella after different treatments of desiccation and rehydration. More importantly, this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of the response to Salmonella under conditions of desiccation stress prior to heat stress which will allow the design of effective validation studies."

In addition to its economical importance, viruses described here use an array of unconventional tools to express encoded genes. Little is known how carmo-, panico-, and umbraviruses are able to recruit translation machinery in the absence of canonical modifications in their genome. Even less is known of how they are able to break resistance encoded by natural recessive resistance genes. The success of plant breeding for improved avirulence determinants depends on how much we know about virus gene replication and expression. The purpose of this study is to determine the roles of RNA sequences from these three different viral genera in cap-independent translation initiation, their interaction with the protein synthesis machinery and how these interactions modify RNA structure using combination of structural and functional methods such as X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis. A detailed understanding of mechanism of cap-independent translation employed by these plant viruses will make it possible to 1. identify key regulatory steps and find common themes for viral translation shared with other economically important plant viruses that will ultimately suggest new ways to control viral disease and reduce crop losses in US and world; and 2. use the RNA translation signals to control expression of nonviral genes in transgenic plants expressing any gene of agricultural interest."

The key role of obligate endosymbionts to their sap-sucking insect hosts is nutritional. Obligate endosymbionts, such as Buchnera in aphids, provide essential amino acids deficient in the aphid's sap diet for the benefit of their insect host. Some beneficial facultative endosymbionts protect their insect host from natural enemies; natural enemies play an important role in reducing insect herbivore populations. This project attempts to tease apart how an aphid-Buchnera integrated metabolism functions in diverse aphid species and within a species (obj.1), and with and without facultative endosymbionts (obj.2). This research will contribute broadly to scientific knowledge relevant to agriculture, insect ecology and evolution, and symbiosis. All sap-sucking agricultural insect pests (e.g. psyllids, whiteflies, scale insects) possess obligate endosymbionts, analogous to Buchnera, in addition to facultative endosymbionts. The aphid-endosymbiont symbiosis, particularly the symbiosis of pea aphid and its Buchnera, is a model insect-endosymbiont system that is revolutionizing our understanding of endosymbiont evolution, regulation, and functional roles in hosts. Our proposed project will elucidate whether and how pest aphid species with different feeding ecologies interact with their obligate endosymbiont, Buchnera using a functional genomics approach. Additionally, a greater understanding of how mutualistic facultative endosymbionts metabolically interact with Buchnera and their aphid host will be accomplished from this research. Ultimately, this fundamental knowledge is required to understand which insect and bacterial genes are important for insect nutrition and aphid survival."

However, little research has been conducted on the evolutionary forces driving pathogen diversification and emergence. Xylella fastidiosa is a vector-borne xylem-limited bacterium that causes disease of economic importance in several crops such as grape, almond, and peach. The number of new diseases caused by X. fastidiosa has increased dramatically in recent years; however, the factors driving the emergence of these diseases and the mechanisms that allow the pathogen to adapt to new host environments are not understood. We recently found that X. fastidiosa is naturally competent and can recombine DNA acquired from the environment into its genome. We propose to characterize the biology of competency and determine what factors control its induction. We will investigate target genes identified by BLAST searches and previous microarray work for their role in transformation and recombination through molecular and biological assays. In addition, we will study the role of recombination in the evolution of X. fastidiosa's pathogenicity and determine what role if any its insect vector plays in promoting recombination events. We hypothesize that homologous recombination in X. fastidiosa occurs at high rates and that a constant reshuffle of genes throughout the genome results in the emergence of pathogenicity and new strains, which may drive epidemics. Understanding the role of horizontal gene transfer in the emergence of new diseases may help prevent future crop failure and famine resulting from pathogenic infections."

Unfortunately the rate of mortality suffered by colonies over the last 4 winters has been unsustainably high, threatening the livelihoods of not only the beekeepers who manage bees, but those who rely on bees for pollination. The project proposes to help beekeepers keep colonies alive by initiating several levels of surveys. These surveys will document which management practices beekeepers use and the degree of loss suffered by beekeepers. Using methods developed by human epidemiologists, we will compare the effectiveness of different management practices by calculating and comparing the losses suffered by those that did or did not use a particular management practice. In recognition of the fact that the most appropriate management practices for a beekeeper in one region is not necessarily the same for beekeepers in other regions, we will develop web and app based tools that will allow beekeepers to interact with the survey data to permit them to compare management practices among groups of beekeepers that share their geography, purpose (e.g. honey production, pollination), and/or management philosophy (e.g. minimal pesticide use). To facilitate this level of engagement we will develop a honey bee health database that will act as a repository for all honey bee health data collected from this and other bee health surveillance projects. This project is motivated by the conviction that beekeepers, when presented with beekeeper derived data that objectively shows which management practices worked and which did not, will adopt the more successful practices. This in turn will reduce colony losses, and increase the availability of pollinating units overall."

The Papilionoidaea legume subfamily includes the majority of legumes of agronomic value, such as alfalfa, soybean, chickpea, garden pea, and lentil. Estimates of the dietary intake of legumes show that this family is responsible for ~1/3 of the total protein intake in the human diet. In addition to their human dietary importance, certain legumes (e.g. alfalfa) are major forage crops important in sustaining livestock agriculture worldwide. Most legume species have the ability to form symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This is an unusual yet important feature, shared among few plants outside the legume family, enabling them to thrive in environments with minimal nitrogen input. Due to their nitrogen-fixing ability, they are also used as a rotation crop to enhance available soil nitrogen. Barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) has been studied extensively as a model legume since the 1990s, and work on this plant and its associated microbiota has resulted in significant advances in understanding of the basic biology of the legume, mechanisms of plant-microbe communication, and the biology of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. It is now recognized that bacteria and fungi accumulate in large, diverse populations at the plant root-soil interface (the rhizosphere). This microbial community accumulates to take advantage of the rich collection of nutrients secreted by the plant roots (plant root exudate). Some plant root exudate chemicals are demonstrated to act as signals to specific microbes. These signals can result in alterations to the rhizosphere microbial community that enhance plant nutrient uptake, aid in suppression of plant pathogens, and enable a symbiotic relationship between plant and microbe resulting in nitrogen fixation by certain bacteria in legume plant root nodules. We aim to identify genetic features of the plant that enable optimal microbial community assembly in the Medicago truncatula rhizosphere. While our work will be done with a legume, we strongly believe that the research will be relevant to rhizosphere microbial community assembly and function in all agriculture crops. This work will result in an increased knowledge of signaling pathways between plant and microbe that enhance plant health, plant productivity and sustainability of the agricultural system. Ultimately, crop breeders and plant genetic engineers will use knowledge generated from this research to select for crop varieties that will optimize their rhizosphere microbial community to enhance these features."

Studies in Arabidopsis and maize also show that transposable elements (TEs), which are targeted by endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), influence the expression of nearby genes through DNA or histone modifications. We hypothesize that changes in endogenous siRNAs targeting TEs and repeats in the genome influence gene expression during soybean seed development. The goal of the project is to determine whether the flux of endogenous small RNAs and the resulting changes in epigenetic states play a role in regulating gene expression programs during seed maturation and germination when storage reserves are being accumulated and remobilized, respectively. The proposed research is the first to focus on the role of endogenous siRNAs in seed filling and seed germination and will lay the foundation for a full appreciation of new regulatory mechanisms that program gene expression in the seed."

We will focus on the sustainable integration of diversified perennial-based cropping systems that supply feedstock for bioenergy and bioproducts as well as offer ecosystem services including those that offer crop protection for other crops such as soybean. Our goal is to 1) develop an agronomically-realistic platform for the production of perennial bioenergy crops, and 2) support a knowledge-based strategy for integration of bioenergy cropping systems in a way that supports ecosystem services that lead to reduced pest pressures in surrounding crops. The ecosystem service that we are targeting is biological control of the soybean aphid, a devastating invasive pest. We will focus on four bioenergy cropping systems; a polyculture mix comprising forbs, legumes, and tall grass prairie species, a monoculture of willow, a mix of willow and herbaceous polyculture crops in an alley cropping configuration and a monoculture of soybean that will serve as the control. The study emphasizes two main objectives. First, we will compare crop growth and productivity of the various bioenergy cropping systems. This information will be used to estimate net energy balance and biomass conversion rates. Second, we will compare biological control of soybean aphid adjacent to three classes of bioenergy plantings and the control site. This will be done using a combination of sampling to determine the abundance of soybean aphids and their natural enemies, determinations of the extent of resource use in the biofuel plantings, and estimation of a biocontrol services index, which defines the contribution of surrounding landscapes to biological control. The biological control objective will also include releases of approved, exotic parasitoids of the soybean aphid. An understanding of the implications of diversified multi-species bioenergy cropping systems in the context of providing crop protection and ecosystem services benefits is critical to the long-term sustainability of multi-use landscapes. This research will provide information that will help make decisions on biomass cropping systems design, placement, and potential scale of influence as it relates to the surrounding landscape.

Previous studies have suggested that these bacteria may possess unique characteristics that allow them to interact with plants, but very little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating these responses. The elucidation of the genetic principles that govern the ability of these food-borne pathogens is critical for the development of effective prevention strategies. Our laboratory has developed a model system, using hydroponically-grown lettuce plants inoculated with non-pathogenic E. coli, to study the interactions of pathogens with food plants. In this proposal, we plan to use a similar experimental system in combination with advanced genetic technologies to study the interactions of E. coli O157:H7 with lettuce and spinach, and Salmonella with peanuts. The identification of the bacterial genes involved in attaching or in growing on plant leaves and roots will be accomplished. Genes with important role in these interactions will be identified and grouped according to function. Those genes will be selected for further study using microbiological, microscopic and molecular techniques. Depending on identified genes and their functions, appropriate control strategies will be designed to inhibit colonization and prevent contamination. This project will advance the understanding of the fundamental phenomena that allow these pathogenic bacteria to interact and survive on produce and eventually cause disease."

Young children remain the most affected by food allergies which have been on the rise for reasons that are not well understood. Peanut and wheat are two economically and nutritionally important crops associated with severe allergies. However, their ubiquitous use by the food industry makes it very hard for allergic individuals to find safe food choices, hence the need to reduce/eliminate allergens in these products. We hypothesize that, under the right combination of physico-chemical and enzymatic processing conditions, food allergens can be reduced or inactivated through various mechanisms that target their vulnerabilities as proteins. Preliminary data obtained in our lab provide promising indication of the potential for this approach in peanut. This proposal seeks to (1) demonstrate the effectiveness of post-harvest processing of peanut and wheat with endopeptidases and physicochemical treatment in reducing the concentrations of target allergens, (2) confirm the reduction of allergic potential of treated products in patients through clinical testing, and (3) evaluate the sensory acceptability and quality of treated peanut and wheat products. The most effective processing conditions (as judged by immunoassays) will be used to produce samples for confirmation of reduced allergenicity using basophil activation assays in leukocytes from allergic patients. Processing conditions that lead to minimum histamine release in-vitro will be used to process products for skin prick testing among allergic patients to confirm safety. Subsequently, sensory acceptability and quality of hypoallergenic products will be assessed and used as indicator of their commercial potential."

While OTA has been associated with nephropathic diseases in animals and humans, its nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, immunosuppressive, mutagenic, and teratogenic potency has been shown in animal studies. Due to the diverse growth characteristics, the toxigenic fungi and OTA have been found in exceptionally wide variety of agricultural commodities worldwide including cereal grains, nuts, dried fruits, spices, meat, milk, and many processed foods made from these commodities including wine, beer, infant formula and baby foods. Most studies on OTA in food have been conducted in European countries where OTA levels are regulated. Currently, no regulation for OTA in foods has been set in the U.S. and there is an urgent need for up-to-date information on the incidence and levels of OTA as the international trade of agricultural products has been increased dramatically to meet the changing consumer demand. We propose this project to provide data on the emerging OTA issues by comprehensive national survey followed by health risk assessment of foodborne OTA for general public and high-risk population.

The processing-induced changes can include physical removal of allergens, changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of the allergnic protein, chemical modifications, and changes to the primary structure of the allergenic proteins through proteolysis including fermentation. However, the assessment of the residual allergenicity of processed foods can be very challenging because analytical methods often depend upon the solubility and antigenic reactivity of the allergenic protein. Preliminary results indicate that the detection of milk residues is diminished by thermal processing. This proposal aims to do a more thorough assessment of the effects of a range of processing methods, including both physical and biological processes, on the detection of residues of two key allergenic foods, milk and peanut, using the most common commercial assays. Based on the preliminary results, the likelihood exists that these current methods will not be sufficiently robust. Thus the final phase of the project will involve the development of improved approaches to residue detection such as oligoclonal immunoassays, use of processing-altered antigens to make better antibodies, use of more aggressive extraction methods and various combined approaches."

An estimated 35% of the global production of plant-based food comes from crops that benefit from animal pollination. Bees are by far the most important pollinators in agricultural settings and contribute between $5.7 to $19 billion per year to the United States economy and $217 billion per year globally. The most widely-used bee for crop pollination is the European honey bee, Apis mellifera. Honey bees are ideal pollinators in many crop systems. However, honey bee populations in North America and Europe are experiencing declines, primarily due to heavy pathogen and parasite loads. The progressive decline of honey bee populations in North America over the past 50 years and the dramatic loss of honey bees due to colony collapse disorder (CCD) in 2007 suggest that the exclusive reliance of agricultural pollination on one bee species remains extremely risky. While honey bees are important crop pollinators, they are certainly not the only crop pollinators. Native bees (species of bees that are native to North America) play an important, but underappreciated, role in crop pollination. The economic contribution of our native bees to agricultural pollination is almost certainly high, but has rarely been quantified. More and more evidence suggests that the contribution of native bees to agriculture is often substantial, yet under-appreciated. Apples are an economically important crop in the United States that is likely pollinated substantially in some areas and under some conditions by wild, native bees. Apples are the second highest value non-citrus fruit produced in the United States. In 2008 apple production was valued at $2.19 billion, second only to grapes ($3.34 billion) and very close to almonds ($2.26 billion). Surveys of apple orchards over the past century have indicated that orchards provide viable habitat for a surprising diversity of wild, native bees, particularly species in the genera Andrena, Bombus, Halictus, Lasioglossum, and Osmia. Such native pollinators provide pollination services for free in many cases and may serve as insurance against declines in honey bee populations across the United States. A number of studies indicate that native bees may be better apple pollinators on a per-visit basis than honey bees. No previous studies have attempted to quantify the potentially important role of native bees in apple pollination. Our project will focus on characterizing the community (the number of species and their relative abundance) of native bees in apple orchards in the eastern United States. Our project will be the first attempt to examine the role that the native bee community plays in commercial apple production in the eastern United States. We will identify how management practices, such as pesticide/herbicide use, impact the species richness and abundance of native bees in apple orchards. We will also examine the impact of both bee abundance and bee species richness on the level of fruit set. Our study will result in specific guidelines for growers on effective management of native bees for commercial apple pollination."

Formal apprenticeship in managed dairy grazing using the framework the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development has utilized for years. This model uses classroom education through the Wisconsin Technical College System as well as on-farm employment by master farmers.Despite increased public interest in local food systems and sustainable farming, the dairy industry continues to lose small and mid-sized farms. Young people are not entering dairy farming at rates that offset the loss of retiring producers. At the same time, family farmers who utilize  managed grazing  in their dairy operation are profitable but have few opportunities for investment and growth. In managed grazing systems, livestock are rotated through paddocks of high quality legumes and grasses, which are then allowed to rest and re-grow. This cost effective farming method works with biological processes to build natural resources and to ensure that animals are healthy and productive. Biological constraints, however, such as the distance a cow can walk from the pasture to the milking parlor, limit the size of managed grazing farms. Confinement dairy operations have expanded to meet industry milk supply needs by increasing the number of cows on a single site. The trend toward consolidation and expansion leads to highly capital-intensive farming, which essentially prohibits young or beginning farmers from entering into ownership. Formal apprenticeship in Managed Dairy Grazing as an alternative way to farm that will keep building the dairy industry and keep the dairy processing sector flush with enough milk to meet its needs. The long-term goal of GrassWorks Apprenticeship Program is to establish more small and mid-sized sustainably managed dairy farms in Wisconsin and the region. To accomplish that goal, the program will meet the following supporting objectives: 1.) establish formal apprenticeship as a new career path for entrant and beginning dairy farmers and 2.) create new models of investment and/or transition for established managed grazing dairy farmers that gives beginning farmers a stake in farm ownership. The program will prepare young people to become owners and operators of managed grazing dairy farms through a formal apprenticeship established by the Department of Workforce Development, GrassWorks as the Industry Sponsor, and the Wisconsin Technical College System. Apprentices will become Journeymen and finally Masters in a career path similar to that of electricians, plumbers and comparably skilled workers in other industries. Dairy Grazier Apprentices will work on-the-farm under an established Master Grazier, who has had training in mentoring an apprentice. Concurrently, apprentices will be enrolled in related courses at the Wisconsin Technical College System or University of Wisconsin."

Approximately 20,000 of the tribe's 28,000 members live on the main section of the Tohono O'odham Reservation. The community is American Indian, rural, and economically poor. In 2004, employment was found to be 24 percent lower than the Arizona state average, with 363 per 1,000 residents employed (CCPR-WPC 2008). The 2000 Census reports that 50.6% of Tohono O'odham households with children live below the poverty level (compared to the U.S. average of 13.6%). For over a thousand years, the Tohono O'odham were a self-sufficient farming society, producing all of their own food in the Sonoran desert. As late as the 1930s, traditional water harvesting techniques, known ak chin (monsoon flood plain) farming, enabled the cultivation of more than 20,000 acres. Traditional agriculture had dwindled to 2,500 acres by 1949. By 2000, this number was further reduced to fewer than 10 acres of traditional crops. The diagnosis of type-II Diabetes among the Tohono O'odham correlates with the demise of their traditional agriculture. In 1960, type-II diabetes was virtually unknown within the community. Today, more than 60% of adults suffer from the disease, the highest rate in the world. In the 1990's, the crisis intensified, with the childhood onset of type -II diabetes becoming common. Tohono O'odham children as young as six years old suffer from the disease. Currently 76% of Tohono O'odham 6th- 8th graders are overweight or obese (+85 %ile). Tepary beans and other traditional foods have been proven to regulate blood sugar levels and may delay the onset of type-II diabetes. Regaining food self- sufficiency -- producing local, nutritionally-appropriate crops in the community -- can help disrupt the diabetes epidemic.  A New Generation of O'odham Farmers  can support this effort through training that will increase access to traditional foods in the community. The  New Generation  program will implement two activities. 1) Training, Professional Development, and Capacity Building: Over three years, the  New Generation  program will provide multi-site internships, workforce training, and preparation for farming as a career. All 65 trainees will learn farming skills, conservation practices, crop technologies, and basic farm safety. The  New Generation  program has three training tracks to prepare a variety of beginning farmers: a) One-year Agriculture Apprenticeships - 3 per year/ 9 total; b) Professional Development for Agricultural Workers - 32 Tohono O'odham who are currently employed in low-level agriculture jobs will participate in multi-year, ongoing workforce development; and c) Summer Youth Internships - 8 high school students per summer: 24 total. 2) Establishing a Learning Center & Teaching Farm: A working traditional farm will become a center for training, education, outreach, and technical assistance. The Learning Center will enable recruitment, youth participation, and a setting for farmers-in-training to apply what they are learning. It also will provide a model for culturally- and environmentally- appropriate farming."

The large travel distances increase both cost and time required and the relatively few extension specialists at MSU in the IPM area are primary constraints to IPM implementation. Therefore this proposal addresses this need with Extension IPM Associates and funding for travel and program support. Primary Coordination Program Emphasis will include: IPM Implementation for Agronomic Crops: wheat, barley forage crops (alfalfa), oilseeds (safflower, canola and camelina) and seed legumes ( dry peas, lentils and chickpeas);; IPM Implementation for Specialty crops (seed potatoes, sugarbeets, and dry beans); and IPM Training for Consumer and Urban Environments (consumers, home landscape businesses, public facilities (parks, city forestry) and Master Gardner training). Secondary coordination program emphasis includes: IPM Support for Pest Diagnostic Facilities; IPM education for Pesticide Applicators: IPM Training and Implementation in Schools; and IPM Partnerships in Wide-Area Pest Monitoring and Reporting Systems (weather-based pest prediction, cutworm prediction, NPDN) These programs are built on the expertise of the MT IPM team and state needs in terms of pest problems, technical assistance and IPM education with overall goals driven by the National Road Map for IPM. New emphasis will include: IPM Training and Implementation in Schools, IPM, building a web-based weather-based IPM information system linked to regional assets for Montana and continued expansion of the web-based High Plains IPM Guide cooperatively with IPM specialists in Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Outcomes will be better educated growers, landscape and turf businesses and public building mainatinance personnel.

In Arabidopsis, silencing of HOG1 has resulted in significant increase in yield and biomass. We will also use TL constructs for down-regulation of lignin biosynthetic genes, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), hydroxycinnamoyl CoA: shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) and coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3'H) to decrease lignin content in rice. Further, we will use TL constructs to understand the mechanism of rust resistance in common bean. Two loci, Ur-3 and Crg, are known to provide resistance to rust. Silencing of Ur-3 and Crg sequences through TL construct will shed light on the much needed mechanism of rust resistance in common bean. The project will lead to: 1) improved grain yield and biomass in rice, 2) reduced lignin in rice straw for biofuel, 3) better understanding of rust resistance in common bean, 4) trained undergraduate/graduate minority students in biotechnology, 4) establishment of collaboration between UAPB and other institutions, and 5) strengthened research and teaching capacity of UAPB."

These markets and the market need for small maneuverable harvesters for research plots and breeder blocks have created a need for an inexpensive, but efficient, camelina harvester. The Seedster has the potential for meeting the demand for a camelina harvester that is inexpensive, variable width, maneuverable, has quick seed unloading and rapid cleanout. In Phase I Native Seedsters, Inc. (NSI) tested the basic Seedster technology which consists of counter-rotating brush and combing drum. The space in-between the brush and comb creates a 'pinch-point' where seed is plucked from the plant inflorescence. The first harvest of camelina with a Seedster resulted in a product that was 50% (by weight) seed, 40% seed capsule halves and 10% stems. In commercial camelina seed production the receiving elevators allows only 4.5% tare. To improve upon the purity of Seedster harvested seed a screening device was designed and tested. This device consisted of semi-cylindrical 9/64  round-hole screen which housed a 9  auger. During the second year of the Phase I project the seed purity was improved from 50% to 97% with the addition of the screening device. Although Phase I met or exceeded 4 of the 5 Performance Goals, the seed recovery efficiency was still not high enough to be competitive. In Phase I, the 40  Test-Bed Seedster capture only 59% of the total seed from stands yielding 1,100 lbs/acre and 70% of the seed in stands yielding 550 lbs/acre. The seed loss was attributed to a) seed shatter upon initial contact with the main brush, b) seed carry over on the combing drum and c) seed that 'stalled out' in the dislodgement chamber and fell back out the pinch-point because of insufficient airflow to carry the seed all the way to the seed hopper. In the Phase I Test-Bed the majority of the airflow for transporting the dislodged seed to the seed hopper was created by the main brush, with supplemental air and direction created by the air assist brush. In Phase I this airflow was insufficient to transport all of the heavy, rounded camelina seed to the seed hopper. In Phase II, a 60  Test-Bed Seedster will be assembled that is capable of configuration and reconfigurations to address these seed losses. The air-assist brush will be replaced with a tangential flow fan, positioned behind the combing drum to direct and propel all dislodged seed from the dislodgement chamber into the collection hopper, eliminating carry-over on the combing drum. The combing drum will be adjusted forward, thus making the distance between the pinch-point and the point of initial contact closer, reducing initial shatter. Various brush bristle densities and various combing drum surfaces (greater static friction) will be tested for maximizing seed dislodgement. An 8/64  round-hole screen will be tested in the screening device to try to improve seed purity to 99%. If the Phase II Performance Goals are met the Seedster will be a viable camelina seed harvest alternative for many farmers and researchers."

The state's IPM program has advanced pest management methods that meet the economic, ecological and societal expectations of clientele with the goals of providing effective and economical pest management methodologies, reducing the use of high risk pesticides, and protecting human health and the environment from pests and pest management tactics. This is a three-year (FY 2010 through FY 2012) EIPM-CS Coordination Program project for integrated pest management coordination and Extension activities in North Carolina in five program emphasis areas: IPM Implementation in Agronomic Crops, IPM Implementation in Animal Agriculture, IPM Implementation in Specialty Crops, IPM Training and Implementation in Housing, and IPM Training and Implementation in Schools. The designated Extension IPM Coordinator at North Carolina State University will involve Extension faculty and county agents in IPM activities, communicate program successes, and maintain stakeholder input via an established Advisory Committee and six newly-created IPM working groups. North Carolina State University faculty and staff as well as faculty and staff from North Carolina A&T State University will conduct IPM-related applied research, demonstration and training activities for specified crops and settings to achieve project objectives. The seventeen project objectives will address stakeholder priorities for IPM in agronomic crops (i.e., corn, cotton, peanuts, small grains and soybeans), poultry and livestock (swine), fruit (i.e., apples, blackberries, blueberries, grapes, peaches, raspberries and strawberries) and vegetable crops, ornamental and nursery crops (including Christmas trees), and children's environments (i.e., child care centers and schools). Three of these objectives will focus on the need for acceptable integrated pest management practices by small and organic farmers in the state. Results of the project will provide stakeholders in North Carolina with IPM practices that are economical, environmentally sound and protective of human health."

Honey beekeepers currently face numerous problems including Varroa mites, American foulbrood, Africanized bees and most recently colony collapse disorder. These problems have led to a shorter supply of colonies and consequently higher rental prices in the United States. It is sensible to have more than one pollinator available to growers in case shortages become worse in the future. The blue orchard bee, Osmia lignaria, is a solitary, native bee that has been shown to be an excellent pollinator of several crops including almonds, cherries and apples. Almonds are the United States? largest specialty export crop and their production depends on bee pollination. Domestication and large-scale management of blue orchard bee is still developing, but there are already several business entities working with this species as an alternative pollinator. One of the management difficulties experienced with this bee is that many will fly away from their emergence site, and not return. It is not uncommon to lose up to half of the emerging females to such dispersal. In cooperation with USDA-ARS, AgPollen LLC conducted three blue orchard bee nest attractant field studies in 2009 with Phase I SBIR funding. These trials demonstrated that extract of a bee nest product could increase nesting by up to 2.7-fold compared to the control. Fractionation of the extract showed that free fatty acids and hydrocarbons were the most active in attracting bees to nests. A test of several free fatty acids found in the extract showed that three of them could increase nesting, and one of them increased nesting 8-fold compared to the control. The research proposed here will expand upon these results to optimize which chemical or chemical blend can most improve nesting success. This research will be a cooperative effort between AgPollen LLC and USDA-ARS. Jordi Bosch (CREAF, Autonomous University of Barcelona), an expert on Osmia species, has agreed to provide consulting services. Karin Anderson, postdoctoral researcher (AgPollen), will conduct the research under the direction of James Buckner (USDA-ARS), Theresa Pitts-Singer (USDA-ARS), Stephen Peterson (AgPollen) and David Moreland (AgPollen). Chemical extractions and analysis will be conducted at the USDA-ARS Biosciences Research Laboratory in Fargo, North Dakota, and field bioassays will be conducted at the USDA-ARS Bee Biology and Systematics Laboratory in Logan, Utah and at AgPollen field sites in California. Suterra, a leader in pheromone technology will provide assistance in formulation and release technology under a subcontract to this project. Paramount Farming Company, has agreed to cooperate on this project. The product developed from this enabling research would greatly enhance the rate of commercialization of blue orchard bee in almond production systems. By multiplying blue orchard bee populations more rapidly, orchardists will benefit from an alternative pollinator sooner, which will in turn help to secure an important segment of United States agriculture."

A second component will involve animal scientist that will explore the potential use of diverse crops for livestock feed. These projects will specifically consider peas as feed for dairy and range cattle, pea forage for growing beef cattle, and cold-pressed oilseed (camelina) meal as a source of protein and energy in swine diets. Utilizing the products of these crops locally or on the farm minimizes transportation costs. The last component will consider the potential of optimizing the inter-crop fallow periods. Treatments will evaluate the potential of using inter-crop fallow periods to grow cover-crops that utilize the excess water to compete with weeds, sequester or fix nitrogen, enhance microbial activity, and encourage beneficial insects. The potential of using these crops as a forage resource will also be examined. These systems will be evaluated across the moisture gradient of the humid and arid parts of the Northern Great Plains.

Investment in specialty crop research, education, and marketing is critical for the maintenance and expansion of these crops as a vital component of Indiana agriculture, particularly, in the southwestern part of the state, which has unique agroecological characteristics for growing specialty crops. Additionally, such investments will serve as an engine for economic growth by generating new opportunities, diversifying production systems, reducing impacts of production practices on the environment and improving the nutritional quality of diets. Specialty crops grown in Indiana include a variety of horticultural crops such as fruits and nuts, vegetables, ornamentals and organic agronomic crops, including new crops such as botanicals and medicinals. Importantly, the geographic and climatic conditions in southwest Indiana make it ideal for fruit and vegetable production as well as greenhouse production of nursery crops. Expanded capacity there would fill a production niche between crops grown in Florida and Arizona from the south and Wisconsin and Michigan from the north. Furthermore, approximately 40% of the nation's population lives within a 500-mile radius of Vincennes and Evansville, making same-day distribution of fresh produce and floricultural crops feasible. With an increase in specialty crop production, there will be a need for a well-educated, technically savvy workforce. Purdue University has had a long partnership with Vincennes University, and together the two institutions could offer degrees, courses, and training to prepare students to enter the workforce, thereby enhancing economic development and jobs creation in the region. Purdue University has a long-term presence in southwest Indiana with its Southwest Purdue Agricultural Center (SWPAC) located at Vincennes. This Center has maintained two to three research and Extension staff who have supported the fruit and vegetable industry, primarily melons and stone fruit. They have also worked with Vincennes University's agriculture program to teach courses and to train students at SWPAC in production management practices. The opportunities to promote production, processing and marketing of specialty crops in southwest Indiana have only been met partially, and the potential for enhancement of such efforts is tremendous, with its concomitant significant impact on the economy of the region. The emphasis on specialty crops and local production will become even more important as increasing energy costs limit availability of affordable and fresh produce from distant locations. Expanding the capacity of the SWPAC will serve as the research and extension engine that will drive the growth of specialty crop production in southwest Indiana, while the processing and marketing of specialty crops will greatly increase the overall economic growth of the region."

The goal in all production systems is to tip the competitive balance to favor the crop over the weed. The choice of crop variety is of utmost importance in this battle. If a variety is  competitive  it will emerge well under stressful conditions, capture moisture, light, and available nutrients, suppress weeds, and be tolerant of insect pests and diseases. For centuries plant breeders have been selecting for varieties that have the highest yields under pest-free and nutrient-rich conditions. Organic farmers need varieties that perform well under their production systems which may differ in nutrient availability and pest pressure compared with conventional systems. In conventional production systems navy bean cultivars yield more than black bean cultivars. However, black beans produced greater yields than navy beans in organic trials. These yield differences in dry bean class and variety may in part be due to differences in nitrogen fixation and uptake by bean root systems. Nitrogen availability in organic systems is largely dependent on the crop rotation, including the planting of cover crops. Red clover is a common cover crop which when tilled into the soil supplies an available form of nitrogen for the following crop. Rye and oilseed radish are not legumes, but both may increase nitrogen availability to dry beans by mineralization of nitrogen during the summer months. By researching the incorporation of cover crops into organic dry bean production systems we will determine which cover crop (or lack thereof) supports the nodulation and uptake of nitrogen for optimum seed yield in organic dry bean production systems. Including cover crops prior to planting dry beans may help in weed suppression. Some cover crops such as cereal rye suppress germinating weed seedlings due to release of allelopathic compounds. However, weed suppression by these compounds is short-lived and therefore producers must manage emerging weeds by other means, including rotary hoeing and cultivation. The vigor of the dry bean variety is very important because it is difficult to cultivate weeds when the crop is not growing vigorously. Furthermore, cover crop residues may assist or hinder weed management by mechanical methods in the weeks following dry bean planting. On-farm trials will provide much needed information on how to manage weeds in cover crop/no cover crop residue situations in organic dry bean production. Organic dry bean producers must also manage insect and disease pests. In this regard cover crops can be either a help or a hindrance. For example,  Colonel  oilseed radish is a well known variety that suppresses nematode pests. On the other hand, if beans are planted too close to the incorporation of a cover crop insects like seed corn maggot can become a problem. Western bean cutworm is a relatively new pest that is of concern to all dry bean producers. It is currently unclear what role dry bean variety and cover crops play in negating or enhancing the infestation of this pest."

The North Dakota American Indian (AI) population, primarily the Spirit Lake Nation, shares many of the same issues regarding academic achievement and these are based in poverty. Poverty stricken community members, regardless of urban or rural status, are less like to attempt education and less likely to complete education if they are to start. The lack of participants in the Agriculture and Natural Resources Management Program of Studies are affected due to the historical trauma experienced by AI. The land allotted to Spirit Lake enrolled members was in heavily treed or land that was not conducive for planting. Excess land not allotted and land that was more suitable for farming was sold to non-Natives; thus, a checker board reservation with the good land going to non- Natives. Mni Wakan Dakota Oyate (Spirit Lake Dakota People) were historically agriculturists in that they planted 19 varieties of squash as well as corn, and a variety of beans, to supplement the hunting and gathering for which they are more widely known.

Research needs to address the issues currently facing growers so that they can achieve competitive yields in a sustainable manner. The proposed research will benefit Michigan dry bean growers by reducing yield losses caused by potato leaf hopper, and the use of pesticides to control the pest. Enhanced levels of potato leaf hopper resistance in future dry bean varieties would facilitate the transition from conventional to organic production practices of dry beans in Michigan, and reduce the need and costs of expensive pesticide control. The savings from improved productivity due to lower yield losses and the reduction in pesticide use, would contribute to sustained productivity of a vital commodity and an important industry in Michigan. Breeding for adaption to the local growing environments has proven extremely successful to meet challenges worldwide over time. On-going work has identified unadapted sugarbeet germplasm with good germination in over 150 mM NaCl salt solutions as well as good field emergence, however these results and germplasm selections need to be validated under highly saline field conditions, a project being done with colleagues in Egypt. We propose to apply molecular transcription profiling tools to better understand the genetic basis for salt tolerance in beets, with particular effort to discover genes differentially expressed under varying salt levels and between germplasm showing tolerant and intolerant phenotypes. The resulting knowledge and materials will be further developed in the form of new germplasm and molecular genetic markers. The sugarbeet cyst nematode is considered the most important soil-borne pest of sugarbeet worldwide, and has recently been identified as a serious pest for many Michigan sugarbeet growers. Historically, this pest has been managed through crop rotation and limited use of fumigant and non-fumigant nematicides. The goal of this aspect of the proposal is to introgress these newer sources of nematode resistance into a well-adapted Great Lakes genetic background suitable for release to the sugarbeet seed industry. Management of weeds in sugarbeet production continues to be a challenge. The 2008 growing season was the first wide-spread commercialization of glyphosate-resistant (Roundup Ready) sugarbeet. The acceptance of this technology has simplified weed management in Michigan sugarbeet fields. However, the development of glyphosate-resistant weeds is a major concern with the increased use of glyphosate for weed control in most crops grown in rotation. Incorporating other weed management strategies including the use of cover crops to suppress initial weed emergence and growth may reduce the need for relying only on glyphosate for weed control in sugarbeet. In current production systems glyphosate will need to be applied three or more times to control weeds and maximize sugarbeet yield. Incorporating cover crops into sugarbeet production systems may reduce the number of glyphosate applications for summer annual weed control."

Maine farms produce a wide variety of agricultural commodities including grain crops such as corn, soybeans, and canola, fruit crops such as apples, strawberries, and blueberries, as well as broccoli, dry beans, peas, and multiple other vegetable crops. The potato industry, however, is the top agricultural sector in the State of Maine with a total economic value to the state of over $500 million, including farm-gate receipts of $100 million, and employing over 6,000 individuals. In order to ensure the sustainability and economic viability of Maine's potato industry, timely and efficient management of pests is crucial. A successful IPM program can not only potentially reduce production costs through decreased pesticide applications but, through the use of effective monitoring techniques, can ultimately save growers millions of dollars in potential crop losses. Integrated pest management programs, such as those offered by the University of Maine Cooperative Extension Service, play a pivotal role in supporting the Maine potato industry by offering assistance directly to growers. The University of Maine Cooperative Extension's Potato Integrated Pest Management Program impacts approximately 56,000 acres of potatoes. The program employs 18 seasonal program aides, maintains nearly 150 specialized insect traps, coordinates a statewide network of electronic weather stations, and surveys 100 potato fields on a weekly basis for weeds, insects and diseases. The data produced helps IPM scientists track potential pest outbreaks and helps provide growers with current information on specific and timely treatments in order to minimize the number of pesticide applications and maximize potato yield. The current market demand for perfect, pest and damage-free produce and crops, combined with the public's desire to decrease pesticide use for human health and environmental reasons, creates a difficult challenge for Maine potato growers. Homeowners and growers are increasingly at odds over the application of pesticides on farms adjacent to new or existing housing developments. The Potato IPM Program plays an integral role in ensuring that Maine's potato crop is pest and damage free while attempting to minimize the amount of pesticides that are applied. The presence of late blight in Maine during the 2009 crop year has produced the potential for inoculum to be widespread in 2010. Although, potato late blight does not typically survive Maine winters, early snow cover, could facilitate the proliferation of volunteer potatoes, which could serve as a host for late blight. This potential inoculum source, combined fungicide resistance of the late blight organism, and the confirmed presence of both the US-8 and the US-14/17 late blight strains, have the potential to create a considerable threat to the Maine potato industry's 2010 crop. For the 2010 crop year and beyond, it will be imperative for growers to eliminate all inoculum sources by controlling volunteers, cull piles, and by planting only late blight free seed."

Specially, canopy management and irrigation management of orchard and vineyard crops were identified as the most critical needs of the industry. To address these needs we have assembled a team of trans-disciplinary, multi-state researchers, industry leaders, and cross-commodity groups and developed this project. It addresses three legislatively mandated areas - (i) efforts to improve production efficiency, productivity, and profitability over the long term, (ii) new innovations and technology, and (iii) potential food safety hazards. This project uses proximal sensors mounted on a mobile platform to provide the information desired by stakeholders. These include information on canopy architecture and light interception using Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) sensors (- enhance yield and/or quality by proper canopy management), plant-soil water status using a sensor suite consisting of a thermal IR gun, ambient temperature, humidity and wind speed sensors (- improve water use efficiency). Moreover, this project aims to develop a data visualization software and a decision support system to assist with management decisions. Variable rate water application using a wireless network to address spatio-temporal variability in plant-soil moisture status is also being addressed (- enhance yield, improve quality and/or conserve water). Finally, this proposal addresses the socio-economic implications of proposed senor technology. Four states in the western region - Arizona (pecans), California (almonds, grapes, and walnuts), Oregon (hazelnuts), and Washington (tree-fruits and grapes) - will participate in this project. The expected outcomes of this project are - (i) field verified sensors mounted on mobile platforms for measuring canopy architecture and plant water status, (ii) a decision support system to implement canopy management and irrigation management based on sensor data, (iii) development of a technology to apply water to individual or block of trees based on soil and plant water status, and (vi) determination of socio-economic implications of the developed technologies. Outreach has been integrated into the project plan and each state will implement various activities (i.e., webinars, presentations at commodity group annual meetings, demonstrations at field days, etc.) starting with the second year of the project. An advisory board has been setup to ensure that stakeholders continue to play a key role during the course of the project."

With pollinators, a similar reliance on just the honey bee is no less a folly. Many projects are dealing with threats (CCD) to the honey bee, but to truly address the threats to pollination there should be contingency plans that include the development of alternative pollinators and baseline data to measure future impacts on our native bees. Developing multiple tactics with multiple pollinator species represents the most robust management approach for a future of uncertain climate, environmental disruptions, and invasive species introductions. What is certain is that: a) the supply of honey bees in the U.S. will not be able to meet the demand for pollination services; b) that production costs for honey bees will go up; and c) that the cost to growers to rent honey bee hives will continue to increase. The economic impacts of pollinator shortages on US specialty crops could be considerable and for fruit growers have resulted in a 3 fold increase in the cost of renting hives. Rising costs combined with declining yields would lead to higher prices of US nuts, fruits and vegetables which would reduce exports of major commodities during a record US trade deficit. Another 3,500 non-Apis bee species in the US,however,are also important pollinators. These include bumble bees and many species of solitary bees which are collectively known as pollen bees. The value of pollen bees in US agriculture is conservatively estimated at $3 billion annually. The importance of native bees in the pollination of fruit in the Mid-Atlantic region has been underestimated due to our unique landscape ecology of agricultural and non-agricultural lands and the mosaic of diversified fruit and vegetable farms. These impart unique advantages in pollinator conservation and utilization compared to the monocultures of the Midwest or dry areas of the West. For most bee species, the paucity of long-term population data and our incomplete knowledge of even basic taxonomy, life history and ecology makes assessing their value and possible declines in some regions very difficult. Wild and managed species of pollen bees in many cases can supplement honey bees for pollination, and, in some situations, replace them. The National Research Council's Committee on the Status of Pollinators in North America (2007) issued a report assessing pollinators in North America. Our proposal applies the expertise of agricultural specialists in entomology,horticulture, ag economics, and ecology to address the NRC recommendations and long-term goals in the areas of basic discovery, research, extension, public outreach, and USDA-NRCS conservation programs for pollinators. Extension and outreach efforts of university extension and state governments will be coupled with the conservation expertise and outreach potential of the Xerces Society who represent many public and private groups outside of the agricultural sector."

Unfortunately, continuous cropping coupled with intensive tillage has resulted in compacted soils, reduced water infiltration, and increased soil erosion. Including a sod grass, such as bahiagrass or bermudagrass, into the crop rotation ameliorates some of the negative impacts of intensive peanut and cotton production and results in increased yields with reduced inputs. The overall objectives of this multi-state project are to: 1) develop and compare the economic and environmental benefits of conventional and sod-based farming systems using conservation tillage systems, 2) quantify the positive impact that sod based rotations have on soil health, pest reduction, sustainable farm production, and soil carbon sequestration, and 3) refine and promote production practices in a sod-based rotation which result in significant yield increases associated with decreased inputs. This project has the potential to improve producer income and stimulate rural economy in the Southeastern US. Furthermore, this project leads to sustainable production practices that benefit the environment by reducing nutrients losses, reducing nutrient inputs, sequestration of carbon, and reduced dependence on water resources for irrigation."

They not only presented threats to public health, but also diminished consumer confidence in U.S. food production systems and caused significant economic loss to the involved food companies due to recalls. President Obama's recently formed Food Safety Working Group (FSWG) and two 2009 federal legislation bills on food safety and protection (S. 510 and H.R. 2749) are clear indications of the U.S. government's determination to improve food safety and protect public health. Among those efforts, improving food traceability systems is identified as one of the most critical tasks, since current systems are often inadequate to respond to these outbreaks and are sometimes inaccurate in identifying contamination sources. Current government regulations and guidelines for traceability systems primarily focus on food safety and recalls. Many small and mid-size growers and food processors consider implementation of traceability systems as another burden to their business and have less incentive to actively implement new traceability systems, especially in the specialty crops industries. Unlike commodity crops such as wheat and corn, specialty crops are often unique in their production systems. The specialty crop growers are usually relatively small in scale, tend to be labor-intensive and have less automated production systems. They are more isolated and dispersed over large areas compared to commodity crops. Their production systems vary greatly due to the wide variation in specialty crops, from fruits to vegetables, herbs to hops, and berries to nursery crops. These differences increase the vulnerability of specialty crops and also present greater challenges for effective tracking and tracing The long term goal of this research proposal is to develop and collect the necessary information for future implementation of effective automated traceability systems to improve food safety (recalls), quality and productivity of U.S. specialty crop industries. An automated full-chain traceability system will not only reduce the amount of labor and time in data collection but also improve the accuracy of the data with time stamps and product locations. As a result, it will make the supply chain more visible and create more efficient management systems for inventory, shipping and receiving. A key point of this project is that it will investigate the economic and technical feasibility of how emerging technologies can be applied to improve the effectiveness of automated traceability systems in terms of food quality, productivity and energy efficiencies in addition to food recalls. By doing so, it will provide incentives for the specialty crop industries to implement full-chain traceability systems."

Highly visible cases of food-borne illness, such as Salmonella contamination in peanuts and poultry, E.coli contamination in lettuce, as well as increasing rates of cancer globally are drawing more attention to food safety and management at the farm level. The shift toward organic production and consumption is increasing the need for alternative control methods that are of low risk to health and the environment. Meanwhile, producers require cost effective management strategies in order to remain viable in the agriculture industry. The University of Georgia IPM program and collaborative efforts among UGA and other institutions have created an atmosphere conducive to programs which not only benefit the state of Georgia but the entire southern region. Specific, targeted pesticide applications and implementation of alternative management strategies (e.g. planting of resistant cultivars, use of Bt cotton) have reduced the overall number of pesticide applications and amount of active ingredients applied to agricultural crops. Currently, integrated management teams are developing and constantly refining IPM programs in many critical sectors of agriculture throughout the state of Georgia. Teams of IPM experts, including entomologists, plant pathologists, agronomists, weed scientists, and others, are currently at the forefront of pest management research and extension efforts in cotton, peanuts, fruits, vegetables, and poultry production. Coordination among these efforts provides efficient transfer of data from researchers and extension specialists to extension agents and grower groups. In addition, open communication links from specialists to stakeholders promotes input from stakeholders, outlining problems and concerns to be addressed by specialists. This two-way avenue of communication is critical to the success of any IPM program. Flexibility and adaptability of Georgia's IPM programs allow them to remain relevant and adequately serve stakeholders. It is expected that the outcomes/impacts of this program will result in changes in knowledge concerning the biology of new and emerging pest problems. Further, changes in action are expected as new and innovative pest management strategies are developed and tested by extension experts. Lastly, changes in environment due to higher agricultural productivity, improved animal health and production, a safer food supply, and a cleaner environement are expected from the work proposed here."

While there are many well developed oilseed crops none are efficient sources of these high value oils. Many undomesticated crops, particularly those adapted to harsh environments such as the desert, produce high levels of high value oils and waxes. The jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) shrub is one example. Jojoba  beans  can contain up to 70% by weight of a high molecular weight liquid wax that has been utilized as a replacement for sperm whale oil. There has been a long standing interest in developing renewable sources of high molecular weight oil products including the wax esters produced by jojoba, carnauba palm (Copernicia cerifera), and other species to meet this need. The high molecular weight oils and waxes produced by these plants have a variety of uses including as industrial lubricants, food additives, cosmetics, and as renewable stocks for synthesis of compounds such as various adhesives, emmoliants, PEG's, natural plastics, nylons, and more. In spite of considerable efforts in the past decades to develop efficient production schemes for native oil-bearing desert plants such as jojoba efficient production methods capable of meeting demand have not been devised. Conventional oilseed crops could potentially provide a natural and renewable resource for high value oils and waxes. Characterization of the wax biosynthetic pathway in jojoba led to the discovery of a wax synthase capable catalyzing high molecular weight wax formation. Homology searches of other plant genes identified 11 candidate wax synthase genes in A. thaliana that are similar to the jojoba wax synthase. We hypothesize that high value wax ester production in conventional Brassica oilseed crops like rape seed can be increased by altering regulation of genes already within these Brassica spp."

First, the high cost of implementing manure management strategies, such as installing and operating anaerobic digesters and therefore the need to optimize return on investment by developing value-added products from the residuals. Second is that biomass (particularly large quantities of agricultural residue like wheat straw, pea vines, and other residuals) has the potential to play a significant role in the future of combustion or co-combustion power plants. However, a drawback is that the overall energy yield of these materials is modest when compared to other potential sources. The project will develop a value-added industrial absorbent product from anaerobically-digested bovine manure fiber. In preliminary studies, fiber treated post-digestion to improve certain properties has shown significant promise as a superior absorbent for petroleum products. We will characterize and optimize these properties for several types of digesters. The optimized fiber absorbent will be delivered to test customers in order to evaluate its efficacy under industrial conditions and to survey customer satisfaction with the product. Following use, the fiber will be picked up from the customers and tested to determine its energy (BTU) content. This information will determine the potential of the product following use to absorb petroleum spills to augment the energy content of agricultural residues, thus making them a more efficient source of renewable energy."

A study conducted at five locations across the state that included irrigated and non-irrigated sites found that tall wheatgrass and grass mixtures that contained tall wheatgrass provided superior quality for ethanol production compared to several other species evaluated including switchgrass. Tall wheatgrass also contained higher cellulose and had lower lignin amounts which would increase ethanol production efficiency. In a separate study, grass plots harvested every other year produced approximately 25% less biomass yield than grasses harvested annually. Several experiments were seeded in spring 2009 to evaluate the potential biomass yield of kenaf, sunnhemp, sorghums, and millets. Initial results found sorghum and kenaf have the potential to produce above 10 ton/acre of dry matter in one season and could be used as annual feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol production in ND. A study to evaluate production potential of 22 varieties of sorghum that included BMR (Brown Mid Rib) hybrids was conducted at two locations in ND. The BMR character confers reduced lignin content which increases digestibility with a resulting increase in ethanol production. Unfortunately, varieties that contained the BMR character had less biomass production than the same variety without BMR. Studies are in progress to evaluate to yield potential of grass and grass legume mixtures compared to grasses grown alone. The long-term goal is to produce more biomass and thus more ethanol per acre with reduced inputs. Examples of mixtures include intermediate and tall wheatgrass, wheatgrass, alfalfa and sweet clover, or basin and alti wildrye. Sugarbeet pulp is used as a feedstock for ethanol production. A solids fed batch approach has shown that loadings up to 12% solids allowed near maximum yields with increased sugar concentrations for subsequent ethanol conversion compared to higher or lower percentages. Invasion of cool season perennial grasses into established switchgrass fields has become a serious problem and decreases potential ethanol production. A total of four pre-emergent and 23 post-applied herbicides have been evaluated for efficacy on switchgrass, quackgrass, and smooth bromegrass. Of these nine were chosen for further evaluation for weed control in an established switchgrass field. Pyroxulam, sulfosulfuron, and aminocyclopyrachlor provided the best smooth bromegrass control while sulfometuron and propoxycarbazone were most effective for quackgrass control. None of these herbicides injured switchgrass. An empirical model based on a mathematical programming algorithm was developed to determine the optimal number, location, and size of cellulose ethanol plants in North Dakota to maximize the use of biomass produced in the state. The goal is to minimize transportation costs of biomass to the plant and of ethanol from the plant to blending facilities."

Increasing nitrogen production from legumes in an age of increasing energy costs will be a necessity. A Pennsylvania Soybean Promotion board funded project will be continued during 2010 to develop a network in PA soybean growers who seek to conduct their own on-farm evaluations. They employ some of the latest computerized planting and harvesting mapping capabilities. Coupled with aerial photography, these tools will aid in the identification of yield and profit-limiting factors in soybean production. Supported with a NE SARE Research and Education grant, researchers from Penn State, USDA-ARS Beltsville, and Rodale Institute will continue a project that seeks to improve the sustainability of dairy cropping systems for the northeast. Manure injection, increased use of cover crops, controlling cover crops with a roller/crimper, and the possible inclusion of canola into the cropping rotation for purposes of producing liquid fuels for farm use will be included. A project supported with funding from the USDA-OREI program, recently begun and to continue through 2013, will include researchers from Penn State, USDA-ARS Beltsville, and University of Delaware. The goal is to improve the sustainability of organic grain production by reducing the amount of tillage normally practiced. Making use of varieties with shorter growing season needs to enable more intensive usage of cover crops is the focus of the project. Weed and insect pest management techniques will also be tested. The recent large increase in fertilizer prices, especially nitrogen, has prompted strong promotion of several products that are added to N fertilizer to reduce losses to volatilization and leaching. Two on-farm studies will be conducted during 2010 to complement one being conducted at the experiment station to quantify relative efficiencies of N utilization when urea is treated with commercially available products. Other areas of research are identified as the on-farm research coordinator continues to discuss production problems and possibilities for collaborative research with producers, county and state Cooperative Extension personnel, PASA organizers, and representatives of other agencies."

Due to the expensive process of bringing a new chemical crop protection product to market (in the US, the cost is in excess of $50 million dollars), the agriculture chemical industry often does not register their products on specialty crops (most vegetables, fruits, nuts, herbs, nursery and flower crops) - the cost of necessary data is greater than any potential return on investment. IR-4 endeavors to provide domestic specialty crop growers the means to remain viable and competitive by facilitating the registration of crop protection products on specialty crops (IR-4 is the only publicly supported research program in the US to do so)."

All bees depend on floral pollen and nectar to satisfy the nutritional requirements needed to sustain their populations. Native landscapes with a diverse array of floral resources historically supported a diverse fauna of native bees. As the human population has increased over the past century, the demand for resources provided by ecosystems has increased over fivefold. Entire landscapes have been modified for human use and what remains is highly altered. Consequently, there is growing concern over whether modern ecosystems are sustainable. Landscape modifications, aside from altering the historical availability of key ecosystem services for humans, also have altered critical resources for bees (e.g., nutrients, pollen availability) as agricultural crops have replaced native plants and pesticide use has increased. Not surprisingly, landscape fragmentation and pesticide use are two factors contributing to the documented decline of native bees and honey bees. However, the effects of long-term land use patterns on honey bee nutritional health, immune system functioning, pathogen and parasite loads, colony productivity and ultimately colony survival have never been tested directly. We will survey native bee diversity and species richness, and test honey bee nutritional health, immune system functioning, pathogen and parasite loads, and pesticide exposure. We will identify sources of pollen for bees, and will measure colony productivity and colony survival in three landscapes in North Dakota that vary in pollen and nectar resources for bees, as identified though USDA's detailed historical records, satellite images and ground truthing of land use in that state. We will follow the same colonies as they are transported to California for use in the pollination of almonds. To quantify the effects of land-use change on bees, the data will be linked into a larger USGS ecosystem model (EcoServ) to facilitate forecasts of the multiple and simultaneous change in ecosystem services. The results will communicate how shifts in land cropping patterns in the Midwest influence our national pollinator services. By virtue of land use trends in North Dakota we can quantify pollination services at local and national scales, and the features that contribute to the delivery of multiple ecosystem services. This study will provide much needed documentation for legislative initiatives on habitat / landscape restoration to support pollinators, and will provide statewide projections (maps) for how landscape suitability for bees may change in response to major drivers, such as shifts in climate, economic incentives (e.g., for bioenergy crops), and conservation programs."

Since 2005, there has been a 20% loss in the number of farms and 29% loss in number of acres of farmland. Fewer and fewer farmers are producing food, further and further from the regions consumers. And less than 1% of the farmers represent a minority race. In addition, high rates of unemployment continue to plague the area, mostly affecting minorities and people with disabilities. And increasing rates of chronic disease exacerbated by the abundance of urban food deserts speak to the need for healthier food options for all residents. Despite these challenges, the development of new economic development strategies, such as farming, holds much promise in reversing these trends. The increasing number of immigrants and refugees with strong agrarian roots, greater interest by many in locally grown foods, and widely accepted knowledge that urban areas are the food production hubs of the nation provide further testament to the need for small scale farming enterprises. Cleveland, with 3,300 acres of land available and 89% of residents purchasing local foods, is a national innovator in urban land use planning and urban agriculture. Urban garden district zoning, small livestock legislation, grants for urban farmers, and the creation of an agricultural overlay district are just some of its more recent accomplishments that portray a committed community and political will that supports agriculture as a means of transforming the once rust belt into a thriving green belt. The BEAN Project plays a key role in building capacity to create and sustain economically viable small farm enterprises in the Greater Cleveland area through its unique outreach to socially disadvantaged residents (minorities, immigrants, refugees, and limited resource adults with developmental disabilities) and its ability to educate beginning farmers using methods sensitive to ones culture, language and learning style. Innovative models of teaching and learning lay the foundation. Hands-on learning modules, field trips, specialty workshops, educational materials in plain and native languages, mentorship opportunities, and model land lease agreements are some of the key strategies to create an effective learning continuum. This continuum aligns to the projects overall goal to contribute to the local food economy and promote social change by increasing the number of minority and underserved farmers who own and/or operate economically and environmentally sound small farm enterprises. Participants can and will become a part of a communitys social capital and add value to the overall health and well-being of the community. This project also has the potential for long range impacts that can inform a regional food system, enhance the self-sufficiency of traditionally underserved populations, and provide a platform for further replication that expands its scope and reach in a culturally and linguistically congruent manner."

The value of tobacco sold in Kentucky in 2008 was $382 million, down from $784 million in 1999. Interest in alternative crops has risen as tobacco income has fallen. This project is designed to develop and deliver Kentucky farmers the knowledge they need to assess new crop opportunities. Biofuels, sustainable organic production, and novel new crops projects will be conducted by University of Kentucky researchers as part of this project. Kentucky has enormous potential for sustainable biomass-based energy production. A shift toward using abandoned agricultural or nutritionally depleted land for production of non-food crops to produce energy, rather than using corn, is the choice for second-generation biomass industries. Kentucky has one of the highest proportions of arable marginal lands in the U.S., about 20%. Supporting an integrated biofuels and bioproducts industry will enhance revenue and value-added processing income for farmers and foresters. As for organic research, increased acreage in organic production nationwide is aligned with an increase in direct marketing of organic products through Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), farmers markets, etc. Kentucky ranks in the top 10 states with the fastest direct market growth. There has been little systemic study of the economic, environmental and social benefits direct markets are touted to produce. This project will use the model CSA system at the university as a case study for diversified organic vegetable production. This study will be used to create a conceptual model for direct-marketed vegetable systems representative of the scale and types of operations used across the state. The results could have a significant positive impact on grower acceptance of organic agriculture. Meanwhile, potential new crops for Kentucky include edamame, hops, and stevia. Previous research focused on growing edamame as a stand-alone crop; it has greater potential when incorporated into a production system such as minimum tillage. Hops offer potential for marketing to microbreweries, and also for value-added products; however, no research on hops has been done as yet in Kentucky, so there is a need to develop a production system. Although currently a niche market, the potential for expansion is great with stevia, an herbaceous annual with high leaf concentrations of sugars. Overall, the New Crop Opportunities Center will feature a Web site for 24-hour access to new crop information. Staff will answer questions from Extension agents and farmers, and will distribute new crop information at field days and meetings. The Center will facilitate packaging of information from its research and other sources for dissemination. Expected outcomes/impacts will be an increase in knowledge among farmers and Extension agents about production and marketing systems for new crops. This should allow farmers to make informed decisions about which crops to try, and how to market them. Anticipated benefits include greater profitability for Kentucky farmers."

Organic farmgate sales for 2008 were estimated at $280 million in Washington State, with forage, processed vegetables, and tree fruit the main crops. The state is the leading national producer of organic apples, pears, cherries, sweet corn, green peas, snap beans, and onions. Acres of organic apples have nearly doubled since 2005 and represent 10% of all apple acres in the state. Continued growth of the sector occurred in 2009, but at a slower rate due to the recession. Organic farming offers growers a form of production and market diversification and the potential for increased returns, all of which are needed in light of current economic conditions. In addition, organic systems generally lead to improved environmental performance (Reganold et al., 2001) and farm worker safety, thus lessening the need for the public sector to bear these costs. Conventional growers also benefit from the development of organic practices because they are increasingly adopting these practices to deal with pesticide resistance and regulatory constraints and because adoption of these methods may lead to reduced costs, improved biological performance, and enhanced environmental protection (A. McErlich, pers. comm.). This special grant project will enable Washington State University to continue to address the priorities listed above and assist organic growers to improve their profitability, agronomic performance, and environmental stewardship. This will provide economic benefits to growers and their rural communities, fulfill consumer demand for organic products that bring environmental benefits to the farm and watershed, and develop techniques that conventional farmers can use to meet the regulatory challenges of the federal Food Quality Protection Act and other public environmental initiatives. The region&#8223;s climatic diversity provides biophysical characteristics that favor organic production, especially in the semi-arid zones where there is high quality irrigation water. Additionally, the region has a high level of consumer awareness and demand for organic products as well as support for organic and sustainable production systems, especially in the urbanized maritime region. This special grant will help the agricultural sector to capitalize on these advantages."

These techniques will ultimately be incorporated into potato production systems. Outreach and education targeted specifically at biologically based IPM and ecosystem production methods are essential to promote adoption by growers. In Wisconsin we have developed the foundation for biointensive IPM education. We are now proposing to continue the educational efforts which will enable growers to integrate biointensive IPM strategies into existing production systems. The overall momentum of the Collaboration has been extremely strong with many accomplishments such as the continuation of the marketing effort, enhancements of the Collaboration standards, improvements of resistance management protocols, database implementation, grant coordination and expansion of the development and use of educational tools for growers. We have worked with numerous faculty, industry representatives, potato and other commodity organizations, and environmental organizations to export this agricultural model for targeted and industry-wide change. In Wisconsin, this work is expanding to other vegetable crops, such as carrots, peppers, beans and peas, and is now also expanding to fruit crops. Furthermore, we have enhanced the ecological portions of the Collaboration by working with national and local environmental organizations and expanding our research with University of Wisconsin faculty by involving their expertise, research and education into the project. We need to maintain this strength while exporting the model of industry-wide agricultural changes through the use of policy and communication efforts. The success of the adoption of biointensive IPM programs by growers will be measured utilizing the measurement system previously developed by the Collaboration. At the conclusion of this project we expect to have completed detailed performance evaluations for a range of reduced-risk pest management alternatives. We will use this information in the educational activities and materials to provide growers with detailed efficacy and economic analysis of various alternatives which can be used by individual growers to refine their pest management practices to more biologically based, less toxic practices. The marketplace rewards which have been generated through the eco-labeling project in Wisconsin have also created a favorable climate for our biointensive IPM strategies to be adopted throughout the region. We are confident that growers see the potential for value-added marketing as a mechanism to offset declining commodity returns in traditional markets. The WWF/WPVGA/UW Collaboration will continue its outreach, stakeholder participation, and national policy efforts to increase dialogue on using market-based incentives to advance growers' use of biointensive IPM and reduce reliance on high-risk pesticides."

Michigan cultivates 79,210 acres of Phytophthora-susceptible vegetables worth $163 million and 7,600 acres of Fraser fir worth $10.6 million. Phytophthora can be easily spread across and within agricultural regions via water. Phytophthora management is complicated by its large host range and lack of known disease resistance in vegetables. Phytophthora can last for 10 or more years in soil and it is common for growers to experience complete crop loss in some fields. Some strains of Phytophthora have mutated to become resistant to key fungicides and have colonized an estimated 25% of the acreage in the Michigan growing region. Disease outbreaks occur yearly and recent losses have become so large (up to $32.5 million) that the economic viability of these Michigan industries is at risk. This project seeks to reduce losses suffered by Michigan growers and stakeholders by developing integrated management strategies that emphasize cultural methods and environmentally friendly practices. Research will include investigating ways to limit the spread of Phytophthora; identifying and developing cultivars that are resistant to Phytophthora disease; investigating soil amendments, mulches, crop rotation and water management as new techniques for managing Phytophthora; and testing fungicides, biological control agents and new chemistries for disease control.

Therefore, the Phytophthora/Capsicum interaction is an excellent approach and crop model to understanding durable host resistance. The use of resistant crop cultivars is the most desirable, sustainable, and green disease control method from both an economic and an environmental perspective."

Development of sustainable processing technologies which result in energy and water savings is another benefit of this research. Food safety will also be improved. Forming, casting, infrared, microwave, ultraviolet, solar, ultrasonic and pulsed-electric field processing technologies will be explored, alone and in combination, to form novel value added food systems. Ultimately effects of processing on final product properties will be characterized and processing methodologies optimized to maximize final product quality, safety, and nutritional value.

Analytical techniques, such as stable carbon isotope analysis, will be used to determine the influence of C4 host plants, such as field corn or pigweed, on populations of tarnished plant bug adults infesting cotton fields. This information will identify sources of tarnished plant bugs that may lead to alternative control measures prior to infestations into cotton fields. Tarnished plant bug populations will be monitored for resistance to various classes of insecticides commonly used by mid-South producers. This will provide real-time information to decision makers that will allow them to adjust their control recommendations based on the type of resistance that is found in their area of the mid-South. Detoxification enzyme activity surveys will be conducted in an effort to correlate and quantify insecticide resistance levels in field populations of the tarnished plant bug. Molecular genetics techniques will be conducted on tarnished plant bug populations that could lead to assays to evaluate the extent of field resistance in tarnished plant bug populations and provide input for insect management decisions. We also plan to determine the effect of bollworm ecology (corn earworm) on resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. Analytical techniques, such as stable carbon isotope analysis and a gossypol detection technique, will be used to determine the impact of bollworm larval plant host on pyrethroid resistance levels measured in adults collected from pheromone traps. Molecular genetics tools will be used to identify candidate genes and biological pathways associated with insecticide resistance in bollworm populations. Successful identification of loci associated with insecticide resistance and the development of genetic markers for those will provide a method to obtain quantitative estimates of field evolved resistance by estimating the allele frequencies via population studies.

The overall goal is to reduce the risk of salmonellosis associated with low-moisture foods, by accounting for critical product and process factors affecting Salmonella resistance to interventions across multiple product types. The specific objectives are to: (1) quantify the relationship between Salmonella inactivation rate and (a) product factors (composition and structure), and (b) time between contamination and pasteurization, (2) expand and validate novel inactivation models accounting for the significant intrinsic and extrinsic factors, via Salmonella-inoculated, pilot-scale challenge studies using multiple pasteurization technologies, and (3) develop pasteurization scale-up and validation strategies that account for inherent uncertainty in the inactivation models. The overall plan will entail: (1) bench-scale inactivation trials with Salmonella cocktails on three classes of products (large particulates, powders, and pastes), with varying compositions, inoculation methods, and post-contamination storage periods, and using multiple intervention processes (moist-air heat, radio frequency energy, and low-energy X-ray), (2) modification of novel inactivation models, (3) pilot-scale validation trials, and (4) development of recommendations for appropriate application of the lethality models to commercial pasteurization processes.

However, recent outbreaks of salmonellosis linked to low moisture foods (e.g., chocolate, dried milk, almonds, peanut butter, peanut products, toasted oats cereal and dried spices) have demonstrated that this bacterium survives dry conditions very well. Furthermore, Salmonella cells subjected to dry conditions become more heat tolerant. This response has clear implications for food processing when heating is used to kill potential food pathogens making Salmonella an important emerging problem for this food sector. Since iron homeostasis plays a fundamental role in the survival and virulence of Salmonella, its role in bacterial tolerance to stresses has been studied. This study aims at determining and controlling the protective systems in Salmonella that trigger resistance to thermal treatments observed in dry foods. Salmonella resilience to dry conditions and thermal treatments is linked by a common physiological response relying on the iron available. Control of iron concentrations would modulate its resistance to thermal treatments. Specific objectives: 1) Determine the relationship between iron available in cereal and the resistance of Salmonella to thermal inactivation and dryness. 2) Determine the molecular and physical chemical changes induced by changes in the iron availability, temperature, and water activity. 3) Determine the effective combinations of temperature, dryness, iron concentration, and iron chelators to reduce Salmonella presence in dry foods. Approach: Four Salmonella serovars will be inoculated in a toasted oats cereal model and subjected to very low moisture vs. thermal treatments in presence of different iron concentrations, or anaerobic conditions. The effect of similar conditions on genetic status will be determined by advanced molecular and spectroscopy to develop a theoretical model. This model will be employed to design treatments to be tested in dry cereals. Potential impact and expected outcomes: The proposed research will provide information on the factors influencing the emerging problem of thermal treatment resistance of Salmonella in dry foods."

This research will provide a quantitative understanding of the factors that affect the ability of Salmonella to survive in low moisture foods, and an understanding of how these foods can be manipulated to decrease Salmonella survival. Our major hypothesis is that the physical state of water is an important factor influencing survival of Salmonella in low moisture foods, and that food composition will have a significant influence on this property. One objective of this project is to produce valid predictive models based on temperature, water activity, and molecular mobility.

Pruning requires tremendous amounts of manual labor, while training and trellising systems have additional materials and labor costs. Harvesting fruit and nuts from large spreading trees often requires the use of ladders or elevated platforms. When using mechanized harvesting equipment such as shakers, substantial losses can be incurred from fruit bruising when dropped from high or dense canopies. Trees also require tremendous amounts of land space which leads to the excessive use of fertilizers and pest control chemical inputs. As has been accomplished for cereals and other crops, genetic architectural improvements to enable high density production systems and mechanization stand to revolutionize the way in which fruits, nuts, and other tree-based crops are produced. Easier management will translate to immediate cost savings for growers and consumers. High density production systems will lead to higher productivity and reduce the volume of chemical inputs needed (also a substantial cost savings). This will translate to an environmental benefit as well, given that less agricultural land and chemical inputs would be utilized. The ability to rationally manipulate and breed for altered architectural tree forms could also benefit forestry species where fast growth and limited branching is desirable, as well as the ornamental tree industry to enable more flexible and aesthetically appealing landscape designs. In this proposal, our goal is to identify the genes controlling several common architectural traits in peach trees including dwarf, weeping, compact, forked, and pillar types. This work will give researchers a foundation for understanding the genetic basis for variations in tree architecture and provide key gene targets to manipulate architecture, not only peach, but in other tree species as well."

It is the 4th most important oilseed crop in the world, ranked by production, exceeded only by soybean, rapeseed, and cottonseed. The US accounts for approximately 6% of world production and is a major exporter. Peanut has the unusual reproductive habit of above ground flowering and below ground fruiting. Its subterranean reproductive strategy poses additional plant health problems not encountered by most seed crops. Of particular concern is invasion of underground pods by fungi that can produce highly carcinogenic aflatoxin. Aflatoxin biosynthesis is induced when the host tissues attain a permissive physiological state under drought stress and elevated temperatures, conditions almost certain to be increasingly encountered in this era of climate change. We hypothesize that molecular indicators of host plant stress response are correlated with induction of aflatoxin biosynthesis and that genotypic variation for aflatoxin contamination is associated with variation in stress response. The objectives of this study are to use physiological and gene expression tools to determine the pre-harvest stress threshold at which aflatoxin biosynthesis is induced in developing peanut seeds and to map quantitative trait loci for indicators of this stress response. Advancing phenotyping protocols and associating phenotypes with nucleotide sequences will have an immediate impact on conventional breeding for preharvest aflatoxin contamination resistance that will eventually translate to improved farm efficiency, sustainability, profitability, and food quality."

While Wolbachia is normally associated with various reproductive manipulations that allow this symbiont to invade and persist in host populations, recent evidence indicates this symbiont can also invade by conferring protection to the host from pathogenic microbes. We have discovered that Hawaiian populations of Pentalonia aphids are infected at high rates by Wolbachia. Since sub-tropical environmental conditions present in Hawaii prevent the sexual reproduction of these aphids, we hypothesize that Wolbachia confers net fitness benefits to these hosts rather than acting as a reproductive manipulator. Here we propose to explore the prevalence and evolutionary relationships of Wolbachia infecting aphids from the genus Pentalonia. We also seek to determine whether Wolbachia protects aphids against a range of microbial pathogens and influences the transmission of an aphid vectored plant virus. The latter has important implications for the management and control of plant viruses for which aphids are exclusive vectors. We will also conduct transfection experiments to study the effects of Wolbachia infection in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, which has emerged as a model system for studying bacterial symbionts. While our initial findings will provide key information on the nature of Wolbachia -aphid interactions, the broader scope, which is in line with the long term goals of the USDA AFRI foundational programs, intends to address the extent to which Wolbachia may be exploited to interfere with the spread of aphid-vectored plant viruses."

Crops that are predominantly pollinated by honeybees have an estimated value of more than $215 billion worldwide, and bees are thought to be responsible for every third bite of food we eat. Disturbingly, the number of honey bee hives in the U.S. has declined sharply in recent decades, from 6 million after World War II, to 2.4 million today. In fact, pollinators are in decline worldwide, creating a pollination deficit for agricultural production. On top of the existing pollinator crisis, since 2006 huge numbers of U.S. honey bee colonies have been lost to a mysterious new malady, 'Colony Collapse Disorder' (CCD). This disorder is diagnosed by colony abandonment by adult worker bees. Since the onset of CCD, annual colony losses have doubled in many areas of the U.S., creating a new urgency to the pollination crisis faced in agriculture. There have been many recent studies that have attempted to identify the causes of CCD. Collapsed colonies turn out to have numerous problems, including more diseases (including fungus, bacteria, and viruses), parasitic mites, and pesticide residues. CCD is more likely to occur in colonies found in disturbed urban or agricultural landscapes, rather than in open land habitats with abundant and diverse floral food sources. However, despite all the research, there is still no 'silver bullet' -- no study to date has been able to pin down the actual cause of CCD. In fact, the only thing researchers can agree on is that CCD must be caused by a combination of several factors. Purpose: In this project, we propose to test a new hypothesis for CCD. It focuses on the negative effects of two critical factors to bee health: infection with multiple viruses and nutritional stress. We hypothesize that bees under nutritional stress leave the hive in search of food, but are unable to return due to negative effects of being infected with viruses, such as paralysis. When bees fail to return to their hives, their colonies produce new foragers, who may then meet the same fate. This cycle of bees leaving the hive and failing to return could quickly lead to the sudden 'disappearance' of worker bees, the diagnostic symptom of CCD. We will use a combination of laboratory and field-based studies to examine the effects of three viruses and nutritional stress on worker bees and their colonies. We will determine whether these two negative factors together can cause the symptoms of CCD. We will be specifically looking for higher loads of viruses, hive abandonment behavior, diagnostic patterns of gene activity, and ultimately, hive death. These findings may lead to changes in apicultural management, such as: more informed virus quarantine practices, colony supplementation with multi-source pollen when bees are nutritionally stressed, allowing bees to forage on crops of high nutritional value after low, and encouraging farmers and beekeepers to use land management practices that increase floral diversity."

For thousands of years, American Indians lived healthy lifestyles. American Indians have developed very sophisticated agricultural systems that gave us beans, corn, potatoes, squash, and other foods. Maintaining a traditional diet appears to be beneficial and the main reason for the project is to motivate American Indian families to return to a more traditional diet. This study has the potential for measurable outcomes based on results that will empirically establish the efficacy of community based participatory research for food science; demonstrate the important role of culture in determining and changing people's food behaviors, and the effect of a multi level ecological approach to food interventions. Impacts and outcomes include; multi systemic change in Lummi nutrition; multigenerational knowledge sharing; infrastructure development across tribal, local, and state agencies; scientific advancement in the food and nutrition fields related to Native North Americans. Participants will benefit from shared and increased knowledge of traditional foods, they will experience the benefits of a collaborative research process, they will feel ownership of the research and its products, they will have a renewed sense of pride for the culture, they will increase their fruit and vegetable intake, learn about and integrate locally grown foods, increase amounts of traditional foods, decrease amounts of processed foods, learn healthy food preparation. Other outcomes include: increased collaboration between NWIC, WSU, and Growing Washington, increased collaboration with local community partners, and increased interest in ecological and agricultural science.

MICRO SUBGRANTS ACTrees will motivate local tree-plantings that support sustainable urban agriculture initiatives with $125,000 of requested PGGP funds to provide micro-subgrants to its network of member organizations. The immediate impact of PGGP funds will be tree-plantings which shade or provide weather or line-of-sight screens for local community gardens, and for planting fruit and nut trees for local consumption and production. Tree-plantings supported by PGGP subgrants will benefit socioeconomic diversity of locations, engagement of local residents in sustainable urban agriculture, building and/or strengthening local collaborative partnerships, and bolstering local projects that address food security in areas of low income. II. NATIONAL PROGRAM $15,000 of requested PGGP funding will be directed to engaging a consulting Project Manager with direct knowledge of administering community gardens, developing coalitions and strategic partnerships, managing and expanding nonprofit organizations, engaging volunteers and community leaders, and developing successful programs. In addition to direct responsibility for developing and implementing the subgrant process, the Project Manager will research and develop a new national program. The Project Manager will glean information from the subgrant process that supports a national program. The full scope of work for field-testing and launching the program will be developed using information gathered from the ACTrees Network, regional & local food security and community garden stakeholders around the nation, published research, case studies relating to fruit and nut trees and community gardens, and from all grant applications and reports submitted to ACTrees by its PGGP subgrantees. ACTrees will build institutional knowledge about fruit and nut trees and the impact of trees on community gardens through development, field-testing and launch of this program. This new national tree-planting program will provide guidance and support for all stakeholders planning to establish, maintain and/or expand the planting of trees that bear fruits and nuts and/or trees which shade and screen Peoples Gardens. This PGGP funding will allow distribution of much-needed funding across a diverse mix of member organizations for tree-planting projects that will directly impact the lives of families. These funds will establish and expand community gardens, People's Gardens, across the country. This funding also provides the opportunity for ACTrees to bring models and strategies for successful urban agriculture to a national level with a well-developed and field-tested national program. ACTrees is a strong and credible nonprofit organization positioned to partner with USDA and deliver important results through the People's Garden Grant Program."

The result of an infection ranges from unmarketable fruit to plant death. This could turn into a serious problem for the $660 million fresh tomato fruit industry in the southeastern U.S. The critical questions to be asked about this emerging plant disease are: what is the geographical distribution of this virus and what are its plant hosts. With this information it will be more feasible to develop management strategies that will enhance tomato production in light of this new threat. The objectives of this study are to assess the geographic distribution of the virus in the southeastern U.S., determine the alternate host plants for the virus, evaluate management methods to reduce the impact of the virus, and make sure the acquired information is available to the industry that has an interest in the future of tomato culture. This study will accomplish these objectives through a variety of methods. They include scouting of tomato production field areas which will search for evidence of the disease and the thrips insect vector; catalog the local plants that will be possible alternate hosts for the virus; and verify that the suspect disease incidence is truly the groundnut ringspot virus using molecular techniques. The same will be done in tomato transplant houses. The study will also evaluate a range of alternate host plants to determine if they truly can  host  the virus. The tomato varieties that are known to be resistant to the spotted wilt virus (a relative of the groundnut ringspot virus) will be tested as to their resistance to the groundnut virus by inoculating the varieties with this emerging disease. All relevant information gained from the research and surveys will be extended to the industry and other interested groups via a Thrips Pest Management website, extension fact sheets, a workshop for the industry, researchers, crop advisors, and extension agents. Expected outcomes are a working knowledge of the extent of the disease, identification of the host plants, and a management strategy that will diminish the impact of the disease. The economic impact is considered to be between $33 to $240 million (5% to 40% infection) per year if a management strategy is forthcoming."

Currently, BMSB is well established throughout DE, MD, PA, NJ, VA and WV and has been officially detected in 33 states and the District of Columbia. BMSB is a polyphagous pest of numerous specialty crops in Asia. In 2010, BMSB populations increased dramatically and attacked many high-value specialty crops in the mid-Atlantic region. Damage in commercial orchard crops reached critical levels with some growers losing entire blocks of stone and pome fruit. In addition, extensive damage and crop losses were reported for peppers, tomatoes, sweet corn, caneberries and grapes. Damage to woody and herbaceous ornamentals also was severe. The risk to other specialty crops such as snap and lima beans is considered high, and questions of potential disease transmission and post-harvest issues continue to arise. As the threat to U.S. agriculture posed by spreading BMSB populations continues to increase, there is no established detection method, treatment threshold, or control strategy for BMSB in any cropping system.

In addition, honey bees make a significant contribution to enhancing the environment by pollinating wildflowers, home gardens and ornamentals, and honey products are important as food and in a wide variety of alternative cosmetic and medical products. There are presently standards for pure, natural or organic honey which has a high market value. However, the number of honey bee colonies in the U.S. has declined by more than 40%, down from 5.9 million in 1947 to 4.5 million in 1980 to 2.44 million in 2008. The decline occurred in spite of an increasing demand for the pollination services for fruit, vegetables and nuts. A large part of the decline has been caused by invasive insects and diseases, and existing controls for these introduced pests rely on a small number of chemical insecticides where resistance is either present or has the potential to occur to these chemicals. We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of non-chemical controls for these pests in the form of entomopathogenic fungi. The major challenge to their use has been their short shelf-life. In this project, we intend to explore the use of dry fungal spores which should increase survival time and thus be more practical to use. We also intend to develop improved, user-friendly delivery systems for existing products, while at the same time expanding the search for other environmentally friendly products. Much of the research will be conducted by faculty and graduate students at Florida A&M University (FAMU), with project assistance from undergraduate students in order to provide direct research experiences for future leaders. We will work closely with beekeepers, including organic and hobbyist beekeepers, to update them on best management practices and new research findings in the apicultural industry, thus transferring both practical training and research findings. This will be accomplished by regular workshops with expert speakers and use of existing facilities and services of FAMU Extension. At the same time, the research and extension programs will provide opportunities for students to gain intellectual tools and problem-solving skills. The overall goals of this project are to (a) develop an environmentally friendly (chemical-free) and sustainable control strategy for the major pests of honey bees in Florida, (b) to create collaborative reliable linkages for further research, (c) to provide students and beekeepers (existing and new) with hands-on training and information needed to maintain healthy colonies, and (d) to contribute in making the honey bee industry more competitive on the world market."

Limited resource farms total 14.6% of Missouri farms, in which 230,360 acres are in pastured woodlands and 261,752 acres are woodlands that are not pastured (Missouri NASS, 2010). Many of these woods contain hardwood trees or nut producing trees (hickory or walnuts) which could be adapted for silvopasture with goats. Although goat numbers have decreased by 1% the last two years, they increased significantly from 2000-2008 and goats are increasingly more important to the economy (Missouri NASS 2010). If managed correctly, goats can be used to control unwanted vegetative underbrush, open up acreage for forage production, reduce soil erosion, control wildfire fuels, increase plant species biodiversity, and soil fertility. Today's economy forces producers to look for ways to diversify agricultural production. The primary constraint to adapting silvopasture practices is a lack of knowledge. This project creates an opportunity to start a program that can offer Missouri's limited resource farmers and landowners a more sustainable economic return from their land (meat, milk, fiber, timber, nuts, etc.). Anticipated impacts include the ability to educate farm families to: 1) Utilize goats for clearing woodland areas of brush/browse rather than chemical or mechanical means for enhancing soil and forage quality; 2) Compare performance and parasite resistance by breeds of goats in a woodland environment; and 3) Adapt the concepts of managing a silvopasture resulting in increased income from value-added products."

The search for foods that contribute to a healthy diet and which aid in chronic disease prevention (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, inflammation, cancer) has led to the identification of plant foods. Reported studies suggest that frequent nut consumption may be protective against coronary heart disease (CHD) due to beneficial effects on blood lipids. For these reasons, a considerable amount of research funding to characterize the nutrients and bioactives found in almonds has been provided. Data generated from this research has given marketers a valuable tool to describe the healthfulness of this tree nut. Consumers have taken note, resulting in increased sales of almonds and almond-containing products. But what of pecans In 2008 results of a survey indicated that 87% of respondents still believe that consuming pecans increase the levels of bad cholesterol (which is actually opposite of what was found in recent clinical studies). Moreover, it is evident that there is a need for intensive studies on the nutrients of pecans when data in the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (Release 23) is examined: in most cases only 3 samples were analyzed (compare to almonds and black walnuts which have 75 and 11 data points, respectively), and for a number of the nutrients/bioactives only imputed values are given! The rationale behind this project is to provide the consumer with a better understanding of the nutrients as well as the phytonutrients with health-promoting properties of US pecan cultivars. Data from this study will furnish stakeholders with scientific and economic information to allow the industry to increase per capita consumption of pecans through targeted marketing efforts that can report the details on pecans and pecan-containing products as a desirable package of nutrients and health-promoting components. It also will enable the industry to differentiate the pecan from other tree nuts (e.g., almonds and walnuts) in certain respects; this is critical in various marketing efforts/strategies (a good case in point is the emerging Chinese market, where it is believed that pecans are American gourmet nuts) to promote the pecan as a major source of essential nutrients in the diet. Applying the most advanced techniques available to profile the phenolic constituents and to characterize the antioxidant (e.g. ORAC values), anti-inflammatory, and anti-glycation capacities of US pecan cultivars will take the research into an important direction where information is lacking, consumer interest is high, and potential impact (both from health and economic perspectives) is great. The findings will initially be delivered to an advisory board of stakeholders, and strategies will be developed to disseminate the information to the public by the outreach efforts as well as by targeted efforts from state pecan commodity commissions and through publication efforts in peer-reviewed scientific publications."

The primary obstacle to achieving this goal is the lack of high quality adapted germplasm, because thus far hazelnuts in the region have been primarily seed-propagated. Our objectives are to develop viable methods of vegetative propagation of native and hybrid hazelnuts, to use plants propagated by these methods to develop a germplasm improvement program for the region, and to develop best management practices for growing native and hybrid hazelnuts. We will build on expertise and relationships that have been developed between the project team, extension, and hazelnut growers for the past decade or longer. Over the five years of this project we propose to host annual regional hazelnut conferences, train-the-trainer workshops, and at least one field day per state per year. Results from the research will be distributed through Extension and organizational partners, and through an Upper Midwest Hazelnut Website, which will be a low-cost method of getting results to growers quickly, and will offer growers a way to share their observations with others. Native and hybrid hazelnuts could provide growers with a way to make income from land that would otherwise be unsuitable for agriculture. With prices of $10/lb for shelled nuts, and relatively low input costs, their economic potential is excellent. Woody perennials such as hazelnuts have been shown to reduce soil erosion, enhance water quality, increase soil carbon sequestration, improve N cycling efficiency, reduce N leaching and nitrous oxide emissions, and increase numbers and diversity of beneficial soil organisms, beneficial insects, and birds, while reducing on-farm energy expenditures. There are an estimated 129 hybrid hazelnut growers in the Upper Midwest region. Surveyed growers have identified the extreme variability in the available seed-propagated germplasm, as their main challenge. To address this, the Upper Midwest Hazelnut Development Initiative/Hazelnut Improvement Program was launched in August of 2009, with growers and researchers working closely to aggressively screen hybrid hazelnut plantings for superior material and populate performance trials. Growers are also coming together at the state level to form growers associations to address challenges in processing and marketing."

It's rich, tasty flavor is a high-valued food additive. Although 15.4 acres of black walnuts yield approximately 4 billon pounds of raw nuts annually, only about 20 million pounds are commercially processed. With low economic incentives and small processing capacity, growers lack motivation to harvest. However, the growers can potentially enjoy great economic gain if these black walnuts can efficiently sorted. The USDA's very strict standards allow no more than 0.05% shell or foreign material by weight in any grade of shelled nuts. With very similar physical properties between the shells and meat, an effective method of automatically differentiating the shell from the meat needs developing, particularly for black walnut processing. This research will develop a hyperspectral fluorescence imaging technology to solve the challenging problem of distinguishing between nut fragments from nut meat which are much similar in physical characteristics. This technique utilizes the fluorescence emitted light responses under hyperspectral wavebands and high-dimensional imaging algorithms to identify the shell fragments and nut meats. Further, this automated dynamic system technology will enable the removal of nut shells from the nut meat non-destructively for quality and safety nut products. This research will lead to a valuable technology toward an initial prototype which allows growers to recoup economic benefit from their black walnuts."

Pyrethroid insecticides are inexpensive and have activity against a wide range of pest arthropods. However, these are not selective compounds and are toxic to many beneficial organisms. In the past, corn pest management in the upper Midwest has not relied heavily on these powerful tools as foliar treatments. However, the emergence of a new insect threat, the western bean cutworm (WBC), has led to large increases in rates of application in areas where this pest is found. Only selected varieties of Bt corn are effective against this pest. As a result, these hybrids are often in short supply in the area of infestation. Pest managers have a viable alternative, however: it has been demonstrated across its native and expanded range that the combination of scouting and application of insecticides timed to coincide with peak oviposition can manage WBC effectively. Although scouting and threshold guidelines have been available for decades, more information about possible intersections between this insect pest and fungal pathogens are needed as this pest continues to expand its range. While pyrethroids are long-established in the corn pest management arsenal, a notable class of fungicides have entered the marketplace in recent years: the QoI or strobilurin group. These compounds have proven to be effective at reducing disease development of yield-limiting pathogens in susceptible varieties of field corn. In contrast with pyrethroid use in corn, which is driven by a novel pest, growers typically apply fungicides not in response to disease pressure, but in the hopes of preserving yield or obtaining plant health benefits that have been widely promoted with these fungicides. Prophylactic use of fungicides is in direct opposition to IPM principles of disease management, and the benefits are not at all clear: research has indicated that there could be negative or limiting factors to the extent that fungicides can alter plant chemistry to promote yield. The nature of these powerful tools dictates that we exercise caution and apply science-based rationale to their use. The often-cited potential pitfalls of widespread use of any pesticide include the threats of resistance development and negative impacts on non-target pests (including beneficial insects and fungi). Our project will use research-based results to improve management options for these important pests and increase awareness through multiple platforms and tools that will be available and updated in the future."

In 2010, 1.29 million acres of peanut were planted in the United States. Peanut production acreage in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida accounts to more than 70% of the total production acreage in the United States. However, peanut production is faced with numerous challenges. Thrips and thrips-transmitted Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) have been the most important constraint in the last two decades. TSWV was first observed in Texas in 1971 and spread to the entire southeast in the next few years. TSWV-induced losses in Georgia peanuts from the late 1980s through 1997 were estimated to be around 12%, representing an approximate value of $40 million. TSWV was identified as a priority in several pest management strategic plans and crop profiles. In the 1980s a multidisciplinary team was formed to initiate TSWV eradication efforts (Spotted Wilt Eradication Acton Team, SWEAT). Despite its efforts, TSWV spread throughout the southeast. Currently, efforts are directed towards management of TSWV rather than eradication by the same team (Spotted Wilt Action Team, SWAT). It should be noted that there is no single management tactic that can be sufficient for thrips and TSWV management. As a result growers often use an integrated approach. The main management tactics regularly adopted by growers include planting TSWV-resistant peanut cultivars, insecticide applications (phorate and aldicarb) at the time of planting, and cultural tactics such as planting date adjustments, planting in various row patterns, and fertilization practices. Applications of Aldicarb and Phorate can lead to undesirable environmental and non-target effects. The non-target effects are so undesirable that a recent risk assessment study conducted by the US Environmental Production Agency (EPA) indicated that the carbamate insecticide (aldicarb) no longer meets agencies rigorous food safety standards. Recently, US EPA and Bayer Crop Science have agreed to withdraw the use of aldicarb (Temik). Withdrawal of aldicarb and potentially phorate can disrupt the equilibrium that exists among management tactics and also negate the cumulative effect. However, the advent of next generation peanut cultivars with high levels of TSWV resistance can allow some flexibility. In such a situation, insecticides are more critical to manage thrips damage than to suppress spotted wilt incidence. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to identify softer insecticides with high thrips activity and integrate them into the existing integrated management programs. A number of new insecticides that are more environmentally friendly and have relatively low non-target effects are available. In order to address this issue, a multistate transdisciplinary team has been formed. Efficacy of alternative chemical insecticides and an insight on the mechanisms through which they suppress thrips feeding and affect TSWV incidence will be studied in detail. Results of these studies will be disseminated to peanut growers in all three participating states and in the southeast through numerous outreach efforts."

Due to insecticide resistance issues and limited information on basic stink bug biology, growers currently have few treatment options except blanketing entire fields with insecticides. It is imperative that pest managers develop a better understanding of stink bug biology and develop alternative management strategies to mitigate these pests. Here, we plan to conduct research that seeks to improve our understanding of basic stink bug biology and ecology, while evaluating a novel insecticide application strategy that could reduce insecticide applications by nearly fifty percent. Specifically, we plan to investigate weekly changes in stink bug population density and reproductive status within a farmscape, and determine whether stink bug populations and damage in cotton can be managed by spraying alternating strips, as opposed to the entire field. All proposed objectives will be completed by the end of the project. The experiments will be conducted in grower-owned farmscapes (wheat, corn, cotton, peanuts, and soybeans) replicated in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. We expect that new knowledge of regionally important stink bug hosts and reproductive status will be presented at state production conferences, regional scientific conferences, and in peer-reviewed journal articles. Results of the strip treatment approach will be disseminated through our statewide Extension linkages."

This is currently the case in the North Central region, where an insect pest, the western bean cutworm (WBC), is driving increases in application rates of pyrethroid insecticides. The insecticides themselves are relatively inexpensive, however, they are usually applied by air and are commonly coupled with fungicides in a combination that is promoted as a  one-pass  preventative approach to pest-management and yield preservation. Prophylactic use of fungicides is in direct opposition to IPM principles of disease management, and the benefits are not at all clear: research has indicated that there could be negative or limiting factors to the extent that fungicides can alter plant chemistry to promote yield. Questions remain as to how WBC and fungicide applications impact development of Gibberella ear rot, a fungal disease capable of causing yield loss and producing mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) and zealeranone, which are toxic to both humans and livestock. Because of the potential for WBC to exacerbate ear rot problems, combined with the fact that producers are combining fungicides (with no demonstrated efficacy against these pathogens) with insecticide applications, it is clear that these pests should be considered together when developing management plans. Our research objectives seek to both identify the relationships between the insect and the fungal pathogens and identify management practices that will address both problems effectively. Field experiments will be designed to quantify the relationship between the two pests and determine if prophylactic pesticide applications have an impact on disease development and mycotoxin production. We will develop Extension programs based on these research findings led by a web-based  smartphone  application that will allow clientele to take the research findings and recommendations (along with existing diagnostic tools and pest identification resources) into the field. Web-based video resources, field demonstrations, and workshops will be developed to ensure that stakeholders have the information and tools needed to implement improved pest management recommendations for WBC and Gibberella ear rot."

Most crop protection products (fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators and biopesticides), necessary tools in the integrated  war  against destructive pests, are developed for large markets on major crops such as corn, soybean and cotton where the cost of discovery, development, registration and production can be offset by significant sales of the product. Due to the expensive process of bringing a new chemical crop protection product to market (in the US, the cost is in excess of $50 million dollars), the agriculture chemical industry often does not register their products on specialty crops (most vegetables, fruits, nuts, herbs, nursery and flower crops) - the cost of necessary data is greater than any potential return on investment. IR-4 endeavors to provide domestic specialty crop growers the means to remain viable and competitive by facilitating the registration of crop protection products on specialty crops (IR-4 is the only publicly supported research program in the US to do so)."

Movement and avoidance behaviors will be evaluated using video-tracking and bioassays with lyophilized leaf tissue incorporated into artificial diet. Results of the laboratory trials will guide selection of appropriate treatments for subsequent semi-field experiments. The marker development and screening strategies used for identifying Bt resistance linkage groups in ECB will be adapted for developing molecular markers associated with behavioral adaptations in ECB. We will characterize gene flow and genetic structuring among ECB populations in Pennsylvania (PA). We will use a panel of 74 SNP markers, previously identified and verified from EST sequences, in population genetics analyses to determine the effects of potential geographic barriers on ECB gene flow separately for the pheromone races, and determine if genetic structuring is associated with host plant association in the E race. The development of laboratory tests to evaluate possible effects of stressors from GE crops involves two phases. The first phase is development of a standardized protocol for testing an orally administered test substance on a specific insect and life stage. The second phase is using these protocols to parallel test (a.k.a. ring test) the selected insect at three or more laboratories. We will take a mass-screening approach to validate EST-derived SNPs for WCR using the Illumina Golden Gate SNP assay platform. We anticipate that about 75% of the 4,111 candidate SNPs we have identified will produce a designable assay, which would translate into nearly 3,100 assays. These candidate SNPs, for which an assay can be designed, will be tested for polymorphism against samples of rotation-resistant WCR populations from Illinois and wild-type populations from Iowa. Information from the Illumina GenCall and GTS Reports software will be used to remove bad SNPs and bad samples. Complementing the genomics and bioinformatics groundwork, we will investigate Bt resistance traits by integrating structural and functional genome information. SNP markers will be used for mapping QTL studies of ECB, and population studies of ECB and WBC. Our experiments will investigate separate native resistance (NR) sources leading to differential feeding or survival of WCR larvae on roots, of WCR adults on silks, and of corn earworm (CEW) larvae on silks. For both lepidopteran and coleopteran pests, we will narrowly define chromosomal segments of the corn genome that harbor NR alleles. We will also create large sets of inbred and hybrid isolines to enable future mechanistic analysis of the effects of the NR alleles on both target and non-target insects."

Objective 3: Assess the role of processing-induced chemical or structural modifications on the individual allergens by systematically altering amino acids thought to be important in clinically-symptomatic allergic reactions. Objective 4: Develop computer models and/or determine NMR/crystal structures of native and recombinant peanut and select tree nut and legume allergens in raw and processed forms.

New allergens or changes in allergenic properties of existing allergens due to the thermal processing will be identified by immunoassays, using serum (containing IgE antibodies) from peanut and/or tree nut allergic individuals. Proteins found to be immunologically altered by thermal processing will be purified by conventional chromatography and analyzed for alterations in size, structure, digestibility, and binding to various antibodies, including anti-Maillard reaction products and specific anti-allergen antibodies. The specific amino acid residues, thought to be modified during different processing events and to contribute to altered allergenic properties (i.e. IgE binding), will be identified. These amino acids will be identified by cloning and expression of select recombinant major allergens of peanut and tree nuts in E. coli followed by site directed mutagenesis, simulated processing and immunological analysis of previously identified IgE binding sites, specifically, sites thought to be modified by processing. Understanding the molecular basis of processing-induced alterations of allergens will guide development of processing technologies towards reduced allergenicity of nuts. This knowledge will also contribute to the development of better labeling practices and detection tools for industry and regulatory agencies resulting in better protection of consumers."

Identify the ecological and edaphic factors affecting the reproduction, spread, and survival of invasive, herbicide-reistant, and herbicide tolerant weed pests of agronomic and vegetable crops in the southeastern coastal plain, including, but not limited to pigweeds, common bermudagrass, and perennial nutsedges. 3. Combine effective chemical and cultural control measures into integrated systems for the management of key species of herbicide resistant and invasive weeds of agronomic and vegetable crops in the southeastern coastal plain, such as pigweeds and Benghal dayflower.Approach:   Research will be conducted to determine weed management practices that will: A) Manage weeds without conventional herbicides in organic systems and B) reduce reliance on a dwindling number of herbicide tools in conventional systems. Conventional weed management systems rely heavily on herbicides to minimize crop yield losses associated with weeds. Organic cropping systems have few approved herbicide options, and must rely primarily on weed control from cultural and mechanical practices. The occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds has limited the efficiency of many herbicides in conventional systems. Studies will be initiated to evaluate a multi-tactic approach to managing weeds with a reduced reliance on herbicide tools. In the first objective, integrated weed management systems will be developed in organic agronomic and vegetable cropping systems. Cultural and mechanical weed management strategies will be employed to prevent seedling establishment and reduce propagule persistence in the soil. The second objective will determine the factors that affect the reproduction and persistence of herbicide-resistant and herbicide tolerant weed pests. Specific studies will include the effect of cover crops on weed establishment, growth, and fecundity, as well as determining the factors that affect persistence of the soil seedbank. The third objective is to combine effective chemical and cultural control measures into integrated systems for the management of key weed species. Weed growth and reproduction as affected by crop stand and presence of cover crops will be evaluated. Ultimately fulfillment of these objectives will improve grower profitability and reduce reliance on a limited set of herbicide resources that are rapidly declining in efficiency."

Develop cost-effective systems and sensors for rapid and nondestructive measurement of moisture content and density of cereal grains, oilseeds and nuts that can be used in static and dynamic situations (on line and in process applications). 2. Develop a portable system for moisture measurements of shelled and unshelled peanuts that can be used in the field and at peanut grading stations. 3. Improve peanut grading processes by developing a rapid system for nondestructive determination of peanut kernel moisture from measurements on pre-cleaned samples and samples consisting of a mixture of pods and foreign materials. 4. Develop methods for monitoring water migration in almonds and other nuts and its effect on their quality by dielectric and spectroscopic methods.Approach:   Developing a cost-effective microwave system for rapid moisture measurement will require analysis of existing dielectric properties data to determine the optimum frequency and measurement parameters. From these results, microwave components will be specified, assembled into a low-cost rapid prototype, compared to a network analyzer, then calibrated and validated for moisture content of wheat, corn, soybeans, almonds, oats, sorghum, and barley. For peanuts, dielectric properties from 2 to 18 GHz on Runner, Spanish, Valencia, and Virginia will first be collected on shelled and unshelled peanuts. As with the other grains above, these data will then be analyzed to determine the optimum dielectric properties parameters and associated algorithms for a density- and variety-independent measure of peanut moisture content, and a prototype low-cost rapid peanut moisture measurement system will be developed. From these measurements and system development for peanut moisture content of shelled and unshelled peanuts, further development of a system to measure the moisture content of peanut kernels without shelling will be developed. Additional dielectric properties of both the unshelled and shelled kernels will be collected as needed, along with the moisture content of both the shells and the kernels. From these data, moisture algorithms will be developed. Additional dielectric properties measurements on unshelled peanuts with and without foreign material will also be collected for development of moisture models that are also independent of foreign material (trash). Models will be developed for both pod and kernel moisture contents. Besides kernel moisture content, meat content and percentage of foreign material are also important grading parameters. Attempts to correlate the dielectric properties data with these parameters will also be made. For almonds, since no dielectric properties data exists, fundamental dielectric properties measurements of almonds of varying varieties, growing locations in California, and moisture contents will be collected with a network analyzer. Correlations between moisture content and dielectric properties data will be developed. To investigate the dynamics of water migration in the almond kernels, known amounts of water will be sprayed on almond kernels of known moisture content, mixed, and then sealed in a Styrofoam box. The sealed box will then be placed between two horn-lens antennas for free-space measurement of the dielectric properties between 2 and 18 GHz at room temperature. Changes in the dielectric properties will be recorded over time as water moves from the almond surface to water in equilibrium inside the kernels. The next stage will be the use of these dielectric spectroscopic methods to monitor water migration inside the almonds under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature. In this instance, the water will permeate the almonds from the atmosphere for varying relative humidities from 20 to 80% in a controlled environmental chamber. Additionally, measurements will be repeated over varying temperatures from 0 to 50 oC in 5 oC increments."

Most of our work concentrates on measuring properties of single kernels so that they can be segregated or the distribution of properties in a sample can be ascertained, versus measuring the average quality of a bulk sample. In general, the project will include the development of instruments to improve rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) measurement of grain quality at receiving stations, the development of non-destructive and rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) single-kernel sorting systems to improve post-harvest grain quality and similar systems to help grain breeders rapidly select specific traits for improved lines, and improve grain-storage and handling systems. Specific objectives are: 1. Develop sensors and methods to rapidly and accurately quantify attributes such as protein composition, starch composition, end-use quality, toxins, and micronutrients. 1.A. Develop or apply spectroscopic technologies that offer significant improvements over current technologies used to measure traits of single kernels and other biological materials. 1.B. Adapt a previously developed conductance mill for detection of live-insect infestations in wheat in other grains such as corn, rice, barley, and oats, and to dry beans, such as pinto and navy beans. 1.C.

Investigate insect-pest densities and commingling of insects in grain that causes the spread of an infestation from bucket elevator boots. 3.D. Develop monitoring systems for grain-storage quality management. 3.E. Develop improved, environmentally-friendly insect-pest control methods for stored grain. While the objectives of this project include pre-harvest (seeds) and post-harvest handling of grain, the work is interconnected in that the overall goal is to improve the quality of grain produced in the United States. Instruments developed to assess grain quality will be used to study how grain quality might change during storage and handling. An instrument previously developed by this group to detect insect-infested grain will be used to study the spread of insect infestations and the storability of grain based on insect population levels.Approach:   U.S. farmers grow over 15 billion bushels of corn, wheat, soybeans, and other grains annually to supply the nation and world with food, animal feed, and biofuels. A significant amount of this grain may be stored for a year or more before it is used or processed. Our goal is to improve U.S. grain quality and international competitiveness through the application of engineering principles, specifically to the areas of rapid (inspection results from at least 60 individual kernels per minute) quality measurement and in maintaining quality during storage. Much of our research concentrates on measuring the distribution of quality within samples, and on detecting traits that are present at very low levels. We propose to develop instruments to rapidly (up to 500 kernels/s) measure quality traits for inspection at the first point of grain delivery, for breeders in selecting traits for new lines, and for processors prior to grain buying or processing. We also propose to develop chemical-free technology to control insects and maintain quality during handing and storage. This research will lead to higher profits for the agriculture sector, higher-quality foods reaching consumers, and more food available for a growing world population."

We will establish the tolerance of tropical fruit to any new or modified quarantine treatments, including the quality of diverse assortments of tropical fruit following irradiation treatment. To expand markets for high-value specialty fruit, we aim to develop postharvest disease control and packaging strategies to extend shelf-life. Also, preharvest practices that reduce the incidence of quarantine pests that limit exports will be investigated, such as non-chemical alternatives to control thrips on orchids, essential oil formulations for control of waxy insects on ornamental crops, and biological control of white peach scale on papayas."

Use data from genome-wide systematic analysis to determine the molecular and biological changes that occur in A. flavus upon infection of corn and other crops. 2. Identify mechanistic and molecular requirements for transcriptional regulation of aflatoxin biosynthesis and fungal survival to develop targets for intervention. 3. Establish effects of abiotic (environmental, nutritional) factors on fungal development and toxin production by aflatoxin-producing fungi.  Approach: Aflatoxins (AFs) are polyketide-derived, toxic, and carcinogenic secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus flavus on corn, peanuts, cottonseed, and tree nuts. While biosynthesis of these toxins has been extensively studied, much less is known about what causes the fungi to produce AFs under certain environmental conditions and only on certain plants.  Our goal is to determine the dynamics of interaction among the key nutritionally and environmentally induced transcription factors necessary for production of AF in order to develop novel inhibitors to one or more of these factors to prevent AF formation in crops. We will use gene microarray, yeast two-hybrid, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to determine which critical AF transcription-associated proteins are affected by physiological stress, environmental and soil conditions, and interactions of the fungus with plants. Interactions among key known or to be discovered AF biosynthesis regulatory factors, such as LaeA, VeA, AflJ, and AflR, will be examined by these methods. We will examine the effects of known natural (plant-derived, such as volatile aldehydes) inhibitors of AF production on key components of the AF transcription machinery to ultimately design safe, inexpensive chemicals that inhibit proteins unique to fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis. We expect to identify safe and effective inhibitors for applications on crops intended for consumption by humans or animals."

Understand the phylogenetics of aflatoxin production through an examination of the population dynamics of aflatoxigenic and atoxigenic Aspergillus (A.) species in mixed cultures. Determine the potential for restoration of toxigenicity in toxigenic strains of A. flavus and development of toxicity in other species or genera which contain partial aflatoxin gene clusters. 2. Identify A. flavus pathogenicity factors required during invasion of oilseed crops and link these factors to aflatoxin contamination. Identify the critical enzymes that will allow the formulation of viable biological control strategies for a given crop situation.  Approach: Aflatoxins (AFs) are polyketide-derived, toxic and carcinogenic secondary metabolites produced mainly by Aspergillus (A.) flavus on cotton, corn, peanuts, and tree nuts. One of the main strategies for prevention of AF contamination in these crops involves introducing a non-aflatoxigenic competitor Aspergillus to the soil of the plants during the growing season. Recent work revealed that A. flavus has a complicated evolutionary history that includes a history of recombination. It is the purpose of this proposal to better understand A. flavus population dynamics in agricultural environments in order to more safely use biocontrol as a strategy to reduce crop contamination with AFs. To do this we will develop new competitor strains with improved properties for tracking their dispersal after introduction onto crops and with improved ability to over-winter in order to decrease the need for annual reapplication. Optimal candidates should be unable to produce the neurotoxin, cyclopiazonic acid, without altering their competitive ability. The potential for restoration of both AF- and CPA-producing ability of the atoxigenic strain in the laboratory or the field will be assessed. We will determine if the ability to produce hydrolases by the biocontrol strain is important for its competitive ability. With these studies, we expect to be able to either develop new biocontrol strains or improve the design of currently used biocontrol strains to reduce preharvest AF contamination. We also expect to provide additional insight into the evolution of diversity within A. flavus."

In this regard, the project has a series of interconnected objectives. These objectives and their interrelationships are described as follows:   Objective 1: Develop detection methods for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) to pinpoint food contaminants.  Develop methods for identifying specific,  signature,  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as telltale indicators of microbial, mycotoxin contamination or insect infestation. This VOC detection will be applied to Objective 2. Objective 2: Develop methods for real-time detection of pathogen or insect contamination and toxins. Telltale VOCs will be used as real-time  signals  for detecting the presence of pathogens, mycotoxin-producing fungi or insects in crops or crop products, in post harvest storage or processing environments. This detectability will permit optimization of any intervention measures that are needed; which will be developed in Objective 3. Objective 3: Develop intervention technologies using plant VOCs / natural products as tools for the control of pathogens and insects. Specifically target the genetic control mechanisms through the use of chemosensitization and formulation development.  Objective 4: Investigate the biochemical and genetic regulation of toxin production within fungal communities, with special emphasis on communication. Investigate the factors controlling aflatoxin catabolism and identification of the catabolic products.  Approach: Identify the natural constituents responsible for resistance of certain varieties of tree nuts to growth of aflatoxigenic strains of aspergillus. Isolate and identify novel metabolites in sclerotia of Aspergillus and develop analytical methods for such compounds in order to assess exposure levels of tree nut orchards to the fungus. Identify genes involved in triggering mycotoxin biosynthesis using high-through put bioassays. Assays involve use of deletion mutants, gene knockouts and complementation analysis. Discover natural compounds that disrupt functionality of gene targets identified. Develop biosensors for detecting toxic fungi in pre- and post harvest environments."

This includes both the control of fungal pathogens (mycotoxins) as well as bacterial pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella. One approach will be the development of biocontrol agents using bacteria, yeast and non-toxigenic Aspergillus carbonarius. In addition, a better understanding of organic and conventional farming systems will provide new insights on mycotoxin control. The specific objectives for the period covered by this project plan are as follows:  Objective 1: Define the critical control points for pathogen contamination during the production stream. Place particular emphasis on agricultural water sources including dairy waste water. Using both cultural and non-cultural based methods we will identify the points in the developmental process, as well as the processing cycle where tree nuts are most likely to become contaminated with human pathogenic bacteria and mycotoxigenic fungi.   Objective 2: Evaluate the microbial ecology of organic v. conventional practices. Although several surveys have reported that consumers equate organically grown food stuffs with higher levels of food safety, little is known about how these practices affect the microbial population structure or mycotoxin levels in tree nuts. We will address the influence of phyllosphere microbial community on the population diversity of A. flavus in tree nut orchards, and A. carbonarius on grape surfaces in both farming systems.  Objective 3: Delineate the factors affecting cross-contamination during processing and develop a potential intervention strategy during storage. A number of experiments point to a strong possibility that cross-contamination of toxigenic fungi is possible during processing and storage, although no research appears to have been done on the transfer in actual (not laboratory) processing and storage conditions. Development of novel approaches to prevent the growth of storage fungi and production of harmful toxins is a high priority in the almond industry. Edible films and coatings (EFC) containing antimicrobial natural compounds will be tested for their efficiency to reduce mycotoxin in stored almonds.  Objective 4: Develop biological-control/intervention technologies using competitive or antagonistic microorganisms such as yeasts or bacteria that can be mass-produced and effectively utilized in a variety of pre- or post-harvest environments. Bacterial and yeast biocontrol agents will be tested in almond orchards and vineyards to control A. flavus and A. carbonarius, as well as human pathogenic bacteria, E. coli and Salmonella. EPA registration of the patented yeast, Pichia anomala will be pursued for commercial application. Methods to enhance the biocontrol efficacy will be developed.  Approach: Develop methods to control insect pests and toxic fungi of tree nuts. Insects include naval orangeworm, codling moth and peach twig borer. Feeding damage by these insects leads to infection by aflatoxigenic aspergilli. Control methods for insects are to be environmentally benign and employ semiochemicals to disrupt insect behavior. Control of toxic fungi focuses on biological control using competitive or antagonistic microorganisms. These microorganisms include either yeasts or bacteria that can be mass-produced and effectively utilized in a variety of pre- or post harvest environments."

Objective 2: Provide molecular genetic data defining biosystematics and population diversity of pest and beneficial insects such as Diabrotica, Lygus and Osmia species. Determine the molecular mechanism(s) of diapause physiology for beneficial insects. Objective 3: Provide a better understanding of the roles that lipids and other natural products play in overwintering/cold-tolerance processes, communication, and better management of beneficial insects.  Approach: 1) We will develop an industrial scale cryogenic storage protocol for the screwworm (Cochlyomyia hominivorax) and work towards developing large-scale storage protocols for other mass-reared insects. A majority of our efforts will be to develop a simplified and automated process by which embryos can be prepared for vitrification.  Fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) studies will be conducted on dormant and developing bees. All thermal regimes will be conducted in programmable environmental chambers, concentrating on optimizing the high temperature pulse of the FTR. Survival, defined as a beeÆs ability to successfully emerge from the cocoon, will be assessed weekly.  The effects of photoperiod and atmospheric conditions on storage survival will also be assessed. Photoperiodic manipulation will be achieved via boxes fitted with programmable shutters.  Atmospheric manipulation will be achieved in air tight chambers, focusing on differential oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Survival will be assessed as detailed above. 2) We will use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and genomic sequences to measure diversity and mine for heritable differences to establish an evolutionary-based phylogeny of recognized insect species. The mtDNA barcode region will be used to establish an initial molecular phylogeny of Lygus plant bug species. Additional markers will be used as needed to clarify potential ambiguities. Because the barcode region lacks sufficient polymorphism other markers need to be identified in the blue orchard bee. To determine the distribution of the different strains of Wolbachia in northern corn rootworm we will use PCR primers that are specific for each of the five strains.  To isolate diapause regulated genes and DNA-methylation during diapause. The bees will be removed from the field by mid-August and transferred to 6?C. RNA will be collected monthly from November to July and screened using microarrays to determine developmental expression profiles. DNA-methylation levels will be will be determined by EZ DNA Methylation-Direct Kit. After incubation the samples concentrations will be determined with a spectrophotometer. 3) Lipids involved in the processes of insect cold storage, dormancy and cryopreservation will be extracted from insect tissues with appropriate organic solvents. Lipid class fractions will be obtained using silica gel adsorption chromatography or HPLC techniques. Individual lipid components will be characterized by capillary GC and GC-MS. For bees reared under different temperature regimes, recovered internal lipids (e.g., triacylglycerols) will be analyzed and quantified by HPLC and GC-MS.  Potentially-active chemicals extracted from bee tissues and bee nesting materials will be obtained from either, GC-FID and GC-MS analyses or HPLC-UV-VIS, HPLC-ELS, HPLC-MS and silica gel chromatography. Active chemicals (fractions) will be tested by using Y-tube olfactory response bioassays. Identified bio-active chemicals and chemical blends will be used in field bioassays at specific bloom times in almond and apple orchards to further explore nest cavity preference due to specific nest components."

Enable reduced N2O emissions from fertilized cropping systems through improved understanding of controlling mechanisms, as a contributor to the ARS Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network (GRACEnet).  Approach: Field experiments will be conducted at three locations, each using 3 treatments: zero, intermediate, and full stover removal. We will measure soil organic carbon (SOC) changes and gas exchange. Research will also be conducted at the UMNÆs Rosemount Research and Outreach Center (ROC) and on private farm fields in MN. Research at Rosemount will take place in two 20 ha fields with similar soil types, one managed as a conventional corn-soybean rotation; the other in a corn-soybean rotation, but with winter rye cover crop seeded by helicopter in late summer. Latent and sensible heat flux and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 will be measured by eddy covariance. Yield and ancillary soil, physiological and micrometeorological variables will also be measured for 4-years. Soil sampling for SOC analysis will be conducted biennially. Data will be used to test a model of rye production and water use (RyeGro). Field research will also be conducted at Rosemount MN and Arlington WI, supplemented by greenhouse research in St. Paul. Four treatments will be evaluated using a completely randomized design with 3 replications: (i) control, (ii) biochar, (iii) biochar plus manure, and (iv) manure. Biochar will be applied at 20,000 lb ac-1. Three other biochar treatments, derived from macadamia nut, wood pellet, and lump hardwood charcoal, will also be evaluated. Biochar production temperatures will be varied according to constant heating time and thermal time equivalency tests. Experiments will be conducted to examine impact of post-processing of biochar by thermally or chemically activation. All biochars will be analyzed for elemental composition, surface area, thermal stability, and CEC. Incubations will assess the impacts of biochar amendments on GHG production. For the greenhouse studies, 5 different specialty crops will be investigated with respect to biochar impacts on germination, growth, and uptake of volatile chemicals. Lab incubation experiments will be conducted to evaluate the inhibition of ammonium and nitrite oxidation rate due to the presence of free ammonia and free nitrous acid. Three different soils used for corn production in MN, IA, and eastern Canada will be examined. The methods will be adapted from procedures used to quantify nitrification inhibition kinetics in wastewater. Parameters obtained in the lab experiments will be incorporated into previously developed nitrification and N2O emissions models that account for both steps of nitrification, N2O production pathways, microbial N2O reduction, and gaseous diffusion. Plot experiments will be conducted over two consecutive growing seasons at the UMN ROC in Rosemount, MN in long-term research plots split into subplot treatments. Each main plot will first be randomly sub-divided by N rate so that each subplot will receive the same total N rate during the growing season, with N rate levels of 0, 7.5, 15, 20 and 25 g N m-2. Each N rate treatment will then be randomly sub-divided into two timing treatment sub-subplots consisting of (a) a single pre-plant urea application, or (b) two split post-plant urea applications. Soil-to-atmosphere N2O fluxes will be measured using chamber methods."

While it is now understood that food environments can impose stresses on pathogens, little recognition has been given to the potential for these stresses to impact cell capture or detection. Stresses such as reduced water activity and cold are known to induce a common and significant physiological change in Salmonella: the formation of large filaments. We hypothesize that these gross changes in cell morphology are accompanied by corresponding changes in biomolecular content and that these changes may have a profound practical impact on our ability to detect Salmonella in foods. In Objective 1, we will use model broth systems to examine the impact of various filament-inducing conditions (reduced water activity, cold) on physiological aspects of Salmonella important to our abilities to capture and detect this pathogen. In Objective 2, we will determine the limits of antibody-based concentration methods and map the capture efficiency of stress-filamented Salmonella as a function of post-stress enrichment time. In Objective 3, we will use an innovative quantitative image analysis approach to observe and document the in situ behavior of Salmonella over time in peanut butter, a water-limiting food. This study will directly address the practical impact of water-limiting or other filament-inducing conditions on Salmonella physiology as they affect our ability to separate and concentrate this pathogen via antibody-based methods in filament-inducing food environments. By expanding our capacity to monitor pathogens in situ in foods, we will gain greater understanding of the pressures exerted by these environments, how they may affect our abilities to detect cells using traditional means and how we may be able to modify our detection approaches to account for these phenomena."

Population pressure has led to continuous cultivation of the land without crop rotation. This system results in a decline in soil fertility and high disease inoculum in the soil, specifically, bean root rot fungi and root-knot nematode. Our long-term goals are to use organic matter (compost and biochar) to reduce the incidence and severity of soil borne fungal diseases and plant-parasitic nematodes and improve soil health; improve legume inoculants (strains and carriers) to increase yield, BNF and the protein content of common bean, and build capacity by training participants on how to prepare compost, how to use farm-scale, biochar producing stoves and how to use the resulting biochar and compost to suppress plant diseases, improve soil health, and increase nodulation and N fixation in beans. Our approach will be to produce biochar-based inoculants, amend soils with biochar and compost we develop and evaluate their efficacy in on-farm trials with farmer cooperators. Small-holder farmer networks established by Univ. of Nairob, IITA and Cornell will be engaged. Measurement variables will include bean yields, nodulation, nitrogen fixation, fungal disease incidence and root galling. Simple pictorial guides to evaluate nodulation and nematode galling will be used, so that farmers can assess their own outcomes in these trials and in the future. We expect to advance knowledge on the interactions between biochar/compost and key bean diseases and pests and the efficacy of selected biochars/composts in their control; gain knowledge on the longevity of observed effects to guide timing of further amendments; and expect several publications to emerge from this work. We expect bean yield to increase and yields to become more reliable. In addition to yield improvement, improved N content will enhance family nutrition. We anticipate rapid farmer adoption, once disease control efficacy is shown, but also due to anticipated synergistic effects of enhancing and improving nitrogen fixation, thus improving nutrient content of beans. We will build capacity by training Master Farmers as a key dissemination tool. We will train four PhD and two MSc Kenyan students to carry on work in this area. Capacity of University of Nairobi to address key issues constraining bean yields for small-holder farmers will improve. Training materials developed will continue to be built upon as more knowledge becomes available. Our vision of success is that we begin to turn the tide on bean disease pressure and soil degradation by use of organic matter amendments; encourage more widespread inclusion of beans in cropping systems to improve soil quality and family nutrition; help farmers achieve greater agronomic success, higher yields and more reliable return on their investments in bean cropping and; increase research and extension capacity to help small scale farmers address constraints to bean production sustainably."

The technology has enabled dramatic improvements in agronomic performance of major food crops grown on millions of acres around the world. Common bean - a most important source of dietary protein for human consumption globally - cannot be transformed routinely using current approaches. Coupled with the genome sequence, an efficient transformation system will accelerate genomic approaches to improve this important crop. Our goal is to establish a reproducible transformation protocol for common bean using Agrobacterium-mediated method. Our hypothesis is that half seeds or cotyledonary nodes of common bean can be used as target explants for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and organogenesis for regeneration. We will focus our efforts on Agrobacterium-mediated method as transgenic events generated by this method usually provide low transgene insertion in the genome, which is more desirable for researchers. Iowa State University's Center for Plant Transformation has extensive experience providing genetic transformation services (corn, soybean, rice and Brachypodium) to public researchers around the world. We expect to develop a robust and publicly-available bean transformation technology. This new technology will accelerate gene discovery, marker development, and identification of new traits in a crop that has been extremely difficult to improve using standard breeding approaches."

In these East African countries, yields of staple crops such as beans are the lowest in the world due to root rotting diseases which limit productivity. Beans are the major staple for millions in East Africa and the crop is particularly valuable to women farmers and homemakers both as a food source and a source of revenue. A major threat to maintaining or expanding bean production in these countries is the high occurrence of soil borne plant pathogens that attack the bean crop, reduce yields and quality of the harvestable bean pods and seeds. Available land resources, tight rotations, and susceptible varieties, limit the ability of small land holders in Rwanda and Uganda to meet consumption needs or take advantage of beans as a cash crop. We plan use the latest tools in plant pathology, genetics, and genomics to characterize the soil borne pathogens in bean production regions and identify genetic resistance in beans in order to develop new high-yielding bean varieties with resistance to these root diseases in order to enhance bean production by small scale farmers in these countries."

Root and crown rot diseases cause severe yield losses and are especially problematic in areas with too little or too much water. The narrow genetic base of commercial bean varieties also contributes to lower yields. A number of soilborne pathogens within different species of fungi and Oomycetes are the primary causes of root rots. This proposal addresses research for broadening the genetic base of beans and identifying the predominant causal agent(s) by rapid unbiased methods. Additionally, epidemiological information on the pathogens that has been lacking and has hindered progress in breeding for root/crown rot resistance will be obtained. We will employ approaches such as multi-site field evaluations of a nursery of parental candidates from diverse areas of the world and with multiple disease resistance, molecular marker assisted selection, and next generation DNA sequencing methods to identify the problem pathogens. Practical interventions will be transferred to the stakeholders by local scientists with innovative web based approaches such as Legume ipm PIPE. A unique combination of plant pathologists, breeders, and soil scientists with agronomic backgrounds and expertise in innovated DNA technology will be engaged in both research and training scientists to strengthen the human resource capacities within Zambia and Mozambique. The proposal participants will disseminate methodologies and germplasm outputs to other African research networks and institutions in the private and public sectors. Improved bean yields and increased availability of this highly nutritious source of protein and other health benefits will be outcomes of this research. Expected Outcomes: 1. Release of germplasm and pre-variety lines of dry bean with root rot resistance and resistance against other diseases in Zambia and/or Mozambique. 2. One or more molecular markers associated with root rot resistance will be available with markers for other traits to use in marker assisted selection breeding. 3. Trained plant pathologists/breeders will be available in regions of Africa. 4. Trained local technicians, extensionists and small landholders. 5. Clean seed of advanced bean lines will be available for on-farm trials. 6.

However, yields are often only 20% of bean yield potential due to diseases and other factors. Plant genetic engineering can overcome disease losses by introducing durable resistance genes into transgenic bean cultivars. As more common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are consumed than any other legumes, it is the species of choice for improvement via genetic engineering. Likewise, genetic transformation using Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a preferred approach due to precision, low copy number, and defined integration of foreign genes. We will develop a reliable Agrobacterium-based transformation protocol for common bean and test several antimicrobial genes in transgenic bean lines for resistance against targeted fungal pathogens. Specific objectives of this project are, to establish a reliable Agrobacterium-based transformation system, generate independent transgenic bean lines expressing seven different types of antimicrobial proteins, and to screen the transgenic lines for resistance against soilborne fungal pathogens. A reliable common bean transformation system offers avenues for quick and targeted development of the next generation of improved genotypes able to mitigate negative effects of diseases, drought and other adverse growing conditions. Development of a reliable Agrobacterium based transformation protocol and disease resistant transgenic bean lines are two deliverable outcomes of this project.

Biological nitrogen fixation-in which legumes in symbiotic relationship with bacteria known as rhizobia capture atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into a form available to plants-is the major source of new nitrogen in organic agriculture. Composts or animal manures are used in conjunction with legumes to provide the remaining complement of major and minor nutrients. Legumes can provide as much as 300 pounds/acre of nitrogen, although 80-150 pounds/acre is more common. In addition to fixing nitrogen, leguminous cover crops serve multiple functions in organic farming systems. The functions we hear mentioned most often by organic growers are: 1) build soil organic matter 2) suppress weeds, 3) provide habitat for beneficials, 4) suppress disease, 5) improve soil tilth, 6) reduce nitrate leaching, and 7) reduce soil erosion. To increase the probability that a cover crop can achieve these multiple functions, organic farmers often plant mixtures that combine legumes with non-nitrogen-fixing plant species. Grasses, for example, are usually more effective for weed suppression and reducing soil erosion, while brassicas excel at capturing nitrate to reduce leaching losses, particularly in sandier soils. A major challenge faced by farmers who rely on biological nitrogen fixation as the chief source of nitrogen additions is determining how to optimize the process to meet cash crop nutrient requirements while also managing cover crops to deliver other key benefits. The long-term goal of this project is to develop guidelines that can be used by organic farmers to select the best cover crops for grain and vegetable production systems in the northeast. We will pursue questions about how organic management regimes and the resulting soil legacies interact with plant and microbial species to regulate biological nitrogen fixation and other nitrogen cycling processes that govern crop production and environmental impacts. Our approach combines on-farm research with field station experiments, farmer directed cover crop trials, and a suite of integrated outreach activities. The proposed project targets five goals: 1. Conduct research in organic and conventional farms to determine the impact of long-term organic management and specific practices on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental services. 2. Characterize cover crops in terms of a variety of attributes that impact crop production and environmental services. 3. Improve the Denitrification-Decomposition model to simulate N2O emissions from organically farmed landscapes in the Northeastern US. 4. Engage in outreach activities with organic farmers and policy-makers to optimize environmental services in organic farming systems and develop metrics/tools that can be used to implement policies rewarding farmers for these services. 5. Develop and test a course that trains the next generation of agricultural scientists in how to conduct collaborative, agroecological, on-farm research."

This project builds on the success of a former OREI-funded project and seeks to institutionalize the relationships we have developed into a center that will serve the organic community for decades. The impetus for our project grew directly out of a series of farmer panel discussions hosted by North Carolina State's Organic Cropping Systems Program. At these panel discussions, farmers voiced concern over increasing privatization of breeding, decreasing availability of GMO-free varieties, and lack of breeding under organic conditions. This project fits squarely under OREI priority four, to:  Strengthen organic seed systems... goals of organic seed systems proposals can include, but are not limited to: disease and pest resistance, stress tolerance, quality and yield improvement, and genetic mechanisms to prevent inadvertent introduction of GMO traits through cross-pollination.  Our new center has the intention and capability to release corn hybrids resistant to GMO contamination, increase weed competitive ability in soybeans, find seedling disease resistance in peanuts, discover allelopathic wheat lines through our newly developed protocols, and to increase the yield of all four crops under organic conditions."

Multi-functional cover crops will include winter pea and crimson clover (N-fixers), oats and cereal rye (weed suppressors) and oilseed radish (reactive N and P recycler, compaction alleviator, and disease minimizer) and organic amendment will be the mined Zeolite (reactive N trapper).

In systems where N fertilizer can be replaced or offset with N from biological N fixation (BNF), GHG can be significantly reduced through decreased fossil fuel based inputs and reductions in GHG emissions from fields. Furthermore, increased soil C sequestration and resulting improvements in soil health also result in greater yield stability in an uncertain climate. We address two Challenge Area Goals: Climate change mitigation and adaptation and the Program Priority Area of food and fiber production systems, with a focus on legumes. The over-arching goal is to reduce use of Haber-Bosch N though increased adoption of green manures.

Contamination by Salmonella can occur anywhere from field to the kitchen. Outbreak by Salmonella has not declined in the past fifteen years, and even worse, every year different Salmonella serotypes have emerged as causative agents of foodborne illnesses. No single molecular diagnostic test is so far available to detect multiple foodborne Salmonella serotypes simultaneously. This project proposes three objectives 1) Develop simultaneous, rapid and robust identification tool for multiple Salmonella serotypes, 2) Develop nano-particle based specific identification of a small number of Salmonella from different food products, 3) Exploits the intrinsic nature of gold nano-particle aggregation to develop naked eye pathogen detection technology. The project involves different interdisciplinary approaches including microbiology, food safety, genomics and nanotechnology. Findings of this study will ensure emplacing an effective means of detection prior to any incident to identify and apply appropriate risk mitigation measures. Moreover, the output of this project could provide reliable detection techniques to identify pathogenic Salmonella in human food supply systems, before the agents reach the consumer. Rapid assays will be patented for commercial use, and findings will be disseminated in the form of publications and presentations.

Next is the development of regionally-appropriate, whole-farm, and crop-specific sustainability metrics, while also giving attention to potential barriers to grower adoption of these tools. On-farm trials and field research will test credibility for sustainability claims relative to environmental and economic impacts in Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. Lessons learned from pursuing this long-term objective will be realized through a strong Extension based and outreach effort. Traditional outreach techniques will be integrated with innovative media favored by growers and the processing industry.

Two highly damaged crops, fresh tomato and pepper, represent 18% of the value of all U.S. vegetables, with 85% of pepper and 65% of fresh market tomato acreage grown in states involved in this project. In addition, Georgia is the largest peanut producer in the U.S. Members of our team work in the most threatened geographic areas, positioning us to coordinate management of thrips and tospoviruses, create networks to sustain economic viability of farm operations, and enhance quality of life for farmers and society nationally. Feeding by thrips populations causes direct damage that reduces marketability; however, the greatest damage stems from their spread of tospoviruses, e.g. Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). TSWV is among the world's most damaging plant viruses, causing estimated crop losses over $1 billion (US) annually. Detailed information on importance of these pests in fresh market tomato, pepper, peanut and onions, and current control means have been summarized in  Crop Profiles,  Pest Management Strategic Plans, and multiple outreach publications, supporting our goal of discovering and creating new technologies for national deployment to producers via the Pest Management Network (PMN) hosted by the American Phytopathological Society (APS). Human populations are expected to grow to over 9 billion by 2050, requiring production of 70-100% more food. This project integrates our unique research and outreach strengths, leverages and builds on our long held, successful collaborations and synergies from complementary research and extension programs across multiple geographic areas. We will significantly advance creation of knowledge-based tools and our combined efforts will permit design, testing and deployment of new management tactics with multiple strategies. A major, sustainable outcome will be the web-based pipeline for rapidly deploying new information (the PMN). Although it is broadly recognized that significant advances occur at disciplinary interfaces, most student training in vector-virus relationships occurs in separate departments of plant pathology and entomology. Students do not have opportunities for interdisciplinary experiences, thus limiting their understanding at topical interfaces where the most significant innovations occur. Furthermore, high proficiency in all the topics important to navigating plant-virus-insect interactions is rarely found in a single department or institution. We will mitigate this problem by applying our diverse expertise to initiate an educational network, the TTEN. Participants and mentors recruited from multiple institutions, including minority-serving campuses, will use electronic media and video-linking technologies to develop and launch annual cyber research symposia and student information exchanges. The learning community that will grow from this effort will educate future scientists to solve complex problems in an integrative and collaborative fashion."

This area also has strong potential for low-input organic sheep production, but access to sources of grazing and feed represents a challenge for ranchers. Re-integrating livestock into diversified organic farming systems could enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of organic production in semiarid environments. Based on inputs from our advisory board, we have developed this regional research/extension/education project to evaluate integrated animal and crop production systems. This redesigned system replaces tillage with targeted sheep grazing to terminate legume cover crops, manage crop residues, and reduce weed, insect, and pathogen pressures. Advantages of the proposed system include reduced soil erosion, enhanced pest control, improved soil quality, enhanced nutrient cycling, and diversification of the economic base of the organic enterprise. This systems-level study combines on-farm research with information gathered in controlled experimental plots to increase our knowledge-base in the areas of crop production, animal health, holistic pest management, and economics. We will deliver our results through field days, news releases, technical bulletins, stakeholder and professional presentations, and web-based outlets. We will develop training opportunities and educational resources on sustainable organic agriculture for undergraduate and graduate students, and elementary and secondary rural schoolteachers. This information will help new and existing organic growers in semiarid regions balance economic and environmental constraints with sustainability goals.

Walnuts are the fourth largest U.S. specialty crop export which places the US as the world's largest exporter of walnuts with over 50% sold on the export market. Walnuts are among the most nutrient-dense whole-food sources of the short-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that protects the heart against cardiovascular disease and have been placed on  super food  list by the US Food & Drug Administration. In addition, walnut is an important hardwood with an estimated standing timber value of over $539 billion. Most commercially cultivated walnut trees, grown for nut production, are grafted on rootstocks to limit root diseases which currently cause an estimated 18% annual loss worth $191 million to the industry. The availability of new pathogen-resistant rootstocks is critical for the viability of the walnut industry and is ranked by the US walnut industry as its top research priority. We will use an integrated approach encompassing, disease resistance-screening, plant propagation, genomics, and conventional and novel breeding strategies to develop, characterize, and deploy clonal walnut rootstocks with improved resistance to four major soilborne diseases caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Phytophthora spp., Pratylenchus vulnus, and Armillaria mellea. This work will exploit the Juglandaceae germplasm collections in the USDA-ARS National Clonal Germplasm Repository in Davis, CA and the Missouri Horticulture and Agroforestry Research Center in New Franklin, Mo. Together, these collections comprise the largest assemblage of wild Juglans spp. in North America. In this process we will identify genes conferring resistance to these diseases and develop SNP markers for their selection in segregating populations and integration into commercial rootstocks. Emerging walnut rootstock diseases, such as Thousand Canker Disease and Paradox Canker, will be monitored by integrated outreach. A comprehensive economic analysis will optimize nursery propagation strategies and quantify the value to the industry of using pathogen-resistant clonal rootstocks developed here.

We developed a system in Florida where scouting data is recorded directly on a smartphone, uploaded to a server, where it is then mapped and easily shared via the internet. The objectives of this project are: 1) Adapt a smartphone and web-based scouting system currenlty in testing in Florida to California vegetable and grape production by creating digital maps of production fields, and incorporating the database of insect and disease pests into the system; 2) Hold training workshops in Florida and California to enlist growers to use the system and encourage areawide pest management practices; 3) Evaluate the utility of using regional scouting data to base management actions through case studies of the whitefly-transmitted viruses Tomato yellow curl virus and Squash vein yellowing virus in Florida, the mealybug-transmitted Grapevine leafroll-associated viruses in California, and the thrips-vectored viruses Tomato spotted wilt virus and Groundnut ringspot virus in California and Florida.

Here, the river meanders across the floodplain and frequently floods in winter, and not all farms are protected by levees. Severe flooding in the 1980s drove some farmers out of the area, and their abandoned land was acquired by public agencies for habitat restoration. These restored forest sites have now been around for as long as 20 years, and they provide a unique opportunity to both reduce the impact of climate change, and potentially provide income to the most vulnerable farmers. Because trees soak up atmospheric carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, as they grow, California now compensates forest owners for reforestation, forest preservation, or changes to forest management that result in more carbon uptake. Farmers in flood-prone areas might be more likely to benefit from these  carbon credits  if they could predict how much they could earn from  farming carbon  rather than nuts or prunes. We take advantage of the fact that the restoration plantings were all done with similar tree species, on similar soils, to analyze the many different sites that were planted over two decades as though they were a single forest site measured at different timepoints between age 0 and age 20. In this way we can look at the trajectory of carbon uptake by the forests and predict income from carbon credits. The economic analysis will include other possibilities for farmers to earn income from habitat restoration besides carbon credits, such as conservation easements. We'll also use our data to figure out if the existing models that predict forest growth, which were developed for timber species like Douglas fir and pines, are any good for predicting forest growth when the community consists of cottonwoods, willows, sycamores, and other riparian species. Being able to use a model to predict carbon accumulation, rather than taking expensive on-the-ground measurements, would further help farmers benefit from carbon credits in California."

With no eradicative controls, prevention is essential. This is attempted primarily through fungicides and preventative pruning, but grower adoption of such practices in mature vineyards and orchards comes too late for effective control. This is in spite of the fact that these diseases are widespread across the entire acreage of these crops and that these diseases are the main depreciable driver of crop longevity. Gaps in our ability to detect the pathogens in the nursery and the field, insufficient knowledge of disease-resistant cultivars, and a weak understanding of the socioeconomic factors that limit grower adoption of preventative practices contribute to a high disease incidence. Accordingly, we propose the following objectives: (i) to develop new detection tools for use by diagnosticians, nurserymen, and growers, (ii) to identify sources of resistance in the germplasm, and (iii) to encourage adoption of preventative control practices in young vineyards and orchards. These objectives are the main priorities for wood-canker disease research, as identified by an SCRI planning grant-funded series of meetings and workshops with an advisory board of commodity representatives, and with research and extension agents from across the US.

However, difficulties in controlling diseases that plague this particular crop are economically limiting in the MAR. Such diseases include those caused by fungi and fungal-like pathogens, as well as an animal pathogen, a small worm called a Root-Knot Nematode, which is an escalating concern on lima beans in the MAR.

For many years, researchers at University of Delaware and University of Maryland have worked with lima bean growers and processors on certain aspects of controlling these diseases, however a comprehensive plan for generating and fostering more economically efficient and environmentally friendly pest management practices had yet to take shape. Our project goals are to develop these practices and strategies to tackle these pressing concerns, and then to implement these practices in the field and teach the growers and processors how to use them. We have a structured, yet flexible time-table that will allow us to obtain feedback from the growers as we move through the project, at the beginning, middle and end stages. We will also host  field-person  schools in order to teach  on-the-ground  decision makers in the industry, in person, how to implement the practices we've developed; likewise, they will also have access to these trainings via a YouTube channel called  2012limabean .

A class of proteins (termed RXLR effectors) has been identified as being key for the pathogens ability to infect the host. These proteins are secreted from the pathogen and enter the host cell where they modify cell physiology. This system is further complicated by the fact that it is genetically diverse and readily utilizes sexual recombination to maintain its diversity in US fields. By determining what genes are turned on within both the host and pathogen during infection (and by doing this across many unique genetic variants in the pathogen) we can understand what genes within the pathogen are important for infection and how genetic variations between isolates effect the plant responses. This knowledge can then be used to guide breeding choices when developing strains of plant that are resistant to the pathogen."

Developing these tests is the main theme of this research, as well as moving the American chestnut closer to restoration. Our previous funded BRAG research on immature chestnut trees established two shelterwood and two open field plots consisting of a standard panel of American, Chinese (C. mollissima), hybrid, and backcrosses, as well as several transgenic types of American chestnut trees. The transgenic trees included empty vector controls (transgenic tree with no resisance genes), and trees with single and stacked resistance-enhancing genes. To date, the differences between transgenic and conventionally-bred trees have not exceeded variation found between conventionally-bred cultivars for the environmental impacts evaluated in our previous study. In this follow-up study, the trees will be four years of age and are entering their reproductive age with the production of male catkins and pollen. In the context of this milestone, we will assess 1) gene stability in the transgenic parent trees and their seedling offspring, 2) compare the biochemical content of stems, leaves, pollen, and nuts between the transgenic and conventionally-bred chestnuts, and relate these results to: 3) growth and survival of select plant eating insects 4) decomposition of leaf litter, and 5) growth characteristics of the trees. Our hypothesis is that differences will be seen in the transgenic trees but their environmental impact will not be significantly different than the inherent variation among conventionally-bred trees. The results will inform regulators on the environmental impact of genetically engineered trees."

Consequently, the federal government implemented mandates to increase production and consumption of renewable liquid transportation fuels made from agricultural crops and crop residues. As a result conventional food, feed, and fiber agricultural crop acreages are already being converted to biofuel cropping systems, and this is expected to intensify as demand for biofuels grows. Despite these mandates, we have a limited understanding of the environmental implications of converting current crop land to biofuel crops. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to enhance our understanding of the environmental implications of direct land use change from conventional cropping systems to biofuel cropping systems. Specifically, the objectives of the project are to quantify and compare the effects on crop yield, cropping system water use and water quality, and cropping system greenhouse gas regulation (soil carbon dynamics) of converting current conventional cropping systems in the Southeast to emerging biofuel cropping systems. These objectives will be addressed with two large field experiments, one comparing an annual sweet sorghum biofuel cropping system to a cotton-peanut rotation and the other comparing a perennial elephantgrass biofuel cropping system to a perennial bahiagrass pasture system. In both experiments, the biofuel crops will be converted to two different fuels, in one case using pyrolysis and in the other case using microbial fermentation. In both biomass conversion processes a waste product is generated that could be returned to the cropping system as a soil amendment, potentially enhancing the environmental sustainability of biofuel cropping systems. Expected outcomes from dissemination of the outputs of this project include a change in knowledge of the scientific community regarding ecosystem services of biofuel cropping systems, an impact on stakeholder behavior with regard to crop species selection and production practices, an increase in stakeholder adoption of using biofuel conversion waste products as soil amendments, an impact on future water planning of stakeholders/growers, an improved public perception of biofuel cropping systems, and broadly trained experts in ecosystem services of biofuel cropping systems, This project will therefore result in identification of relatively sustainable biofuel cropping systems for the region."

Our efforts will target on emphasizing the superiority of third-generation TSWV-resistant cultivars over the previous generation cultivars with regards to susceptibility to TSWV and/or thrips. We will highlight the usefulness of these cultivars as an integral part of the new TSWV management package for peanut through oral presentations, feature articles, and by conducting workshops. We also intend to include these new cultivars as a parameter in the peanut risk index. Peanut growers throughout the southeast currently use the TSWV risk mitigation rating. Hence, this would be an ideal platform to disseminate the information. Feature articles and workshops will highlight the importance of these cultivars and their compatibility with new insecticides and the flexibility they offer in terms of utilizing cultural practices. The econometric analyses will indicate the monetary benefits of utilizing these cultivars over the earlier generation TSWV-resistant cultivars. Cost benefit analyses will be exhaustive and will provide information on break-even points and will also include long-term investment in equipment. Finally, a detailed follow-up of adoption of the recommended tactics/management package will also be undertaken through electronic and non-electronic conventional surveys."

In the 1980s the peanut crop was extremely susceptible to TSWV. Since then breeding efforts have tremendously improved field resistance to TSWV. But, resistance to TSWV has only accrued in slight increments. For instance, we currently have three generations of TSWV-resistant peanut genotypes with field resistance at the third generation being the highest. Even the second-generation TSWV resistant cultivars display systemic TSWV infection symptoms upon inoculation. But, the combination of cultural and chemical tactics so far has allowed growers to avoid substantial losses. Until now, the application of Temik and Thimet has been critical for thrips and spotted wilt management. However, production of Temik is halted already, and its usage will be phased out by 2018. Thimet, another compound with broad-spectrum toxicity will likely be phased out soon. Thus, it is critical to compensate their loss. With the levels of field resistance that the third generation cultivars possess, we may no longer need these insecticides. Recent results with second-generation cultivars have indicated that neoncotinoids and spionsyns could serve as replacements. Their compatibility with third generation cultivars will be tested through this grant. Third generation cultivars could also offer more flexibility with cultural operations. For instance, peanut planting in mid to late April was discouraged as it increased the likelihood of TSWV incidence. Growers had to wait until mid may or later to plant. But, growers at times find it difficult to exactly use this time window. With third generation TSWV-resistant peanut cultivars, it may be possible for growers to plant either in April or in May without concern. Also, sparse planting resulted in increased spotted wilt resistance. As a consequence, increased seeding rate and plant stands were recommended. This recommendation increased the cost of seeds. With the third generation peanut genotypes it may not be critical to maintain such high plant stands and instead use a reduced seeding rate (at least by one-third to half). With earlier generation TSWV-resistant peanut cultivars cultural practices including twin row planting suppressed TSWV incidence. But with third generation cultivars practices such as twin-row planting may not be that critical. Clearly, there might be more flexibility with third generation cultivars. These cultivars might also be the most compatible with organic peanut production and the demand for organic peanut production is consistently increasing. Until now, TSWV has been the major production constraint for organic peanut producers. With third-generation cultivars it may be possible to integrate the usage of organic insecticidal compounds and still achieve substantial spotted wilt control. By integrating third generation highly resistant TSWV-resistant cultivars we can reduce the cost of production and make peanut production more profitable."

Most crop protection products (fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators and biopesticides), necessary tools in the integrated  war  against destructive pests, are developed for large markets on major crops such as corn, soybean and cotton where the cost of discovery, development, registration and production can be offset by significant sales of the product. Due to the expensive process of bringing a new chemical crop protection product to market (in the US, the cost is in excess of $50 million dollars), the agriculture chemical industry often does not register their products on specialty crops (most vegetables, fruits, nuts, herbs, nursery and flower crops) - the cost of required data is greater than potential return on investment. IR-4 endeavors to provide domestic specialty crop growers the means to remain viable and competitive by facilitating the registration of crop protection products on specialty crops and is the only publicly supported research program in the US to do so."

In addition, nitrogen inputs from legume cover crops can reduce the demand for fossil-fuel based fertilizer inputs, resulting in decreased greenhouse gas emissions. This research will improve our understanding of cover crop effects on nutrient cycling in cropping systems using greenhouse and field experiments. We will integrate results into an existing cropping systems model to estimate the relative importance of cover crop effects on carbon and nitrogen cycling on grain farms. Through collaborations with a larger cover crop research team, we will integrate results into a broad suite of outreach activities through which farmers will increase understanding of the multiple ecosystem services provided by cover crops and will increase cover crop adoption."

There is a critical need to minimize the risk of foodborne pathogens in low-moisture foods by incorporating a lethality step in the last leg of production processes. Radio frequency (RF) waves heat these products rapidly and volumetrically and therefore we propose to develop a high temperature short time RF process. Heating non-uniformity and arcing have been the major issues limiting the successful deployment of RF process technology. We propose modeling as a tool to develop guidelines for design of RF applicators and design of continuous treatment systems (pumps for paste and conveying and packaging systems for powders) to improve heating uniformity and therefore food safety. The overall hypothesis is that computer aided design of RF process system will result in improved heating uniformity which will facilitate development of high temperature short time RF treatments for enhanced microbiological safety of the products. The specific objective are to: 1) develop continuous RF processing system for in-package powder (wheat flour) and pumpable food pastes (peanut butter) by using computer simulation as tool for designing applicator and package configuration for uniform heating, 2) determine RF process parameters based on microbial inactivation kinetics and product quality deterioration kinetics, and 3) validate process design with microbial challenge study. The successful development of RF processing for two products will wide open the application of this technology in to other low moisture food products. Development of this RF-based lethality step will improve microbiological safety and will give a competitive edge to US food processers in global market."

However, most food allergens are proteins and food allergies have been adversely affecting an increasing number of patients. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the number of American children suffering from food allergies increased 18% in just 10 years (1997-2007). Because the understanding of this potentially life-threatening IgE-mediated hypersensitivity disease is still very limited, the recommended care for individuals with known anaphylactic reactions to foods is avoidance, recognition of early symptoms of an allergic reaction, and prompt use of injected epinephrine in case of accidental ingestion. Steps to prevent severe food allergic reactions include precautions in the lunch rooms at schools and proper labeling of packaged food. Thus, the food allergy problem affects not only allergic patients but also the general public, and its negative impacts on food distribution and on the agricultural and food industries are becoming more and more serious. This study aims to increase food safety and sustainable use of agricultural crops, including tree nuts, milk and tomatoes. The overall goal of this project is to improve basic scientific understanding of allergenicity through characterization of food allergens and to study effects of conventional and novel food processes on allergenicity. This project will concentrate on several tree nuts (almonds, pecans and peanuts) that cause severe persistent allergies, on milk which causes the most common childhood allergy, and on tomatoes that cause allergies that have received less attention. The following are specific objectives of the proposed plan: Objective 1: Characterize allergens from different foods to obtain information regarding their relative potency. Objective 2: Determine the relative importance of linear and conformational epitopes in different food allergens for binding to immunoglobulin E. Objective 3: Investigate the effect of different food processing technologies on the allergenicity of allergens in milk, tomatoes, almonds, and pecans.Approach:   Food allergen researchers either concentrate on studying a single allergen or a few selected allergens from a food. In this project, all known allergens from a chosen food will be purified and their relative potency will be assayed by IgE binding using patient sera with Western blot and/or ELISA. If a food belongs to one of the eight major food allergen sources (e.g. almonds considered as a tree nut) but only few allergens has been identified in it, potential allergens will also be purified based on knowledge of protein families and information about allergens in other foods to facilitate the identification of new allergens and better understanding of the allergenicity of food proteins. The relative importance of linear and conformational epitopes in different food allergens will be studied by competition ELISA using patient sera, native allergens, and allergen fragments. Nuts, milk, and fruit will be subjected to novel and conventional food processing methods, including jet cooking, extrusion, and pulsed UV. The effects of food processing on the allergenicity of food allergens will be assessed by Western blot and ELISA and by cell based methods, such as basophil activation tests in order to obtain information that can be used to understand the use of and guide the development of food processing technologies for reducing allergenic potential of food proteins."

As part of the LTAR network, and in concert with similar long-term, land-based research infrastructure in Southeastern Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain region, use the GACP LTAR to improve the observational capabilities and data accessibility of the LTAR network, to support research to sustain or enhance agricultural production and environmental quality in agroecosystems characteristic of the Southeastern Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain region, as per the LTAR site responsibilities and other information outlined in the 2012 USDA Long- LTAR Network Request for Information (RFI) to which the location successfully responded, and the LTAR Shared Research Strategy, a living document that serves as a roadmap for LTAR implementation.  Participation in the LTAR network includes research and data management in support of the ARS GRACEnet and/or Livestock GRACEnet projects.  Approach: This project will provide new knowledge on the long term effects of agricultural management on water quality, hydrology, and ecosystem services of agricultural watersheds/landscapes in the Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain. The region is characterized by intensive row-crop agriculture with vegetable, fruit, and nut production increasing rapidly.  Riparian forests occur along stream channels. Cropping practices and patterns in the region are expected to change as bioenergy crops are introduced and as climate change affects crop choices, pest pressure, and crop management. Water quantity and quality will be affected by increased water demand, expanded acreages, increased agrichemical inputs, and increased variability in weather and climate. Ecosystem services derived from agricultural landscapes, and the potential for agriculture to enhance these services, also need quantification. The research will: a) quantify processes controlling nutrient and agrichemical transport; b) develop conservation practices to minimize environmental impacts; and c) quantify the effects of watershed management on water resources and ecosystem services. Research results will be used to better represent these processes in state of the science models. Smaller scale studies will provide new information that will enhance understandings at the field and watershed levels. Watershed scale hydrology and water quality data characterizing the impacts of bioenergy crop establishment will provide direct measures of their effects when integrated into land management. Field surveys combined with modeling will be used to determine the effects of distribution of conservation practices, pest management, water withdrawals, ponds, and irrigation uses on water quantity and quality. Comparisons of urban and agricultural water quality and quantity will serve as a direct measure of an ecosystem service from agriculture. Remote sensing tools will be used to determine how the ecosystem services soil carbon and water holding capacity are related to crop production. Long term agroecosystem research will be implemented to establish a research platform and infrastructure to study techniques of sustainable intensification of Coastal Plain agriculture at multiple scales.  Partnerships will be established with research and technology transfer organizations in the southeast to establish a framework to evaluate the effects of agriculture on ecosystem services.  Watershed research approaches will be augmented by landscape ecology approaches to quantify effects on ecosystem services on multiple scales, including effects of land cover change and land use intensification.  New technologies will be evaluated on field and watershed scales to determine potential for increasing production with current or reduced resource use.  Replicated field scale experiments and farm-scale watershed experiments will be established in conjunction with USDA, university, and private research cooperators to provide a platform for long term (decade or more) research on major crops in rotation, biomass production for bioenergy and soil carbon accretion, and integrated effects of crop production on soil ecology."

Biological control organisms are being marketed for use in cotton and peanut, and also occur naturally in fields.  We will explore the effect of crop production practices (tillage, fumigation, cultivar, and cover crops) on these antagonistic organisms with the goal of conserving or enhancing their activity against nematodes.  We will identify crops that can be grown in rotation with cotton and peanut that will reduce populations of root-knot nematode either by producing toxic metabolites (high residue rye) or by limiting nematode reproduction (sorghum for bioenergy use).

Determine the population dynamics of sexually reproducing Aspergillus flavus under field conditions.  2.  Identify genes in Aspergillus flavus responsible for virulence during the infection process and elucidate the role of fungal gene products for overcoming peanut resistance mechanisms.  3.  Determine the role of defensive peanut phytoalexins in mediating natural crop resistance against Aspergillus flavus.  Approach: Sclerotia of A. flavus will be collected from corn grown in a randomized complete block design consisting of four overhead irrigation treatments to provide different degrees of drought stress.  Experiments involving natural field populations of A. flavus will be conducted during years 1 and 2.  The same procedure will be repeated for years 3 and 4, except that corn ears will be sprayed with a conidial suspension of a non-toxigenic biocontrol strain (NRRL 21882 [from Afla-Guard® ] or AF36).  Sclerotia will incubated on the surface of nonsterile soil (100% relative humidity) for 5-7 months.  Ascospores from fertile sclerotia will be germinated to obtain progeny strains.  To detect genetic recombination, total genomic DNA will be isolated from progeny strains.  Recombination events due to independent assortment of chromosomes and crossing over will be detected by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and linkage disequilibrium/compatibility analyses.  Genes encoding putative phytoalexin-detoxification enzymes (PDEs) will be cloned from pathogenic A. flavus strains.  PDE production by A. flavus will be induced in culture by the presence of purified peanut phytoalexins or peanut seeds.  cDNA libraries will be generated and used as templates to amplify candidate genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).  Native in vitro-expressed proteins will be purified and their activity will be tested against a variety of purified peanut phytoalexins.  Liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS) analysis of the phytoalexin samples after exposure to the various purified proteins will be used to detect potential enzymatic modifications of the phytoalexin compounds.  Target PDEs will be analyzed from different genotypes of A. flavus and A. parasiticus to assess the genetic variability of these enzymes and thus predict the potential effectiveness of PDE inhibitors.  A model system will be developed to screen PDE inhibitors.  Pathogenicity tests will be conducted on single peanut seeds inoculated with A. flavus after the application of inhibitory compounds.  The bioactivity of phytoalexins will be assayed against economically important plant pathogenic fungi grown on micro-plates.  The dynamics of phytoalexin formation will be studied by first determining the most fungal-resistant (high phytoalexin producers) and fungal-susceptible (low phytoalexin producers) peanut genotypes from a core collection of 108 genotypes.  Peanut seeds from genotypes will be subjected to different biotic and abiotic elicitors to elucidate changes in the composition of phytoalexins and to detect possible degradation products due to detoxification.  The embryos and cotyledons from seeds will be wounded and inoculated with fungi and bacteria, then extracted and analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/MS.  Data obtained from analyses of the core collection of peanut genotypes will be used to identify peanut germplasm with disease resistance.  To further examine phytoalexin detoxification (degradation) products, feeding experiments will be conducted in which fungi and bacteria are fed peanut phytoalexins followed by HPLC/MS/Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis."

High costs of grain and nitrogen (N) fertilizer, in conjunction with the environmental conservation attributes of grassland-based agriculture, have led to renewed interest in the use of N-fixing forage legumes as a source of feed for ruminant livestock. Improved BFT cultivars from this project could contribute to increased resiliency and sustainability of pasture-based beef production systems. We propose to increase the efficiency of beef gain on pastures by developing birdsfoot trefoil germplasm from which cultivars with improved stand longevity and tannin concentration could be developed. We will focus on the Eastern Transition Zone where significant cattle production takes place on toxic endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue [Schedonorus arundinaceum (Schreb.) Dumort.] pastures to the detriment of cattle health, gain, and reproduction. We will use a two-pronged approach by starting with (a) material from existing cultivars and breeding populations and (b) with 120 accessions from the National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS). The former have been selected fro aggronomic traits such as yield and persistence, whereas the latter has accessions with high tannin content. The resulting germplams will be extremely valuable for the development of improved BFT cultivars."

This project&#39;s overall goal is to enhance pest management practitioners&#39; skills that help to ensure both protection of human health and the environment and effective solutions to pest problems encountered by California agricultural producers and consumers. At least half the pesticides used in California are applied in urban or residential areas. Urban pesticide use has been increasingly implicated in pesticide runoff into creeks and streams, and nonagricultural pesticide use accounts for up to two-thirds of reported pesticide poisonings each year. To help consumers manage their pest problems while protecting the environment and their family&#39;s health, we will also create resources including diagnostic aids, seasonal checklists, and mobile-friendly resources to be used directly by consumers and other audiences. We will focus on training and providing outreach materials to groups with the most direct contact with the public: UC Master Gardeners, retail and garden center employees, public agencies, and landscape professionals. California almond, pistachio, and walnut crops together are valued annually at more than $6 billion and use more than 24 million pounds of pesticide (active ingredient). While effective IPM programs exist for each crop, availability of effective and extremely cheap broad-spectrum pesticides has brought us back to an era where pesticides are increasingly the method of choice for control, without due consideration of potential secondary effects such as off-target movement and impact on non-target species or poor control due to resistance. We will develop and conduct educational outreach to growers and consultants working in almonds, pistachios, and walnuts to encourage adoption of practices that improve pest management and reduce environmental risks. We will also produce materials about pesticide impacts on pollinators and make information more easily available for use in the field on tablets and smartphones, increasingly demanded by California pest control consultants in particular."

The separation of bacteria from a food sample remains the major obstacle for rapid detection. Although significant work has been performed in the area of rapid detection, these methods often require a concentrated clean sample. The field of rapid sample preparation has not received as much attention and therefore pre-enrichment of food samples remains the standard. If a reliable method for separation was developed, the time from analysis to results could be minimized resulting in a reduction in potential illness and costs. We have devised a method for bacterial separation using cobalt nanoparticles tagged with pathogen-specific bacteriophages. The uses of nanoparticles as compared to micro-scaled particles have previously demonstrated to have a significant increase in capture efficiency due to increased surface area. The binding affinity between phage and host has been demonstrated to be higher than that of antibodies allowing for a more reliable separation. The use of cobalt over iron allows for a much more rapid separation due to an increased magnetic pull. The ability to continuously collect samples from grains and nuts would be a tremendous benefit to their respective industries. We have developed a continuous sampling system designed to collect samples from the products as they transport on a conveyor. The system will pull the fines from interstitial spaces around the product and filter it. The particles are then pulled into a wetted cyclone which produces a 5 mL buffered sample."

While a significant accomplishment, important traits, such as earliness, were not fully maintained during the development of Type II pinto beans. To fully support breeding efforts within this new growth habit, it is necessary to: 1. develop a complete description of an ideal Type II pinto bean ideotype; 2. search the germplasm for important genetic variability that breeders can incorporate into they efforts to improve Type II pinto beans;, and 3. describe the genomic regions that can be targets for marker assisted breeding.

Although historically small grains, potatoes, sugar beets, and beans represented the primary crops, a surge in dairy production has lifted Idaho to the 3rd largest dairy-producing state in the U.S. Over 70% of the dairy cattle within the State reside within the south-centrally located Magic Valley. Idaho also has 115 permitted aquaculture facilities with approximately 98% of those facilities also located within the Magic Valley. Rainbow trout are most important in that Idaho provides approximately 70% of the domestic supply. Annual precipitation within the region averages less than 300 mm, thus making the Snake River a key resource linking crop production, dairy operations, and aquaculture. Critical to continued sustainability of agriculture in this region is irrigation water from Snake River dams, water that once applied to crops moves quickly through the sandy soils to shallow aquifers that drain back into the Snake River. Thus any contaminants originating from municipal or agricultural sources and transported through the soils are available in downstream waters reused for irrigation or for aquaculture. The ability of agricultural soils to attenuate transport and obviate the threat of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) such as hormones, antibiotics, and other veterinary drugs to environmental quality and downstream aquaculture operations is unknown. Our objective is to determine the capacity of soils in the Eastern Snake River Plain to attenuate the transport of biologically active concentrations of CECs contributed from irrigated, dairy manure-amended fields, thereby improving the sustainability of crop production, dairy operations, and aquaculture. We propose to not only identify and quantify potentially harmful CECs, but to assess biological impacts with respect to endocrine disruption and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Both field and laboratory studies will be conducted to identify harmful CECs (hormones, antibiotics, and other veterinary drugs) and Cu in manure and manure-amended agricultural samples and determine the potential biological impacts. Data will be used to construct a model that will predict the fate of CECs in the environment and whether those CECs will be potentially harmful to agricultural sustainability and human health. Our data will contribute to developing best management practices designed to minimize negative environmental consequences associated with the land application of dairy manure in an irrigated environment of critical importance to three major agricultural industries."

For example, genes for yield, disease and pest resistance, and tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought and heat, have been found in the wild ancestor but are absent in the corresponding crops. This projects seeks to facilitate the utilization of such extra diversity in the breeding of improved bean varieties, whether dry beans or green beans. The use of biodiversity collections for crop improvement has been limited in the past for a number of reasons, including the difficulty in evaluating such collections in a systematic way; and the difficulty in transfering genetic diversity of interest, while leaving deleterious wild trait behind. Wild beans are of great interest because genes for yield and disease and pest resistance have been identified previously among them, but also because they have a very broad geographic distribution from northern Mexico to northwestern Argentina, suggesting that they have diverse adaptations to drought or heat. In order to identify wild beans of interest in this broad distribution, we will perform a novel combination of analyses, namely an analysis of DNA diversity combined with a computer-based eco-geographic analysis to: 1) identify those wild bean populations that live in the driest/hottest environments; and 2) identify those genes or genome regions correlated with distribution in the driest/hottest environments.In turn, the chosen wild beans can then be used in crosses with domesticated beans to enhance drought or heat tolerance and using the genes identified as molecular markers in marker-assisted selection. This project will provide an unsurpassed detailed view of genetic diversity in wild beans, which will facilitate the maintenance and utilization of this biodiversity. It will develop a new high-throughput genomic resources for beans, namely a large number of new molecular markers. It will initiate new breeding efforts to obtain bean varieties that are more tolerant to drought and heat, two traits that may climate-proof beans."

SWD has since been confirmed from 38 states in the continental US and 14 countries since these initial observations. This recent range expansion has resulted in significant losses in crop yield and quality and risk of even more profound damage. Berries crops (e.g. caneberries, blueberries, and strawberries) and stone fruits (e.g. cherries) crops have been the most significantly impacted by SWD globally. Potential losses due to SWD in these crops in California, Oregon, and Washington have been estimated at $511 million annually (Bolda, et al. 2010), and potential losses in states participating in a Southern IPM Center sponsored SWD working group, eFly, have been estimated at $207 million annually (See Impacts of Spotted Wing Drosophila in the Eastern United States). Actual loss statistics have been more difficult to generate. Based on information from the twelve eastern US states participating in the eFly working group, impacts of SWD in blueberries, caneberries, and strawberries during 2012 were between $45 and $55 million, the vast majority of which was direct crop loss. However, the eFly working group noted that crop loss is likely a fraction of total SWD impact and that mechanisms to measure these less tangible costs should be developed. SWD infestation and crop losses have occurred in the southeastern US despite the fact that pesticide use has dramatically increased in order to meet the zero infestation levels required by fresh market wholesalers. Blueberries are valued at over $160 million annually in North Carolina and Georgia (USDA NASS Noncitrus Fruits and Nuts Summary 2012), the largest blueberry producing states in the southeast, and growers have indicated that pesticide applications have increased between 30-50% compared to 2009, prior to the introduction of SWD. This increase translates to weekly insecticide applications, which are reapplied if feasible in the event of rain, resulting in as many as twice weekly applications under adverse weather conditions. Similarly, caneberry growers produce a crop valued at over $15 million annually in North Carolina and Georgia have also resorted to weekly or even biweekly insecticide applications, making a total of up to 16 applications during the harvest period. Before SWD was detected in the southeast, one or no harvest period insecticide applications were made in caneberries. Our project will address the most pressing short and mid term managment needs for SWD by determining which season-long management programs are most effective and reducing SWD infestation and result in the fewest intended, potential deterimental consequences."

Food processors and consumers expect these products to be readily available with very high quality and at a reasonable price. This cannot be achieved without effective pest management methods. Many of the tools of pest management, particularly pesticides and biopesticides, require approval and registration by the Environmental Protection Agency for use on each individual crop. Providing the data to satisfy EPA is both expensive and time consuming, and many of the companies that produce these agents do not choose to go through this process for the smaller acreage crops because the return on their investment would be very low or negative. This is a problem for specialty crop growers worldwide. In the USA an effective solution exists in USDA&#39;s IR-4 program which generates these essential data and submits them to EPA. Without IR-4&#39;s efforts to make these materials available to growers, using both conventional and organic methods, many of these specialty crops could not be grown in the USA, and for others the cost and quality expectations of the public could not be met. This is a very effective investment of public funds. In 2011 an independent study at Michigan State University concluded that the approximately $16 million investment in IR-4 annually contributes $7.3 billion to the US economy and this includes over a $290 million to the Michigan economy. This supports over 100,000 jobs nationally. In addition, through its pesticide residue analytical work, IR-4 helps to ensure that the food supply in the USA is kept safe from possibly dangerous pesticide residues, and by focusing most of its program on newer and safer pesticide products, it helps decrease the current risks to farm workers, consumers, and the environment."

The overall goal is to reduce the risk of salmonellosis associated with low-moisture foods, by developing a model based on simple and fundamental interactions between bacteria and particles, which reveals how contamination can propagate within a processing system, and elucidating the physical mechanism of cross-contamination during nut processing. The specific objective isto develop avirtual computer system consisting of nuts and bacteria based on basicphysics, such as forces and movements, so that thecomputer system can simulate more complex real lifeprocessing and contaminationscenarioswithout actual experiments. The computer model performance will be compared with actual small scale experiment resultsto validate its accuracy and robustness.During this course of development, how bacteria move around dry nuts withvarying environmental factors, such as relative humidity, will be elucidated and incorporated into the computer simulation system. Although almonds and Salmonella are the test case of this study, the developed computer simulation can be easily expandedto other dry particulates and pathogens because the simulation will be developed based on fundamental interactions."

The research will be driven by the following hypotheses: (1) IC and soluble OC in biochar contribute to GHG emissions during the first few months after biochar has been added to soil, (2) the acid- and base-insoluble fraction (recalcitrant fraction) of biochar is highly resistant to mineralization, (3) the recalcitrant fraction of biochar will decrease GHG emissions from soils by facilitating OC stabilization, (4) biochar will increase SOC by enhancing the stabilization of OC and promoting greater net primary productivity, (5) biochar will decrease N2O emissions by decreasing soil bulk density and increasing aeration, and (6) the potential of biochar to enhance C sequestration will be greater in high-diversity agroecosystems than maize monocultures. The research will be conducted in three phases.In phase 1, six biochars will be analyzed to obtain characterization data needed to address hypothesis 1.In phase 2, three incubation experiments will be conducted. For the first experiment, two contrasting soils (silt loam and clay loam textures) from the field study sites (phase 3) will each be incubated with the six biochars analyzed in phase 1 for at least four months. Secondly, two of the biochars will be subjected to a series of treatments to isolate specific biochar fractions, and these fractions will be incubated with soil. Lastly, the biochar used in phase 3 will also be incubated with soil from one of the field sites at three different moistures and temperatures. GHG emissions from these soil-biochar mixtures as well as soil alone will be quantified at regular intervals throughout the incubations.For phase 3, I will measure GHG emissions at two different field sites where the mixed hardwood gasification biochar has already been applied to research plots. These plots contain the following cropping systems:continuous corn monoculture; switchgrass monoculture; a low-diversity, high-input grass-legume polyculture; and a high-diversity, low-input perennial polyculture (prairie mix)."

Ultimately, we will evaluate diverse germplasm for the capacity to physiologically acclimate to a water conservative production system our team has developed. Specifically, we will: 1) investigate the physiological and molecular basis of crop response to abiotic stress that occurs in limited water production systems, and the role of stress acclimation in this response, 2) develop straightforward crop management protocols that maximize plant acclimation capacity and effective water use while maintaining economic and environmental sustainability, and 3) use physiological and molecular methods to assist in selection and development of abiotic stress-tolerant peanut cultivars. Field trials will be conducted in both Texas and Florida using previously identified genotypes that have shown contrasting abilities to acclimate to mild water deficits early in development, along with a wider screening of genotypes from the core and mini-core collections. Large scale as well as in-depth physiological screening combined with genetic expression analysis will be conducted to elucidate mechanisms behind abiotic stress tolerance.

Hence IPM approaches will be investigated along with optimization of orchard floor management. Treatment impacts on biodiversity will also be assessed and compared. An advanced systems-based on-farm research approach will be implemented at five locations including three commercial farms. Simultaneously, in-depth optimization of key components will be investigated (e.g., optimization of microbial biological control applications and cultivar resistance).

Almost 80% of this economic sector is located in the Pacific Northwest (Washington and Oregon), California, and the Southeast (Texas and Florida). Orchards and vineyards in these regions provide healthful fruits and nuts to the nation and for export, support local tourism, and generate economic and environmental benefits. However, orchard and vineyard plants are vulnerable to numerous diseases caused by pests and microbial agents, making our food supply susceptible to both naturally-occurring and intentionally-released pathogens. Huanglongbing (HLB) is a pathogen that devastates citrus crops and the citrus industry desperately needs early detection of these infections. However, there are no robust diagnostic tests currently available for early identification of this or other citrus pathogens under field conditions. This proposal directly responds to the need to reduce the impact of plant pathogens and insect pests on citrus crops by developing a means of early detection. Our proposed technology senses and measures the odor signatures that emanate from the leaves of the plant to identify HLB infected trees from healthy trees. The odor signatures are composed of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with varying abundances that are different between healthy plants and diseased plants and from plants infected by different pathogens. Our prior work has shown that VOC signature identification can be effective at detecting HLB infected trees before the infection is visually apparent and before it can be confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis. The VOC signature detection technology proposed has been shown to be effective on sweet orange varietals (Hamlin, Valencia and Madame Vinous). The objectives will be to demonstrate that the VOC signature for HLB infection as detected by the EZKnowz tool is robust against background variations, evaluate the HLB VOC  fingerprint  across many citrus varietals, and optimize the EZKnowz instrument for performance optimization in urban areas and in commercial orchards. Anticipated Results and Potential Commercial Applications: The Phase I efforts will provide the information needed to build the engineering prototype instrument for economical use in commercial orchards and urban landscapes. The Phase II effort will demonstrate economic viability by developing a tool that will be sensitive to the HLB signature and sufficiently fast such that it can be useful beyond academic research. The technical benefit will be a deeper understanding of the response of plants to HLB infections across many citrus varieties. The economic benefit will be a tool that can be used in finding and managing HLB infestations in citrus trees. In Florida, the study by Hodges and Spreen estimates the difference between the scenarios with- versus without-HLB is a total output impact of &#8722;$4.541 billion, total value added of &#8722;$2.717 billion, total labor income of &#8722;$1.753 billion, and average total employment of &#8722;8,257 jobs. The impact of a similar infestation in California would likely be larger."

We recently isolated the Rhg1  gene  and discovered that it is actually a block of three different genes, and that this three-gene block is present in as many as ten repeated copies in the genome of SCN-resistant soybean varieties. Still, essentially nothing is known about how the proteins encoded by these genes confer SCN resistance. For the present project we propose to identify molecular mechanisms by which the three dissimilar Rhg1 gene products confer resistance to soybean cyst nematodes. As a second aim, we will carry out experiments to determine if the soybean Rhg1 gene cluster or analogous genes can be used to increase resistance of potato and sugar beet to economically important cyst nematode pathogens of those crops."

Root colonization by AM fungi (AMF) triggers profound physiological changes in the host plant thereby affecting other interactions with above- and below-ground organisms. Though, it has been proposed that the plant hormone, jasmonic acid plays a central role in AMF-induced resistance (AIR), the exact mechanisms involved in tripartite interactions (especially in crops) still remain unclear. In many cases, AMF-crop associations exist in the field under natural conditions, so it is essential to better understand the influence of AMF on plant-insect interactions, not only because of the AM symbiosis&#39; important role in nutrient cycling, but also, because of the deleterious effects caused by insects on crop yield and as vectors of devastating plant pathogens. This Seed Grant starts to fill the void regarding the potential impacts of AIR in potato especially against insects. It will allow us to establish the experimental conditions to study two tripartite interactions: 1) potato with AMF and potato aphids, and 2) potato with AMF and cabbage loopers. The research goals are: a) to evaluate the conditions to create a rigorous biological system to study AMF-potato-insect interactions, b) to examine the effects of above-ground insect herbivory and below-ground AMF colonization on potato plant physiology, and assess organism performance in these tripartite interactions, and c) to determine the impact of AIR in potato against insects of two feeding-guilds.We expect that: i) AMF-root colonized potato plants will exhibit enhanced systemic resistance against shoot herbivores; and ii) the AM-symbiosis will counteract the detrimental effects caused by insect herbivory. These are supported by our preliminary data showing that mycorrhizal barrel medic plants had fewer pea aphids feeding on them compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. The data obtained through this Seed Grant will strengthen a future grant proposal to AFRI aiming at elucidating the mechanisms through which AMF alter potato-insect interactions. The project outcomes will serve as a foundation to achieve our long-term goals of discovering genes useful in developing insect-resistant crops; therefore, this research has significance in enhancing food security and has practical applications for U.S. agriculture. Furthermore, the proposed project explores an environment-friendly approach to reduce the use of phosphate fertilizers and pesticides, thus it is of an urgent nature to the AFRI&#39;s priority area: Plant-Associated Insects and Nematodes."

This proposal addresses Program Area Priority  Understanding Plant-Associated Microorganisms and Plant-Microbe Interactions  (Priority A1121). The specific part of this program priority addressed is the  determination of molecular mechanisms of communication between plant-associated microorganisms (e.g....nitrogen-fixing bacterial endosymbionts) and their plant hosts.  The rationale for the proposed project is that symbiotic, nitrogen-fixing bacteria are extremely important for increasing productivity in agriculture and reducing nitrogen fertilizer usage. It is therefore necessary to gain a thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which these bacteria invade and colonize their plant hosts, in order to improve these processes in the native symbionts and hosts and ultimately transfer the capacity to perform these processes to non-native symbionts and hosts. The proposed research aims to determine the molecular mechanisms of communication between the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti and its agriculturally important hosts, the forage legumes Medicago sativa (alfalfa) and Medicago truncatula (barrel medic). Specifically, our long-term goals are to determine how the rhizobial exopolysaccharide succinoglycan facilitates bacterial invasion of plant roots, why chemical modifications to succinoglycan and its size distribution have a profound effect on invasion efficiency, and how the plant host perceives and responds to succinoglycan to build an  infection thread  pathway for the bacteria to invade plant roots. This work will also provide fundamental information about the interaction between bacterial acidic exopolysaccharides and host plant cells. These exopolysaccharides are important determinants in interactions between plants and pathogenic bacteria as well as symbiotic bacteria."

The overall objective of this project is to evaluate and develop this trait as a tool to improve drought tolerance in maize and eventually other crops. Specifically, we will: 1. Confirm the physiological utility of CCFN for root growth, soil exploration, and water capture from drying soil in controlled environments. 2. Identify genes underlying natural variation in CCFN and develop stocks that will support mechanistic assessment of its regulation and utility. 3. Evaluate the utility of CCFN for drought tolerance in the field in rainout shelters in PA and a field research facility in AZ. Defining and understanding traits enhancing drought tolerance is of considerable importance for keeping American agriculture competitive while ending world hunger, as well as adapting to climate change, two of NIFA&#39;s grand challenges. CCFN could be an entirely new tool for improving drought tolerance of crops. In addition to drought, CCFN may be useful in the acquisition of limiting soil nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. While this project focuses on maize, we have observed variation for CCFN in rice, sorghum, and common bean, so this trait may have broad utility. This project therefore addresses novel scientific issues that are of demonstrable relevance to human welfare."

Reliance on fossil fuels exposes the U.S. to a range of fluctuations, such as the changing price of crude oil and problems with supply and demand. Sustainable biofuels are an attractive alternative due to the abundant domestic biomass supply and the potential to reduce the carbon footprint by up to 80%. This project will focus on two common arid lands plants, Gindelia squarrosa (curtly top gumweed), and Ericameria nauseosa (rabbitbrush). Both plants are prevalent in the intermountain west on lands that are not generally suitable for food and feed crops, and both have potential as biofuel sources, but also for higher value industrial and consumer products. Rabbitbrush produces rubber, and gumweed produces a chemical, grindelic acid, which has properties similar to the industrial product, abietic acid. Thus, this investigation, by engineers, chemists and agronomists will examine a variety of avenues to produce fuels and biomaterials on lands that will not compete with food crops. Extensive arid lands exist in the western US, which are not suitable for growing food crops, but which might contribute significantly to biofuels production, particularly for plants that have relatively low water requirements. Gumweed (Grindelia squarrosa) is a hardy and versatile plant, indigenous throughout the Great Basin of Nevada, which has been successfully cultivated in an experimental setting. A biocrude oil is extracted from gumweed at about 70-85 gal/acre on an annualized basis in amounts comparable to that of soy beans, except that gumweed needs much less water. To utilize marginal arid land, which is unprofitable for food crop cultivation, for growing the dedicated energy crop can be truly valuable. It is estimated that if even 10% of sagebrush lands of Nevada are used to grow gumweed for aviation biofuels, 400-600 million gallons per year of jet biofuels could be produced, which can supply up to 20% the single largest fuel customer, the US military (jet fuel consumption was ~3.0 billion gallons in FY2008 (Andrews, 2009)). These considerations make gumweed a local solution in Nevada (as well as much of the intermountain west) to a national initiative. Cultivated gumweed contains 12-14% extractable hydrocarbons on a dry plant weight basis, and is composed of 60-75% grindelic acid. Grindelic acid is an excellent biomass feedstock source for jet fuel. Besides grindelic acid, the gumweed biocrude contains other terpenes, which, together with grindelic acid, are prone to forming coke at elevated temperatures. While both biodiesel and aviation fuel potential will be examined, the higher valued aviation fuel will receive the primary focus."

This allows for habitat management to improve wildlife and ecosystem restoration. Most of the CRP acreages in the Southeast have been planted to pine trees (loblolly, slash and longleaf) . These trees range in age from 10 to 17 years, requiring a management system that will make them productive and profitable, sustainable forestry practices are being sought. Silvopasture systems integrate trees, forages, livestock and related animals and plant species. Landowners derive impressive revenues and sustainable land use from silvopasture when practised.This project involves the participation of selected CRP landowners in three separate counties in the Tri-State areas of North Florida, South Georgia and Southeast Alabama). A two-tree-row methodology will be used in two acres of CRP land as trees will be thinned from a spacing of 12 ft x 12 ft to a spacing of 12 ft x 42 ft for the demonstration trials. For rotational grazin g purposes, 1 beef cattle and 5-7 goats will be grazed on bahia grass estblished in between tree rows in electrically fenced paddocks. Data will be collected on livestock performance, tree growth and pasture indicated by grazing response. We anticipate two main outcomes from this project: a brochure and a DVD detailing the various steps needed to successfully implement and mange a silvopasture system while converting CRP trees into a a sustainable forestry program. Secondly, a greater awareness for silvopasture among landowners and extension agents."

We will measure the fitness of ladybeetles exposed to aphid-produced toxins, and also evaluate whether the bacteria affect host plant usage by the aphid, thus determining the distribution and pest status of the toxic aphids across the landscape. Finally, we will investigate whether toxin production by these aphids compromises biological control of the aphids. In other words, are toxic aphids less likely to be eaten by predators, and thus worse pests, thanks to their toxin? This project will ultimately shed light on how bacterial symbionts affect the interactions between pest insects and beneficial predatory insects."

Traditional soil carbon models assume that soil C is linearly related to plant C inputs; however multiple studies have shown alternative relationships. For example, non-linearities appear to exist, where soil C is higher in systems receiving fewer C inputs. Such is the case at the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) Long Term Ecological Research site in SW Michigan, where the organic cropping systems have higher C concentrations despite lower total C inputs. This research hypothesizes that the observed non-linear relationships between plant C inputs and soil C sequestration can be explained by differences in microbial physiological traits and their response to plant resource quality. The potential significance of microbial physiology in driving non-linear soil C relationships arises from recent evidence that stable C is largely comprised of microbial biomass residues and byproducts. As such, soils characterized by high microbial biomass production may result in greater rates of stable SOM formation. If true, this has major implications for how we manage our soils: plant inputs that promote microbial activity and efficient growth, such as energetically favorable plant litter (i.e. legume covercrops) may be more effective at building soil C. To pursue this hypothesis the organic and conventional agricultural field sites from the KBS LTER will be used, where known non- linearities in soil C exist. These sites which differ in their plant input chemistry will be examined for differences in key traits of microbial biomass production (growth efficiency and growth rate) over two-year-long cropping cycles. Microbial physiology will be linked with how new C inputs are processed into various soil C pools and biomarker analyses will determine how differences in observed C allocation strategies influence the production of stable microbially-derived soil C. Results from this research could encourage new approaches for agricultural management and land-use conservation that emphasize building soil C by increasing microbial biomass production. Not only will this research advance our fundamental knowledge of soil C formation, but it will inform crop residue and soil C management decisions that impact long-term predictions of soil C stabilization and climate change mitigation."

This mutualism culminates in the formation of a new plant organ, called the root nodule, within which the bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a biological form that can be directly consumed by the plant. One striking feature of the symbiosis is its high level of specificity. Such specificity can occur at the early phase of the interaction that is associated with bacterial infection and nodulation as well as at the late phase of nodule development that is related to nitrogen fixation. Genetic control of symbiosis specificity is complex, involving complex signal communication between the symbiotic partners. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the signaling pathways leading to root nodule development, the molecular mechanisms underlying natural variation in nitrogen fixation efficiency/specificity are largely unknown. The goal of this proposal is to explore host genetic control mechanisms underlying strain-specific nitrogen fixation in the legume-rhizobial symbiosis using the Medicago-Sinorhizobium model."

Farmers are consumed by daily workload and have difficulty leaving the farm for management planning or educational events, resulting in a competitive disadvantage and posing a risk to the viability of sustaining their farm business.An integrated team of outreach professionals will work directly with 150 farms in the Champlain Valley to provide technical assistance and outreach support to plan and implement improved crop practices and supporting program implementation. The result will be a measured increase in farm profitability and environmental sustainability through improved soil health, increased crop production, enhanced pasture grazing management and alternative crop production systems.On-farm research trials will demonstrate the use of diversified cover crop mixtures to provide supplemental feed, increase soil organic matter, cycle on-farm nutrients and protect soil from erosion.

Like all aerobic organisms, terrestrial insects need oxygen to survive because it is important for generation of catabolic ATP. Hermetic storage is a widely adopted technique for preventing stored grain from being damaged by storage insect pests. This cultural control measure uses airtight containers and preserves grains by limiting access to oxygen required for insect development. By sealing grains in airtight bags and containers, the respiration of the feeding and growing insects raise levels of carbon dioxide while utilizing the oxygen, resulting in hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions. Such an environment is intended to cause insects to cease feeding, growing and reproducing, and eventually to die. However, many insects are very tolerant to oxygen deprivation, and can recover from hours to days of hypoxia exposure. This poses a difficulty in using hermetic storage as a means to control insect pests, leading to more loss of stored grains. Storage insecticides have human health and environmental consequences and are becoming less and less favorable. To protect and promote this cost-effective and environmentally friendly storage practice, it is imperative to have a deeper understanding of insect adaptive response to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Unfortunately, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms mounted by storage pests in response to hypoxia. We plan to use the cowpea bruchid as our model to dissect the complex transcriptional regulation of hypoxia-responsive genes. A genomic approach will identify a group of hypoxia-responsive genes from cowpea bruchids. We will study the transcriptional regulation of selected genes by identification of their interacting cis- and trans-factors. We expect that the results of these analyses will help expose insects&#39; resistance mechanisms against hypoxia, and possibly identify new vulnerable sites in adaptive regulatory pathways useful for pest management strategies in legumes and many other valuable food grains."

This research is to take the advantage of recently-developed high-throughput sequencing technology-based restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to map the genes controlling drought and heat tolerance and to develop SNP markers, the latest DNA marker technology, enabling efficient manipulation of heat and drought tolerances in cowpea and related species.

This research will not only map the drought and heat tolerant genes in cowpea, but also provide a platform for mapping the genes controlling several other biotic and abiotic stress tolerances such as aphid resistance and low-phosphorus tolerance, both of which are also of extreme significance for agricultural production of many crops. The drought and heat tolerant genes, once defined and cloned, will significantly advance our understanding of molecular basis underlying plant drought and heat tolerances, and help design tools enabling effectively combining multiple adaptive traits into new cultivars adapted to global changing climate in this and related crops, thus supporting the long-term genetic improvement in and sustainability of U.S. agriculture and food systems."

Their knowledge of healthy foods was extensive. They developed sophisticated agricultural systems that gave us beans, corn, potatoes, squash, tomatoes, and many other foods (Keoke &amp; Porterfield 2003). Their knowledge of medicinal plants was also extensive. They could cure scurvy centuries before Europeans and more that 200 indigenous drugs they used have been in the pharmacopoeia of the United States since 1820 (Vogel 1970). Thus, it is hardly surprising that traditional diets and lifestyles allowed them to enjoy excellent health and freedom from chronic disease. The picture of American Indian / Alaska Native (AI/AN) health today is very different. AI/AN have among the highest levels of health problems of all ethnicities in the U.S. in each of these areas: overweight / obesity, diabetes, alcoholism, drug abuse, heart disease, suicide, family violence, tobacco use, life expectancy, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and more. Many of these challenges are compounded by extreme poverty.Fortunately, solutions are available. Research shows that culturally-based approaches to addressing these challenges among AI/AN are more likely to succeed than non-cultural approaches (Halpern 2007; Minkler &amp; Wallerstein 2003; Smedley &amp; Syme 2000). For example, in a recent study among the Pima, participants were assessed for ethnic diet-type preference - Pima, Anglo, or mixed. Those who followed the traditional Pima diet had higher intakes of complex carbohydrates, vegetable proteins, dietary fiber, insoluble fiber, and the proportion of total calories from complex carbohydrates and vegetable proteins. The risk of developing diabetes in the Anglo-diet group was 2.5 times as high as in the Pima-diet group and 1.3 times higher in the mixed diet group than in the Pima-diet group (Williams et al. 2001).In addition to their impact on obesity, poor food behaviors also play a negative role in the continuum of substance abuse. Research shows that AI/AN and others who drink the largest quantity of alcohol, even infrequently, have the poorest eating habits, while people who drink the least amount of alcohol have the best quality diets (Breslow et al. 2006). While many tribal agencies throughout the United States engage in work related to wellness through traditional plants and foods, there is often little collaboration between these organizations. Most are burdened by incredibly heavy workloads. As such, tribal health clinics, schools, commodity foods programs, elders&#39; center, and similar programs often focus on only their own turf. The conference for which we are seeking funding brings representatives of these programs together, giving them opportunities to teach and learn from each other while initiating ongoing relationships that will benefit all.As our Plants Program gained success and notoriety in tribal communities throughout the region, we recognized the need for an organization focused on sharing not only the successes and resources of our program, but also those of other similar programs making a difference in Indian Country. With support from a National Institute of Food and Agriculture grant, we established the NWIC Institute for Indigenous Foods &amp; Traditions in 2011. The Institute&#39;s mission is: By embracing ancestral knowledge and identifying successful models of change, we can build tribal community strength and resilience. The Institute serves as a connecting point for all entities that touch on the world of traditional plants and foods. By hosting an annual conference, the Institute fosters opportunities for tribal agencies and allies to partner and collaborate."

In recent years, Salmonella has been frequently implicated in foodborne disease outbreaks associated with fruits, spices and nuts. The overall goal of this project is to identify and characterize bacterial determinants, food attributes, and environmental factors that affect the attachment, survival and persistence of Salmonella on the surface of different fruits and nuts in order to gain new knowledge regarding the physiology of this pathogen on such foods and to develop effective control measures to reduce its contamination. We will use combined microscopic, microbiological, molecular and genomic approaches to study the physical and molecular mechanisms used by Salmonella outbreak serotypes and strains to attach to and survive on different produce items including tomato, cantaloupe, black pepper, almond and hazelnut under environmental conditions relevant to processing and storage. Different fruit and nut surface characteristics will be examined for the attachment behavior of Salmonella. A newly constructed library containing over 4,000  barcoded  single-gene deletion mutants in Salmonella genomes will be used for systematic screening of additional genes required for Salmonella surface attachment. Results will be used for the development of knowledge-based intervention strategies that are effective and sustainable."

The export trade of certain horticultural products may be affected as well, with importing countries requiring quarantine treatments to prevent the introduction of exotic pests. Of particular concern to agriculture in the Western U.S. are field pests such as the olive fruit fly (Bactrocera oleae), navel orangeworm (Amyelois transitella), various mealybugs, and codling moth (Cydia pomonella), and storage pests such as the Indianmeal moth (Plodia interpunctella). Processors rely largely on chemical fumigants such as methyl bromide for insect disinfestation, but regulatory, environmental and safety concerns mandate the development of non-chemical alternatives. This project addresses this problem with a broad collaborative approach, examining both preharvest, biologically based control strategies as well as physical postharvest disinfestation treatments. Areas of investigation include the development of attract and kill traps for control of olive fruit fly, improved field control of navel orangeworm through mating disruption, mass trapping, sanitation and entomopathogenic nematodes, control of vineyard mealybugs through reduction of ant populations, combining forced hot air with controlled atmospheres to disinfest walnuts of codling moth, and the potential of the parasitoid Habrobracon hebetor as a natural control agent for navel orangeworm and Indianmeal moth. New, non-chemical methods for control of these economically important pests will be the outcome of this research."

Over the past five crop seasons (2007-2012), these crops have been grown on an average of 1,260,000 acres in the US with an average harvest value of over $320 million. These crops also contribute to the success of the US wheat and barley industry by serving as useful rotation crops in small grain production systems.   This research project has three objectives that focus on developing new and improved varieties of cool season food legumes (peas, lentils, and chickpeas) and effective integrated disease control strategies for these crops.   1) Develop and release new varieties and germplasm of peas, lentils, and chickpea that have higher seed mineral concentrations; improved host-plant resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, Sclerotinia wilt and Ascochyta blight; and higher yields than existing commercial varieties.   2) Identify genetic markers closely associated with superior yield, optimal plant height for harvest, seed mineral concentration, resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, and improved cold tolerance for autumn-sown peas, and validate their utility for marker-assisted plant breeding. Sub-objective 2A:  Identify molecular markers in adapted pea populations that are associated with important traits including concentrations of minerals in seed, resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, and winter hardiness.  Sub-objective 2B:  Identify molecular markers in adapted chickpea populations that are associated with seed size and early maturity.   3) Develop efficient techniques to screen peas, lentils, and chickpeas for host-plant resistance to Ascochyta blight and Sclerotinia wilt, and characterize genetic and physiological factors responsible for the virulence of these pathogens.  Sub-objective 3A:  Develop efficient techniques to screen peas, lentils and chickpeas for resistance to Ascochyta blight and Sclerotinia white mold. Sub-objective 3B:  Deter  Approach: New varieties and germplasm will be developed from pure lines selected from among segregating populations of peas, lentils, and chickpeas. Cyclical hybridization will be conducted to combine favorable alleles for traits of interest. Parental lines will include adapted germplasm, commercial cultivars and accessions from the various international breeding programs. Promising breeding lines will be released as either germplasm or varieties based on a rigorous comparison of their performance relative to that of commercial check varieties.   Linkage analysis and the detection of associations between markers and different traits will be done using simple sequence repeats (SSRs), expressed sequence tagged- SSRs, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pea recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations will be developed from a cross between Aragorn and Kiflica to identify markers associated with seed mineral concentrations. RILs from a cross between the pea cultivars Medora and Melrose will be used to identify markers associated with cold tolerance. Molecular markers associated with seed size and early maturity in chickpea will be detected using a RIL population developed from an interspecific cross between C. arientinum line Flip 90-27 and PI599072 (C. reticulatum). Associations between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) conditioning traits of interest  will be detected by composite interval mapping.  Improved methods will be developed to screen chickpea for reaction to Ascochyta blight. Toxins will be purified from liquid cultures of A. rabiei. Toxins will be adjusted to various concentrations and applied to detached chickpea leaflets. Leaflets treated with water will be used as controls. The speed of lesion development and final lesion size will be used to compare the reactions of different chickpea genotypes. The relationship between field disease scores of the chickpea genotypes and their sensitivity to the toxin will be determined. Studies to develop more efficient methods to screen peas and lentils for reaction to Sclerotinia white mold will initially examine resistant and susceptible materials reported in prior studies. Plants will be grown in the greenhouse and inoculated with agar plugs containing mycelia of S. sclerotiorum. Disease reaction will be scored by measuring the length of the lesion produced by the fungus over different time points.   Two approaches will be taken to investigate the genetic factors responsible for pathogenicity and virulence of S. sclerotiorum. One approach will be to use Agrobacterium mediated transformation (AMT) to generate random mutations that will be screened to detect mutants with reduced virulence. The other approach will be to identify genes of S. sclerotiorum that are differentially expressed during the processes of infection and disease development."

Objective 2: Breed, evaluate, and release dry and fresh green pea, lentil, and dry bean (kidney, pink, and pinto) germplasm with combined disease resistance, desirable seed quality attributes (slow darkening trait), and improved agronomic performance.  Approach: Edible legumes (common bean, chickpea, lentil, and pea) are high value crops that provide growers with crop options for the short season growing regions in the US. Production losses resulting from diseases caused by pathogens and abiotic stresses (drought, low soil fertility) cost growers millions in lost revenue annually. Incorporation of genetic resistance and stress tolerance traits are needed to minimize yield and quality loss caused by disease and abiotic stresses, and to reduce dependency on pesticides and fertilizers.    The breeding of new edible legume germplasm and cultivars with improved resistance to diseases or abiotic stresses will be accomplished by the systematic evaluation of germplasm from different countries, interspecific lines, and core and base collections in repositories to identify new resistance sources. Once new sources of resistance are identified, inheritance studies including QTL analysis and genomic characterization will be conducted to understand the resistance source and develop breeding strategies to utilize the resistance.   Genomic advances such as: the release of the annotated common bean whole genome sequence; availability of other reference genomes for synteny; abundance of genetic markers; and improved sequencing techniques will be used to characterize resistance traits. Phenotypic data will be obtained to characterize major genes conditioning resistance traits from appropriate genetic populations. Traditional and marker-assisted breeding strategies will be used to develop new cultivars with enhanced resistance to diseases, drought, and low soil fertility to ensure sustainable productivity.   Genomic markers in the form of SNP arrays will be used to identify genes/QTL which condition resistance to targeted diseases and abiotic stresses segregating in different populations. Available and developed bi-parental recombinant inbred line populations and germplasm diversity panels will be used for composite interval mapping and association mapping, respectively. Genome-wide association studies will provide a new approach for identifying gene/QTL in common bean. Two fully gene-annotated, whole genome reference sequences will be used for physical mapping and validating genetic map positions. The physical map positions of the resistance-linked markers will be used to find SSR, indel, SSCP, and other sequence based-markers from associated whole genome sequence for the purpose of marker-assisted selection.  Genetic maps will be developed using MapMaker, MapDisto, or JoinMap, and QTL analysis will be performed with QTL Cartographer, QGene, or other related software. Selective mapping and whole mapping approaches will be used to identify major-effect QTL associated with expression of disease and abiotic stress resistance. Principal components analysis will be used to determine population structure. Identity-by-descent and identity-by-state estimates will be calculated to measure genotype relatedness and the cofactors will be fit in regression models and evaluated using GAPIT. The best mixed models accounting for structure and genotype relatedness will be determined using Bayesian Information Criterion using GAPIT."

Objective 2: Optimize legume/grass mixtures, including nontoxic (novel) and toxic (wild-type) endophyte-in  Approach: Forage systems provide low cost feed while mitigating man’s impact on the environment. Currently, the available fundamental biological information for predicting animal performance in response to plant nutrients under varying environmental, genetic, physiological status, and management conditions is limited. Even more problematic is the poor understanding of the effects of plant nutraceuticals and anti-quality factors on nutrient intake, metabolism and assimilation for product, health maintenance, or work by the animal. To increase the sustainability of forage-based enterprises, it is essential that a better understanding be developed of the fundamental biological processes underlying the interactions between the animal, plant, and environment. This is particularly essential for endophyte-infected forages that produce toxicants. This Project Plan, through the development and utilization of cutting-edge technologies and real world testing, proposes to decipher the complex interactions within the animal-plant interface in order to accomplish the following objectives: improve productivity of forage-based animal systems through optimization of legume/grass mixtures and management of nontoxic (novel) and or control of toxic (wild-type) endophyte-infected tall fescue in pasture systems; determine forage nutrient and forage plant secondary metabolite effects on the gut biome to improve the health, well-being and forage utilization efficiencies of forage-animals; determine the fundamental biological processes underlying the interactions between forage animals, plants, and the environment including the epigenetic effects of forage nutrients and secondary metabolites in the forage-animal; and define the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of the ergot alkaloids in forage-animals."

Approach: Improved perennial grasses and legumes and associated management practices will be developed for use in the Central Great Plains and Midwest for bioenergy production and grazing when grown on land that is unsuitable or marginal for grain crop production.  Perennial plant breeding technologies will be used to develop the improved cultivars.   Improved management methods will be developed to fully utilize the genetic potential of the new cultivars by enhancing establishment, yields, and utilization by livestock, and all aspects of biomass energy crop production.  Basic molecular biology and biochemistry/physiology information will be developed that will improve the breeding and management products. The project is a continuation of a long-term perennial grass project that has plant materials, management, and basic science studies in various stages of development and completion.  Research will be conducted on both C3 (cool-season) and C4 (warm-season) grasses because both are needed in the region to maximize the length of the grazing season.  Switchgrass, big bluestem, and indiangrass will be the primary C4 species and will be developed for use in both bioenergy and livestock production systems.  Smooth and meadow bromegrass and intermediate, tall, and western wheatgrass will be bred for use in cool-season pastures.  Native legumes will be enhanced for use with C4 grasses in biomass production systems.  Grass technologies from this research when utilized on 6 million hectares in the Midwest could produce biofuels for 15 million cars.  Beef production per hectare from pastures with new cultivars and improved management could be improved by 10 to over 25%."

Specifically, during the next five years we will focus on the following: Objective 1: Enhance productivity and ecological function of native tall-grass prairies by development of management practices, including management-intensive grazing, and restoration strategies to follow invasive brush and tree species removal. Sub-objective 1A: Compare the effects of different systems of intensive grazing on plant communities and soil properties of over-utilized tallgrass ecological sites, and define shifts in responses to applied management regimes.  Sub-objective 1B: Determine greenhouse gas emissions from soil, plant, and animal components of diverse grazing systems.   Sub-objective 1C: Define the influence of eastern redcedar trees on local soil conditions of abandoned cropland (old fields), and identify restoration practices that enhance conversion of retrogressed old fields to native prairie.  Objective 2: Increase sustainability in grazing systems and improve year-round availability of forages for grazing through: improved pasture establishment and persistence, use of multipurpose legume crops, reduced need for purchased inputs in crop and forage production systems, and increased efficiency of water and nitrogen use.  Sub-objective 2A: Assess effect of tissue damage on grass growth, development, and persistence characteristics.  Sub-objective 2B: Identify forage species and management practices, including use of legume crops for green manure, that promote efficiency of resource use, especially N and water use, to increase year-round availability of forage for grazing.  Objective 3: Increase marketing options, including providing high-quality farm-finished beef, through d  Approach: Livestock production systems in the Southern Great Plains are confronted with problems of limited and uncertain forage supply, increased climatic variability, and environmental degradation that threaten economic viability and system sustainability. This project will develop management practices and identify forage genotypes that are resilient under variable climate and will increase forage productivity and input use-efficiency on livestock farms at a range of scales. Commensurate with the scope of the location as a Long-Term Agroecosystem Research network site, we will initiate assessments of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and agricultural production under different livestock systems of the Southern Great Plains, including both native prairie and wheat pasture.  Data from this study will be pooled with results from similar flux studies in the region to evaluate climate and environmental impacts on system response.  To evaluate system resilience, over-utilized prairie ecological sites with a mix of native and introduced species indicative of good and poor condition mixed grass prairie will be used to evaluate the use of infrequent, high-intensity grazing on succession and diversity of forage species at the sites. The impact of prior encroachment of redcedar on old-field nutrient and seedbank reserves and consequent recovery of understory and grass species following removal of redcedar will be assessed.  The use of legumes and grasses as green manure sources will be researched for summer (sorghum) and winter (wheat) grain crops to promote efficiency of N and water use.  Nitrogen turnover and utilization by the subsequent crop will be assessed.  Also, N-uptake and efficiency of utilization of cool-season annual and perennial species will be measured in greenhouse experiments to develop screening methods for plant germplasm.  Improved management methods will be developed to fully utilize the genetic potential of new cultivars by enhancing establishment, yields, and utilization by livestock. To increase marketing options of livestock producers, we will determine appropriate forage resources for production of farm-finished beef, either on all forage or with limited grain inputs.  Interactions of animal genetic type (frame score) and finishing system (forage or grain) will be assessed.  Time-series data from ryegrass trials in four southern states in the last decade will serve as the basis for examining the possible importance of 5-day and 7-day summary weather statistics of the near-surface environment, and the variations of those statistics around decade-long averages, as a predictor for seasonal production.  Plant breeding technologies will be used to develop improved cultivars of perennial C3 grasses, particularly fescue, that are more persistent under the regional climatic conditions, and are more water-use efficient. Basic molecular biology and biochemistry/physiology information will be developed that will improve plant breeding techniques and products."

Approach: Objective 1: Three bermudagrass populations with desirable traits for forage, good seed production, and synchronous pollination will be used in a system of recombinant recurrent selection to develop a uniform, highly productive seeded bermudagrass for forage and/or turf.  Multiple cycles of selection and crossing will be done to create populations that will be tested in multiple replicates at different locations.  In napiergrass, a similar approach will be developed to develop vegetatively propagated high yielding, disease resistant genotypes for multiple location testing and eventual release.  Also for napiergrass, sequence data generated from genomic DNA from the cultivar Merkeron will be used to mine single sequence repeat (SSRs) markers and match them with genotypic traits of interest as marker assisted selection.

Selected lines will be used as parents to test hybrids for biotic stress and yield characteristics for eventual public release.  Linkage maps will be developed for markers of biotic traits.  Objective 2: Replicated tests will be performed to determine appropriate nitrogen-fixing winter legume cover crops (clovers and alfalfa) for use in forage bermudagrass (Tifton 85, Russell) to reduce fertilizer applications and improve forage quality.  Similar tests will be conducted for efficient production of biomass from energy cane, napiergrass and biomass sorghum (rotated with traditional row crops).  Winter cover crops (lupine, clover, others) will be tested against inorganic and unfertilized controls to determine efficient ways of reducing inorganic fertilizer use.  These replicated tests will be conducted at multiple sites.

(Objective B.1, NP Action Plan 215)  Approach: The semi-arid and arid rangelands and irrigated pastures of the western U.S. provide a broad array of ecosystem services, including livestock forage, a diversity of native plants, pollinators, animals, and recreational activities.  Many of these regions are classified as severely disturbed and non-productive.  Moreover, based on predicted climate change models for semi-arid regions, environments will become hotter and drier, increasing the already high rate of rangeland and pasture degradation, resulting in the invasion of annual grasses, increasing wildfire frequency, and reducing forage productivity.  Thus, in water-limiting environments, there is a need to develop grasses, legumes, and forbs that will establish under drought, compete with invasive weeds, and persist with adequate forage production and quality to meet the needs of wildlife and livestock producers throughout the year.  Increasing digestibility in pasture grasses by 1% results in a 3% increase in livestock gains.  The Forage and Range Research Lab (FRRL) combines the disciplines of plant breeding, molecular biology, and ecology in conducting experiments to better understand the genetic mechanisms and pathways of seedling establishment, persistence, competition, forage yield and quality, and other abiotic stresses to develop improved plant materials and management practices for use on these western U.S. rangelands and pastures.  These plant materials and management strategies will improve sustainability by reducing the impact of wildfires and invasive weeds, improving wildlife habitat, and conserving, restoring, renovating, and reclaiming degraded landscapes."

Limited basic biological information exists on the cross-talk mechanism between tall fescue (TF) (the predominant forage of the transition zone) and its fungal endophyte (symbiont – beneficial to TF plant), as well as how the plant and/or fungal metabolites affect forage quality, persistence, and production.  Furthermore, little is known about the impact that forage and/or fungal metabolites have on their pasture ecosystems.  Gaps in our current knowledge are hindering researchers’ abilities to predict and select best combinations of forages and management systems for use by forage-animal production enterprises.  Aiding researchers to develop new forage varieties, forage systems, and management recommendations for improving sustainability of forage-based enterprises will require an improved understanding of metabolite (plant and fungal) profiles and their biological functions at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels.  This research project proposes to decipher the complex interactions within the animal-plant-environment interface; improve sustainability of forage-based enterprises through improved forages and forage systems management; and improve basic understanding of the plant/fungal metabolite effects on forage plant persistence and production, as well as consequent effects on the structure and function of pasture ecosystems.  The objectives of the proposal are focused on the predominant forage of the transition zone, TF, as well as on its companion species (e.g., red clover)."

The Collection is a service-oriented program with a major objective of distributing characterized germplasm of rhizobia to stakeholders in industry for use in inoculants and for research at State, Federal and University laboratories.  The second part of the project is research-oriented with the focus on soybean, the most important leguminous grain crop for U.S. agriculture.  The purpose of the study is to investigate the soybean host genotype and its influence on the genotypes of the rhizobia that infect and establish in the nodules on the roots.  This part of the project is the only one of its kind and is made possible by the development by ARS of a method for determining the rhizobial genotype in each individual nodule.   The specific objectives of the project are:  Objective 1:  Preserve, curate and provide long-term back-up of germplasm in the USDA-ARS Rhizobium Germplasm Resource Collection and assess the needs of the agri-business and research community in order to define gaps in the collection followed by the acquisition of new Rhizobium accessions.

These pathogens are known for their extensive virulence diversity that may change from one year or location to another.  Thus, one very important target of this project is to identify broad-spectrum disease resistance genes from the Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools of the wild and cultivated common bean. This will be accomplished by inoculating common bean with selected races of the aforementioned pathogens.  Studies of the inheritance of disease resistance will be conducted to characterize and map the new disease resistance genes.  Simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers linked with the newly discovered disease resistance genes will be identified to expedite the incorporation of these genes into new bean cultivars using marker-assisted selection.  Conventional and molecular breeding approaches will be used to develop bean germplasm lines in various market classes that combine several genes with broad-spectrum resistance to the rust, anthracnose, and angular leaf spot pathogens with high yield and other valuable agronomic attributes.   The specific objectives of this project are: Objective 1: Evaluate available common bean accessions from various geographic regions to identify potential sources of resistance to various pathogens, characterize new resistance genes, and develop molecular markers for use in introgression.   Objective 2: Introgress useful disease resistance genes, combine with good agronomic and quality trait genes in adapted backgrounds, and release germplasm lines or cultivars that can be used to broaden the genetic base of common bean.  Approach: To identify disease resistance sources and genes for rust, anthracnose, and angular leaf spot, the emphasis will be on evaluating 77 wild accessions and 55 domesticated landraces from the Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools of the common bean.  The Andean Diversity Panel with about 350 bean accessions will also be evaluated.  All evaluations will be conducted under greenhouse or field conditions.  Evaluations in the field will be in locations where these pathogens occur naturally or where inoculation with local isolates is possible. Similar methodologies will be used for the three aforementioned diseases.  Selected races of each of these pathogens known for the virulence spectrum will be used to inoculate all bean accessions.  Crosses will be made between selected resistant and susceptible cultivars to determine their inheritance of resistance.  F2 populations consisting of at least 120 F2 plants will be inoculated with selected races of the three pathogens.  Reactions of each F2 plant to these pathogens will be recorded.   Molecular markers including simple sequence repeat (SSR)  and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA markers are needed for use in marker-assisted selection to develop common bean cultivars with durable resistance.  To accomplish this, the parents, the segregating population, and checks will be inoculated with specific races of the three pathogens to which one of the parents is resistant and the other susceptible.  The reactions for each F2 plant will be recorded.  Genomic DNA will be isolated from the parents, checks, and from each of the F2 plants of the segregating population.  Bulked segregant analysis will used to identify DNA markers associated with resistance in those cases when the segregation indicates single gene resistance.  The homozygous and susceptible bulks and the resistant and susceptible parents will be analyzed with 5398 SNP DNA markers using the BARCBean6K_3 Illumina Infinium assay.  The whole genome sequence scafld possessing the polymorphic SNPs will be canvassed for SSRs that distinguish the R and S parental lines.  The SSRs will be assayed on the recombinant inbred line mapping population, such as BAT 93 x Jalo EEP 558 population, to map the resistance genes to one of the common bean linkage groups.   Crosses will be made to combine the newly identified bean rust resistance genes with other already identified rust resistance genes to create bean germplasm lines with broad and durable resistance to this pathogen.  A similar approach will be followed to develop cultivars with broad resistance to the anthracnose and angular leaf spot diseases.  To combine genes for resistance to rust and other diseases into a single common bean germplasm line or cultivar, crosses will be made between cultivars carrying the newly discovered broad-spectrum rust resistance genes with cultivars having genes for resistance to the anthracnose and angular leaf spot diseases.  Races of the pathogens and molecular markers will be used to confirm the presence of the disease resistance genes in the newly created bean plants with genes for resistance to rust, anthracnose, and angular leaf spot."

Develop genome-wide molecular marker approaches to determine the genetic variability of important pathogens, such as those causing early and late leaf spot (Cercospora arachidicola and Cercosporidium personatum), to facilitate phenotyping and breeding for resistance to these pathogens in peanut.  2. Develop RNA interference (RNAi) technology and apply it to identify genes that can be used to prevent aflatoxin accumulation in peanut, and assess the utility of other novel techniques to access useful genes in peanut.  3. Identify key components of the drought response regulation system in peanuts through transcriptome and small RNA (sRNA) mining.  4. Develop and release high yielding peanut cultivars with biotic and abiotic stress tolerance for the United States using conventional breeding and marker-assisted methods.  Approach: The causal agents of leaf spot will be isolated from symptomatic leaves to determine their genetic diversity.  We will develop molecular markers and fingerprint the isolates.  We will also develop molecular markers for peanut plants.  Multiple peanut lines will be grown in multiple locations, phenotyped for leaf spot resistance, and fingerprinted with molecular markers to find association between markers and disease resistance.  For the use of RNA interference (RNAi) in the control of aflatoxin, multiple approaches will be used, including making multiple constructs that target 2-5 genes in the pathway, genetic transformation of Aspergillus spp., transformation of Arabidopsis to characterize the effectiveness of the system, genetically transform peanut plants with the most promising constructs and finally test for accumulation in seeds after challenging them with aflatoxigenic strains of the pathogen.  For drought tolerance, multiple peanut genotypes that have shown different response to drought will be grown in multiple locations, under drought and irrigation conditions.  Genes potentially regulated by drought will be identified from transcriptome sequencing, also genes potentially regulated by epigenetics (i.e., small RNAs, methylation) will be identified and later verified the expression profiling.  Both, genes and molecular markers identified in the various areas, will be incorporated into the breeding program."

The existing ex situ collection of germplasm in the National Collection of Genetic Resources (NCGR) for Pecans and Hickories provides a broad representation of the diversity of the genus.  NCGR collections will be augmented and strategically expanded by addition of accessions, and by qualifying in situ populations in cooperation with federal and state conservation programs. Molecular genetic tools have been developed and will be refined, extended, and used on NCGR collections, in conjunction with standardized phenological descriptors, to define the relationships between genetic diversity, phenotypic expression and geographic distribution.  Data will be entered into the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN-Global), making a wealth of information available to an international, multi-disciplinary audience.  Over the next 5 years we will focus on the following objectives: Objective 1: Elucidate patterns of genetic divergence and diversity in Carya (pecan and related taxa) and apply that knowledge to genetic resource management and ultimately to pecan genetic improvement. Sub-objective 1A: Determine ploidy level and comparative genome size in Carya using flow cytometry. Sub-objective 1B: Profile NCGR Carya accessions with selected genetic markers. Objective 2: Effectively manage and conserve Carya genetic resources and associated information. Sub-objective 2A: Manage ex situ collections at College Station and Brownwood worksites. Sub-objective 2B: Designate in situ reserves based on regional characterizations of diversity.  Approach: In order to better elucidate patterns of genetic divergence and diversity in Carya (pecan and related taxa) and apply that knowledge to genetic resource management and to pecan improvement (Objective 1A), the ploidy level and genome size will be determined in selected accessions.  Work will stress species whose ploidy level is not currently known and species whose subgeneric placement has been disputed.  For more broadly represented species, accessions representing different areas of origin will be checked.  Data on ploidy and genome size will be combined with genetic marker data being developed for routine profile determination of NCGR accessions (Objective 1B).  Using sequence information generated in cooperative work, single nucleotide polymorphic sites (SNPs) will be selected to represent known genic regions that are well distributed across chromosomes in homologous species, as well as SNPs representing organelles.  SNPs will be validated for information content using a panel of diverse species of Carya as well as geographically and phenotypically diverse pecan accessions.  Validated SNPs will be used in analyses designed for cost efficiency.  DNA will be extracted from remaining NCGR accessions to be profiled.  The resulting datasets will contribute to effective ongoing management of ex-situ collections maintained at worksites in College Station and Brownwood, TX (Objective 2A) and will help in the identification of in situ reserves based on regional characterization of diversity (Objective 2B).  Phenological records of the NCGR will be summarized and refined in consistency with uniform ontologies to facilitate cross-database queries and comparative analysis of gene expression and phenotype (Objective 3A).  Based on previous observations of diversity, a phenotypic  core subset  will be established and used to monitor phenology (Objective 3B).  Historical data will be examined to select a small group of cultivars that represent geographic diversity of origin and manifest broad diversity in phenology but which can be sampled at both the Brownwood and College Station worksites.  Inventories of those accessions will be visited weekly to rate patterns of growth inception, flowering, nut development, nut quality, leaf condition, and leaf drop using revised descriptors (from sub-objective 3A).  This will provide a framework onto which other Carya accessions will be integrated and their variability interpreted by comparison over a broad geographic range.  The initial effort will be the aerial characterization of budbreak, which differs by over a month across accessions in provenance orchards.  Observations of the progression of budbreak in the diverse phenotypic core cultivars at Burleson and Brown Counties in Texas will be entered into the budbreak protocol on Pecan ipmPIPE.  In order to facilitate the transfer of pecan germplasm, genetic marker technology, and descriptive information and accelerate pecan research and genetic improvement (Objective 4), the historic origination records and all inventory-specific evaluation records will be made publicly available on GRIN-Global, with appropriate summaries on the Unit website."

Over the next 5 years this research proposal will address the following objectives: Objective 1: Employ the most up-to-date genotyping, phenotyping, and marker-assisted selection strategies to develop and release superior peanut cultivars containing the most current disease resistance, agronomic, and quality trait genes, with emphasis on high yield, early maturity, oil, and seed quality traits. Subobjective 1A: Develop and release high-oleic, high-yielding runner, Virginia, and Spanish peanut cultivars with superior resistance to Sclerotinia blight, southern blight, and pod rot that are adapted for production in the SW United States. Subobjective 1B: Develop and map molecular markers associated with disease resistance in peanut that will aid in marker-assisted breeding. Objective 2: Improve existing methods and/or develop new methods to screen for resistance to Sclerotinia and southern blights and pod rot of peanut, and use these methods to identify useful resistance genes from the USDA peanut germplasm collection and other sources. Subobjective 2A: Define relationships between resistance to Sclerotinia and southern blights and response to oxalic acid, stem lignin content, and plant architecture characteristics.  Subobjective 2B: Develop a reproducible greenhouse protocol for screening germplasm for resistance to pod rot.  Approach: Objective 1: Parental lines being used in such crosses include Arachis hypogaea L. cultivars, advanced breeding lines, and plant introductions (PIs) with demonstrated disease resistance and high oleic acid content. New and existing potential parent lines with high oleic acid content are continually tested in the greenhouse and field plots for resistance to Sclerotinia blight and southern blight and are readily available for use in the peanut breeding program.  Included in our annual screening of germplasm for disease resistance are cultivars, breeding lines, and germplasm accessions. Also, collaborators include the curator of the U.S. peanut germplasm collection as well as other breeders who are continually evaluating accessions for value added traits. Molecular markers for Sclerotinia resistance will be identified and verified by phenotypic reaction. Advanced breeding lines will be tested in local, regional and national tests for agronomic performance before release as a variety.   Objective 2: Response to oxalic acid, stem lignin content, and specific canopy architecture appear to be correlated with Sclerotinia resistance among cultivars of other legumes. We will determine if these traits are also useful for predicting resistance to Sclerotinia and southern blights in peanuts. Development of pod rot-resistant cultivars is significantly slowed by unpredictability of the disease occurring under field conditions. We will develop a reproducible greenhouse protocol for screening germplasm for resistance to pod rot by: 1) identifying and quantifying Pythium spp. and Rhizoctonia solani from Oklahoma and Texas fields with high incidences of pod rot using quantitative real-time PCR; and 2) evaluating symptoms in greenhouse-grown pods exposed to different inoculum levels of the three most common pod rot pathogens found in Oklahoma and Texas."

Despite much research, many determinants of host resistance and their roles in signaling remain unknown. Pseudomonas syringae, a plant pathogenic bacterium, causes disease in more than 150 plant species. ZAR1 is the R protein responsible for recognizing the acetyltransferase HopZ1a, a P. syringae type III secreted effector protein (T3SE). ZAR1 is found in many plant species, including the Solanaceae, castor bean, and rice. However ZAR1 defense signaling does not depend on any components previously implicated in plant resistance, including salicylic acid. Further investigation of ZAR1 signaling gives us a unique opportunity to identify novel genes involved in plant resistance and potential targets for improving plant immunity. This project plan will address three major questions:  1) What other genes are genetically implicated in resistance to HopZ1a? Preliminary data from a forward genetics screen has identified several mutants that lack HopZ1a-mediated defense responses (hopz-effector-triggered-immunity-deficient or zed). The proposed work will map these mutants and characterize their roles in resistance.   2) What is the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance? The proposed work will identify other proteins that contribute to ZAR1-mediated resistance.   3) Is ZAR1 resistance conserved in other plant species? The proposed work will examine ZAR1 resistance in wild and domesticated tomato. Using a multi-pronged approach, this work will identify and characterize new sources of resistance to protect plants from disease.  The specific objectives are: Objective 1:  Conduct genetic screens coupled with next-generation DNA sequencing to identify genes that contribute to pathogen resistance in plants.   Objective 2:  Characterize the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance using molecular, genetic, and proteomic approaches.   Objective 3:  Evaluate susceptibility and resist  Approach: Objective 1:   Hypothesis: Using HopZ1a as a probe of immune pathways in plants, we will identify novel genes (ZED1 and ZED2). We hypothesize that ZED1 and ZED2 will not be affected in basal defenses or responses to other T3SEs, and will be specifically involved in HopZ1a recognition. Further, we hypothesize that ZED1 or ZED2 will act as the guardee, and will be acetylated by HopZ1a. Experimental design: Screen F2 population of zed1 (or zed2) cross to Ler for a loss of the HopZ1a-induced macroscopic HR, when pressure-infiltrated with P. syringae carrying hopz1a. Identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms by Illumina sequencing of whole genomes from zed1 or zed2 populations that lack defenses. Characterize the roles of the zed mutants in defense and virulence, and their molecular functions. Contingencies: We can also conduct a genetic suppressor screen for restoration of HopZ1a-mediated immunity in zar1 mutants.  Objective 2:   Hypothesis: Plasma membrane-localized complexes of ZAR1, HopZ1a and other plant proteins will contribute to immunity. Defense-related host proteins will interact specifically with ZAR1. Epitope-tagged ZAR1 will be functional, complement the null zar1 mutant, and interact with other host proteins. Loss of function alleles of unknown (non-zed) plant genes will result in a loss of HopZ1a recognition and increased bacterial growth. Experimental Design: Identify ZAR1-interacting proteins using membrane-based high-throughput yeast two-hybrid approaches and biochemical approaches. Test whether the interacting protein affects defense responses. Contingencies: If the gene of a single interacting protein is part of a gene family, we will silence the gene family by RNAi and test for changes in defense responses.  Objective 3:   Hypothesis: As ZAR1 appears to be an ancient R gene, I hypothesize that HopZ1a will be recognized by a complex of proteins homologous to ZAR1 in tomato. Pto and Prf, known resistance-related genes in tomato, will not be needed for HopZ1a recognition. I further hypothesize that we will observe natural diversity for HopZ1a recognition. Silencing of ZAR1 homologs will result in the loss of HopZ1a resistance. Experimental Design: Infiltrate P. syringae carrying hopz1a into tomato. Test for induction of defense responses by conductivity assays, which measure rapid ion leakage upon recognition of a pathogen, or by bacterial growth assays, which quantitate bacterial growth over time. Silence homologs of ZAR1 to determine if they are necessary for HopZ1a recognition. Contingencies: If our study of natural diversity in tomato progresses more quickly than anticipated or if we fail to identify accessions that are resistant to HopZ1a, we can test additional accessions of tomato. HopZ1a can also be delivered to tomato by Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression."

This goal was validated, and ranked as a high-priority ‘researchable objective’ by stakeholders attending the 2011 Program Visioning Conference held at the San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center. Specifically, over the next five years we will focus on the following objectives:  Objective 1:  Evaluate table and raisin grape germplasm with putative resistance to powdery mildew for superior fruit quality and field resistance to powdery mildew under commercial conditions.  Objective 2:  Evaluate fruit quality of dry-on-vine (DOV) raisin selections and of “teinturier” type table and raisin selections.  Objective 3:  Develop superior Prunus rootstocks with resistance to economically important soilborne pests and excellent graft compatibility, desirable scion vigor, and excellent production potential.  Objective 4:  Select and evaluate new high quality scion cultivars of Prunus (almond, apricot, peach, and plum) from currently available breeding crosses.  Approach: Classical breeding techniques have been used to create segregating populations where the expression of quantitative traits has been concentrated and newly available characters have been transferred into adapted Prunus and Vitis germplasm. Seedlings in existing segregating populations of Prunus and Vitis will be selected and propagated for new cultivar development. Greenhouse and field screening will proceed to select Vitis seedlings with resistant to powdery mildew. Molecular markers will be used to identify those Vitis seedlings with multiple sources of powdery mildew resistance. Resistance to powdery mildew and Pierce’s Disease will be combined through hybridization of appropriate vines.  Hybridizations will continue for production of both dry on the vine and red flesh color in grapes. Apricots will be selected for drying ability and for late maturity season from all remaining segregating progenies. New self-compatible almonds will be selected from segregating populations that have kernel qualities similar to Nonpareil, and four high kernel quality self-compatible almond selections will be trialed in three locations in the San Joaquin Valley. Hybridization will be repeated if necessary, to achieve population sizes necessary for identifying and selecting elite germplasm or for the development of molecular markers linked to traits of interest."

Identify and map important abiotic (heat and drought) and biotic traits for disease and pest resistance in common bean, and develop useful molecular markers that will help accelerate the breeding process. 1a: Map drought and heat tolerance traits, derived from common bean and tepary, respectively, using bi-parental and association mapping populations and develop markers. 1b: Elucidate the genetics of resistance to pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina, causing ashy stem blight.  2. Develop and release common bean germplasm with higher levels of abiotic stress tolerance, and with multiple resistance, including disease and insect resistance, in important U.S. market classes.  2a: Develop heat and drought tolerant common bean in new market classes, including great northern and cranberry. 2b: Develop germplasm of medium seed size tolerant to multiple root rot pathogens; and to leaf-hoppers.  3. Introgress useful genes from tepary bean into common bean and develop tepary bean as a new crop with superior heat and drought stress tolerance and with improved agronomic and quality traits for areas where bean production is not practical due to severe abiotic stress.  Approach: Identification and mapping of important abiotic (heat and drought) and biotic traits will be completed using bi-parental and association mapping populations. Drought and heat tolerance traits, derived from common bean and tepary, respectively, will be evaluated using yield components and stress-response traits. For genotyping, the BeanCAP 6,000 SNP chip will be employed using the Illumina Infinium system that was developed through the BeanCAP project. In order to analyze these complex traits, both quantitative trait loci (QTL) and association mapping (AM) analyses will be employed. The genetics of resistance to the pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina, causing ashy stem blight, will also be elucidated. Controlled trials, using inoculation with M. phaseolina in the field, will be completed. Green house screening techniques for M. phaseolina will be further refined, as greenhouse methods producing more consistent results are needed.  Development and release of common bean germplasm with higher levels of abiotic stress tolerance will focus on the great northern and cranberry market classes. Parental crosses will be performed during the shortest photoperiods (winter) in order to ensure flowering of exotic parents and reduced temperature stress during hybridization. About 100-400 F2 progeny will be planted in the field in Juana Diaz for selection for high temperature tolerance in May, or for drought tolerance in December. For root rot and Empoasca resistance, the ARS Isabela Research Farm, PR will be used as the selective environment and the focus will be on general germplasm improvement. Due to differences in genetic control and genetic distance between different germplasm, varied breeding approaches are often required for gene introgression, including recurrenwan. Populations developed from intercrossing will be selected in the F2 under heat stress at the UPR Ag. Substation in Juana Diaz, PR in FY13 based on heat tolerance, plant habit and seed type. In order to take advantage of the superior abiotic stress tolerance of the tepary bean, a concurrent effort will focus on improving agronomic characteristics and virus resistance in tepary bean. The goal is to develop tepary bean germplasm that is capable for use as a crop in areas with high levels of heat and drought stress, such as in arid zones and in areas marginalized by climate change. Although challenging due to genetic distance between the species, crosses between tepary bean and common bean lines with virus resistance genes (e.g., I, bc3) will be completed in order to transfer BCMV and BCMNV virus resistance to tepary. The lines generated will serve as important germplasm for future tepary bean breeding efforts.t selection, congruity backcrossing, bridging parents or inbred backcross approaches.

Genotype and phenotype data for a genetic segregation population can be associated with QTLs and markers for trait of study and a genetic linkage map could be constructed. Peanut germplasm accessions have variable levels of disease resistance. The mapping population(s) will be genotyped using primarily SSRs, and ultimately the sequence-based markers will be added into this collection when Peanut Genome Sequence Project will be completed soon, in which the four parental line, Tifrunner, GT-C20, SunOleic 97R and NC94022, and their RILs will be sequenced. Field phenotyping for TSWV, leaf spots and other agronomic traits will be conducted for at least two years and at least two different locations with at least three replications.  2. Marker-assisted breeding will be employed as an example to combine two different traits with known linked marker(s) for faster and accurate transfer of trait from donor to elite lines through a back cross program or pedigree selection. Two traits can be combined into one productive peanut cultivar. Available markers for nematode, rust, and high oleic traits and new markers identified for TSWV and leaf spots will be compiled. The outcome of these efforts will enable more precise and effective molecular breeding for peanut improvement.  3.

Generate and compare sequence information among cultivars, wild soybean relatives and other legumes to discover novel alleles that can be used to improve important agronomic traits.  Approach: This project will provide data and resources that will increase soybean production by mitigating losses due to pests, pathogens and nutrient stress and by identifying genetic factors that increase yield. To study disease resistance, we will focus on the soybean-Phakopsora pachyrhizi pathosystem, using expression analyses and virus induced gene silencing to identify signaling networks required for resistance. To tackle nutrient stress, we will use iron deficiency chlorosis as a model. We will use expression analyses and virus induced gene silencing to improve our understanding of the signaling networks controlling iron homeostasis in soybean. Finally, we will use molecular, genomic and bioinformatic techniques to take a retrospective look at soybean production over the last 80 years. Using these tools, we can determine how breeders have continually increased soybean yield over time, largely before the introduction of molecular techniques. A review of soybean’s breeding history will impact how we breed soybeans in the future."

In addition, one project objective also addresses the use of markers in wheat and common bean improvement through identifying loci impacting a range of traits including disease and environmental stress and product quality and developing additional markers for marker assisted selection.  An additional objective is the whole genome sequence analysis of two perennial soybean species that can ultimately serve as sources of genetic variability for cultivated soybean.  A final objective relates to determining the genetic influence of the soybean on the genotype of the nitrogen fixing bacteria that form root nodules on the soybean host plant.    The specific objectives of the project are: Objective 1:  Develop a Core Collection for wild soybean and provide whole genome sequence data of the Core Collection, as well as elite cultivars that will be used in crosses with selected wild soybean accessions, and analyze highly productive progeny as well as unselected progeny from the G. max x G. soja crosses to further define and delimit the genome regions associated with soybean domestication and agronomic performance.   Objective 2:  Discover QTL and genes controlling biotic and abiotic stress resistance, agronomic and quality traits in soybean, wheat, and common bean, and develop DNA markers that define haplotype variation across these and previously identified regions. Objective 3:  Determine the DNA sequence and define sequence variation and linkage disequilibrium of at least one perennial Glycine species.   Objective 4:  Determine the nature of the host–regulated genetic control of the specific strain of Bradyrhizobium japonicum that occupy the nitroge  Approach: The genetic analysis of 1,150 wild soybean accessions in the USDA Germplasm Collection with 50,000 SNP DNA markers will provide the genetic data to select a Core Collection of 60 wild soybean accessions.  Thirty of the accessions were used by collaborators in crosses with cultivated soybean followed by intense selection and yield evaluation.  The whole genome sequence (WGS) of the Core Collection, the adapted parents used in the cultivated x wild crosses, as well as a set of the highest yielding progeny and a similar set of unselected progeny from each cross will be determined.  These data will facilitate a comparative sequence analysis to identify genome regions containing genes associated with domestication and unique genomic regions/genes from the wild soybean.  Genetic markers to introgress the wild soybean-derived genes into cultivated soybean will be identified.   The available WGS of common bean and wheat will be analyzed to identify SSR DNA markers.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets flanking the SSRs will be designed and used to establish SSR marker databases for common bean and wheat.  To evaluate the utility of the databases, a set of SSRs will be selected to amplify DNA from a set of genotypes and the amplicons visualized for locus specificity and polymorphism.  In the case of wheat, additional WGS analyses using the HiSeq 2000 DNA sequencer will be performed on a small set of hexaploid wheats to provide additional data for SSR identification.  In the case of soybean, analysis of 50,000 SNP DNA markers on the USDA Germplasm Collection of more than 18,000 cultivated soybean accessions will be used to identify a set of 6,000 SNP markers that are highly informative and well distributed across the soybean chromosomes.  The 6,000 SNPs will be used to create a new Illumina BeadChip for soybean genome analysis.  This Beadchip, along with a previously designed 6,000 SNP BeadChip for common bean, will be used to discover genes/quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling important traits including resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and agronomic and seed quality.  Genomic DNA libraries of perennial Glycine species G. tomentella and G. canescens will be prepared for DNA sequence analysis on the HiSeq 2000.  Size-selected DNA libraries ranging from 500 bp to 10 kbp will be developed for paired-end sequence analysis.  Construction of four DNA libraries with fragment sizes of 500bp, 2.5kb, 5kb, and 10kb will be produced.  The resulting 150 bp sequence reads will be processed using SOAPdenovo software.  The resulting sequence scaffolds will be anchored to the G. tomentella and G. canescens chromosomes using genetic maps created using genotyping by sequencing.   Recombinant Inbred line (RIL) populations of progeny from crosses of Williams 82 soybean with nodulation-restricting genotypes PI377578 and PI417566 will be analyzed for nodulation phenotype.  Bulked segregant analysis using 1536 SNP DNA markers will be used to identify the position of the gene in each population controlling restricted nodulation.  Additional markers will be developed and used to verify the position of the genes controlling restricted nodulation."

Valid economic thresholds are not available for many of the most common pest species found in the crop. This leads to uncertainty for growers who must make pest management decisions based on limited or outdated information. Tobacco thrips, Frankliniella fusca, and three cornered alfalfa hopper, Spissistilus festinus, are found in nearly every peanut field in the Southern US, but the economic impact of their feeding activity has not been quantified, and no economic threshold exists for either species. Current management practices rely on the prophylactic or calendar-based application of broad spectrum insecticides. This research-led project will develop appropriate monitoring protocols and establish economic thresholds for tobacco thrips and three cornered alfalfa hopper. Cages will be used to maintain experimental pest densities on plants in the field and greenhouse. Feeding injury will be characterized, and resulting economic damage will be quantified (yield, quality, delayed maturity). Studies will evaluate the impact of pest life stage and crop phenology on economic injury level (EIL = level of infestation at which losses equal the cost of control). An economic analysis of insect injury, cost of control, and crop value will be used in conjunction with field research results to build an EIL and develop economic thresholds. Key project personnel have both research and Extension appointments; grower and Extension agent training will be a critical component of this work to facilitate adoption of new IPM practices."

The IR-4 Project is needed because registrants of crop protection technology focus their development effort in major crops. IR-4 fills the niche by developing the required data to extend these registrations to specialty crops/minor uses. IR-4 Headquarters manages and coordinates all activities of national IR-4 Project including all activities with collaborators and researchers, the crop protection industry, State Agricultural Experiment Stations, EPA, USDA and cooperating foreign governments.IR-4 continues to provide significant products and outcomes to directly answer the request for assistance submitted by specialty crop growers, producers and commodity associations. On an annual basis, IR-4 data is used to facilitate over 2000 new food and non-food registrations for critical pests in specialty crops. IR-4 focuses its efforts on registration of conventional pesticides and biopesticides deemed lower risk for humans and the environment while giving the specialty crop producers technology to better manage diseases, pests and weeds in a sustainable and environmentally manner. Some of these products are of acute need for use in IPM systems. The food chain benefits because these registrations reduce pest damage and maintains crop yield and quality while providing consumers and food processors with an ample supply of fruits, vegetables, herbs, ornamentals and other specialty crops that make up a healthy diet and enhances the environment."

Food processors and consumers expect these products to be readily available with very high quality and at a reasonable price. This cannot be achieved without effective pest management methods. Many of the tools of pest management, particularly pesticides and biopesticides, require approval and registration by the Environmental Protection Agency for use on each individual crop. Providing the data to satisfy EPA is both expensive and time consuming, and many of the companies that produce these agents do not choose to go through this process for the smaller acreage crops because the return on their investment would be very low or negative. This is a problem for specialty crop growers worldwide. In the USA an effective solution exists in USDA&#39;s IR-4 program which generates these essential data and submits them to EPA. Without IR-4&#39;s efforts to make these materials available to growers, using both conventional and organic methods, many of these specialty crops could not be grown in the USA, and for others the cost and quality expectations of the public could not be met. This is a very effective investment of public funds. In 2011 an independent study at Michigan State University concluded that the approximately $16 million investment in IR-4 annually contributes $7.3 billion to the US economy and this includes over a $290 million to the Michigan economy. This supports over 100,000 jobs nationally.

This is partly credited to not enough effort being devoted to the creation and dissemination of more ecological pest management (EPM) solutions, new pest introductions causing growers to abandon EPM options in favor of pesticides, and EPM solutions being insensitive to growers&#39; production constraints or cost. This is an applied research project aimed at developing economic and ecological sustainable pest management plans to alleviate weed and insect problems in solanaceous and leguminous vegetables. Yields and profits of these crops are impacted by several high-priority pests including herbicide resistant weeds and economically damaging insects. Growers often rely solely on chemicals to address these problems. This project proposes to examine, create and disseminate a  truly integrated  pest management program that includes several tactics to help mitigate multiple pest complexes and lower input costs. Two economically important crops, eggplant and snap beans will be used as model systems. We anticipate this project embodying all priorities listed by the ARDP such as addressing multiple species complexes, integrating multiple pest management tactics, promoting interdisciplinary IPM system approaches, developing effective management tactics for invasive and key production limiting pests, developing projects that enhances the development of innovative, ecologically-based, sustainable IPM systems, and overcoming constraints to and measuring impacts of IPM adoption.The EPM tactics that we propose to develop can be adopted in part by conventional and organic producers. Potential impacts will include hundreds of growers transitioning from high-risk and restricted-use insecticides to cultural and conservation biological control, reduced-risk chemicals, limited or no chemical options. Specifically, products and husbandry practices that are of lower risk to beneficial organisms (e.g., predators, pollinators and soil health organisms) will be used. Learned tactics will potentially impact hundreds of thousands of handlers and consumers through reduced pesticide residues on harvested produce and chemical exposure to handlers, pick-your-own clientele and sensitive environmental tributaries."

Our research provided the necessary data to obtain approval of dielectric heating (DH), which includes radio-frequency (RF) and microwave (MW), as the first alternative to MeBr under International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures 15 (ISPM-15). Because WPM is associated with most global merchandise trade, ISPM-15 affects more trade by volume than any other phytosanitary measure. The version of ISPM-15 adopted for DH includes restrictions on treatment load (&lt; 20 cm) and time (within 30 minutes). These restrictions are unnecessary and cost prohibitive for application of RF for economical bulk treatment of WPM. Our long-term goal is to expedite adoption of RF technology as a long-term solution to reducing MeBr use for QPS purposes by delivering economically competitive treatment schedules. To meet our goal we will (1) Demonstrate that RF heating under commercial conditions effectively treats WPM &gt;20 cm in any dimension, (2) Show that efficacy of killing pests in wood is not reduced when treatment time &gt;30 minutes, (3) Conduct comparative economic analyses of RF heating with and without current treatment restrictions and in comparison to MeBr and conventional heat treatment, (4) Educate and promote adoption of RF through our Stakeholder Advisory Committee and Extension activities. Working with the U.S. National Plant Protection Organization, we will support formal submission of documentation to the IPPC to remove restrictions for RF under ISPM-15.

There is a critical need to implement effective and sustainable methods for controlling pests of fruiting vegetables, such as strawberries, green beans, melons, squash, eggplant, bell peppers and tomatoes. These and other vegetable crops for the fresh market generate more than $11 billion per year in the United States. This revenue is being threatened by non-native thrips and the plant viruses they spread (tomato spotted wilt virus, groundnut ringspot virus, tomato chlorotic spot virus, and ilaviruses). Primary pests include not only thrips but also whiteflies, aphids, spider mites, pepper weevil, and a few others. Melon aphid and green peach aphid are among the most important pests of cucurbits, including watermelons, cucumbers, cantaloupes, and squash. Unfortunately, growers uninformed about the science of pest management have responded to outbreaks of these pests by applying broad-spectrum insecticides according to calendar schedules. This has resulted in a classic &#39;3R&#39; situation: 1) Pest resistance to insecticides, 2) Resurgence of thrips and other pests due to the killing of natural enemies and native competitors, and 3) Replacement of native non-target thrips with new much more damaging species. An overreliance on insecticides to control thrips has resulted in the development of resistance to the available insecticides, and an inability to prevent unacceptable damage in many vegetable crops. Research is providing effective and sustainable integrated pest management (IPM) methods for controlling these pests and diseases but implementation of these methods depends on delivering training to producers and Extension personnel.Goals and Benefits. The purpose of this project is to increase adoption of sustainable IPM practices by strawberry growers, and possibly growers of other fruiting vegetables. These practices assist producers in deciding when to take action to control a pest and how to prevent pests from reaching damaging levels by using ultraviolet reflective materials, biological control and compatible insecticides. If a pest must be controlled, insecticides are used that minimize environmental side effects. Increasing IPM adoption, will require developing grower&#39;s proficiency in scouting and identifying pests, non-pests and natural enemies; capacity to determine the impact of natural enemies in suppressing pests; understanding movement of pests within and around crops; and ability to assess the injury to fruiting vegetables caused by pests and if necessary take informed action to protect their crops. IPM training will be delivered to producers of strawberries and other fruiting vegetables, Extension agents, educators, consultants, scouts and others. Up-to-date, high quality education and training materials will be developed and used for this training, e.g., IPM guide for strawberry, PowerPoint presentations, videos, websites, etc. The outcome will be reduced use of broad spectrum insecticides, prevention of pest resistance to available insecticides, lower risk of damage to vegetable crops caused by pests and diseases, fewer environmental side effects caused by pest control practices, and increased profits for vegetable growers."

The US is a significant leader in hazelnut breeding and research, yet US production amounts to &lt;5% of the world&#39;s crop and most US consumption is from imported nuts. Eastern filbert blight (EFB), a stem canker disease found only in North America, is devastating to the European hazelnut and threatens the sustainability of current commercial production in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, where 99% of the US crop is grown. It also severely restricts expansion of hazelnut plantings in the eastern US, where selections of European hazelnut could thrive if resistant.To date, more than 40 sources of genetic resistance to the disease have been identified, although only a dozen of them have been used in breeding and all recently released commercial cultivars rely on a single R-gene. A substantial germplasm base, including new EFB-resistant accessions and cultivars and thousands of breeding progeny, has been amassed in Oregon and New Jersey. These resources are now available for study and use in developing enhanced, EFB-resistant plant material. Much research has also been completed on the genetics of hazelnut and the EFB fungus, and is now available to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of breeding for durable resistance. Through this targeted research: 1) the inheritance of EFB resistance from many new sources will be studied; 2) hazelnut germplasm available for use in breeding will be characterized with molecular markers; and, based on these results, 3) new, enhanced EFB-resistant germplasm will be developed from which to select/breed new cultivars in the future. Graduate and undergraduate students will also be trained.Broad outcomes of this project will include the expanded planting of hazelnut as a sustainable, low-input, high-value food crop. The target environments are the Pacific Northwestern US and the  fruit belt  of the eastern states--from Virginia to the Hudson Valley and along the Great Lakes. Although the climate in these areas is suitable for growing European hazelnuts, EFB susceptibility is a major constraint. The breeding of new cultivars with durable EFB resistance will provide new economic options for growers and entrepreneurs, improve national food security, and enhance crop and product diversity."

The Southeast US presents ideal conditions to produce food such as crops or animals, but there are ways where the management of these production sites can be improved. One big issue is soil health that can affect crop production as a whole and forage production requires large areas and large amounts of N fertilization.Managing alfalfa in the South to increase its acreage can be beneficial since alfalfa is a legume crop that can fix N in the soil. Producing alfalfa incorporated with grasses can improve soil health and forage quality, making this production scenario more sustainable.In order to increase alfalfa production in the Southeast US, we have proposed to do field experiments to test different forage management strategies that can increase production of this forage crop especially in TN an AL. Since this project is going to be developed also in Ohio, where alfalfa is well-developed, we can use some of their management strategies and guidance for improvement in the South.We plant to disseminate our findings through field days, conferences directed to livestock producers, scientific conferences and meetings, extension publications and peer-reviewed publications as well.Our goals by the end of our project are to inform our extension agents and livestock producers in all three states where this is going to be developed and increase alfalfa production that can be used in beef and dairy production farms."

We will compare cover crop interseeding and rotational no-till strategies to standard organic crop production practices to quantify differences in profitability and ecosystem services including crop performance, soil health, greenhouse gas emissions, weed seed predation, and nectar provisioning for pollinator conservation. Our previous and on-going research suggests that interseeding grass-legume cover crop mixtures into corn and soybean can improve soil health. Moreover, grass-legume cover crop mixtures can self-regulate based on soil nitrogen levels and have potential to reduce nitrous oxide emissions compared to standard cover cropping practices. While it has broader implications for addressing problems with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water quality, this project is organic farmer-focused and builds on stakeholder interest in diverse cover crop mixtures and interseeding cover crops using aerial applicators and spinner spreaders at layby cultivation. We will work together with organic farmers to develop advanced cover crop management recommendations. In addition to working directly with leaders in the organic farming community, we will transform agriculture through hands-on educational programming.

To control these diseases, the best way is to breed resistant genotypes. However, conventional breeding way to have a resistant variety in peanut could take 12 - 15 years. If we can identify DNA markers which are associated with disease resistance traits, we can select individual plant based on present/absent of DNA markers. Before selection of individual plants, we have to build a genetic map to line up all DNA markers on the map, which is similar with aroadmap. DNA markers like milestone and genes like city or town on the genetic map, on which we can understand what markers are close to what genes. If we know some markers are closely located to resistance genes, we could select individual plants with these markersbecause the selected plants should have resistance genes. This process is named as marker-assisted selection in plant breeding that could avoid screening and rating resistance traits in the field, thus save resource and time.

This multi-region (IA, MN and PA) effort addresses the Organic Research and Extension Initiative (OREI) goals for increasing yields, efficiency, productivity and socioeconomic benefits through research on integrating crops and livestock; educational tool development for agricultural professionals; improving food safety and quality by reducing toxins and microbial contamination; and developing innovative animal production systems in mixed operations. The issue is organic producers often use off-farm feed and fertility sources, and a system integrating crops and forage/pasture is needed. Objectives: 1) Establish crop rotations including legume and grass forages for livestock, soil-building and pest management; 2) Enhance cattle nutrition, measured by rate of gain, health, and nutraceutical components (conjugated linoleic acids); 3) Increase income by lowering production and energy costs through on-farm production of feed and fertility; 4) Improve food safety practices for organic plant and animal products; and 5) Demonstrate useful educational tools for farmers, Extension, NRCS, and other ag professionals by utilizing a farmer-centered approach in conjunction with eOrganic Communities of Practice. Outreach efforts will include critical outputs of annual Field Days, conference and classroom presentations, publications, and social media webinars, blogs, and articles on e-Organic and University/Rodale websites. Outcomes include increased producer knowledge and skills to integrate livestock, forage and grain crops, increased soil quality, profitability, food safety and measurable carbon sequestration. Evaluations will gauge knowledge and behavioral change, such as increased numbers of participants establishing integrated rotations, incorporating livestock on their farms, and utilizing food-safety protocols."

Develop improved integrated management of pecan foliar and fruit diseases, with emphasis on pecan scab. [NP305, C1, PS1B] 2.A. Determine ways to provide better control of scab and other pathogens in pecan trees based on an understanding of disease progress, tree stress and canopy health. 2.B. Develop an improved basis for managing scab resistance using a knowledge and understanding of the characteristics of the genetic diversity and population biology of the scab pathogen.  Approach: This research aims to provide pecan farmers improved and sustainable crop-load and disease management practices enabling mitigation of alternate (AB) bearing by pecan orchards.  The goal of this research project is to provide U.S pecan (Carya illinoinensis) farmers with horticultural and disease management tools and strategies that enable them to mitigate alternate bearing (AB). The industry considers AB to be its most important biological problem. AB is an economically harmful, typically biennial, trait that causes excessive year-to-year fluctuation in nut yield and kernel quality. Many biotic and abiotic factors, and the stresses caused by reproduction, interact with innate reproductive physiology to either induce or increase the amplitude of this cyclical pattern. There are many important knowledge gaps pertaining to the biology and management of AB. This project targets whether fruiting in ‘Off’ (low crop load) years can be increased by appropriate and timely use of cytokinin (CK) and/or ammonium (NH4+) in the previous ‘On’ year to enhance production of female (pistillate) flowers the following year. It also targets whether reducing previous ‘On’ (high crop load) year tree stress caused by fungal diseases, particularly pecan scab (Fusicladium effusum), but also other stressrelated pathogens, can increase subsequent ‘Off’ year flowering. A series of field and laboratory studies over the next five years will address these key knowledge gaps and develop greater understanding and horticultural tools and strategies required for mitigation of AB."

Develop improved irrigation management practices and criteria to reduce irrigation water requirements in southeast cropping systems (cotton, corn, and peanut).  2. Determine the effects of amending soils with Biochar on irrigation scheduling, crop yield, and economics in irrigated and non-irrigated southeast cropping systems.  3. Develop methods to improve peanut maturity distributions and flavor profiles in all US peanut producing regions to enhance economic returns to producers.  Approach: The United States peanut industry generates approximately $4.4 billion annually in economic activity. Much of this activity is located in rural areas that are directly dependent on peanuts to sustain rural economies and foster rural economic development. Over the past decade, the peanut industry has been in a period of economic and technological adjustment driven by changes in peanut policy, increased cost of production, and repeated drought in the major peanut producing regions. The purpose of this project is to conduct farm systems research to reduce the per unit cost of production, improve peanut quality, conserve natural resources, and offer new production and management techniques that will sustain peanuts and crops grown in rotation with peanuts. The first objective will focus on irrigation water requirements for peanuts (and cotton and corn which are the prevailing crops grown in peanut based rotation systems) using shallow subsurface drip irrigation and overhead sprinkler systems. Improved management practices for scheduling irrigation (in unconstrained and constrained water supplies) and new subsurface drip irrigation systems will be addressed.  The second objective will examine the agronomic, environmental, and economic feasibility of amending soils with Biochar in a cropping system consisting of peanuts, cotton, and corn in the lower Southeast. Economic evaluations will be performed to determine the economic value of adding biochar as a carbon credit. The third objective will determine if improvements in peanut maturity will lead to improvements in flavor and shelf life of roasted and processed peanut products. This will be accomplished with applications of various chemicals to reduce flowering at specific growth period. This research will also address the agronomic and economic impact of methods to improve peanut maturity profiles within the peanut production and processing system including farmers, shellers (first processors), and manufacturERS."

This limits the opportunity to include cover crops in rotations. The primary focus of this project is to produce information, management tools, and technologies to help farmers integrate cover crops and compost into intensive vegetable and strawberry production systems, maximize the benefits from cover cropping, and reduce production costs.    The main objective of this project is to develop ecologically-based soil management strategies that enhance soil quality, nutrient cycling, pest and disease management, and profitability, and reduce off-farm inputs, organic vegetable and strawberry production systems. The subobjectives are as follows:   1. Evaluate the effects of cover cropping frequency and compost on soil quality, vegetable and strawberry yields, soil borne disease, and system profitability. 2. Evaluate the effects of a legume-rye mixture versus non-legume cover crops on vegetable and strawberry yields. 3. Evaluate the effects of cover crop seeding rates on weed density and weed management costs in subsequent vegetable and strawberry crops grown in rotational sequences. 4. Identify pathogens causing emerging bacterial diseases of organic vegetables and small fruit.  Approach: The first three sub objectives will be addressed using unpublished data collected during the first 10 years of the Salinas Organic Cropping Systems (SOCS) experiment, and with additional laboratory analyses on archived soil samples using standard proceedures. During the next 5 years, experiment will continue with a less intense management phase to provide the team with the time to analyze and understand the existing data before deciding if the experiment should be terminated or continued. Furthermore, a complete analysis of unpublished data from the first 10 years is essential to provide insights into potential modifications to the existing treatments, and to formulate meaningful questions to be addressed if a new long-term study is initiated.  The following hypotheses will be tested for the first three subobjectives outlined above. - Soil quality will be higher in systems where cover crops are used annually than in systems where they are used only quadrennially.   - Soil quality will be higher in systems that receive compost annually than systems that only receive cover crops. - Vegetable and strawberry yields will be higher in systems where cover crops are used annually than in systems where they are used only quadrennially.  - Vegetable and strawberry yields will be higher in systems that receive compost annually than systems that only receive cover crops.  - Profits will be higher in systems where cover crops are used annually than in systems where they are used only quadrennially.   - Profits will be higher in systems that receive compost annually than systems that only receive cover crops.  - Verticillium microsclerotia counts will be higher in systems that receive legume-rye cover crops than systems with non-legume cover crops. - Vegetable and strawberry yields will be higher following legume versus non-legume cover crops. - Weed density will be lower in vegetable and strawberry systems where cover crops were planted at relatively high seeding rates over several years, than when using lower seeding rates. - Weed management cost during vegetable and strawberry production will be lower in rotations where cover crops were planted at relatively high seeding rates over several years, than when using lower seeding rates.  The results from this SOCS experiment will be communicated to stakeholders by publications and presentations. The results from the first 10 years may indicate that there would be value in collecting additional field data or conducting additional analyses of archived soil samples. If this occurs we will modify our plan to collect this additional data with our existing collaborators or seek additional collaborations as needed.   The fourth sub objective will be achieved by soliciting samples of new diseases from organic fields. Samples will be analyzed with standard methods to identify the bacterial pathogens. The results will be reported to the growers through publications and presentations. If samples are not submitted, work will be conducted to resolve the etiology of diseases from organic systems for which isolates have been obtained but research has not proceeded."

Sub-objective 3B: Develop an improved cacao rejuvenation system that integrates improved management practices and evaluates its effect on cacao yield.  Approach: The major emphasis of this project is to identify cacao genotypes tolerant to abiotic stresses (drought, infertile acidic soils, and high/low irradiance) and develop sustainable management systems to improve their productivity and bean quality. The residual effects of cover crop cultivation and improved management systems (agroforestry planting, high density planting, fertilization, sanitary and phyto-sanitary practices) on the changes of soil quality parameters (physical, chemical, biological) and bean yield and quality will also be determined. Nutrient use efficiency of macro-micronutrients of elite cacao genotypes and cover crops at various abiotic stresses and management systems will be evaluated. Enhanced nutrient use efficiency and sustainable high productivity of cacao will be achieved through improved management practices. To achieve these objectives we have established collaborative research programs under specific cooperative agreements with government and non-government organizations (NGO) and national and international agricultural universities in cacao growing regions of Peru, Brazil, and Ecuador, and the University of Florida at Fort Pierce as well as the USDA ARS in Puerto Rico to establish controlled studies in greenhouses and large scale field trials. University of Reading (UR), UK will be collaborating on abiotic stress assessment. Cacao genotypes with superior ability for establishment under abiotic stresses will be identified and incorporated in cacao improvement programs. Improved management systems will be developed, based on the results of this research, to enhance cacao yield potentials and bean quality and further improve soil fertility and halt the further soil degradation."

Agrochemical use has been increasing, but we do not yet have a comprehensive understanding of the effects of acute and chronic exposure to these compounds on colony health and survivorship. The objectives of this project are to evaluate agrochemical exposure and nutritional stress with respect to bee nutrition, worker-queen interactions, pheromone profiles, queen retention, colony growth and forager activity. Published studies on pesticide exposure and the nutritional value of pollen and bee bread will help determine experimental treatments. The impact of the effects of pesticide exposure on the colony level will be evaluated by continuously monitoring hive weight, temperature and forager activity in row crop agriculture and in nut and fruit pollination. The role of nutrition on Varroa population growth and on colony recovery will also be examined.

The first is to develop lines of staple food crops with improved bioavailability and content of iron (Fe).  To do so we will employ our established screening tools of an iron bioavailability bioassay and an animal model.  In conjunction with these tools, we will make use of mass spectroscopy and marker assisted molecular breeding techniques.  With these approaches, we will be able to identify and utilize regions of the plant genome that harbor genes associated with the enhanced food crop nutritional quality for Fe. To further complement the above approaches, we will continue our work on the identification of agricultural and food processing practices that enhance the bioavailability and content of Fe and Zn in staple food crops.   The second major objective of this project is to develop a method to measure and evaluate the bioavailability of functional phytochemicals from plant foods.  To do so, we will assess the use of a surgical model utilizing the unique intestinal anatomy of the broiler chicken to measure absorption of compounds from the duodenal segment of the intestine.  This approach uses an established surgical preparation involving anesthetized animals.  Our initial efforts with this model will focus on compounds that are common to many staple food crops, fruits and vegetables.  These phytochemicals will include the flavonoids epicatechin, quercitin, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and kaempferol. Enhancing our knowledge of bioavailability of health promoting phytochemicals will significantly improve efforts to develop more nutritious plant foods."

Determine the effects of a diet and activity enhanced Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program on weight and health related outcomes in mothers and their infants.  2. Determine associations between dietary patterns (identified using variant statistical and epidemiologic approches) and health inicatiors in children using the most recent NHANES datasets.  Approach: 1. The Delta Healthy Sprouts Project is an 18-month, randomized, controlled comparative effectiveness trial. Participants are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms (75 participants per arm) – Parents as Teachers (PaT) or Parents as Teachers Enhanced (PaTE). All participants receive monthly PaT lessons and materials. Only participants in the experimental arm receive PaTE supplemental nutrition and physical activity lessons and materials. The control arm utilizes the PaT curriculum which is a nationally recognized, evidence based MIECHV program that includes one-on-one home visits, monthly group meetings, developmental screenings, and resource networks for families. Through these activities, PaT seeks to increase parental knowledge of child development, improve parenting practices, provide early detection of developmental delays, prevent child abuse, and increase school readiness. PaTE, delivered to experimental participants, builds on PaT by adding culturally tailored, maternal weight management and early childhood obesity prevention components. These components include healthy weight gain during pregnancy, nutrition and physical activity in the gestational and postnatal periods, breastfeeding, appropriate introduction of solid foods, and parental modeling of positive nutrition and physical activity behaviors. The interventions are delivered in the home to women beginning early in their second trimester of pregnancy by community based, trained Parent Educators.  2. Dietary patterns will be determined for 2-18 year old U.S. children using the 2 most recent cycles of NHANES datasets with available dietary data. Analyses will be conducted separately by gender, age group (2-5, 6-11, and 12-18 years), race/ethnicity, and poverty income ratio (PIR) given sufficient sample sizes. The first dietary pattern identification method is based upon existing recommended dietary guidelines and current knowledge. The Health Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) ranks individuals in terms of compliance with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Total HEI-2010 scores range from 0-100 and are computed by summing scores for 12 components including:  total fruit; whole fruit; total vegetables, greens and beans; whole grains; dairy; total protein foods; seafood and plant proteins; fatty acids; refined grains; sodium; and empty calories.  For the first 9 components, higher intakes result in higher scores (healthier diet).  For the last 3 components, lower intakes (more beneficial) result in higher scores. Latent class analysis (LCA), the second dietary pattern identification method, derives empirical dietary patterns based on current study data. Similar to cluster analysis, LCA partitions data into groups so that observations (children) within a group are as similar as possible to each other (foods consumed) and as dissimilar as possible to the observations in other groups. Differing from cluster analysis, LCA does not absolutely assign observations to groups, but assigns a probability of group membership.

Many small market, niche, and specialty crops have been genetically engineered over the past 25 years but the majority has not been commercialized due to real or perceived regulatory constraints. This proposal requests funding to partially support a workshop on the practical aspects of developing dossiers on genetically engineered (GE) specialty, niche, or small-market crops/products for submission to US regulatory agencies. While most workshops on the US regulatory system for biotech-derived crops provide general overviews of various aspects of the regulatory process, this workshop presents an opportunity for public sector scientists and public or private crop developers to spend two days with regulatory officials and learn the specifics of putting together an actual dossier for regulatory approval. The steering committee of the Specialty Crop Regulatory Assistance (SCRA) initiative (www.specialtycropassistance.org) is organizing the workshop as a follow-up to a highly successful  Nuts and Bolts  workshop in 2011. The workshop will be held in the Washington, DC, area during 2016."

Phytophthora capsici a fungus-like plant pathogen is a scurge of vegetable crops known to infect over 45 species including peppers, cucumbers, squash, cantaloupe, watermelon, zucchini, pumpkin, eggplant, tomatoes, snap beans and lima beans.Its complex life cycle high genetic variability, sexual reproduction, and ability survive in the soll for many years makes this pathogen a nightmare for farmers. Although similar in appearance to fungi, it is an oomycete and more closely related to certain algae than fungi. Because of this most agricultural chemicals used for treating plant pathogens being designed to kill fungi, are not as effective against oomycete pathogens like P. capsici. Under idea growth conditions no chemical treatment is effective against P. capsici. When this is combined with limited success in the development of vacines against P. capsici it is clear that new control strategies are desperately needed.Guild Associates proposes to conduct proof-of-concept study to develop an antisense based agent against P. capsici. Antisense agents work by blocking the production of a target protein rather than blocking its function as most chemical agents do. Using a military analogy most cheimical treatments work like tanks engaging enemy tanks on the battle field, whereas antisense agents work like a bomber destroying the factory that makes the tanks. Our firm is currently developing a similar antisense agent for use against the fungal human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus using similar methods. We have already identified a type of transport peptide called a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) that is effectively transported into the fungal pathogens A.fumigatus and Candida albicans. The first part of this study will evaluate other CPPs identified from the literature against our current top CPP for their ability to be transported into P. capsici. Then the top performing transporter will be further improved using rationally designed CPP libraries to evolve an improved product. Next we will use an antisense molecule (PMO) attached to this CPP to demonstrate we can use this agent to knockdown the production of a model fluorescent protein introduced into P. capsici. Finally we will develop and test a CPP-PMO that blocks the production of protein that is essential for growth of P. capsici producing an early-stage anti-P. capsici agent. Further refinement and optimization through a Phase II grant would allow this agent to be developed into an agent ready for field testingIt is believed that through the efforts of this project, a new treatment option for P. capsici infestations in the fields of vegetable crop farmers will be attained, not borrowed from other similar looking plant pathogens, but designed and taylored specifically to eliminate P. capsici from the farms of America. Because agents of this type are the progeny of the genomics era, they can be quickly designed using the genome of the targeted pest, and since they like DNA gain meaning by the order of their component parts (similar to how words attain meaning by the order of the letters) not by a unique complex chemical structure, different agents against the same organism will have similar chemical properties reducing the amount of testing necessary to bring them to market, producing new more effective drugs quicker. Thus this project will open the door to a new age of treatment options for farmers around the world that will reduce crop losses and improve the profitability of vegetable farming."

Drought and salinity are two major environmental factors determining alfalfa productivity. In the western United States, nearly all alfalfa hay acreage is irrigated. The costs associated with irrigation are significant. These costs are likely to increase as populations rise in these states. In addition, climate change may adversely impact water availability. The water use efficiency of alfalfa cultivars needs to be improved to help meet the challenges of finite water resources. The proposed research is to identify molecular markers (genes) and germplasm for drought and salt tolerance for developing superior alfalfa cultivars with enhanced water use efficiency. The first objective is to identify germplasm with drought and salt resistance in the primary gene pool and develop populations with a high percentage of resistant plants in elite genetic backgrounds through recurrent selection. Quantitative genetic analysis of inheritance of resistance will be carried out. The second objective is to map QTL associated with drought and salt resistance. Finally, the third objective will develop molecular markers tightly linked to the resistance loci for rapid selection of drought and salt tolerant alfalfa to accelerate breeding programs. Quantitative traits such as biotic and abiotic stress resistance are likely under the control of multiple genes and influenced by environmental factors. Identification of resistance loci that contribute to variation in such complex traits, is a primary challenge in plant breeding and population genetics. In the proposed study we will use an integrated framework that merges a QTL mapping approach called &#39;&#39;genome-wide association&#39;&#39; with high-throughput genome sequencing methodologies called  genotyping by sequencing (GBS)  in order to map traits quickly, efficiently, and in a relatively inexpensive manner. This framework provides a statistical basis for analyzing marker-trait association using linkage disequilibrium. It will help to identify molecular markers associated with resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses in alfalfa. In general, segregation population or association panel will be used for mapping genes/QTL. Parents or progenies will be phenotyped for traits of interest. The SNP markers will be used for mapping genes/QTL associated with drought/salt tolerance. SNPs tightly linked to the specific trait will then be used for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs. This project will provide new tools and strategies for improving resistance to abiotic stress that threatens alfalfa grown in the US and will train members of a new generation of alfalfa breeders in conventional and molecular breeding techniques."

Rice and beans merit biomarkers for nutritional assessment without reliance on self-reported intakes for whole grains and legumes during nutrition assessments as wheat, barley, rye and soybeans have been studied in dietary patterns and for relationships with disease risk. A major challenge with validating dietary biomarkers is that an elevated level of consumption is often required for reliable quantification, and emerging evidence supports that the overall dietary pattern (e.g. vegetarian, omnivore) can influence the profile of metabolites detected. The identification and validation of dietary biomarkers using metabolomics is an emerging field of investigation with broad-spectrum applications of health importance, and is the major focus of the research strategy for developing rice bran and navy bean biomarkers in children and adults herein. These studies will set the foundation for evaluating Rice Bran (RB) and Navy Beans (NB) intake to other important diet-disease relationships."

Because the limited amount of fixed nitrogen very often limits plant growth, these associations often occupy foundational positions in natural ecosystems and are very important in traditional forms of agriculture. Increasing the utility of nitrogen-fixing symbioses is one way of changing the current dependence of agriculture on industrial nitrogen fertilizers, a practice that generates a number of types of pollution, from soil acidity to atmospheric greenhouse gas generation and ozone destruction. Establishing an effective symbiosis requires the development of root nodules, unique symbiotic organs in which the specialized metabolism of nitrogen fixation, nitrogen assimilation and transport can take place. Both the plant and bacteria change during nodule development. Recent work has shown that members of the CspA family of bacterial RNA binding proteins are highly regulated during symbiotic development. The CspA family is named for the archetypal Cold Shock Proteins, but it is clear that the striking changes in CspA family gene expression during nodule development are not a response to cold stress and suggests instead that their induction/repression is a programmed way of controlling gene expression. In preliminary studies we have found that the set of RNAs that co-purified with different Sinorhizobium meliloti CspA homologs after heterologous expression in E. coli were distinct and were significantly enriched for regulatory RNA sequences containing base paired stem-loop structures. These data support a hypothesis in which riboregulation mediated by different CspA family proteins participates in symbiotic development through their interaction with specific stress or environmentally responsive RNAs. We will specifically address what RNA molecules CspA proteins modulate and how CspA function influences gene expression during symbiosis. Achievement of the proposed aims will begin to define mechanisms of CspA homolog function in rhizobia and expand the current understanding of gene regulation and stress response mechanisms in symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Application of this understanding is critical in ameliorating the financial and environmental cost of industrial nitrogen fertilizer use and is essential to meet future agricultural needs."

Conversely, growers might be able to promote insect and disease resistance in plants by managing soil rhizobia. To elucidate the relationships between insects, viruses, rhizobia, and nitrogen fixation in legumes, we will accomplish two objectives: (1) determine the impacts of insect pests and viral pathogens on biological nitrogen fixation in legume crops, and (2) investigate how rhizobia and nitrogen fertilizers influence insect and pathogen resistance in legumes. Our study system consists of field pea, a common rotational crop in the USA, two insect pests (pea aphid; pea leaf weevil), a viral pathogen (pea-enation mosaic virus), and the bacterium Rhizobium leguminosarum. To accomplish our first objective, we will measure the ability of peas to fix nitrogen following attack from insect pests and virus over a growing season. To accomplish our second objective, we will measure the performance of aphids, weevils, and virus on rhizobia-inoculated and non-inoculated plants, and the rate of virus spread in field plots with or without rhizobia or synthetic fertilizers.

Many plant species are significantly impacted by sap feeding insects, which are able to subsist on a nutritionally unbalanced diet of plant sap with the aid of symbiotic bacterial partners that live within specialized cells of their insect hosts. After millions of years of co-existence, some symbiotic relationships are now obligate where neither can exist without its partner. Though these relationships have persisted over time, little is known about what mechanisms allow for the coexistence between insects and bacteria. This research will investigate how insect hosts functionally regulate bacterial symbiont populations and will address to what extent these insects can tolerate and coexist with bacterial symbionts. This project will use experiments performed on laboratory populations of pea aphids, which harbor obligate symbiotic bacteria. In addition to experiments, this project will use new genomic and molecular technologies to determine to how pea aphids maintain their symbiotic bacteria. This project will provide key insights into the interactions of obligate symbionts with their insect hosts, which will extend current understanding of how symbiotic bacteria affect the ecological tolerance and geographic range of their hosts. Aphids are considered one of the most significant pestiferous and invasive insect species in North America. Thus, all experiments will be performed on a North American pest species. These results will provide new insight into how these pest species interact with microorganisms, and will provide critical information on the role of environmental change in the persistence of local pests and the potential emergence of novel pest species."

Trees in these woodland ecosystems occur near their functional limits with respect to water availability and may be strongly affected by climate change. Previous modelling studies quantifying how changing climate may affect semi-arid tree population dynamics have been limited by a lack of empirical data on the effects of climate variability on tree reproductive outputs, particularly among mast seeding species (i.e. species with highly synchronous and intermittent production of large seed crops). The research component of this proposed project examines how climate variability influences seed production dynamics of singleleaf pinyon pine, a dominant and widespread mast-seeding conifer of the Great Basin. This project also assesses the sensitivity of pinyon pine populations to changes in the magnitude and timing of seed production under different climate change scenarios. Understanding the resilience of pinyon pine populations to changing climate is important due to the multiple ecosystem services and ecological benefits this species provides. Regeneration failure of this foundation species would impact wildlife populations that depend upon woodland habitat and pinyon seeds as a food source, and would dramatically alter water and energy fluxes and carbon stocks. The highly nutritious pine seeds are also gathered by commercial and non-commercial pine nut harvesters, including Native American tribes, for both economic and cultural purposes. The education component of this proposed project will increase the science literacy of high school science students by training science teachers on innovative teaching methodologies and developing instructional materials. Development of a case study teaching module will be based on research results and used to educate students about plant reproduction and the potential impacts of climate change. Working in close collaboration with the school district, this project will provide K-12 educators with specialized training and packaged teaching modules to be directly integrated into their teaching as part of existing core curricula."

Sometimes PGPR work reliably, and cost effectively. Often, however, PGPR are ineffective because they do not reach their sites of action on plant roots. This can be caused by: restricted movement of PGPR through soil; inefficient water-based transport of PGPR or competition with endogenous soil bacteria.We propose that soil protists have the capacity to move PGPR and that they could increase PGPR effectiveness by allowing PGPR to keep up with growing roots. We will isolate from Medicago truncatulaand soybean rhizospheres 30 types of cyst-forming protists. These will be characterized in an in vitro micromodel to select those that best transport bacteria to legume roots. In vitro data will be used to derive agent-based models of protist transport. The top 8 PGPR-moving protists will be used in a series of increasingly realistic experiments to determine their effectiveness in moving rhizobial bacteria. Experiments will measure the effects of protists on: rhizobial transport through soil, rhizobial effectiveness with competitors and rhizobial effectiveness on established roots.Rhizobia, the most frequently used PGPR for nutrient acquisition, are inoculated on soybean, alfalfa, bean, pea, clover and other legumes to provide cheap and sustainable nitrogen. Their use could increase if inoculation was more effective. Nitrogen acquisition in nonlegumes, phosphate acquisition, iron acquisition and biocontrol are also facilitated by PGPR and may be enhanced by protist transport of PGPR."

One of the constraints of relying on breeding techniques to improve crop traits is the issue of time. For most breeding programs, one selection cycle occurs annually, which means that we have only 35 breeding cycles until 2050--a critical global time point that centers on the question of how to feed over 9 billion people. It is unlikely that breeding alone will provide the solutions to increase yields for sustaining human population growth, while also responding to changes in climate. Our research project addresses this concern by initiating research that focuses on assembling collections of soil microbiota--bacteria, fungi, and viruses--that altogether, reinforce desirable crop traits. In essence, we are  breeding  groups of plant-associated microbiota that are able to enhance plant yield by enriching plant root zones with beneficial microorganisms. At present, many top agribusiness companies, including Monsanto, Syngenta, Dupont, and BASF, are investing in microbial-based methods that influence crop traits. Industry is relying primarily on a single species or strain of microorganism as an inoculant in plant seeds or directly into soils. Our approach differs in that it includes complex communities of microorganisms that are assembled through repeated selections on the plant host trait, such as biomass or seed yield. The short lifecycle of bacteria and their ability to shift population structure rapidly, in response to selection, facilitates the breeding of soil microbiota for plant production systems.By 2050, the human population is expected to reach over 9 billion people, with the majority concentrated in Africa, Southern Asia, and Eastern Asia. For parts of these sections of the world, it is challenging to develop intensive agricultural systems routinely using industrial ammonia fertilizers to sustain high yields. Synthetic fertilizers (based on the Haber-Bosch process) consume high amounts of fossil fuel energy in their manufacture and contribute to chronic nonpoint source pollution in hotspots of agricultural production, such as found in the Salinas Valley area of California. Developing a plant microbiome focus to international crop production will help promote sustained yields in major parts of the world lacking the capacity for industrial-based agriculture, in addition to maintaining crop productivity in the U.S. Many cropping systems already include a focus on the microbiome for improved nutrient management; these include rhizobia for legumes and several arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for cereal crops. However, plants that do not form associations with symbionts rely heavily on fertilizer additions. Brassica crop production (many cultivars of which serve as the green vegetable staple of many populations in developing countries) would benefit heavily from greater nitrogen management via soil biotic manipulations, and serve as a model for additional crops that do not form symbiotic relationships.The proposed research will include sequencing of the microbiomes in an effort to identify who comprises the microbiomes that are associated with an enhanced seed yield phenotype and corresponding high nitrogen capture traits. We will be using 16S and 18S bar-coded paired-end reads for characterization of the soil microbiome using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The sequencing methods will allow us to assess how the microbiomes change in community composition over generations of selection, in relation to the development of higher seed yield in the host plants. Functional analysis using plant RNA-Seq, soil extracellular enzyme activity, plant tissue 15N enrichment, and nitrogen mineralization will help explain how the microbiomes are modifying plant phenotypes via plant gene expression and coordinated resource gain. These fundamental investigations into the interactions of plants and their associated microbiota will help pave the way for microbiome-enhancement of agricultural production systems."

This creates tremendous burdens economically and environmentally because of energy costs of industrial N fixation, pollution, and eutrophication. There are intensive efforts and desire to develop crop plants that utilize N more efficiently. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the essential steps in plant uptake, transport, and assimilation of N. However, much less is known about signaling and regulatory events that modulate plant N utilization. A better understanding of the modulation can be applied towards designing crop plants that sense and utilize N more effectively. This project focuses on whether and how membrane lipids and associated enzymes modulate plant N utilization.The project will use soybean to determine the function of a specific group of phospholipase, PLD, providing opportunities to integrate basic knowledge with potential applications to increase crop production and quality. In addition, legume N2 fixation is the most important N source in agro-ecosystems. Thus, developing legume varieties with effective N2 fixation could have profound significance in improving agricultural sustainability. The project employs molecular, biochemical, cellular and whole-plant approaches towards improving N uptake, assimilation, accumulation, and/or utilization through studies in soybean and studies of plant-microbe interactions. It tests the hypotheses that PLD activity and membrane lipids modulate the nutrient-recycling, autophagic processes and plant N use efficiency. Potential conceptual breakthroughs from the study include revealing new mechanisms of regulation of autophagy, N remobilization, and N use efficiency. Also the study of soybean may offer an opportunity to determine how the lipid regulation of autophagy and N utilization impacts the tolerance of nodulation to soil N levels. An increased tolerance would allow increased N2 fixation in soils with a high residual level of N. Finally, manipulations of lipid regulated processes may lead to increased growth and seed production under N-limited conditions. Therefore, the proposed study addresses the program area: Plant Health and Production and Plant Products, particularly regarding the priority areas of Photosynthesis and Nutrient Use in Agricultural Plants (A1151). Such knowledge advances have the potential to reduce usage of N fertilizers, enhance the nation&#39;s natural resource base, and protect the environment."

This direct consumption means that consumers actually see the harvested product (grains, pods, leaves, or flowers, in the case of beans) before it gets processed (i.e., cooked, steamed, grilled, popped, etc.). Over time and locations, cultural preferences have become established regarding the characteristics of these products regarding size, shape, and color. Likewise, farmers expect certain characteristics of bean plants that make them fit into their cropping system, such as growth habit (e.g., bush vs. climbing) and phenology (e.g., early vs. late). From a breeding standpoint, this situation means that a significant part of the genome may already be  fixed . The genes coding for the traits determining farmer and consumer preferences have to be selected during the breeding process to recover these traits. Through linkage, not only these genes but adjacent regions will be selected as well. How big a genomic region will be fixed depends on the distribution of recombination around these genes, which in turn depends on their location on the bean chromosomes. The smaller the region, the easier it will be to recombine fixed traits with other desirable traits such as tolerance to heat and drought stresses, yield, and phenology. In contrast, large areas fixed by selection and relative lack of recombination will make the combination of desirable traits more difficult to achieve. In this project, we will investigate the distribution of recombination on the 11 chromosomes of common bean, especially in relation to the cultural and agronomic traits mentioned above. To achieve this, a large multi-parent, multi-generation (MAGIC) population was established, which includes some 960 lines. This population will be characterized in two ways. First, it will be sequenced to determine the DNA sequences of each line and the recombination distribution will be determined. Second, the same population will be characterized in the field for all the phenotypic traits mentioned above. Genotypic and phenotypic data will then be combined to determine the fixed part of the genome. Furthermore, we will then determine to what extent the genes for drought tolerance and other agronomic traits fall in this fixed genome part. The smaller the overlap, the more favorable the situation. In contrast, a large overlap suggests that breeding for drought tolerance will be more difficult to achieve and special breeding methods, such as additional recombination need to be followed."

The ability of plant-associated microbes to cause disease depends on virulence factors that manipulate host targets, often to alter host physiology, suppress host defenses, and/or promote disease symptoms. Thus, breeding, transgenic, or crop treatment strategies for combating plant disease will benefit from advanced fundamental knowledge about the mechanisms employed by virulence factors of pathogens and their targets in plants. The AvrE-family of virulence effectors are secreted from multiple genera of plant pathogenic bacteria into the cells of host plants, contributing to disease on a wide variety of crops ranging from monocots (e.g. maize) to dicots (e.g. tomato and bean) to fruit trees (e.g. apple and pear). Despite the widespread importance of this family of virulence factors, little is known about their mechanism of action. Preliminary data indicate that the AvrE-family effectors interact with a regulatory subunit of a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). PP2A plays key roles in the regulation of numerous plant processes, including responses to abiotic and biotic stress. We will describe the AvrE-PP2A interaction, determine its subcellular localization, and characterize the consequence on plant defense, including hormone and metabolic signals. Since the AvrE-family virulence effectors are widespread, the crop plants negatively affected by associated diseases are varied and numerous, and PP2A isoforms are key to a variety of plant responses to the environment, the potential long-range benefits to U.S. agriculture from applying the knowledge generated by this study will be broad and significant."

TSWV is distributed worldwide, damaging over 1,000 plant species including important commodities such as tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, peanuts, potatoes and many ornamental plants. TSWV and related tospoviruses are considered emerging diseases because in recent years new species have been described, while the plant host range and geographical limits have expanded for established species. The western flower thrips (WFT) is the most efficient TSWV vector and it is an economically important pest in greenhouses and field crops. The management of thrips pests is difficult because populations of WFT have developed high levels of resistance to many insecticides. Transgenic plants are recognized as promising options for tospovirus management. We propose to exploit and elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) and dynamics of transgenic expression of a TSWV glycoprotein for control of tospovirus spread by WFT. TSWV depends exclusively on its thrips vector for plant-to-plant movement; therefore we propose to disrupt the disease cycle by interfering with the early events of virus transmission by the vector. Disruption of virus entry into the vector will prevent insect transmission or greatly reduce transmission efficiency and thus, stop the transmission cycle. TSWV entry into the thrips vector is mediated by the molecular interaction between the virus protein GN, which serves as a viral attachment protein, and the thrips midgut. Based on our recent finding that TSWV-infected tomato transgenics that express GN inhibited TSWV acquisition and transmission by WFT, we aim to determine the mechanism(s) of reduced acquisition from these transgenic plants, determine the efficacy of these transgenics to prevent spread of other related tospoviruses, and define the region of the GN protein that binds to thrips midguts. The outcome of this proposed work will bring us one step closer to our long-term goal of developing novel, sustainable, and biologically-based strategies for controlling TSWV in agricultural croplands and greenhouses."

The disease is caused by the fungus, Cochliobolus victoriae which can only infect oats if it makes a peptide called  victorin  and interacts with oats carrying a gene called  Vb . Various analyses suggest that the Vb gene, which confers Victoria blight susceptibility and sensitivity to victorin, is identical to a gene called Pc2 which confers resistance to a different disease called  crown rust of oats  caused by the fungus Puccinia coronata. Consistent with this interpretation, molecular analyses reveal that victorin activates a resistance protein (NB-LRR) which leads to cell death and that C. victoriae exploits this defense response to cause disease. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that victorin sensitivity is conditioned by genes encoding resistance proteins across diverse crop species including barley, rice and bean. We hypothesize that these resistance proteins (NB-LRRs) are functionally, and perhaps structurally, related to the protein encoded by the Vb/Pc2 gene in oats. This proposal will address this hypothesis and in addition investigates the diversity of targets for victorin and the resistance proteins activated."

This research project seeks to fill this gap in knowledge byidentifying molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the balance between auxin and cytokinin,two key plant hormones,isregulated during soybean nodule development.Through a previous research project funded by NIFA-AFRI, the PD&#39;s lab identified that a regulatory module comprised of a regulatory RNA (microRNA160) dictates developmental stage-specific sensitivities to auxin and cytokinin, and directs proper nodule formation and maturation in soybean. microRNA160 functions by regulating the levels of a family of transcription factors belonging to the ARF10/16/17 family (referred to as ARF10) that suppress the action of auxin.The major objective in this proposal is to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which ARF10 proteins regulate auxin-cytokinin balance and subsequent nodule development. Therationalehere is that knowledge on these mechanisms will meaningfully contribute to strategies for optimizing nodule formation and nitrogen fixation, and potentially transfer this trait to non-legumes.Methods and approaches:The research project willdetermine the sites of GmARF10 activitythrough molecular probing and microscopy analysis; identify and validate its interacting partner proteins through protein-protein interactions assays in yeast and in soybean plants; identify and validate its direct downstream targets using high throughput sequencing andin vitro binding assays; and evaluate the role of a selected set of ARF10 effectors and downstream targets in nodule development through loss of function assays.Ultimate goal(s):The long-term goal of this research is to sustainably meet our agricultural nitrogen needs and reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers.Studying nodule development in soybean, a major food, feed and potential biofuel crop, is of high relevance to modern U.S agriculture. U.S. farmers used ~13 million tons of nitrogen in 2011 costing them on average $10 billion (USDA-ERS data) which could be significantly reduced through enhancement ofbiological nitrogen fixation. Reduced use of chemical fertilizers also helps sustain clean water, fertile land and a benefiting habitat for future generations."

We are investigating a two-step process inisolating bacteria from a food and agricultural samples. The first step separates surface-adheredbacterial from a plant-based matrix. This is accomplished using a customized enzymaticdigestion of the plant material. As the plant material is rapidly broken down, the bacterial cells inand on the matrix surface are released into an aqueous mixture. While the digestion has beenshown to rapidly liquefy the plant matrix, there has been no effect on the viability of the bacterialcells. Our preliminary data demonstrate a significant increase in bacterial recovery followingenzymatic digestion.The second step involves the removal of the bacteria from the liquefied sample. This will beaccomplished using high affinity bacteriophage-tagged magnetic particles. The coliphage T7 andthe Listeria spp. specific phage A511 will be genetically modified to allow for biotin expressionon the major capsid proteins. The result will be oriented conjugation of the phages ontostreptavidin-coated magnetic particles. This phage separation strategy has been shown to havehigher capture efficiencies as compared to immuno-affinity based separation. Once separated,the bacteria will be quantified using QPCR.A validation of the proposed separation method will be performed by extension. E. coliinoculated spinach and Listeria inoculated bean sprouts will be enzymatically digested and thenundergo a phage-based magnetic separation."

Excess rainfalls near harvest can cause pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), rendering wheat unsuitable for human food use. This wheat can still be sold for livestock feed, but at staggering losses. Falling Number (FN) is a widely implemented method used to test enzyme activity of PHS-damaged wheat and determine pricing, but has not shown to be a reliable predictor. These discrepancies have highlighted a knowledge gap in how PHS influences starch properties within wheat kernels. The proposed FN system will be critical to addressing these issues as it will serve as the only means of communication between quality control and research. Our goals are to address critical issues related to wheat quality through (1) elucidating the mechanism for the effect of PHS, (2) clarifying the relationship between FN and end-use quality, and (3) facilitating the development of new wheat varieties that are more resistant to PHS. The acquisition of a FN system in this proposal will enhance research capacity at the University of Idaho (UI), the teaching quality of the food science and plant science programs, and the collaboration between food science and wheat breeding program at the UI. Through performing experiments, graduate students who are involved in the proposed project will receive laboratory instruction, and gain skills in performing experiment, critical thinking and problem solving. Through teaching starch chemistry course, students will learn specific knowledge of starch chemistry and apply the knowledge to solve related problems in food and agricultural industries. Students will be also more competitive in job markets after graduation."

Alabama predominantly has small farmers with 91 percent of the harvested cropland farm being less than 100 acres, and 76 percent of the cattle farmers having herd size of less than 50. Similar scenario exists for small ruminant producers with median meat goat herd size being 18 with average pasture acreage of 10. Same situation occurs at the national level as well with 91 percent of the family farms classified as  small farms  with their gross annual sales remaining under $250,000.00. The sustainability of these farms is becoming more and more challenging with the changing scenarios, such as increasing globalized market competition, growing global population and food demand, and changing climate with more extreme weather conditions. To remain sustainable, the small and medium-sized farms need to be more efficient, productive, environmentally sound, and socially appealing.Agroforestry is a sustainable land-use system that involves the intentional integration and management of trees, crops, and/or livestock in a single management unit. This system offers more economical, environmental, and social benefits compared to the sole operation of its components. Well-managed agroforestry systems provide economic viability through regular, short-term incomes from crop, non-timber forest products, livestock components, and possible wildlife hunting and tourism, and long-term incomes from tree products. Environmental benefits of agroforestry systems include, but not limited to, creation of milder microclimate, better soil conservation, nutrient recycling, carbon sequestration, cleaner water and air, and provision of other ecosystem services as compared to the system components practiced alone. The beautiful scenery of an agroforestry system adds value to the society. There are tremendous opportunities for developing agroforestry systems in the Southeast USA as most of the landowners and farmers have woodland. However, not much research has been done to explore the suitable agroforestry systems that can enhance the sustainability of small and medium-sized farms in the Southeast. Similarly, there are limited extension education opportunities available to the farmers and landowners in the rural areas on agroforestry practices.The long-term goal of this project is to promote sustainable agriculture and resilient rural communities through the development of robust, sustainable agroforestry systems that promote long-term soil productivity and generate both short- and long-term incomes from crops, livestock, and trees. To support this goal, research will be conducted to identify suitable small ruminant species (meat goat and hair sheep) to be included in the southern pine silvopasture systems, and suitable vegetable crops for pine-tree- and pecan-tree-based alley cropping systems. Pines and pecans are the common timber and nut trees, respectively, in the Southeast. Additionally, economics and soil quality changes associated with different agroforestry practices under this project will be evaluated. Also, methods of managing the non-pine vegetation in the woodland using small ruminants will be explored. The findings of this project will be disseminated to the target audience and beyond through 1) conducting trainings, field days, site tours, 2) presentation of the findings in relevant conferences, seminars, meetings, farm visits, 3) publication and dissemination of the extension articles, 4) publication of journal articles, and 5) publication of graduate theses. The general expectation of this project is that valuable information on agroforestry will be found out and published, and the target audience will be trained and educated on sustainable agroforestry practices. Consequently, this project will promote the understanding and adoption of agroforestry practices that enhance sustainable agriculture and resilient rural communities."

Global population growth is expected to increase to ~9 billion by 2050 and raises unprecedented and definitive environmental, economic, and societal challenges. The overarching challenge facing livestock production systems is one of demand for increased protein production (milk and meat) framed within growing consumer concern over food quality, safety, animal welfare, climate change, and long-term resilience and sustainability. Intensification of current confined livestock production systems are not efficient or sustainable, particularly when protein produced is balanced against land and water inputs. Furthermore, by 2050, &gt;80% of agricultural production is projected to come from increased productivity on presently cultivated land, however, increased agricultural production is frequently associated with management practices which degrade land and water resources. Therefore, to meet the growing demand for milk and meat, agricultural production will increasingly have to preserve and augment good quality land and water resources through enhanced efficiency and utilization of non-conventional resources and/or management practices.Grazing systems are part of the landscape and are an integral component of economically and socially viable livestock production. When compared to other sources of fodder production for milk and meat, grass/pasture based grazing systems represent an economically viable source of feed when compared to maize silage and/or alfalfa haylage. As such there is increasing interest in the development of livestock grazing systems which may foster environmental sustainability/resilience and maintain and/or improve long term livestock production capacity. The underlying challenge facing grazing systems is the need to develop production practices which maximize the utilization of grass per unit of animal product, promote mixed swards which balance nitrogen fixation (legumes) with high quality grasses balancing nitrogen and energy release in the rumen to maximize production efficiency (akin with sound TMR rations) along with sound environmental practices based on grazing science agro-ecology.However, there are few, if any, research facilities incorporating grazing lactating dairy livestock into agro-ecosystems research in the continental United States. Our goal is to integrate a lactating grazing herd into UW-Platteville Pioneer Farm agro-ecosystem research program. With this increased capacity we will investigate the impact of grazing on ecosystem services at the field, farm, and landscape levels; and, compare/contrast the proposed grazing herd with our current confined dairy herd. This goal will be achieved through the establishment of a new collaborative relationship with the United States Dairy Forage Research Center (USDFRC); and, by enhancing our collaboration within the Global Farm Platform (GFP) and Long-Term Agro-ecosystem Research (LTAR) networks."

The goal of this project plan is to use biopolymers to develop sustainable technologies and bioproducts that will benefit the U.S. and that will not negatively impact food reserves. This plan highlights the use of nonfood fibers and crop waste to create new bioproducts and help improve the efficiency in utilizing agricultural commodities via the following objectives:  Objective 1: Enable, from a technological standpoint, new commercial value-added biobased materials. a. Utilize conventional and novel processing technologies to produce and characterize nanofibers from biopolymers and investigate potential applications.  b.Utilize biopolymers to encapsulate/deliver beneficial soil microbes that improve crop production.  Objective 2: Enable new commercial materials based on biopolymers and biobased fillers. a. Develop fiber-reinforced composite materials. b. Develop value-added bioproducts from torrefied crop waste.  c. Develop value-added bioproducts from almond, grape and citrus waste.  Approach: The overarching approach will be to provide data, technology and prototypes that will not only result in novel bioproducts but also address important agricultural needs including the need for higher crop production, the need for more sustainable farming practices, the need for alternatives to petroleum-based products and the need for new innovations such as nanotechnology. The first approach is development of composite materials that encapsulate beneficial microbes to be used to reduce the inputs of conventional fertilizers and petroleum-based pesticides. A co-development as part of this approach is production of humic acid from renewable resources such as torrefied crop waste to augment soil health. Humates will be used as soil amendments to improve soil fertility and crop production. Also, nanofibers from aqueous solutions of biopolymers will be made and characterized by developing new processes to make nanofibers from a wide array of biopolymers. Bioproducts made using the nanofibers will include controlled-release devices and sensors.  Objective 2 is aimed at developing bioproducts from nonfood agricultural products, namely plant fibers and crop waste. The group will apply expertise in dispersing plant fibers in biopolymer matrices and in inorganic binders. The anticipated bioproducts developed in Objective 2a include compression molded food service products containing more than 60% fiber using biopolymers as binders. We will also create lightweight rigid foam products by dispersing plant fibers in inorganic binders including Portland cement and gypsum.  California has one of the most diverse agricultural industries in the world and ranks first in production in terms of cash receipts ($43 billion), but also leads in the output of crop waste and residues. Diverse agricultural byproducts such as almond hulls, grape pomace, citrus peel waste, etc., which are concentrated at processing plants and often carry a cost for disposal, will be converted into higher value products. Objectives 2b, and 2c specifically address this need. The anticipated products include black filler for PET plastics and pelletized coal dust made using inexpensive biopolymer binders such as citrus waste and gums from almond hulls. Other bioproducts include essential oils and antioxidants extracted from seeds processed from grape pomace."

The overall goal is to develop optimal strategies for converting agricultural biomass to biofuels and to create value-added products (bioproducts) that improve the economics of biorefining processes. Specific emphasis is to develop strategies for biorefineries located in the Western United States by using regionally-specific feedstocks and crops, including sorghum, almond byproducts, citrus juicing wastes, pomace, municipal solid wastes (MSW), and food processing wastes. These feedstocks will be converted into biofuels, bioenergy and fine chemicals.   Objective 1: Develop commercially-viable technologies for converting agriculturally-derived biomass, crop residues, biogas, and underutilized waste streams into marketable chemicals. Research on converting biogas will involve significant collaboration with one or more industrial partners. Sub-objective 1A: Provide data and process models for integrated biorefineries that utilize sorghum and available solid waste to produce ethanol, biogas and commercially-viable coproducts.  Sub-objective 1B. Convert biogas from biorefining processes into polyhydroxyalkanoate plastics.  Sub-objective 1C: Apply the latest tools in immobilized enzymes, nano-assemblies, to convert biomass to fermentable sugars, formaldehyde, and other fine chemicals.

Sub-objective 2A: Add value to almond byproducts. Sub-objective 2B: Apply bioenegineering of bacteria and yeast to produce diacids, ascorbic acid and other value-added products from pectin-rich citrus peel waste. Sub-objective 2C: Convert  Approach: Objective 1, referred to by some as Gen 1.5 Biorefineries, involves development of processes that will generate advanced biofuels using the “cheapest source of carbons” within a given region.  Sub-objective 1A provides data about the properties of grain, forage, and sweet sorghum grown in California. Compositional analysis of cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose for grain, forage, and sweet sorghum varieties grown in California provides growers information to decide whether sorghum will become a viable biofuels feedstock in integrated biorefineries that also include anaerobic digestion.   Sub-objective 1B is goal-driven research toward improving methanotrophic bacteria for commercial production of commodity and fine chemicals. High throughput mutagenesis is employed to enrich production of polyhydroxyalkanoate, PHA, from mixed populations. Sub-objective 1C tests the hypothesis that bioconversion of biomass substrates into value-added products will be achieved more efficiently with enzymes anchored to nano-assemblies, compared with using the same enzymes free in solution. The basic nano-assembly building block, termed the Rosettasome, will spontaneously assemble into an 18-subunit, double-ring structure that holds up to 18 different enzymes. Proposed research involves developing optimized Rosettazymes for hydrolyzing various biomass substrates into value-added bioproducts using multiple tethered enzymes.  Objective 2 will provide data and technology that will add value to food processing byproducts. Sub-objective 2A consists of a goal-driven series of engineering developments to recover value-added free sugars, hemicellulose, and gums from almond byproducts. Release and utilization of free sugar and sugar alcohol can be improved by optimizing extraction parameters (time, temperature, particle size of the hulls, etc.) during hot water isolation. This process releases fermentable sugars, hemicellulose molasses and gums from almond shells and hulls. Equations  and their corresponding parameters will be developed into process models for recovery of water soluble sugars in almond hulls. The goal is to add increased value to all components of the almond processing industry.  Research in sub-objective 2B is driven by the hypothesis that whole cells can be engineered to convert pectin and other specific oligosaccharides into value-added products more efficiently than using multi-step chemical or enzymatic reactions. This will be achieved by applying bioenegineering of bacteria and yeast to produce diacids, ascorbic acid, and other value-added products from pectin-rich citrus peel waste.   The general hypothesis driving sub-objective 2C is that bioconversion research is that specific well-defined enzymes can be applied to  surgically  remove selective branching groups from individual polysaccharide substrates via controlled enzymatic debranching and cleavage of main chain polymers."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial ôrhizobacteriaö, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or ôgapsö, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments. Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics.  Approach: Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems. Hypothesis: Dry bean genotypes interact with tillage management to affect yield performance under drought conditions.  Eight pinto bean genotypes with varying drought tolerance will be tested in a field previously sown to wheat. A split, split block with four replications with irrigation level the main plot, tillage level the split plot, and genotypes the split, split plot will be used. Irrigation will be manipulated to impose a terminal drought stress. Conventional tillage and strip tillage will treatments will both include use of a nonselective herbicide. Variables will include plant biomass, soil compaction, soil moisture, measures of plant stress and various yield components.    Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments.   Hypothesis a) Timing of herbicide application when available soil moisture and likelihood of precipitation is greater impacts weed control in chickpea.  Four herbicides will be tested at three application timings; 4 and 2 weeks prior to seeding chickpea, and post-plant, preemergence. Herbicide treatments will be replicated in a randomized complete block. Soil moisture will be monitored gravimetrically for 4 weeks after each application. Weed control and chickpea tolerance will be determined by taking weed counts and visual control ratings at 3 and 6 weeks after planting (WAP) and crop stand counts at 4 WAP, and chickpea seed yield.  Hypothesis b) Roller-packing impacts performance of pre-emergence herbicides in chickpea in dry soil conditions.  Four herbicide combinations applied post-plant, pre-emergence will be tested in chickpea with and without roller-packing. Experiments will be designed as a split block with herbicide as the main treatment and roller packer as the split treatment and each treatment replicated four times. Half of each plot will be roller-packed immediately after herbicide applications. Weed control and chickpea injury will be evaluated and visually compared to a non-treated check. Analysis of variance will be used to statistically separate treatment effects in all experiments.   Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Hypothesis: Rhizobacteria strains, soilborne pathogens and cultivar class significantly impact biological nitrogen fixation and yields of pea and chickpea genotypes.  The interactions between the root rot pathogen Fusarium solani, commercial rhizobacteria inoculants, and foliar applications of phosphorous acid, on nitrogen fixation and rhizobial colonization of the most popular dry pea cultivars grown in Washington and Idaho will be assessed in field and greenhouse trials. Plants will be evaluated for elemental content, plant height, dry shoot/root weight, root disease severity, nodulation and yield."

Objective 1: Employing long-term, longitudinal studies of honey bee survivorship under current management conditions for honey bees used as pollinators and honey producers, elucidate honey bee forage needs and causes of mortality to serve as the basis for best management practices for pollination of specialty crops such as almond.  [NP305, Component 2, Problem Statements 2A, 2B, 2C]  Approach: Honey bees are the main pollinators of crops in the United States and worldwide.Losses of honey bees due to a variety of factors are unsustainable at the current levels of over 30 percent. To mitigate these losses, it is necessary to determine their causal factors; however, long-term baseline data for colony survivorship is not available that can be used to parse the relative importance of suspected factors. It is therefore crucial to develop such a methodology, particularly as part of long-term longitudinal studies of spatial and temporal changes in bee populations exposed to a number of abiotic and biotic stresses and management practices. These longitudinal studies may incorporate research on pesticide, pathogen/pest, and nutrition/forage or other bee health effects, using hives that are stationary as well as those that follow pollination service migratory routes. The proposed longitudinal studies support ARS National Program on Production (NP305) Action Plan research objectives; Component 2: Bee Health; Problem Statements 2A: Bee Management—Improving Bee Nutrition and Performance, 2B: Bee Health—Mitigating the Impacts of Pathogens, Pests, and Pesticides, and 2C: Maximizing Bee Pollination and Quantifying Bee Forage Requirements of the Action Plan."

Approach: Three 24% protein diets containing 30, 20, and 15% soybean meal will be compared with a 28% protein control diet.  Hybrid catfish fingerlings will be stocked in ponds at 6,000 fish/acre.  Each diet will be fed to five replicate ponds. All ponds will be harvested in October/November.  A partial budget analysis based on feed and fish prices will be conducted to determine the economic benefit (if any) of using low-protein alternative diets versus the traditional control diet.   This study will evaluate five 28% protein diets fortified with varoious supplements. Experimental design, diet analyses, procedures for stocking, feeding, pond management, data collection and statistical and economic analysis will be the same as described for Sub-objective 1.A.   All soybean meal in hybrid catfish feeds will be replaced with various combinations of cottonseed meal, distiller’s grains with solubles, peanut meal, and porcine meat and bone meal. Pond will be stocked with hybrid catfish fingerlings, and diet analyses, experimental design, procedures for stocking, feeding, pond management, data collection and statistical analysis, and economic analysis will be the same as described for Sub-objective 1.A.

Sub-objective 2.1: Develop food applications for pulse components. Sub-objective 2.2: Develop non-food applications for oilseed press cake and pulse components.  Approach: Oilseed press cakes and pulse crops are two potentially valuable sources of functional food ingredients and biobased products from plant seed tissues which have not been fully exploited. New processing methods are critically needed in order to (1) identify new applications for currently low-value oilseed press cakes such as pennycress, coriander, and camelina, and (2) provide functional food ingredients from pulse crops in a form that facilitates incorporation into various food products while minimizing negative characteristics. In coordination with collaborating projects, pulse and press cake feedstocks will be obtained and their protein, starch, and fiber components separated by milling, extraction, or treatment with chemicals or enzymes. Thermo-mechanical processes such as steam jet cooking, steam explosion, and extrusion will be investigated as methods to separate, modify, or combine isolated components or remove undesirable components. Functional characteristics such as texture, particle size, microstructure, solubility, compatibility, and organoleptic properties will be determined and suitability for specific food and industrial applications will be investigated. The performance of prototype industrial products will be evaluated and the most efficient methods for the isolation of functional components determined. Anticipated biobased products include gums, adhesives, lubricants, thickeners, fibers, composite fillers, and coatings. Pulse fractions enriched in specific functional or nutritious ingredients will be incorporated into food formulations and evaluated for consumer acceptability. Successful utilization of these feedstocks will enhance the economic viability of the respective crops for farmers and thus provide agronomic benefits such as nitrogen fixation by legume crops and off-season cover crop benefits for oilseed producers."

We will focus on the following three objectives over the next five years:    Objective 1: Increase the commercial value of plant-based, postharvest waste materials, high in dietary fiber and/or polyphenols (grape, berries, tomato, carrot, and olive pomace, olive leaves and water, mushroom byproducts), by reprocessing into healthful food ingredients. 1.1: Screen processing wastes for nutritional properties of the whole pomace, seeds, skins, and the extractable and nonextractable (high fiber) fractions using appropriate animal models. 1.2: Increase value by developing healthful ingredients with improved bioaccessibility to bioactive polyphenols by process treatments such as extrusion, thermal, chemical and enzymatic processing of the whole waste.   Objective 2: Enable new, commercial functional foods from high protein–based waste materials (nuts, legumes, rice, fish).  2.1: Analyze nutrient content of processed farm waste (soybean, peanut, rice and salmon) for functional properties and nutritional quality of protein fraction.  2.2: Formulate and test high protein gluten free health promoting products for consumer acceptability.   Objective 3: Enable value-added commercial applications of nanofibers from specialty crop waste materials to deliver bioactives in new functional foods.   Objective 4: Increase the utilization of post-harvest waste materials by identifying and removing astringent and mineral components that detract from taste, quality, nutritional value and consumer acceptance.  Approach: Objective 1: Determine if processed food wastes or their components from regional fruit and vegetable food processing have health promoting properties by using animal models of obesity and related metabolic diseases to evaluate bioactivity. Animal models are necessary since many bioactive compounds are not absorbed directly but are mediated by gut bacteria. Some waste materials may require fractionation, for example seeds from peels, in order to concentrate bioactive components to a useful level. Bioavailability and bioactivity of more bioactive compounds such as polyphenolics and plant sterols may be increased by removing and modifying dietary fibers that block accessibility to enzymes and gut bacteria. Bioactive food wastes such as mushrooms with high vitamin D content will be processed into films or coatings.   Objective 2: Develop new healthy and flavorful foods from high protein waste materials. Processing wastes from soybeans, peanuts, rice and salmon will be analyzed for protein composition and food related physico-chemical properties. The waste materials will be formulated into foods to increase protein content and improve protein quality. Waste ingredients are often high in insoluble fibers that reduce functionality and may require fractionation from fiber to improve useful properties.    Objective 3: Develop blow spinning technology to efficiently produce natural nanofibers for controlled release applications and evaluate potential pulmonary toxicity effects of nanofibers in mice after intratracheal instillation of nanofibers. Using blow spinning processes nanofibers will be created from food ingredients such as gelatin, chitosan, and fruit and vegetable pomaces (grape, carrot, tomato and olive) in order to eliminate or reduce potential inhalation inflammation or toxicity. Although the nanofibers will be used for encapsulation of bioactive compounds for oral delivery the potential for inhalation during process requires toxicity testing. The ingredients as well as the nanofibers will be evaluated for inflammation and toxicity in a mouse model to determine degree and persistence of inflammation or toxicity if any. Ingredients that are most biocompatible will be used in subsequent studies.  Objective 4: Develop strategies to mitigate astringency in post-harvest materials in order to increase their utilization.  Tannins and minerals contribute to astringency and the identification and characterization of these components is essential. Total and free mineral contents in waste materials (nut shells, hulls, pits, pomaces, skins and seeds from stone fruits, nuts, and persimmons) will be measured using microwave-induced plasma atomic emission spectrometry following microwave-assisted digestion or leaching.  Tannin levels in the same materials will be measured using total soluble phenolic, potassium iodate (hydrolysable tannin), and vanillin (condensed tannin) assays.  The metal (Zn, Cu, Fe) and protein binding properties of waste material tannins will be measured and compared to the properties of commercially available tannins."

Enable new commercial sensor-in-system flowing-grain microwave moisture and density meters for precision farming and yield monitoring.   2. Enable a portable, commercial microwave meter to create capacity for rapid grading in-shell almond and peanut by determining moisture content, meat content, and foreign material contents.  3. Enable new commercial microwave sensors for monitoring controlled drying of grain, peanuts and other seeds.  Approach: I:  To enable a new commercial sensor for flowing grain microwave moisture and density, dielectric-based algorithms for bulk density and moisture content determination at microwave frequencies will be tested in flowing situations. In designing a flowing-grain system, the frequency must be higher than 3 GHz, free-space transmission techniques will be used for on-line applications, and measurements will be performed in the near field to keep the system compact. At least three cultivars each of wheat, corn, and soybeans will be obtained from certified seed with some geographic and seasonal diversity. Moisture, density, and temperature will be varied for model development and then validated on flowing grain.  Next, a prototype sensor made with off-the-shelf components will be assembled and tested. Then a user-friendly, step-by-step software programs will be developed to control the measurements with moisture predictions within 0.2% to 0.5%, and bulk density will be within less than 2% relative error.  II:  The above system will next be developed for rapid grading of in-shell almond and peanut by determining moisture content, meat content, and foreign material contents. First dielectric properties data will be collected with laboratory grade instrumentation on un-cleaned and cleaned in-shell almonds and peanuts of different varieties and from different locations and compared to oven-drying moisture and meat content.  Measurements will also be collected on almond and peanut kernels alone.  The data will comprise of dielectric properties corresponding to frequency, temperature, moisture content, bulk density, meat content, and foreign material content. The next step is to develop a microwave prototype for moisture content, meat content, and foreign material content in in-shell almonds and peanuts which will be externally controlled with a laptop computer and ultimately packaged to satisfy grading requirements and withstand working conditions at buying stations.    III: The last approach is to use the microwave moisture sensors developed above to monitor and record moisture content of grain, peanuts and other seeds in real-time during drying while improving efficiency through control of drying and minimizing energy consumption when compared to existing drying controls.  To accomplish this, a microwave moisture meter will be combined with three temperature sensors and a relative humidity sensor to monitor peanut drying in a quarter scale-model drying wagon to optimize the drying process by determining real time in-shell kernel moisture content in different zones of the trailer.  Similar work will be performed with cereal grains and oilseeds stored and dried in large, farm storage bins. Varying temperature and moisture profiles will be evaluated during the drying process. Through feedback control, the system will optimize the drying process to better ensure even drying throughout the trailer (for peanuts) and bin (for grains). Once successful, the microwave moisture meter(s) will then be integrated with all other sensors in one single unit including a microcontroller, an LCD, and mass storage device."

Approach: To address critical production, processing and regulatory compliance issues pertaining to Western irrigated cottons and companion crops, this project focuses on three main research areas. The first area advances knowledge of and improves cotton cultivars and production and harvesting practices by 1) collaborating with cotton breeders to determine the ginned fiber quality, textile processing characteristics, and cottonseed quality of newly developed cotton cultivars; 2) investigating cotton picker spindle designs to reduce quality degradation during harvesting; and 3) developing a technology to thermally treat cotton plant stalks for whole-plant desiccation and defoliation. The second improves processing, reduces risk, and increases value by 1) building on earlier work to advance the use of microwave energy to effectively dry seed cotton; 2) improving a device developed to accurately measure seed cotton moisture content for better system management; 3) developing an infrared based sensor to detect plastics contamination in seed cotton at the gin and an electrostatic based device to separate plastics from seed cotton by exploiting static charge affinity differences; 4) evaluating current and, then, developing improved gin saw designs that maintain capacity and reduce fiber damage; 5) cooperating with industry partners in further evaluating and refining a prototype seed cotton reclaimer and lint cleaner feed works capable of processing seed cotton carryover and ginned lint from high speed roller gin stands; 6) evaluating roller ginned upland cotton textile utilization without combing to reduce processing cost; 7) studying in depth the cost of roller ginning upland cottons; 8) exploring improvements in lint cleaner saw wire configuration and grid bar design, and developing new air knife and rotary brush technologies to reduce seed coat fragments in ginned lint; 9) developing continuous air system monitoring and control systems and performing cyclone flow sensitivity analyses to reduce gin energy consumption; and 10) updating particulate emission factors, evaluating regulatory dispersion models, documenting federal reference method particulate samplers for more equitable industry regulation. The third area enhances the viability of cotton companion crops by 1) modifying current walnut drying technologies to reduce energy usage and drying time; 2) building on previous testing and utilizing an experimental approach to improve a retrofit particulate abatement technology for mobile agricultural equipment; and 3) optimizing a prototype to mechanize succulent chili harvest."

Objective 3: Integrate allergenic properties and molecular changes with commercial tree nut development.   Objective 4: Enable new commercial immunoassays for detection of allergens in processed foods.  Approach: The immunoglobulin E (IgE) binding sites that are responsible for the symptoms of allergic disease and cross-reactivity among peanut, tree nut and pollen allergens will be identified with peptide microarray technology. The IgE epitopes will be modeled on the surface of allergen structures to identify location and common or cross-reactive sequences and structural regions of allergens among nuts and pollens.  Simultaneously, peanuts, tree nuts or purified allergens thereof (recombinant or native) will be subjected to existing and novel processing techniques (i.e. heat, chemical and enzymatic treatment). New allergens or changes in allergenic properties of existing allergens due to the processing methods will be identified by immunoassays with serum (containing IgE antibodies) from peanut and or tree nut allergic individuals.  Proteins found to be immunologically altered by processing will be assessed within the food matrix or they will be purified and analyzed for alterations in size, structure, digestibility, binding to various antibodies, including, serum IgE, known anti-processing reaction products, and allergen specific antibodies.  The specific amino acid residues, or peptides thought to be modified during different processing events, and to contribute to altered allergenic properties will be identified by mass spectrometry.  Understanding the molecular basis of processing-induced alterations of allergens with respect to the IgE binding sights will guide the development of processing technologies towards reduced allergenicity of nuts and products thereof. This knowledge will also contribute to the development of better detection tools and labeling practices for industry and regulatory agencies resulting in better protection of consumers.  As a possible early interventional method to reduce the allergenic potential of nuts, the expression and accumulation patterns of allergens in a model tree-nut (pecan) will be studied under various conditions, which may allow interference with their accumulation in the future."

The overall goal is to be able to provide compound(s) amenable for commercial development as a pesticide or identify a “high value” plant with unique bioactive compounds. Over the next 5 years, we will focus on the following objectives:  Objective 1: Enable, from a technological standpoint, new commercial biopesticides; and identify optimum production practices for the plants from which these biopesticides are derived.

Improve perennial weed management by targeting production and persistence of vegetative propagules. Sub-objective 1.C. Determine if improved in-row weed control in organic peanut production can be improved by planting in a depressed seedbed and aggressive cultivation, without compromising disease management.  Objective 2:  Improve cultural weed control strategies, including conservation tillage methods that can be used as part of integrated weed management systems for invasive and herbicide resistant weeds (e.g. Palmer amaranth, Italian ryegrass, etc.) of agronomic crops. Sub-objective 2.A. Evaluate the influence of various edaphic factors on weed seed persistence in the soil seedbank. Sub-objective 2.B. Determine the effect of high-biomass cover crop mulches on glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth growth. Subobjective 2.C. Determine when viable Palmer amaranth seed production first occurs and characterize the timing of seed dispersal from the female plant during the growing season.  Approach: Research will be conducted in conventional and organic summer and winter crops in the southeastern coastal plain to develop weed management practices that utilize diverse tactics to minimize herbicide reliance.  Conventional weed management systems rely heavily on herbicides to minimize crop yield losses associated with weeds.  Organic cropping systems have few approved herbicide options, and must rely primarily on weed control from cultural and mechanical practices.  The occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds has limited the efficiency of many herbicides in conventional systems.  Studies will be initiated to evaluate a multi-tactic approach to managing weeds with a reduced reliance on herbicide tools.  In the first objective, the factors that affect the dynamics of problematic weeds in conventional and organic systems, especially weeds of cool-season crops (e.g. Vidalia onion and sugar beet) and perennial weeds, will be characterized.  The impact of the timing of control practices on weed establishment will be evaluated.  Management practices that reduce vegetative propagules of problematic weeds will also be studied.  The second objective will evaluate integrated diverse weed control tactics of herbicide-resistant weeds.  The influence of rolled high-biomass cover crops and nitrogen management on weed seed persistence in the field soil seedbank will be determined.  Herbicide-resistant weeds thrive in the current herbicide-dominated weed control systems, with selection pressure for herbicide-resistant weeds.  These studies will address if there are additional management practices that can be altered to improve weed control and alter the selection pressures on weeds.  The ultimate goal of these objectives is to improve grower profitability and reduce reliance on a limited set of herbicide resources that are rapidly declining in efficiency."

Sub-objective 1c: Quantify the role of soil environmental parameters (e.g., C, C:N and NO3-:NO2- ratios, pH, diurnal temperature variations, soil moisture) in controlling nitrification along with N-loss (denitrification) vs. N-retention (DNRA), and evaluate the link between measured N-cycle processes to weed seed germination and seedling development.  Objective 2: Improve the feasibility of using multi-tactic integrated weed management approaches for regaining control of weeds with resistances to multiple herbicides, and for preventing or slowing the evolution of herbicide resistance in susceptible weed populations.

Sub-objective 2b: Develop and compare weed management systems in edamame, utilizing cover crops, herbicides, and physical weeding.  Approach: Multi-tactic integrated weed management (IWM) offers one potential approach to address the problem of multiple herbicide resistant (MHR) weeds. In IWM systems, suites of multiple complementary tactics are deployed throughout weed life cycles to increase efficacy of weed suppression, prevent survival of weeds that escape earlier management, and reduce weed populations over the long-term. In this project, we evaluate the utility of chemical, cultural, biological, and physical tactics in IWM systems for weed suppression and crop yield protection in fields with MHR weed populations. Edamame (vegetable soybean) cultivars tolerant to cover crop residues will be combined with cover crops, recently registered herbicides, and physical weeding to examine the potential of IWM in legume vegetable production systems. The contribution of improved knowledge of soil N cycling to aid better prediction of weed seedling emergence and community composition also will be evaluated in this production system. In field crops, interactions among weed seed destruction at crop harvest, cover crops, and tank mixtures of herbicides will be quantified for their impact on MHR weeds in corn and soybean. Finally, in a continuation of previous research, the impact of escaped invasive bioenergy crops on weeds of arable areas will be measured."

Sub-objective 1.A. Correlate genetic markers with phenotypic traits of interest in European corn borer, western corn rootworm and western bean cutworm. Sub-objective 1.B. Determine how larval movement and adult dispersal influence insect resistance to transgenic corn.   Objective 2: For corn agro-ecosystems, determine potential impacts of changing farming practices on the demographics and ecology of pest and non-pest arthropods, such as the monarch butterfly. Sub-objective 2.A. Assess the potential value of neonicotinoid insecticide seed treatments to growers of major row crops under different agronomic conditions. Sub-objective 2.B.

Sub-objective 3.A. Develop genetic markers and genomic tools for western corn rootworm, European corn borer, western bean cutworm, and other pests of corn. Sub-objective 3.B. Characterize genetic regulation of surface lipids on corn silks and assess protective capacity of these lipids on corn earworm feeding.  Approach: Field-resistance in western corn rootworm (WCR) to Cry3Bb1 Bt toxins and in European corn borer (ECB) to Cry1Fa and Cry1Ab toxins will be mapped by using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) protocols and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Pedigrees will be constructed from Bt resistant and susceptible individuals of both species. GBS will be performed by constructing genomic DNA libraries from non-size-selected fragments, to which adapters with a unique barcode are ligated.  A population mapping approach using a high density of SNP markers will be taken to identify loci that differ significantly between E- and Z-race ECB. The premise of population mapping is similar to quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, but SNPs with skewed frequencies between races are assumed to result from either selection for race-specific adaptations or genetic drift facilitated by restricted gene flow. GBS-derived SNP markers will be used to estimate gene flow among WCR populations. The strategy will be to estimate Wright's neighborhood area for WCR, the radius of which constitutes a measure of the typical distance genes move per generation. Dispersal and survival rates of fall armyworm (FAW) will be measured in field plot trials. FAW egg masses will be placed in the whorl of vegetative-stage corn plants surrounded by uninfested plants. Living and dead larvae on plants will be counted periodically using destructive sampling. Planting arrangements will include various combinations of Bt and non-Bt isoline plants.  Flight behavior and capacity of WCR will be characterized and compared across three Cry3Bb1-resistant and two susceptible strains using flight mills to determine the degree to which resistance affects dispersal.  In collaboration with other ARS laboratories and as a NP304 effort, a comprehensive review of the literature will be conducted to provide information on the usefulness of seed treatment with neonicotinoid insecticide in controlling target pests and protecting crops from yield loss.  A series of studies will be conducted related to milkweed species selection (larval performance and oviposition preference), and milkweed plant establishment (determining patch sizes and maximizing sustainability of milkweeds). Initially, studies will focus on four Asclepias species found in Iowa: common milkweed, A. syriaca, swamp milkweed, A. incarnata, butterfly weed, A. tuberosa, and whorled milkweed, A. verticillata. Also, studies will be conducted to determine how to maintain these plants in the landscape while avoiding loss from plant competition. This will require identifying the best companion plants for the targeted milkweed species.  Two sources of corn germplasm will be used to screen for silk activity against corn earworm (CEW). These corn lines and CEW resistant checks will be grown in the field. Emerged silks will be harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, and ground to a powder using a knife mill. One cohort of powdered silks will be used for surface lipid metabolic analysis, while another will be used for CEW bioassays, allowing the metabolomic analysis and CEW feeding studies to be conducted in parallel."

Sustainable solutions to these problems have been elusive when traditionally approached at smaller, local scales. Geospatial variation in physical and biological processes across aquatic, riparian and agricultural ecosystems can drive pest abundance and affect impacts to entire watersheds, and knowledge is needed to develop effective spatially explicit management approaches and ultimately to improve environmental quality.  Specifically, we will focus on the following assigned objectives.  Objective: 1) Identify and quantify biological and ecological processes underlying the colonization and spread of key invasive aquatic and riparian plant species in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta–San Francisco Bay, and other impacted watersheds, including the effects of spatially diverse physical processes, environmental conditions, and management strategies on these weeds.  Subobjective 1A: Evaluate spatially diverse processes and environmental conditions and their relationship to the colonization, spread and management of aquatic and riparian weed species.  Subobjective 1B: Evaluate the role of phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation on the capacity of invasive aquatic plants/populations to maintain fitness in response to climate change.  2) Develop scientific monitoring methods to guide geospatially-explicit adaptive management for invasive weeds of western watersheds (e.g., water primroses, curlyleaf pondweed, water hyacinth, Brazilian waterweed, and cordgrasses), and develop integrated weed management and watershed restoration strategies effective under various climate scenarios and at landscape scales.   Subobjective 2A: Develop geospatially-explicit monitoring methods to guide adaptive management o  Approach: We will evaluate the influence of hydrology, water management and other environmental factors on the spatial variation in propagule pressure, dispersal and establishment of Ludwigia hexapetala throughout the Russian River watershed using field experiments. We will evaluate mechanisms underlying distribution and spread of South American spongeplant in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta) and develop a GIS-based model to predict movement and new invasion sites. We will document release efforts, quantify spatial extent of establishment success and measure geographic range expansion of the saltcedar leaf beetle Diorhabda elongata 10 years following its release in Cache Creek Watershed. The effect of salinity and inundation on survival, growth and dispersal of invasive Iris pseudacorus will be assessed at watershed and landscape scales through field research and mesocosm experiments. In a cross-continent comparative experiment, phenotypic plasticity in germination responses of Ludwigia cytotypes to increasing temperature under predicted climate change conditions will be determined for risk assessments. Decision support tools integrating remote and field-based monitoring techniques for aquatic weeds in the Delta will be developed using remote sensing technology and ground-truthing studies. We will evaluate the water hyacinth planthopper and the water hyacinth weevil for integrated management of water hyacinth in the Delta in areas with and without pesticide applications for weed and mosquito control. Field research at multiple sites representing climatic variation will be conducted to assess aquatic invertebrate community responses to integrated weed management of aquatic weed mats (water hyacinth and Brazilian waterweed) and pesticide runoff in the Delta using a Before, After, Control, Intervention (BACI) experimental design. In the Russian River watershed, we will evaluate aquatic plant community distribution, composition and diversity relative to invasion and abundance of Ludwigia hexapetala, flow patterns and other environmental variables to develop future competitive interaction experiments and support reach-scale restoration strategies. To support control of insect pests on specialty crops in California, we will quantify regional dispersal patterns of the brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB) and spotted wing drosophila (SWD) as influenced by specialty crop type (grape, asparagus, cherry, almond, pear and walnut) and proximity to alternative susceptible hosts including invasive blackberry (Rubus armeniacus) in the Delta.  BMSB populations are projected to reach outbreak levels in the Delta but this research will focus on SWD if densities of BMSB fail to reach sufficient levels to be studied at this scale."

Objective 2: Develop practical, mass rearing methods for agriculturally important insects, especially insect pests needed for the production of their natural enemies (such as stink bugs), insect biological control agents (such as predatory pentatomids and coccinellids), and insects potentially important as a food supply for animals and humans (such as mealworms and crickets). Sub-objective 2A: Develop a reliable method for continuous production of the green stink bug Nezara viridula. Sub-objective 2B: Study new methods to produce extracts from the yellow mealworm Tenebrio molitor and the house cricket Acheta domesticus and incorporate them into artificial diets for the predators Podisus maculiventris and Coleomegilla maculata. Sub-objective 2C: Evaluate agricultural by-products as sources of food for the production of Tenebrio molitor and Acheta domesticus.  Objective 3: Develop effective biological control strategies for insect pests of crops grown under cover (e.g. high tunnels and greenhouses).  Approach: Climate matching software will be used to determine the most likely locations of natural enemy adapted populations across native ranges of M. cribraria and B. hilaris. The USDA-ARS European Biological Control Laboratory near Montpellier, France, will play a key role regarding parasitoid introductions of B. hilaris from many regions of Asia and Africa. Scientists at the university in Japan will make additional collections across the geographic range of the host within Japan. Scientists at USDA-ARS-IIRU, Newark, DE, will provide his host specificity expertise and make his Asian contacts available for the Kudzu Bug project.  Development of artificial diets for N. viridula will be approached by detailed chemical analyses of plant foods suitable for development and reproduction of N. viridula approximating their nutritional requirements. Artificial diets will be formulated to replicate the concentration and ratios of major nutritional components of broccoli, green lima beans and raw peanuts, which have been used to rear N. viridula. Diets will be compared to natural food sources broccoli, green snow peas, and raw peanuts plus a nutrient supplement previously developed  (unpublished). Rearing conditions other than diet, such as optimal rearing density and adult reproductive curves, will also be studied.  Extracts of T. molitor larvae and pupae and A. domesticus nymphs will be produced by freeze-drying them at -25ºC and by spray drying of homogenized insects. Dry samples will be ground to particles of at least 30 µm. Extracts produced from dried T. molitor pupae will be used to produce artificial diet formulations for C. maculata. The diet formulations will be compared on their suitability to produce quality predators using life table analysis of C. maculata. The formulations will also be compared to a control consisting of natural food. The same procedure will be used for artificial diet formulations for P. maculiventris.  Four different types of agricultural by products will be tested as viable options to formulate diets for T. molitor and A. domesticus. 1) Peanut shells, 2) corn cobs, 3) discarded cabbage, and 4) residual from corn fermentation for ethanol production. Each by-product will be chemically analyzed to determine the content of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate. Diets will be formulated by mixing ingredients with wheat bran at different ratios depending of their nutrient content based on the chemical analyses. Diets will be evaluated by determining and comparing immature survival, development time and the efficiency of food conversion for each of the two species of insects.  Release and evaluation techniques for lady beetles as predators of strawberry will be develop and evaluated. This study will involve (A) testing the effectiveness of augmentative releases of lady beetles to control aphids in high tunnels, (B) testing the predation potential of larvae in the presence of aphid-tending ants in the laboratory and in high tunnels, and (C) testing the assertion that molecules in wax filaments on the cuticle of S. creperus larvae subdue ant aggression."

For example, they can be used to assess whether or not a process deviation results in a one log cycle increase of Clostridium perfringens during cooling of a cooked meat product during commercial processing. Models that predict behavior of pathogens can be integrated with data for pathogen contamination to predict dynamic changes in pathogen prevalence and number in food across unit operations of a production chain. Predictions of consumer exposure can then be used in a dose-response model to form a process risk model that predicts consumer exposure and response to pathogens in food produced by specific scenarios. Process risk models have great potential to improve food safety and public health by providing a better assessment of food safety and identification of risk factors. In the past, we have developed predictive models and process risk models that have proven highly useful in providing regulatory agencies and the food industry with an objective means of assessing food safety and identifying risk factors. The goal of the proposed research is to elevate that successful effort to the next level of sophistication by considering additional variables and developing new and improved models and more effectively transferring this new research to the food industry by providing updated and improved versions of our software products: the Predictive Microbiology Information Portal, ComBase, and the Pathogen Modeling Program.  1: Develop and validate predictive models for behavior of stressed and unstressed pathogens in food with added antimicrobials. This includes development of validated dynamic models for spores and vegetative foodborne pathogens for evaluating heating and cooling process deviations.   2: Develop and validate process risk models for higher risk pathogen and food combinatio  Approach: Effects and interactions of time, temperature, pH, acidulant, water activity, humectant, or preservatives (phosphates, organic acid salts, and nitrite) in meat and poultry products, as well as in rice, beans, and pasta will be assessed to collect kinetic data for pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus).  Kinetic data will be modeled using primary and secondary models.  Predictive models performance will be evaluated using the acceptable prediction zone method.  Once validated and published, predictive models will be incorporated into the Pathogen Modeling Program and data will be archived in ComBase.  Kinetic data for development of predictive microbiology models for survival and growth of pathogens (Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, and Listeria monocytogenes) on higher risk food (tomatoes, lettuce, raw milk, and crab meat) will be obtained in inoculated pack studies.  Pathogens will be enumerated on higher risk food during storage trials using an automated miniature most probable number method.  Kinetic data will be modeled using neural network modeling methods and models will be validated against independent data using the acceptable prediction zone method.  Whole sample enrichment real time polymerase chain reaction (WSE-qPCR) will be used to obtain data for prevalence, number, and types of pathogens on higher risk food.  Predictive microbiology models and contamination data obtained by WSE-qPCR will be integrated to form process risk models that predict consumer exposure and response to pathogens on higher risk food produced by different scenarios.  All new models will be added to both versions of the Pathogen Modeling Program.  A link to ARS, Poultry Food Assess Risk Models website will be provided in the portal.  Combase will be made compatible with the PMP."

Specifically, during the next five years we will focus on the following interrelated objectives.  Objective 1: Develop and implement control measures to reduce, eliminate, or detect contamination of toxin producing fungi of tree nuts, for example the use of host plant- or fungal-derived semiochemicals to attract or control insect pests, or use of sterile insect techniques to decrease insect pest populations.     Sub-objective 1A: Use of host plant- or microbe-derived volatile semiochemicals to attract or control insect pests.    Sub-objective 1B: Use of sterile insect techniques to decrease insect pest populations.   Objective 2: Elucidate principles of microbial ecology and develop biological control measures to inhibit pathogenic and toxigenic microorganisms, particularly fungi, and can include research on the isolation and development of new biocontrol agents and formulations to control or prevent toxigenic microbes, or survey, identify, and determine ecology of microbial populations for control strategies such as competitive microorganisms.     Sub-objective 2A: Isolate biocontrol agents that prevent pathogenic/toxigenic microbes from colonizing crops.    Sub-objective 2B: Risk analysis of waste used as fertilizers for pathogen/toxigen contamination.    Sub-objective 2C: Develop new biocontrol agents and formulations to control toxigenic fungi, and to survey and characterize populations of Aspergilli.    Sub-objective 2D: Determine ecology of black-spored toxigenic Aspergilli and develop control strategies using competitive microorganisms.   Objective 3: Discover natural chemical compounds that enhance the efficacy of established microbe intervention strategies, for instance augment the activity of antimicrobial agents/treatment  Approach: 1A. Tree nuts emit chemicals that attract insect pests that can be used as bait for insect traps. We will analyze volatiles from nuts by GC-MS and test them for pest attraction in electrophysiological and behavioral bioassays. If we are unable to identify volatiles from nuts we will explore volatiles from other biotic and abiotic matrices.  1B. Sterile insect technique can be applied to navel orange worms (NOW) inside discarded nuts on the orchard floor using an X-ray device towed behind a tractor. We will determine the X-ray dose required for sterilization of NOW and adjust this dosage to sterilize NOW inside tree nuts and develop a tractor towed device for field sterilization. If X-ray exposure does not produce sterile NOW other forms of radiation will be used.  2A. Bacteria with agonistic properties to pathogens are present on almond drupes and if applied in large numbers would prevent pathogen contamination. We will isolate bacteria from almonds and test their ability to inhibit pathogen growth in vitro. The bacteria that inhibit pathogen growth in vitro will be examined for the ability to inhibit growth on almonds, then in field trials. If we are not able to identify bacteria that inhibit pathogen growth on almonds we will use other crops.  2B. Applying composted manure to orchards does not represent a food safety threat. We will examine the microbial community structure of soil and fruit before and after the application of manure. We will repeat the analysis for 3 years to determine the effects of manure application.  2C. Atoxigenic Aspergillus flavus strains with deletions in the aflatoxin and CPA genes can be used as biological control agents for toxigenic A. flavus.  We will identify atoxigenic A. flavus isolates by PCR and confirm by chemical analysis. We will examine their use as biocontrol agents via growth inhibition assays. Atoxigenic strains that displace the toxigenic strains will be impregnated into biochar and analyzed for as biocontrol agents in green house experiments. If the biochar is not suitable we will examine other matricies such as plastic granula.  2D. Ratios of toxigenic to non-toxigenic Aspergillus sp. fluctuate during the growing season; application of competitive fungal or bacterial strains will reduce mycotoxins in grapes/raisins. Grape/raisin samples will be taken at regular intervals in the growing season and analyzed to determine the ideal time to apply biocontrol agents against toxigenic Aspergillus. At these time points we will isolate bacteria and nontoxigenic Aspergillus sp. from raisin and soil samples and assay their ability to inhibit the growth of Aspergillus sp. If no non-toxigenic strains are not found other sources will be investigated.  3. Natural compounds and derivatives can control the growth of fungal pathogens and the production of toxins. Natural compounds will be tested for the disruption of cell wall integrity and the antioxidant pathway in fungi via genetic and physiologic analysis. We will determine the mode of action of these compounds via microarrays and other genetic tests. If we are unable to identify these compounds we will analyze other chemicals such as benzo derivatives"

Identify key genes, using transcriptome analysis of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus flavus-crop interaction that are involved in fungal growth, morphogenesis, toxin production and virulence which can be used as targets for intervention strategies.  Objective 2. Identify metabolites produced by predicted secondary metabolic gene clusters in Aspergillus flavus, characterize the molecular regulation of their biosynthesis, and determine if they contribute to the fungus’ ability to survive, colonizes host crops and produce aflatoxin.  Objective 3. Examine the role of climatic and environmental pressures on the growth, virulence, toxigenic potential, geographical distribution and aflatoxin production by Aspergillus flavus.  Approach: Aflatoxin contamination in crops such as corn, cottonseed, peanut, and tree nuts caused by Aspergillus (A.) flavus is a worldwide food safety problem. Aflatoxins are potent carcinogens and cause enormous economic losses from the destruction of contaminated crops. While biosynthesis of these toxins has been extensively studied, much remains to be determined regarding regulatory factors, their interactions and gene networks that respond to environmental cues governing fungal development and aflatoxin production. Using an –omics approach (transcriptomics, interactomics, proteomics, metabolomics), fungal genes/proteins will be identified and functionally characterized that are critical for successful host plant colonization and aflatoxin production during interaction of A. flavus with the plant. Interactions of regulatory proteins involved in fungal growth and toxin production, such as AflR and other velvet (VeA)-dependent proteins with global regulators, will be examined to elucidate novel mechanisms governing aflatoxin production and fungal morphogenesis. We will also identify and characterize the biological roles of other secondary metabolites produced by A. flavus, their impact on aflatoxin production and food safety in general. Further, we will better define the molecular mechanisms affected by physiological stress (i.e. changing environmental conditions) to the fungus and plant. We expect to utilize the fundamental knowledge gained from the proposed studies for development of targeted strategies (biological control or host-resistance) to significantly reduce pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination of crops intended for consumption by humans or animals."

Identify resistance associated protein (RAPs) genes from corn and cotton using transcriptomic analyses of the Aspergillus flavus-host plant interaction and evaluate for control of fungal growth and aflatoxin contamination.  Objective 3. Develop and evaluate transgenic corn and cotton containing over-expressed identified RAP genes (Objectives 1 and 2) or with RNA interference (RNAi)-based silencing of Aspergillus flavus genes critical to growth and aflatoxin production.

Approach: Aflatoxin contamination in crops such as corn, cottonseed, peanut, and tree nuts caused by Aspergillus (A.) flavus is a worldwide food safety problem. Aflatoxins are potent carcinogens and cause enormous economic losses from destruction of contaminated crops. Utilizing resistant germplasm against A. flavus growth and aflatoxin contamination is the most practical solution for pre-harvest control, the overall goal of this project plan. To this end, we plan to elucidate the complex, multi-genic resistance mechanisms in corn identified in resistant genotypes bred through a collaborative program. We will understand the molecular basis of seed-based resistance through transcriptomic analysis of the corn-A. flavus interaction allowing identification of genes and networks correlated with resistance for use in marker-assisted breeding. RNA interference technology will be used to a) determine the roles and contribution of selected corn genes to overall resistance; and b) to target genes critical to A. flavus growth and toxin production to generate corn varieties with enhanced resistance. Resistance genes identified from transcriptomic analysis of the A. flavus-cottonseed interaction, along with identified corn resistance genes will be over-expressed in cotton to achieve enhanced resistance. Finally, instrumentation for non-destructive, hyperspectral imaging detection will be refined and modified to address practical applications suitable for different user-specified platforms. The proposed research will result in development of cotton and corn germplasm with enhanced resistance to A. flavus growth and aflatoxin contamination. Information and material generated from this research will benefit the scientific community, stakeholder groups, food and feed safety regulatory agencies and consumers, both nationally and internationally."

Assess mutation rate in an A. flavus genome during asexual reproduction in cont  Approach: Biological control products, developed during previous projects, with atoxigenic strains of Aspergillus flavus as active ingredients have been successful at greatly reducing aflatoxin contamination of corn and peanut in commercial fields in the US and in thousands of farmer’s fields across Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Zambia, the Gambia, and Ghana. The current project seeks to improve biological control to increase both single-season and long-term aflatoxin management to provide a context for both efficient area-wide aflatoxin management and reductions in cost of biological control programs. Area-wide influences of current commercial practices utilizing atoxigenic strain biocontrol agents will be quantified with culture and DNA based techniques. Diversity among and distributions of naturally occurring atoxigenic strains of potential use in biological control products will be determined and atoxigenics will be selected and field tested for the next generation of aflatoxin prevention biocontrol products. Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) analyses will be expanded to allow better understanding of strain distribution and divergence. A worldwide SSR database for A. flavus will be developed to allow the global scientific community to identify genotypes reported in the literature and/or incorporated into biocontrol products under development around the world. Comparative genomic analysis will be performed to characterize adaptation, divergence, and the relative contributions of recombination and clonality to A. flavus community structure. The resulting information will provide improved cost effective tools for production of safe foods and feeds."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial “rhizobacteria”, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or “gaps”, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and f  Approach: Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems. Hypothesis: Dry bean genotypes interact with tillage management to affect yield performance under drought conditions.  Eight pinto bean genotypes with varying drought tolerance will be tested in a field previously sown to wheat. A split, split block with four replications with irrigation level the main plot, tillage level the split plot, and genotypes the split, split plot will be used. Irrigation will be manipulated to impose a terminal drought stress. Conventional tillage and strip tillage will treatments will both include use of a nonselective herbicide. Variables will include plant biomass, soil compaction, soil moisture, measures of plant stress and various yield components.    Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments.   Hypothesis a) Timing of herbicide application when available soil moisture and likelihood of precipitation is greater impacts weed control in chickpea.  Four herbicides will be tested at three application timings; 4 and 2 weeks prior to seeding chickpea, and post-plant, preemergence. Herbicide treatments will be replicated in a randomized complete block. Soil moisture will be monitored gravimetrically for 4 weeks after each application. Weed control and chickpea tolerance will be determined by taking weed counts and visual control ratings at 3 and 6 weeks after planting (WAP) and crop stand counts at 4 WAP, and chickpea seed yield.  Hypothesis b) Roller-packing impacts performance of pre-emergence herbicides in chickpea in dry soil conditions.  Four herbicide combinations applied post-plant, pre-emergence will be tested in chickpea with and without roller-packing. Experiments will be designed as a split block with herbicide as the main treatment and roller packer as the split treatment and each treatment replicated four times. Half of each plot will be roller-packed immediately after herbicide applications. Weed control and chickpea injury will be evaluated and visually compared to a non-treated check. Analysis of variance will be used to statistically separate treatment effects in all experiments.   Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Hypothesis: Rhizobacteria strains, soilborne pathogens and cultivar class significantly impact biological nitrogen fixation and yields of pea and chickpea genotypes.  The interactions between the root rot pathogen Fusarium solani, commercial rhizobacteria inoculants, and foliar applications of phosphorous acid, on nitrogen fixation and rhizobial colonization of the most popular dry pea cultivars grown in Washington and Idaho will be assessed in field and greenhouse trials. Plants will be evaluated for elemental content, plant height, dry shoot/root weight, root disease severity, nodulation and yield."

This falls under the standard research program area 5b.  Assessment of the impacts of genetic engineering on plant-pest interactions, including impacts on plant-pest populations . Field-evolved resistance has developed in populations of corn ear-feeding species of Lepidoptera, including the western bean cutworm (WBC). This has resulted in feeding on transgenic corn plants that express Bt toxins despite the use of the high-dose refuge (HDR) strategy in Environmental Protection Agency-mandated lepidopteran insect resistance management (IRM) plans. Aspects of plant-insect interactions may contribute to this rapid accumulation of Bt resistance among insect populations, including WBC resistance to Cry1Fa transgenic corn. The potential exists for a similar fate with the newly commercialized Vip3A toxins if current shortfalls in IRM strategies remain unaddressed. In the proposal, WBC will be used as a model for corn ear-feeding Lepidoptera. Assumptions of the HDR strategy will be addressed by Objective 1: Evaluate WBC mortality following different toxin exposures; Objective 2: Evaluate the effect of cross pollination on refuge strategies on larval survival; Objective 3: Determine instar-specific movement of WBC larvae. All Objectives will evaluate potentials for WBC survival on different toxin exposures, and determine the effects on the accumulation of resistance alleles in the WBC population. Outcomes from this proposal will provide critical data for stakeholders (e.g. Industry registrants) and governmental agencies (e.g. Environmental Protection Agency) responsible for the development and implementation of IRM plans for plant-incorporated protectants (i.e. transgenic corn)."

Insufficient irrigation and fertilization reduces yields and quality, while excess irrigation wastes increasingly scarce water, and excess fertilization can lead to contamination of groundwater, soil and air. Optimizing these management decisions is difficult given the tools typically used to manage large farms. Most decisions about irrigation and fertilizer application on farms are made on the basis of field management experience and a small number of soil and leaf samples. While soil/leaf samples can be accurate, they usually have high operational cost and limited spatial coverage, leading to sub-optimal irrigation and fertilizer application for different areas within the field. Existing commercial aerial photography efforts can provide much better spatial resolution, but are difficult to translate into recommendations for field management.We aim to develop a method for using aerial imagery at select wavelengths to provide quantitative recommendations on amounts of resources to apply, and to estimate how crop yields will be affected. To develop this method, we will start by focusing on almonds, and collect both ground and aerial data during the course of the California almond growing season over a field with a variety of irrigation and fertilization treatment blocks. We will study how our aerial measurements relate to both water/fertilizer input, as well as year end yields. This method provides an avenue for inexpensively measuring water and nutrient needs over a large area, and offers potential for maintaining or increasing yields while decreasing resource use, and reducing associated environmental impacts."

The United States enjoys the most productive and abundant supply on earth but too much of the food goes to waste  says Tom Vilsack. By reducing wasted food in landfills, we cut harmful methane emissions that fuel climate change, conserve our natural resources, and protect our planet for future generations  says EPA Administrator Gina McCarty.Food waste is the single largest component of solid waste in US landfills. The EPA estimates this amounts to 34 million tons with an extimated cost of $1.3 billion (Schwab, 2013). While there are multiple efforts to reduce and recycle food waste, only 3% is recycled (EPA, 2012). These food wastes are lost at multiple levels of the food supply and consumption chain.Therefore, it is clear that food waste is an increasing concern.The EPA has published the Food Waste Hierarchy (EPA 2012) that identifies best practices for managing food waste. After source reduction and reuse feeding hungry people, the highest recycling priority is converting food waste to animal feed. This is ahead of industrial recycling options such as anaerobic digestion, composting, and ahead of landfills.Feed is the largest single cost item for livestock and poultry production, accounting for 60% to 70% of the total cost in many years (Naylor, 2005). The demand for feed corn has been impacted by the use of corn for ethanol raising the cost of feed for livestock producers and adding to the volatility of prices.Our proposal will prove the feasibilty of diverting food waste to animal feed. This will offer hog producers a viable nutritionally beneficial alternative to corn and soybean meal.Our mobile modular food waste processor (MMFWP) is a patent pending vessel that collects food waste from food waste generators. The food wastecollected and contained in the MMFWP tank is delivered to a central location, the tank with the food waste still contained within is unloaded from the vehicle, and the tank hooked up to a heat transfer unit. Through a thermal process, the food waste is dehydrated to a level of 12% or less eliminating the potential for pathogen regrowth and allowing for a shelf life.In this thermal process, the pathogens are killed while not degrading the nutritional content of the food waste.The patent pending MMFWP has been built as a prototype and successfully operated.The goal of the proposal in Phase 1 is:1) To validate to hog producers that converting food waste to animal feed with the technology applied by the MMFWP has equivalent if not superior nutritional benefits compared to soybean meal and corn. This is critical to the business model by ensuring an outlet for the animal feed. 2) To validate that this nutritional benefit is indeed digestible by swine even after the thermal processing. Again necessary to give confidence to hog producers that the output has been proven to be an acceptable source of animal feed. This then supports the economics of the business model dependent on the feed market for the sale of the output.3) To establish the bench mark price of the output. Pricing the output is critical to building a viable commercial operation.For this proposal, arrangements have been made to collect food waste from three generators and process the food waste utilizing the MMFWP:1) Fish distributor/processor (fish waste)2) Produce distributor/processor (fruitand vegetable waste)3) Grocery store (mixed food wastes). A good representation of the heterogenity of food waste expected from generators such as restaurants andcafeterias. It will be a broad mix of waste from the deli (both hot &amp; cold), butcher department, fruits and vegetables, bakery and dairy.The proposal includes critical research performed by the the University of Minneaota Department of Animal Science under the direction of Dr. Gerald Shurson and Dr. Pedro Urriola both of whom are swine specialists.THe processed food waste (output) will be transported to the University of Minnesota Southern Research Center in Waseca, Minnesota. At this site, through established testing methods, 36 pigs will be fed the output. Targeted nutritional components will be analyzed for digestibility of the processed food waste by swine.Preliminary results from operating the MMFWP have shown the nutritional content of the output is comparable to corn and soy bean meal. With the proposed research, we will demonstrate that the processed food waste and the nutritional content of the output is also digestible by swine. This is critical in satisfying any concerns from hog producers that processed food waste can be a viable alternative to current feeding diets.The impact could be considerable:1) The University of Minnesota Department of Animal Science estimates 125 million market pigs couldbe fed on food waste (Dr. Pedro Urriola, 2015) making a significant reduction in the pressure of planting corn and soy beans for feeding these pigs.2) Food waste could now be viewed as a resource with economic benefits. Eliminating landfilling and contributing to a cleaner environment.3) Once digestibility is proven and the benchmark pricing for the output is established, the potential commercial application is promising. The MMFWP is designed to easily scale to meet the market sizes of any metro area, to easily add capacity as the supply of food waste and demand for animal feed grows. The system has a relatively low capital cost compared to current alternatives such as anaerobic digesters and composting facilities and will cost no more than a single refuse truck. Our process produces an animal feed that will be nutritionally benefical to swine and pathogen free. It will be dried to allow for a shelf life and the ability to ship to hog producers regardless of location."

With funding from the Community Food Project Grant, there will be an immediate increase of 20%-30% of the supply of fresh food during the first year into Kansas City&#39;s most impoverished neighborhoods.The center of this project is Ivanhoe; the poorest neighborhood in the Lower East Side of Kansas City, Missouri. A statistical overview of the community targeted for this project; an inner-city community of ~10,000 in the neighborhood of Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe has a density of 5,186 people per square mile. Approximately 63.8% of Ivanhoe Southwest&#39;s population has an annual household income below $25,000 which means that most residents live in low-income households. The neighborhood is 90% African-American and most of the population has only attained a high school degree, which suggests that this is a poorly-educated neighborhood. Roughly 40% of the land in Ivanhoe is vacant or abandoned.This Community Food Project is to help Good Natured Market overcome obstacles in order to get as much healthy, local food as possible into homes in Kansas City&#39;s vulnerable communities through increased food inventory, site improvements, promotion, EBT incentives and memberships. This initiative will directly lead to significant, measurable sales increases. This program is vitally significant because it addresses a problem that is plaguing inner-cities throughout the United States.Inner-cities have very few grocery stores; what is still the only source of food is the local convenience store. The only thing convenient about it is the location. There are very few healthy items you can buy at such stores, usually a few loaves of white bread, milk, and eggs. Limited access to affordable quality fresh food in many urban areas all over American has increased the problem of childhood obesity and diabetes. There is a direct link to the startling numbers of childhood obesity, juvenile diabetes, as well as diabetes developed in adults years later, after growing up in food deserts. In 2004 study from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found, $1 could buy 1,200 calories of potato chips and 875 calories of soda, but only 250 calories of vegetables and 170 calories of fresh fruit. This is why we must look at accessibility and affordability if we want to change what people are eating in the urban areas.Good Natured Family Farms, the workhorse extention of the 501(c)(3) Kansas City Food Hub (AKA The Food Conservancy) is vastly experienced in providing healthy, local food to Kansas City residents, specifically minorities and low-income persons. Effective relationships, partnerships, and strategic use of federal and private foundation grant funds for worthy causes have led GNFF&#39;s small-farm, marketing alliance of over 150 farmer members to become a premier provider of local, healthy food to vulnerable populations.Additionally, GNFF has pioneered a nationally-recognized Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) pilot and many other food-related projects. GNFF&#39; mission is to support local farmers and to provide access of wholesome, fresh food to needy populations. As such, GNFF has developed many strong, working relationships and linkages with community-focused organizations in the Kansas City region; a few examples: Bistro Kids and Treat America to bring fresh, wholesome foods to kids, University of Missouri, Beans&amp;Greens, Menorah Legacy Society, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, United States Department of Agriculture, Ball&#39;s Food (Hen House and Price Chopper stores), Sysco Food Distribution, and many more.What will be interesting to note and track during this project&#39;s time period:  To what degree will making fresh food more available and affordable in inner-city communities change the food choices of this targeted population?  The year-end evaluation, which includes a customer survey, plus sales tracking from the upgraded scanning computer, will help to enlighten us in this query.The Final Report will include significant data collected throughout the year on how better eating habits are linked to fresh food availability and affordability - and the effectiveness of using a clergy coalition in promoting and encouraging its inner-city parishioners to use Good Natured Market&#39;s generous EBT incentives for fresh food."

However, one of the major limitations for feeding high-forage rations is decreased milk production and nutrient use efficiency and increased outputs of nitrogen (e.g.,N2O in manure) and carbon (as enteric CH4) to the environment. On the other hand, energy-dense forages may improve the balance and synchrony of water soluble carbohydrates and nitrogen release in the rumen of dairy cows, while increasing organic matter digestibility ultimately reducing nitrogen and methane outputs to the environment. Perennial legumes and grasses grown in mixtures and selected to increase forage quality via energy-dense stored feeds (e.g., baleage) have strong potential to increase milk production and decrease greenhouse gas emissions of dairy farms transitioning to organic agriculture. However, the feasibility of maintaining species composition within legume-grass mixtures throughout the growing season during multiple cropping years remains to be determined. It is also unknown how microbial fermentation impacts the energy to nitrogen ratio of legume-grass mixtures when they are harvested as stored feeds. This project will fill these knowledge gaps by advancing the scientific understanding about how potential changes in species persistence and forage botanical composition in various legume-grass mixtures across multiple years affect forage quality and stored feed fermentation characteristics and, consequently, milk production and greenhouse gases emissions when fed to organic dairy cows. Through this project, we will partner with three organic dairy farmers in the Northeast who will set up demonstration plots and coordinate field days, thus becoming peer leaders in their rural communities. With guidance and evaluation provided by a Research and Extension Advisory Board, we will enhance learning opportunities among other organic dairy farmers, researchers, educators, and general public via workshops, field days, social media, newsletters, and webinars."

Pecan is recently domesticated, as commercial orchards were first planted in the late 1800s. It is successfully farmed in areas as diverse as the deserts of the southwestern US, the humid southeastern US, California&#39;s Central Valleys, the Southern Plains, and is substantially planted worldwide (Grauke et al., 2011). Growing regions within the U.S. are diverse, with farmers in each region facing major and unique horticultural issues. The horticultural issues to be addressed by genetic tool development include flowering, severe alternate bearing, disease susceptibility, salinity stress, drought stress tolerance, and micronutrient uptake insufficiencies. Project long-term goals are to increase pecan nutmeat yield and quality, optimize nutritional value, and subsequent stabilization of pecan markets by improving crop major limiting characteristics for all U.S. pecan farming regions. The objectives are focused to elucidate the genetics of these crop characteristics. Genetic variation within the species allows for differential adaptation in wide ranges of environments; thus, unraveling the genetics of several genotypes will allow for identification of genes controlling specific traits. Obtained data will allow development of vital genetic tools necessary for increasing understanding of regional adaptation, promoting conservation, and selecting improved cultivars/rootstocks for all major farming regions. All sectors of the industry will benefit--i.e., nurseries, producers, nutmeat marketers, consumers, and the interdisciplinary research community. The knowledge and tools generated will be available on public websites and disseminated to growers, nurseries, commercial marketers, consumers, and researchers.Pecan, a Native American Algonquin word describing a  nut requiring a stone to crack  (Trumball, 1872), is North America&#39;s most economically valuable native tree nut. Its cultivation impacts farmers and farm communities across the southern U.S. As an only-recently domesticated crop species, the development of genetic tools is essential for effectively addressing key constraints to stable and high quality nutmeat production. As the pecan industry has evolved since its inception in the late 1800s, trees have been introduced as an exotic crop to be farmed in relatively alien environments, and this has led to major stress-associated horticultural problems either directly or indirectly altering flowering and alternate bearing. The identification of genetic elements controlling key traits, such as efficient nutrient uptake/transport, scab disease resistance, salinity tolerance, drought tolerance, and nut quality need identification and integration to produce better adapted cultivars for cultivation. Identification of these underlying genetic elements and subsequent development of genetic markers associated with specific traits potentially influences the economics of pecan farming and marketing. Development of trees better suited for specific environments will yield quantitatively and qualitatively superior nutmeats and require less input by growers. This would increase the economic fitness of pecan growers while also enabling more environmentally friendly/sustainable pecan horticulture. Through our research and outreach efforts, the goal of this project is to discover and implement science-based solutions resulting in a stable supply of high-quality pecans over time. This will be of enormous benefit to all sectors of the U.S. pecan industry, from producers to processors and ultimately to consumers and rural communities throughout much of the US.We will use trans-disciplinary approaches to build genetic tools that the pecan industry recognizes as essential for their success. Research institutions include New Mexico State University (1862 land grant/Hispanic serving), University of Arizona, University of Georgia, The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, HudsonAlpha, USDA-ARS Southern Regional Research Center (New Orleans, LA), USDA-ARS Pecan Breeding and Genetics/National Collection of Genetic Resources for Pecans and Hickories (College Station, TX), and USDA-ARS Southeastern Fruit and Tree Nut Research Laboratory (Byron, GA). This trans-disciplinary research group contains the following expertise: plant genetics, plant molecular biology, pecan tissue culture, plant pathology, pecan breeding, pecan horticulture, soil science, agricultural economics, computer science, and outreach/extension. A panel advisory group has also been created that will include agricultural consultants, producers with large- and small-scale pecan orchards, pecan shellers, and nurserymen. The simplified goals of this proposal are 1. To evaluate the genetics that controls the diversity of native pecan. This will be done by obtaining genomic sequences, annotation of the genes, developing linkage maps and SNP markers; 2. Evaluate the molecular mechanisms of flowering, disease resistance, and tolerance to stresses; and 3. Build a designated database/website that will be available to share data and impact of the research with all sectors of the pecan industry."

Research in plant breeding, genetics, genomics and other methods improve cropcharacteristics (80%).a. Product taste, quality and appearance, b. Environmental responses and tolerances, d. Pest and disease management, including resistance to pests and disease resulting in reduced application management strategies. We will investigate the feasibility of R gene pyramiding for durable resistance.2. Identify and address threats from pests and diseases (20%). The proposed work includes the use of molecular markers to investigate genetic diversity among isolates of Anisogramma anomala, the causal fungus of eastern filbert blight (EFB). We will also collect Corylus germplasm, evaluate accessions for response to EFB inoculation, and study the inheritance of resistance from our native Corylus americana.Note that production is the primary system, although components address the consumer and markets system (human nutrition and health, vitality of rural communities).Critical stakeholder needs addressed and long-term goals. Hazelnuts are a profitable, high-value, low input, sustainable crop for which steadily increasing world demand now exceeds supply and stakeholders (from producers through consumers) show a significant desire for expanded US production. However, susceptibility to eastern filbert blight (EFB) caused by the fungus Anisogramma anomala and the limited climatic adaptation of existing cultivars severely limit production in the eastern and Midwestern regions and threaten the sustainability of current production in Oregon. The genetic resources and knowledge to overcome these limiting factors now exist. This SREP  Center of Excellence  project leverages substantial resources and prior investments to develop genomic tools for hazelnut (Approach 1), study gene expression following EFB inoculation (Approach 2), map dominant R genes and study R gene Genomic tools, genetic resources, and outreach to expand commercial U.S. hazelnut production - 7 pyramids and resistance in Corylus americana (Approach 3), enhance Corylus americana germplasm collections (Approach 4), improve knowledge of the pathogen A. anomala (Approach 5), identify superior cultivars and pollenizers (Approach 6), and bolster and implement strategic, coordinated outreach efforts (Approach 7) to address these limiting factors in a targeted, effective, and comprehensive way with longterm goals that include: a) the expanded planting of hazelnut as a food crop, b) the development of new economic options for producers and entrepreneurs, and c) the improvement of national food security by enhancing crop, farm system, and product diversity, adaptation to climatic fluctuations, and improved disease resistance.Outreach plan. Our outreach plan (Approach 7, pg. 27) will directly engage new and existing stakeholder groups and address stakeholder concerns and needs that are related but vary across three climatic zones: the Pacific Northwest where commercial production now exists and is rapidly expanding; the temperate  Fruit Belt  region of the eastern US, where new EFB-resistant cultivars are expected to be released in 3-4 years; and the Midwest and Great Plains, where new hybrids are in the process of being identified with superior nut quality, yield, and adaptation to demanding climates. We will use comprehensive, coordinated, and innovative high-touch, high-tech outreach approaches for education and training activities in the three regions bolstered by demonstration trials and new cooperator field trials, including field tours and  edutainment  events, social media campaigns, stakeholder trainings, and webinars, with publications and presentations focused on the translation of new knowledge and practical applications to engage new and existing local, regional, and national partner stakeholder groups. The Oregon industry has many newcomers who need educational programs. In the Fruit Belt, an emphasis will be placed on  train-the-trainer  meetings early in the project to rapidly disseminate knowledge in support of the first cultivar releases for the region (to be made during this grant period). Targeted, comprehensive, and coordinated national outreach efforts will also be made through the PI institution&#39;s web resources and social media, including the Arbor Day Foundation&#39;s extensive national membership and related partner connections via their educational website devoted to hybrid hazelnuts and a print newsletter that reaches one million people per year, and a hybrid hazelnut membership program with 80,000 members.Potential economic, social, and environmental benefits. Extensive and strong national/international markets (currently $3.26 billion) exist for hazelnut products and powerful environmental and economic benefits (for producers and rural communities) would be generated by large-scale production of hybrid hazelnuts in the US. Hazelnuts are an ideal choice to integrate into profitable, sustainable agricultural or agroforestry production systems, and are family-friendly for small producers focused on local food issues. Hazelnuts could become a  third crop  in the Midwest and Great Plains (along with corn and soybeans), and have considerable value as a specialty crop in eastern states (Fruit Belt region). Environmental benefits of hazelnut production include reduced runoff and soil erosion, enhanced water quality, relatively few inputs of fertilizers and pesticides, improved wildlife habitats, and increased carbon sequestration - impacts that benefit farm families and residents of both rural and urban communities. Further, they can be grown without irrigation in many regions and do not require bees for pollination. Hazelnut kernels are widely recognized for their health promoting effects, have a long storage life, and have robust local-to-international markets for a variety of value-added products. The economic potential of hazelnut is documented by Oregon&#39;s annual acreage increase (3,000 acres since 2009), world annual production (870,000 metric tons/year), the wholesale price/pound of dry, unshelled nuts ($1.70) and the world annual hazelnut revenue ($3.26 billion). Across the central states, many producers looking to diversify their operations beyond corn and soybeans have shown intense interest in hazelnuts. Ten-year average yields of superior selections grown in field trials in NE indicate that net returns from hybrid hazelnuts will likely compete very well with or exceed returns from agronomic crops."

High-tunnel production is characterized by increased productivity, but due to intense cultivation strategies, high tunnels pose many challenges for sustainability, soil health, and environmental quality. The long term goal for this integrated project (Research, Education), based on extensive feedback from growers, is to develop a comprehensive and economically viable model to address soil health issues in high tunnels across a wide geographic reach, resulting in increased adoption of practices such as legume cover crop incorporation that promotes sustainable management of organic high tunnels and financial stability for farmers. We propose to evaluate a range of farmer-selected rotations in three distinct regions ranging from the far north to the south, build a predictive understanding of soil quality management and economics of season extension, and facilitate knowledge exchange via University coursework, organic information clearinghouses (hightunnels.org, eOrganic), and community partners (NGOs), with a focused emphasis on limited-resource farmers and historically underrepresented groups. We will develop three organic agriculture course modules, a hands-on short course addressing issues and applicability of high tunnels for limited-resource growers, a mobile nutrient management phone app, and a webinar series. We will also work closely with NRCS&#39; new Division of Soil Health to connect to existing resources, network farmers, and expand resources via our project results. Our project is designed to have far-reaching implications for how farmers manage their high tunnels for optimal soil health and economic returns."

Cereal production, however, is threatened by wireworms, a group of insects that feed voraciously belowground. Most growers manage wireworms with prophylactic seed treatments of neonicotinoid insecticides because few other options are available. Our goal is to evaluate alternative integrated pest management (IPM) tactics for wireworms in cereal crops that would allow growers to reduce their use of prophylactic seed-applied neonicotinoids in cereal crops. We will achieve three complementary objectives: (1) Investigate the use of entomopathogenic pathogens as a complement or replacement to neonicotinoid seed treatments in wheat and barley crops; (2) Examine whether the use of pesticides in rotational legume crops provides benefits for wireworm control in subsequent cereal crops; and (3) Develop an extension program focused on wireworms. Overall, our project will develop new tactics for wireworms that are cost-effective and targeted for specific species and environmental conditions. Our research could have broad applicability beyond cereals as the resurgence of wireworms is a matter of national concern, with over 45 crops affected. Our project addresses three CPPM Focus Areas: (1)  Plant Protection Tactics  (by developing IPM tactics for a major crop pest); (2)  Diversified IPM Systems  (by evaluating IPM strategies that integrate biological, cultural, and insecticidal controls); and (3)  Developing the Next Generation of IPM Scientists  (by training two MS students in IPM tactics and extension)."

There are no cost effective tools available for monitoring burrower bug populations, and the only factors known to influence infestation levels are soil moisture and tillage practices. The objectives of this project are: 1) to create and facilitate adoption of a burrower bug risk assessment tool that uses site-specific environmental and cultural factors to estimate risk of damage; and 2) to develop a semiochemical-based trap for monitoring burrower bug populations that can be used to inform pest management decision making.

The project addresses the CPPM focus areas of  Plant Protection Tactics and Tools  and  Diversified IPM Systems . Key project personnel have research expertise in semiochemical discovery and application, applied ecology and IPM.

Many organic produce farms are diverse, based on the notion that crop diversity increases ecosystem services such as pollination. However, while crop diversity often correlates with bee diversity, the relationship between crop diversity and pollination services remains largely untested. In this proposal we propose two objectives to assess whether farm diversity promotes pollination: (1) determine the effect of crop diversity on pollination services and (2) develop a citizen science program to assess whether plant diversity increases pollinator diversity and function. Our project stems from two years of cooperation with an engaged group of organic farmers in western WA. To achieve the first objective, we will compare pollination services in experimental mesocosms containing a single crop (runner bean) to those containing the Three Sisters polyculture system (runner bean, corn, and zucchini). To achieve the second objective, we will work with a network of 40 citizen scientists to evaluate bee diversity and pollination services on diversified compared with low-diversity organic farms in western WA. Our project will provide insight into whether farmers can directly increase pollination services provided by wild bees by diversifying the crops grown on their farms. If so, it would provide an incentive for organic farmers to transition away from monoculture-based production systems. Accordingly, our project aligns with the USDA AFRI goal of Increasing Agricultural and Natural Resource Sustainability while addressing the Plant Health and Production foundational area and the Food Security challenge area."

The management practices that farmers feel they must adopt in response to intensifying pressures may result in unintended impacts on the viability, sustainability, and resilience of their farms. Yet the current prevalence and costs of on-farm food safety practices are largely unknown.This project will fill this knowledge gap by studying:Which practices, specifically, do farmers use in response to food safety pressures?How and why do the practices used in response to food safety pressures differ among farmers?How much time and money do these practices cost farmers?How do practices intended to improve food safety impact farmers&#39; sustainability goals?These questions will be addressed through site visits, surveys and interviews with produce farmers in four California regions. As a leader in fruit, nut and vegetable agriculture--and food safety reform--California is an ideal location for this study. Lessons learned here can illuminate opportunities for broader synergy between AFRI&#39;s priority to improve food safety, nutrition and health and its priorities to sustain rural communities and the environment. Specifically, results will inform more sustainable and equitable food safety policy; support the ongoing development of strategies to co-manage food safety and environmental protection; and identify which agricultural communities are most in need of training and outreach support for food safety and conservation."

Recent nectar-inhabiting microorganisms have been found to be important mediators of plant-pollinator interactions with consequences for plant reproduction in native systems. Their diversity and role in mediating pollination services in agricultural systems however are less known. Moreover, pests and pathogens that impact crop quality and yield often challenge agricultural systems. To combat these pressures, agrochemicals such as fungicides are used to minimize damage and loss, which can have unintended ecological consequences for non-target beneficial organisms. Assessment of ecological risk of agrochemical usage has tended to focus on beneficial macroorganisms such as pollinators or predators of crop pests, with less attention paid to beneficial microorganisms. Here, I propose to fill this gap by examining the impact of alternative crop management practices on microbial diversity and draw links between diversity and ecosystem services in an economically important, crop system.This research will address the AFRI Foundational Area of Plant Health and Production and Plant Products by examining the impact of land-use practices on microbial mediation of plant-pollinator interactions in almond, Prunus dulcis. Almond is a mass-flowering, varietally self-incompatible crop that is highly dependent on pollinators for reproduction and has nectar that is colonized by microrganisms. Specifically, I will address the following three objectives: (i) Characterize the impact of alternative crop management practices (organic vs. conventional) on the community ecology of nectar-inhabiting microbes (NIMs) associated with almond. (ii) Experimentally test interactive effects of agrochemicals and shifts in NIM community structure on almond resource quality and detection by pollinators. And finally, (iii) experimentally test direct and indirect pathways through which management practices affect ecosystem services and almond production. Experimental manipulation of microbe presence and identity, coupled with analysis of microbial-induced changes in nectar chemistry, will allow me to identify their potential effects on almond production, quality, and the mechanisms involved. Taken together, results from these experiments will inform integrated management of microbial interactions, both beneficial and harmful, which can affect yield in an economically-important agricultural system, almond."

Because polyploids have two genomes (called subgenomes) within a single nucleus, highly similar loci between sub genomes mask the more informative polymorphisms between different genotypes. There is currently not a bioinformatics tool that addresses this issue for researchers of polyploid crops. Development of pipelines, that are simple to use, and are designed specifically for polyploids will greatly improve the speed and efficacy that researchers can make discoveries. These discoveries can be deployed immediately in breeding programs for the use in crop improvement and release of new disease and stress tolerant, highly productive cultivars. This project addresses the Foundational Program Area, Plant health and production and plant products, and the Challenge Areas, Food Safety and Food Security. Previously, a pipeline utilizing a novel method for variant detection in allopolyploids, SWEEP, was designed and released. Its development resulted quickly in many advancements for the global peanut community, including the design of a 60K SNP array from elite tetraploid genotypes. Despite the early success, improvements can be made. The false positive rate (identifying false polymorphisms as true), although improved, is still too high.Objective 1 will be to develop a new pipeline for polyploid variant detection. This new pipeline will include functionality to use one command to perform an entire analysis, with the end product being a marker matrix of genotypes. Objective 2 will be to develop an add-on module that performs a complete QTL-seq analysis. This module will be benchmarked by using QTL-seq on a peanut RIL population segregating for white mold (Sclerotinia spp) resistance. White mold is the number one pest to Southeastern US peanut production. The expected outcome of this research is to release freely a tool to the community that can be used to accurately identify variants in polyploids and to use different methods for mapping and discovery (e.g. re-sequencing, or QTL-seq). All functionality of this tool will be done with one simple command and the user will be given control to modify all parameters of analysis. Additionally, markers linked to white mold resistance will be identified that can be deployed in marker-assisted breeding programs. Ultimately, the outcome of this research will be to make available the power of next generation sequencing-based genotyping to all polyploid researchers for the rapid and efficient crop improvement."

Corn is the most important crop in the USA and globally. Drought stress is the most important limitation for corn production in the USA and globally, and drought stress is expected to become more severe in coming decades as a result of global climate change. We have observed that corn lines with a large number of small vessels perform better under drought. In this project we will confirm and extend these results, and also identify genes that are responsible for this natural variation.Defining and understanding traits improving the drought tolerance of crops is needed to breed crop varieties with better yield, better drought tolerance, and less reliance on irrigation. Insufficient information exists regarding the value of xylem vessels in crop breeding. Should the importance of xylem vessels for drought tolerance be demonstrated, an entirely new tool will be available for targeted crop improvement. This project will provide validated breeding targets, germplasm sources, molecular markers, and candidate genes that could be used directly in maize breeding. Our close collaboration with maize geneticists will ensure that any useful results will be readily applied in the maize community. While this project focuses on maize, xylem vessels may also be useful breeding targets in wheat, rice, legumes, and other crops.

Identification of more effective markers for the physiological traits is imperative to further mitigate stress and develop stress tolerant cultivars. Our hypothesis is that an integrated approach of plant physiological analysis and marker-assisted selection is a highly-efficient approach to improve biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in peanut. We propose new high throughput technologies including a field-scale infra-red thermography and unmanned aerial systems for canopy temperature and hyperspectral-derived vegetation indices, and LiDAR on carriage for canopy architecture estimations along with the development of DNA-based single nucleotide polymorphism marker for selection of phenotypic responses to environmental stress. The uniqueness in the diversity of environments this proposal covers, representing all major peanut growing areas in the U.S., warrants the discovery and refining of suitable physiological and molecular approaches for the entire U.S. peanut production and breeding."

These forage crops respond to rather high rates of fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, and near monoculture stands of these grasses have often been maintained. Economics, environmental concerns, and less-predictable weather patterns combine to indicate a need for enhanced options for perennial forage crops in the region, even though these perennial forage crops have represented superior conservation options on erosive and marginal soils of the region for decades. Natural ecosystems have been used to suggest that biodiversity can be used to enhance sustainable production and ecosystem services from such agricultural enterprises as forage crops. It is ascertained from previous research that combinations of species are complementary in their pattern of resource use and can increase productivity and nutrient retention but plant species diversity in forage crop production has not been well explored.The research conducted under this proposal will determine the feasibility of introducing plant diversity into warm-season perennial grass systems to enhance soil properties and subsequent herbage production. Annual cool-season species will be over-seeded (no-till or minimum-till planting) into a warm-season perennial sod each fall. The over-seeded crops will include species from several plant functional groups such as grass, legume and brassica. Species within each functional group will be planted separately and in combination with other functional groups. Herbage production will be monitored through the growing season using a relatively frequent and relatively infrequent harvest schedule. Another management strategy allowing the over-seeded crop to grow full season and then mulching will also be employed. Measured herbage mass will be analyzed for nutrient characteristics. Chemical, physical and biological soil parameters will be monitored through lab analyses of soil samples collected periodically during the study. Results from this study will provide insight into the potential for these management strategies to possibly enhance herbage production and soil function. Rangeland and permanent pasture production based on ecological processes with reduced dependence on chemical inputs has tremendous potential to enhance sustainability of the regions overall agriculture. The production systems evaluated in these studies could potentially contribute broader scale ecosystem benefits ranging from wildlife habitat, pollinator habitat, water quality protection, and rural recreation plus income diversification in some single-crop production areas."

However, the efficacy of RNAi against insect pests feeding on plant sap is poor for reasons that are not fully understood. This project will optimize the RNAi constructs to maximize delivery from the plant to the insect, particularly to the individual insect cells where the RNAi functions to suppress gene expression. We will, first, determine the importance of the length of orally-delivered RNAi molecules (&gt; 200 nt vs 21nt) for effective gene expression knock-down in aphid and whitefly pests. We will also identify candidate insect RNAi suppressor genes by a genome-scale association study between genetic variation in pea aphids and RNAi-responsiveness; and then validate these genes by stacking RNAi against the candidate gene with essential insect genes. Building on preliminary evidence that RNAi against suppressor genes substantially improves RNAi efficacy, this project will provide a qualitative advance in RNAi against phloem-feeding aphids and whiteflies, and can be adapted readily to other key phloem-feeding pests, notably psyllids, coccids, leafhoppers and planthoppers."

They are different from the majority of plant species because they have beneficial associations with a particular type of bacteria in their roots. These bacteria (from the genus Rhizobium) are capable of converting atmospheric nitrogen to a form that plants can use through a process called nitrogen fixation. When the plants die, some of this additional nitrogen is returned to the soil leading to higher soil fertility. Farmers have known this for years: they rotate nitrogen-fixing and non-fixing species in their fields to improve crop and fiber production. However, the ability to access additional nitrogen through these bacteria has a cost. Plants give the bacteria sugar in exchange for this nitrogen. Some legume species (facultative fixers) have the ability to terminate the bacterial colonies when they are growing in fertile soil, which allows the plant to use that sugar for other functions like growth and reproduction. Some legume species (obligate fixers) cannot adjust the relationship with their bacterial partners and this may have wide-reaching effects on leaf and root physiology. This project will identify legume species with facultative and obligate fixation strategies and examine how fixation strategy relates to a number of leaf and root physiological processes. Facultative fixers, by optimally regulating fixation to match nutritional demand, should align more with current models of leaf economics and plant carbon gain than obligate fixers and have higher performance under conditions of high soil fertility. Twenty-four legume species will be grown in a greenhouse setting and a suite of leaf, root, and plant-level traits will be measured. Obligate fixers should have lower rates of photosynthesis and growth and higher root respiratory costs. Understanding how nitrogen fixation strategies influence plant performance has strong implications for agriculture and agroforestry by paving the way for genetic improvements to maximize productivity by improving the efficiency of nitrogen use by legumes. This project will also train high school and undergraduate students through hands-on research, which may increase their success in science courses and lead to careers in science."

Aflatoxin causes liver cancer in humans and in a variety of animal species, and it has been associated with childhood stunting; an important public health issue that increases vulnerability to infectious diseases and cognitive impairments. It is estimated that 5 billion people worldwide are at risk of aflatoxin exposure. Prediction and control of aflatoxin contamination is a fundamental challenge for US grain industry, poultry producers, and makers of dairy products. The production of aflatoxin is highly dependent on environmental conditions and it is projected that environmental perturbations due to climate change will result in a significant increase in aflatoxin contamination incidents, further aggravating its economic impact. The lack of a systematic approach to determine the distribution of aflatoxin occurrence before harvest adversely affects the grain industry.The goal of this proposal is to develop a general predictive modeling framework for calculating aflatoxin occurrence in US crop fields before harvest, and package this knowledge in a user-friendly predictive web/mobile interface for generating nation-wide and real-time aflatoxin hazard maps. This has the potential to change certain behaviors in crop management to improve food safety (lower levels of aflatoxin) such as providing valuable information of when and where to test for aflatoxin before harvest, reducing the amount of chemicals used to grow the crops, determining the best time to harvest, as well as indicating the cornfield areas with the highest contamination levels for grain segregation. The mathematical foundation and the proposed software tool are generally applicable to any type of mycotoxin and crop. While hazard maps for aflatoxin and other mycotoxin occurrence are important to crop producers, they are also of interest to consumers, regulators, and insurers to enhance their decision-making process. Furthermore, the presence of mycotoxins in agricultural run-offs is a critical issue in environmental sustainability and ecological physiology of various land and aquatic ecosystems. Hence, the approach to be developed will be of relevance to a broader community beyond the agricultural community."

Whereas most food allergies are outgrown, only 10% and 20 % of those with tree nut and peanut allergy will outgrow it. The only recourse of an allergic patient is avoidance. One complicating factor is that people with peanut and tree nut allergy are also often allergic to other nuts and seeds. Therefore, due to the lack of reliable diagnostic tests, allergists often advise a peanut or tree nut allergic patient to avoid all nuts. The gold standard for diagnosis is Double Blind Placebo-Controlled Food Challenge (DBPCFC), but this procedure is lengthy, laborious and potentially dangerous to perform even in a hospital setting. For years doctors have wanted to have an unambiguous test that would obviate any type of Oral Food Challenge (OFC). While skin prick test, allergen-specific IgE measurement such as (i.e.ImmunoCap) and component resolved-diagnosis measure sensitivity (presence of IgE in the absence of clinical reactivity) and can assist in diagnosis, none are independently or completely reliable. We hypothesize that there are combinations of specific IgE and or IgG4-binding peptides (epitopes), or combinations of peptides with intact allergens that are completely diagnostic of an allergic reaction. The goal of this project is to develop an IgE and IgG4 based, completely reliable in vitro assay for peanut/tree nut allergy. To accomplish this IgE and IgG4 epitopes will be identified using protein and custom-made peptide microchip arrays and clinically-characterized sera. We will use a combination of peptide and intact allergens to develop and test a new and improvedmicrochip assay for immediate commercialization."

Fresh produce production has risen due to consumer demands for healthier diets, however it has also increased the risk of produce related foodborne disease. Food safety concerns with fresh produce arise from the fact that it is typically consumed raw, and lacks a  kill  step to eliminate pathogens prior to consumption. The critical preventive control step for fresh produce including tree fruit is the sanitizing wash water systems. The implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) requires proper validation and verification of any preventive controls. On-site validation of tree fruit wash water systems is nearly impossible, as actual pathogens pose contamination dangers, good indicator organisms are lacking, and natural pathogen contamination is too rare and inconsistent for effective validation. However, with the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) we can now explore the entire bacterial communities of tree fruit at greater depth, and target the entire population to create an effective bacterial index for validating the efficacy of wash water systems. This project will determine if the bacterial communities of three types of tree fruits (apples, peaches and navel oranges) are consistent enough for the development of an effective validation and verification procedure. In the long-term this Seed Project will result in the development of a rapid process control for on-site validation of tree fruit wash water systems, and modeled for other fresh produce validation systems in the future."

Grain legumes are typically grown in rotation with cereal grains, including wheat and corn. This rotation is advantageous for multiple reasons. Studies suggest that it may disrupt the life-cycle of diverse pathogens, while promoting symbiosis with rhizobacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia which benefits legume roots. Grain legumes also complement the nutritional qualities of small cereal grains. U.S. agriculture currently generates 18.2M cwt of dry pea and 2.5M cwt of chickpea annually, with the northern states leading in production volume. Given the increasing global demand for vegetable protein that will be needed in coming years, the U.S. is well-positioned to establish itself as an even larger exporter of these crops with successful breeding programs. In the last two decades, advancements in DNA sequencing and molecular technologies have significantly improved plant breeding. Phenotyping is a key adjunct to these genomics approaches, which allows for thorough evaluation of desirable plant traits and confident se-lection of high-performing breeding lines that can be widely distributed. Unfortunately, the capacity for high-throughput plant phenotyping is non-existent due to the lack of applicable sensing and automation technologies that are well-established and able to be implemented into breeding programs. Therefore, a critical need exists to develop sensor-based approaches for high-throughput crop phenotyping that rapidly and accurately assess breeding materials and bring this important analysis into the 21st century. The overall goal of this research is to develop novel and advanced sensing tools that enable accurate and unbiased plant phenotyping at a rapid pace using grain legume as a target crop. Besides being important for sustainable cereal crop production through efficient rotation, such efforts will ultimately result in improved selection of high yielding legume crop varieties that can be grown in the U.S. In addition, these phenotyping techniques can be easily adapted to other crops."

However, control failures are prevalent and have been attributed to sub-optimal timing of fungicides with the onset of flowering. This project aims to reduce crop loss (optimize disease control) for white mold in snap beans by improved detection of spectral and structural signatures associated with disease severity related to flower phenology and canopy architecture and density, respectively. The effect of canopy density on white mold severity will be modeled to develop a site-specific disease risk model to facilitate reduced fungicide usage when not economically justified. Hyperspectral imagery and lidar data will be obtained using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to fully capture the benefits of precision agriculture for applied agronomic outcomes. Outcomes will be immediately available for adoption by industry and growers using currently available sensors and UAS. Dissemination of research findings is ensured through our partnership with Cornell Cooperative Extension.

Nearly 90% of flowering plant species and 75% of our global agricultural crops use pollinators to set seed and produce fruit (Klein, et al. 2016; Ollerton, et al. 2011). Importantly, these fruit, vegetable, and nut crops provide the micronutrients we need in our diets to support active and healthy lifestyles (Chaplin-Kramer, et al. 2014; Ellis, et al. 2011). However, populations of pollinators, including both managed and wild bees are in decline, which has promoted scientists, policymakers and the public to evaluate factors causing these declines and deveo-p new approaches to conserve and promote pollinators (Evans, 2015; Grozinger, 2015). The plight of the polllinators serves as an outstanding framework that teachers can use to help their students understand how their food is produced, how agricultural systems can be designed to be sustainable, the importance of ecosystems services, how biodiversity contributes to these processes, and how the concerns of citizens can help shape agricultural policy. Furthermore, because the issues associated with pollinator declines and their contributions to agriculture are so broad, the associated research efforts are equally broad, integrating mulutiple fields and levels of biology. Thus, this topic can serve as a platform for teaching students about the wealth of scientific approaches and perspectives used in agricultural sciences.Current K-12 STEM education standards (NGSS) expect teachers to use the practices of scientists and engineers to teach core disciplinary ideas and cross-cutting concepts (Duschl, et al 2007; NRC, 2012; Lead States, 2013). A challenge to this reform is the lack of exposure to authentic research environment of most K-12 science teachers. The practices are often oversimplified as a  Scientific Method  and are operationalized in classrooms as a stepwise, linear process done by individual investigators (Windschitl et al. 2008). One method for providing teachers with first-hand insight into how research is performed is via summer teacher research experiences in which a teacher spends 5-6 weeks working in the lab of a researcher on a small component of the lab&#39;s overall research. Studies on immersion programs have shown the persistence of the concept of one true scientific method (Bell, et al 2003), rather an understanding of the dynamic, systems nature of authenticresearch, and few teachers showing changes in their teaching practice (Sadler, et al 2010).Furthermore, not many teachers are able to devote a large segment of their sumers to PD. Finally, such programs are costly, generally requiring $5,000 stipends per teacher per experience at a minimum and require a long term commitment by graduate students, post docs and/or faculty to mentor the teachers during the research experience. While abbreviated experiences require less time and cost, they still focus on a norrowly defined problem related to a small segment of the lab&#39;s overall research plan. The APPL-RED program takes a different approach, one that uses a workshop format to address content and issues associated with the overall research program of a research group and prepares teachers to engage their students in classrooom research projects that parallel the research group&#39;s research. Also, a consistent thread throughout the APPL-RED program is systems thinking appliedtonatural and man-made systems, and to the research process itself.The APPL-RED educational program brings together the strengths of Penn State&#39;s Center for Pollinator Research (CPR) and Center for Science and the Schools (CSATS). By incorporating a multitude of hands-on activities, active engagement in research projects, and site visits to apiaries, entomological museums and research farms, teachers will develop a systems-level understanding of the role of pollinators in sustainable agricultural systems, learn how researchers investigate these issues, participate in elements of the overall research process, and learn how to translate their learning to their students via classroom research projects associated with the research of PIs at the CPR. Middle schooland high school teachersserving rural and urban school districts will be prepared for student engagement in research through summer and academic year workshops at Penn State, followed by visits to selected schools by the PIs and their graduate students to support implementation of research projects and evaluate the outcomes of the programs. Teachers will also have the opportunity to serve as leaders by training other teachers in their school districts. Additionally, we will foster local interactions between teachers and extension specialists and volunteers from the Pennsylvania Master Gardener&#39;s Program, to help support educators and students in their efforts.

However, only 10% of Missouri&#39;s calf crop are finished in the state, representing a loss of 1.0 billion dollars. A goal of Governor Nixon&#39;s 2015 Agriculture Initiative is to retain some of this value in Missouri. Profitability of beef production in Missouri can also be enhanced by management strategies that optimize nitrogen use. Methods to increase nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) include adding supplemental feed or forage legumes and utilizing cattle management practices that evenly distribute excreta across the pasture.The NUE of beef and forage production will be studied in two separate experiments conducted during 2017 and 2018. Experiments in northeast Missouri will study the addition of sunn hemp, a warm season forage legume on productivity of stocker-cattle production, while experiments in southwest Missouri will study the role of supplemental feed on grass-based cattle finishing systems. Results from the two studies will be used to identify practices that improve NUE and economic returns.Beef producers need the economic and environmental information generated by this research project to enhance the sustainability of their enterprises. However, Missouri State University (MSU) lacks the institutional framework and culture associated with outreach and extension programs found at land-grant institutions. Therefore, a collaboration with the University of Missouri (MU) will be developed to incorporate MSU research into MU Extension programs and the establishment of an annual Beef and Forage Field Day hosted by MSU in cooperation with MU Extension. In addition, we propose the development of the Beef Environment and Economics Forum (BEEF) website to promote MSU research of interest to beef producers.Students seeking degrees related to cattle production require relevant experiential learning opportunities as part of their undergraduate curriculum. This program is designed to provide real-world training for students interested in career opportunities in beef production and marketing. The program will also enhance the incorporation of the Shealy Farm in the teaching program at MSU and broaden student experiences through partnership with MU.The long-term goals of the project are to demonstrate sustainable forage-based beef production finishing systems in Missouri, provide high-impact educational experiences for MSU students, and enhance outreach through strengthened linkages between MSU and MU. We expect: 1) to demonstrate that N fertilizer applications can be reduced when nutrients added to pastures as supplemental feed or forage legumes are accounted for, which will optimize economic returns; 2) to improve student learning as a result of experiential learning opportunities; and 3) to enhance MSU outreach activities by establishing a precedence for MSU-hosted field days, which will encourage producer implementation of sustainable forage management systems."

These pathogens are known for their extensive virulence diversity that may change from one year or location to another.  Thus, one very important target of this project is to identify broad-spectrum disease resistance genes from the Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools of the wild and cultivated common bean. This will be accomplished by inoculating common bean with selected races of the aforementioned pathogens.  Studies of the inheritance of disease resistance will be conducted to characterize and map the new disease resistance genes.  Simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers linked with the newly discovered disease resistance genes will be identified to expedite the incorporation of these genes into new bean cultivars using marker-assisted selection.  Conventional and molecular breeding approaches will be used to develop bean germplasm lines in various market classes that combine several genes with broad-spectrum resistance to the rust, anthracnose, and angular leaf spot pathogens with high yield and other valuable agronomic attributes.   The specific objectives of this project are: Objective 1: Evaluate available common bean accessions from various geographic regions to identify potential sources of resistance to various pathogens, characterize new resistance genes, and develop molecular markers for use in introgression.   Objective 2: Introgress useful disease resistance genes, combine with good agronomic and quality trait genes in adapted backgrounds, and release germplasm lines or cultivars that can be used to broaden the genetic base of common bean."

Despite much research, many determinants of host resistance and their roles in signaling remain unknown. Pseudomonas syringae, a plant pathogenic bacterium, causes disease in more than 150 plant species. ZAR1 is the R protein responsible for recognizing the acetyltransferase HopZ1a, a P. syringae type III secreted effector protein (T3SE). ZAR1 is found in many plant species, including the Solanaceae, castor bean, and rice. However ZAR1 defense signaling does not depend on any components previously implicated in plant resistance, including salicylic acid. Further investigation of ZAR1 signaling gives us a unique opportunity to identify novel genes involved in plant resistance and potential targets for improving plant immunity. This project plan will address three major questions:  1) What other genes are genetically implicated in resistance to HopZ1a? Preliminary data from a forward genetics screen has identified several mutants that lack HopZ1a-mediated defense responses (hopz-effector-triggered-immunity-deficient or zed). The proposed work will map these mutants and characterize their roles in resistance.   2) What is the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance? The proposed work will identify other proteins that contribute to ZAR1-mediated resistance.   3) Is ZAR1 resistance conserved in other plant species? The proposed work will examine ZAR1 resistance in wild and domesticated tomato. Using a multi-pronged approach, this work will identify and characterize new sources of resistance to protect plants from disease.  The specific objectives are: Objective 1:  Conduct genetic screens coupled with next-generation DNA sequencing to identify genes that contribute to pathogen resistance in plants.   Objective 2:  Characterize the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance using molecular, genetic, and proteomic approaches.   Objective 3:  Evaluate susceptibility and resistance of plant species to bacterial pathogens to determine the conservation of resistance."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments. Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B.

Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics."

Basis for the objectives: The first two objectives describe the four basic tenets of the mission of the National Clonal Germplasm Repository Davis (NCGR); acquisition, maintenance, characterization and distribution of high quality, healthy, viable, true-to-type genetic resources and the associated evaluation and characterization information in GRIN-Global to the domestic and international scientific and educational communities. The third objective focuses on developing, implementing, and documenting best management practices for the  collections and keeping the Crop Vulnerability Statements up-to-date.  Acquisition has focused on crop wild relatives (CWRs) to fill important gaps and much of this germplasm is under quarantine and therefore in the pipeline to the Repository. Maintenance is best accomplished with young, vigorous plants and therefore the Repository is in the middle of a repropagation cycle for the collections. Distribution of germplasm to national and international researchers, breeders, and nurseries is primarily, but not limited to dormant cuttings or scionwood. Phenotypic evaluation and genetic characterization of the collections focus on understanding genetic diversity and increasing the visibility and value of the germplasm. Stakeholders are interested in phenotypic data on traits with breeding value. We use Bioversity International descriptors for germplasm evaluation and upload these data to GRIN-Global. Genetic markers discovered at the Repository and by collaborators can help clarify accession identity and assess genetic diversity, structure, and differentiation, and when combined with phenotypes will enhance the value and promote utilization of the germplasm."

These crops form symbiotic associations with rhizobacteria that results in biological nitrogen fixation that contributes to productivity and profitability of cropping systems. Peas, lentils, and chickpeas are typically sown in the spring, and the development of autumn sown legumes may provide alternatives to winter wheat. Diseases cause considerable losses in these crops every year and are primarily managed by the use of resistant varieties. However, resistance is lacking to several important diseases, including root rots caused by Aphanomyces and Fusarium, Ascochyta blight, Pythium seed rot, and Sclerotinia white mold. Improved understanding of fungicide resistance and mechanisms of pathogenicity and virulence will accelerate the development of effective and efficient practices for managing diseases of these crops. Over the next five years this research project has the following objectives.  Objective 1: Develop and release improved germplasm and cultivars of peas, lentils, and chickpeas that have desirable agronomic traits coupled with enhancements in nutritional characteristics and the ability to form symbiotic effective relationships with nitrogen-fixing rhizobacteria.

Given favorable outcomes, breeders will benefit from germplasm releases, growers from increased yield potential and nitrogen fixation, consumers from healthy low cost food with improved quality, and the environment from reduced pesticide use.   Germplasm lines which incorporate novel traits from exotic sources into near-commercial seed market types will provide public and private breeders with useful traits for cultivar development. Moving traits from exotic sources into adapted commercial cultivars is an otherwise arduous task for most breeding programs. Thus, these germplasm releases will facilitate adoption of new traits by breeders and increase genetic diversity in their programs which is crucial for advancing yield potential and for sustainability in the long term. It is expected that some breeding lines with exceptional performance generated by this project will be released as cultivars.    Another long-term goal is to better understand the genetics underpinning complex traits and leverage this knowledge to improve breeding strategies. High-throughput next generation sequencing combined with optical mapping and updated reference genomes will significantly facilitate genetic studies geared toward advancing our breeding efforts. We will seek better markers for indirect selection of economically important traits in pea and common bean and examine new marker-assisted breeding strategies. Populations generated for genetic analyses will be used for breeding and vice versa. Such dual purpose populations facilitate simultaneous advancement toward our long-term goals (germplasm development and genetic knowledge from genomic analyses). For the next five years this project will focus on the following objectives.   Objective 1: Develop genomic analysis populations, and use them to improve genetic understanding of complex traits as well as to accelerate breeding for improved agronomic traits, including biological nitrogen fixation, drought tolerance, tolerance to low soil fertility, and resistance to problematic bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases.    Objective 2: Develop, evaluate, and release fresh green pea and dry bean (kidney, pinto, black) germplasm with improved agronomic performance combined with durable disease resistance."

These crops form symbiotic associations with rhizobacteria that results in biological nitrogen fixation that contributes to productivity and profitability of cropping systems. Peas, lentils, and chickpeas are typically sown in the spring, and the development of autumn sown legumes may provide alternatives to winter wheat. Diseases cause considerable losses in these crops every year and are primarily managed by the use of resistant varieties. However, resistance is lacking to several important diseases, including root rots caused by Aphanomyces and Fusarium, Ascochyta blight, Pythium seed rot, and Sclerotinia white mold. Improved understanding of fungicide resistance and mechanisms of pathogenicity and virulence will accelerate the development of effective and efficient practices for managing diseases of these crops. Over the next five years this research project has the following objectives.  Objective 1: Develop and release improved germplasm and cultivars of peas, lentils, and chickpeas that have desirable agronomic traits coupled with enhancements in nutritional characteristics and the ability to form symbiotic effective relationships with nitrogen-fixing rhizobacteria.

Acquisition has focused on crop wild relatives (CWRs) to fill important gaps and much of this germplasm is under quarantine and therefore in the pipeline to the Repository. Maintenance is best accomplished with young, vigorous plants and therefore the Repository is in the middle of a repropagation cycle for the collections. Distribution of germplasm to national and international researchers, breeders, and nurseries is primarily, but not limited to dormant cuttings or scionwood. Phenotypic evaluation and genetic characterization of the collections focus on understanding genetic diversity and increasing the visibility and value of the germplasm. Stakeholders are interested in phenotypic data on traits with breeding value. We use Bioversity International descriptors for germplasm evaluation and upload these data to GRIN-Global. Genetic markers discovered at the Repository and by collaborators can help clarify accession identity and assess genetic diversity, structure, and differentiation, and when combined with phenotypes will enhance the value and promote utilization of the germplasm."

Given favorable outcomes, breeders will benefit from germplasm releases, growers from increased yield potential and nitrogen fixation, consumers from healthy low cost food with improved quality, and the environment from reduced pesticide use.   Germplasm lines which incorporate novel traits from exotic sources into near-commercial seed market types will provide public and private breeders with useful traits for cultivar development. Moving traits from exotic sources into adapted commercial cultivars is an otherwise arduous task for most breeding programs. Thus, these germplasm releases will facilitate adoption of new traits by breeders and increase genetic diversity in their programs which is crucial for advancing yield potential and for sustainability in the long term. It is expected that some breeding lines with exceptional performance generated by this project will be released as cultivars.    Another long-term goal is to better understand the genetics underpinning complex traits and leverage this knowledge to improve breeding strategies. High-throughput next generation sequencing combined with optical mapping and updated reference genomes will significantly facilitate genetic studies geared toward advancing our breeding efforts. We will seek better markers for indirect selection of economically important traits in pea and common bean and examine new marker-assisted breeding strategies. Populations generated for genetic analyses will be used for breeding and vice versa. Such dual purpose populations facilitate simultaneous advancement toward our long-term goals (germplasm development and genetic knowledge from genomic analyses). For the next five years this project will focus on the following objectives.   Objective 1: Develop genomic analysis populations, and use them to improve genetic understanding of complex traits as well as to accelerate breeding for improved agronomic traits, including biological nitrogen fixation, drought tolerance, tolerance to low soil fertility, and resistance to problematic bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases.
