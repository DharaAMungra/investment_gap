Develop more efficient processes for converting hulled and hulless barley to fuel ethanol and improved, beta-glucan-free, feed coproducts.  Through research assist in creation of a new hulless barley-to-ethanol industry in corn deficient regions, particularly the Mid Atlantic States and the North Western U.S.  Use the low-starch ('low carb') and high-fiber, high-oil, and high-protein fractions recovered from corn and barley prior to ethanol fermentation to produce health-promoting food ingredients, functional foods, and extruded snacks.  Develop improved processes to convert low valued crop-related biomass, byproducts and energy crops being researched in the ARS energy crop program into renewable hydrogen or liquid fuels and conduct economic feasibility studies for integrating this technology into co-located dry grind ethanol plants.  Develop small-scale thermo-chemical technologies that economically, efficiently, and sustainably produce hydrogen and coproducts from agricultural materials.Approach:Develop a continuous corn ammoniator for improving the conversion of corn to fuel ethanol. Conduct research to develop new dry de-germinators, roller mills, and associated fractionation devices with and without 'ammoniation' as a 'front end' to the traditional dry grind ethanol process.  Use these techniques on corn and hulled barley to produce high-starch fractions for more efficient fermentations, and low-starch fractions that can be used as value added health-promoting 'low-carb' food ingredients, healthy edible oils and nutraceuticals.  Use newly developed hulless barley cultivars and develop new beta-glucan-degrading enzyme technology to reduce fermentation viscosity and improve the production of ethanol from barley.  Prepare hulless barley DDGS from beta-glucanase treated fermentations and examine as high-valued feeds for non-ruminants and aquaculture.  Low-valued barley hulls and corn bran from corn and barley ethanol processing and energy crops and residues like switch grass, Eastern gama grass, reed canary grass, alfalfa, and corn stover will be studied as substrates for conversion to hydrogen and related liquid and gaseous fuels by thermochemical processes in a pyrolyzer (pyroprobe) coupled to a gas chromatograph/mass-spectrometer (PY-GC/MS) to analyze gasification products.  Promising substrates will be converted in a 2-inch bench-top fluidized-bed reactor to test selected feedstock for yields of H2, syngas, char and pyrolytic oil. Process modeling and economic analysis will be conducted on all the technologies studied, to help direct research toward the most fruitful and commercially feasible areas."

Within this area of research the experimental diets are to be tested to determine the optimal supplementation level of vitamins and limiting amino acids necessary to obtain maximal growth. The financial increase to the project will aid in developing ingredient enhancement through the development of biological and mechanical concentration methods for the formulation of nutrient complete feeds.New funds will be used to expand Objective One of the research project plan: 1) Develop a series of trout feeds that replace fishmeal and fish oil with traditional and enhanced plant-derived ingredients. The focus should be on ingredient enhancement through biological and mechanical concentration of required nutrients for complete feed development.  Expedite expanded capacity to increase select cultivars in trout feeding trials. This includes expanding strains being developed at Leetown, WV. Dr. Keshun Liu:  Objectives include; 1) evaluate current methods of dry and wet fractionization for ways to improve performance or reduce cost of production; 2) evaluate chemical and enzymatic treatments for effectiveness and production costs, 3) evaluate nutritional quality of protein concentrates, and 4) develop improved analytical methods for some key grain nutrients, such as beta-glucan, protein, to assist breeding screen for improved grain quality.  Dr. Frederic Barrows Objectives; 1) identify the most effective organism and blend of grains to result in a high protein low carbohydrate ingredient, 2) identify optimal processing and incubating conditions,  3) evaluate digestibility and palatability of each ingredients with in-vivo testing,  4) evaluate effect of long term feeding of experimental ingredient on growth, and product quality.  Dr. Kenneth Overturf Objectives:  1) installation of 10 heath tray incubators for hatching and isolating individual families, 80- 4'x15  troughs for rearing fry, and 25- 5' circular for holding individual families and mixed tagged families. Also included with this is the necessary infrastructure such as securing adequate water to the tanks and electrical and lighting for rearing and handling of the fish. Approach:This research will benefit fish farmers, grain farmers and assist in protecting the environment by reducing nutrients in hatchery effluents, and reducing exploitation of ocean fisheries.  A series of plant-based feeds will be eveloped, replacing fish meal, and containing the proper balance of essential nutrients.  New cultivars of barley and oats will be evaluated as a fish feed ingredient along with alternate crops such as flax, sunflower and safflower.  A breeding program will be used to develop new strains of rainbow trout that are better able to utilize plant-based feeds, grow faster and more efficiently and have improved product quality characteristics. Traditional methodologies to determine metabolic scope for a given nutrient or ingredient will be used to evaluate the relative contribution and metabolic efficacy of nutrients supplied in plant-based feeds.  Information developed concerning the genetic, biochemical, and physiological responses of rainbow trout to consumption of various plant-derived ingredients will be used as a basis for developing future feed formulations and to develop improved selection parameters for trout breeding programs. Dr. Keshun Liu:  Use 4 approaches to address this problem.  1) evaluate and further process protein-rich by-products of  current ethanol or beta-glucan production, 2) develop modified and novel methods to fractionate grain proteins for trout feed ingredients, 3) evaluate and process current improved cultivars of barley and oats, such as low-phyate cultivars for making fish feed ingredients, and 4) select and breed new cultivars of barleys and oats with enhanced composition through collaborating with plant scientist at the ARS, Aberdeen ID (Project # 5366-21000-024-00D). Dr. Frederic Barrows:  Solid substrate culture (SSC) has been proven to be an effective method for fungal production on a commercial scale.  The effectiveness of this approach is due to the relatively low capital costs and low energy costs.  This approach has not been used for the development of animal feeds before, but preliminary studies are quite promising. Utilizing different organisms and different blends of grains, a variety of products will be produced. Dr. Kenneth Overturf:  Genetic selection programs for trout have been initiated at the NCCCWA and at the HFCES (through Aberdeen).  The goal of the HFCES program is to select fish with an enhanced ability to utilize a plant based feed more efficiently.  The goal of the NCCCWA is to select trout for superior growth performance. Improved strains will be reared and analyzed in Idaho.

The aim is to improve activity at low pH, and increase catalytic conversion to lower the chemical and energy cost of liquefaction and saccharification.Objective 2: Develop novel enzymes and enzyme-based systems for solubilization and saccharification of hemicellulose components of corn fibers, crop residues, straws and grasses to simple sugars.  Special focus will be to engineer high activity xylanases with decreased end-product inhibition and that can be produced in microbes, which make active cellulases.Objective 3: Utilize and evaluate the evolved enzymes and enzyme systems for the hydrolysis of corn, wheat, and barley starch (Objective 1) and solubilization and saccharification of hemicellulose components of corn fibers, crop residues, straws, and grasses (Objective 2) in laboratory and pilot scale operations.  The improved enzymes will be evaluated on industrial substrates.  Large-scale process development will be conducted in collaboration with corn ethanol companies.Objective 4: Develop and evaluate ethanol-based separation systems for the biorefining of wheat to produce conventional and new fractions as platforms for both food and non-food applications. Characterize the functional material properties of the refined fractions produced in these new systems for their use in both food and non-food applications.Objective 5: Develop and evaluate improved biorefining methods utilizing barrier or membrane-based separation technologies to manage the recovery of ethanol or other biobased chemicals for use as a platform chemical, a biofuel, and a processing fluid.Approach:New biocatalysts are created through directed evolution, in which libraries of enzyme variants are created by the mutation of encoding genes.  The libraries are screened for target properties, and the candidate molecules selected can further undergo cycles of mutation, amplification, and selection until the desired enzyme variant is obtained.  To create novel starch-degrading enzymes toward improved performance, the following steps are involved:   (1) isolate, clone and express amylase genes; (2) mutate the gene sequences to create libraries; (3) screen the libraries for desired functions; (4) Purify the evolved enzymes for biochemical studies; (5) define the structure-function relationship; and (6) construct novel hybrid enzymes.  To develop enzymes for the solubilization of hemicelluloses, the following approach is used: (1) screen by molecular techniques for a full set of genes encoding xylanolytic enzymes that are individually or collectively highly active in xylan degradation; (2) clone and express the genes in suitable expression systems; (3) conduct directed evolution by computational and experimental enzyme mutation; (4) purify the evolved enzymes for biochemical studies; (5) test the enzymes by combinatorial approaches; and (6) produce the enzymes in microbial systems which also produce active cellulases.  As the best-fit enzymes are evolved and selected, the enzyme will be purified to homogeneity for the determination of kinetic properties. A variety of microscopic techniques will be applied to elucidate the action of the individual enzymes developed in this research. Several formats of bench scale enzyme reactions will be evaluated. These include liquefaction and saccharification as a distinct process, liquefaction and saccharification integrated with fermentation, and differentiated liquefaction and saccharification at high solids concentrations.To develop new separation systems, determine and account for (a) unique wheat gluten protein properties in the hydrated and developed state that enhance separation from starch and (b) unique solvent properties of ethanol that enable subfractionation of proteins, recovery of minor components (pentosan), and production of a dry product. Evaluate processing strategies such as countercurrent, batch, and crosscurrent extraction. Collaborate with ARS cost engineers and process-design firms where appropriate. To develop ethanol enrichment and recovery methods develop unique barrier materials for separation operations based pm pervaporation, perstraction, etc. Evaluate new materials for improved permeability and selectivity for ethanol recovery and concentration from fermentation broth (5-10% ethanol).

The large number of genetic mutants, in combination with the ease of obtaining and mapping additional mutants, makes maize an excellent system for determining the function of genes. We propose to identify genes that regulate maize leaf development and shoot architecture. We will carry out mutagenesis with defined inbreds using the chemical mutagen EMS. Mutants will be characterized genetically and histologically. The genes will be mapped to position and cloned. The functions will be determined by expression analysis and further genetics. We already have two mutants at different stages of analysis. The dominant Liguleless narrow mutant has been mapped to position and beginning characterization is under way. The dominant Wavy auricle in blade1 (Wab1) mutant has been localized to a BAC contig. Once we clone Wab1, we will determine the function of the wild-type gene product.

Those objectives are:Objective 1:  Monitor and characterize races of cereal rust pathogens, particularly the new East African strain, Ug99. This includes the sub-objective of characterizing races of cereal stem rust, particularly Ug99 and related mutants, which represent a threat to the production of wheat, oat, and barley cultivars in the United States.Objective 2:  Identify features essential for cereal rust pathogensis including sub-objectives of characterizing the genome of Puccinia graminis (stem rust).  Research for this objective will be expanded to characterize the Ug99 genome sequence and to develop detection methods for the new Eastern African stem rust mutants.Objective 3:  Identify resistance genes and develop effective strategies for deploying host-resistance genes to control cereal rust diseases.

Cereal germplasm with durable rust resistance, and other control strategies are needed to minimize yield losses due to cereal rusts. Variation in cereal rust populations will be analyzed by assessing virulence polymorphism to important rust resistance genes and by using molecular polymorphism to determine the relatedness and relationships between these populations. Migration patterns of cereal rust populations will be established using virulence and molecular markers. Virulence shifts in cereal rust populations in major cereal-producing areas of the U.S. in relation to use of rust resistance genes will be analyzed. Cereal germplasm with rust resistance will be evaluated in seedling plant tests and in adult plant field tests. Advanced germplasm lines with combinations of rust resistance genes will be selected. Cereal germplasm with durable resistance will be genetically analyzed to determine the identity and expression of the rust resistance genes. A genetic map of P. graminis will be constructed using AFLPs, SSRs, and SNPs. Physical maps of regions with avirulence genes will be developed using BAC and cosmid libraries. Genetic determinants of early infection processes in cereal rusts will be characterized. Crosses will be made with other cereal rust fungi to determine the genetics of avirulence/virulence to important rust resistance genes."

Identify the key isozymes involved in avenanthramide biosynthesis and evaluate their role in determining the levels and types of avenanthramides produced in planta.  Avenanthramides are polyphenolic alkaloids found uniquely in oat.  They result from conjugation of one of three major phenylpropanoids and 5-hydroxy-anthranilic acid.  The composition and quantities of avenanthramides in the oat seed tends to be highly variable within cultivars and between growing environments.  Some of this variability likely results from differential expression of isozymes of key enzymes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway. Objective 2.   Determine the physiological effect of avenanthramides in mammals by producing pure compounds for collaborative research with nutrition scientists.  Studies on the nutritional effects of avenanthramides can require hundreds of milligrams of pure authentic compound.  Synthesis of these natural products is the only practical means to provide these quantities free from other naturally occurring metabolites.  We are exploring innovative methods to facilitate laboratory scale synthesis and purification of the avenanthramides.  Objective 3.  Evaluate oat and barley germplasm for antioxidants and other phytonutrients.  Determine the contents of protein, oil, beta-glucan, and certain phytochemicals in oat and barley germplasm from the National Small Grains Collections and from collaborating researchers.  This objective is part of a larger ARS objective to characterize the national collections so that they will become more useful to researchers.  Develop improved oat and barley germplasm by enhancing for higher concentrations of specific phytochemicals.  This will be done by collaborating with plant breeders, who do not have the capability for measuring these compounds in large numbers of samples.  Approach:The overarching rationale for these experiments is to determine the role of specific isozymes of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and / or 4-coumaryl CoA ligase (4-CL) in avenanthramide biosynthesis, and their relation to the biosynthesis of specific forms of avenanthramides.  Although, a number of plant DNA sequences corresponding to both PAL and 4-CL are found in GenBank, currently there are none from oat.  It is expected that, like most plants, oat will possess multiple isozymes of PAL and 4-CL, thus it is important to determine how many genes are present in oat and to obtain DNA sequence information for these isozyme.  These data will allow development of isozyme specific probes to evaluate expression of the target genes over the course of seed maturation and in different plant organs in field grown oats. Although a route to the synthesis of avenanthramides is available, this method is cumbersome and time-consuming.  We have found the use of the peptide coupling reagent benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexaflurophosphate (BOP) to be effective in the synthesis of avenanthramides.  We will also explore the use of other peptide coupling reagents for their utility in avenanthramide synthesis.  The synthesized avenanthramides are being used, in collaboration with nutrition scientists at the USDA Jean Mayer Laboratory of Human Nutrition (Tufts University) and at the University of Wisconsin, Department of Kinesiology, to evaluate the effects of avenanthramides in mammalian systems.  Oat and barley germplasm will be evaluated for the content of other phytochemical constituents that may have physiological effects, and for unusually high concentrations of known phytochemicals.  Entries from the National Small Grains Collections, elite nurseries, and selections from collaborating plant breeders will be analyzed for various constituents, including protein, oil, beta-glucan, and phytochemicals."

Agricultural activities in this region have traditionally been production of corn, soybeans, and specialty crops and some confined animal operations; however, production of bioenergy crops including corn, hulless barley, and switch grass are expected to increase as energy costs rise.  Urban encroachment has also become a major concern in this region resulting in increased NOx production which can lead to ozone formation in the presence of VOCs.  Objective 1:  Identify the major emission sources of agricultural pollutants, such as particulate, pesticide active and inert ingredients and other VOCs, and greenhouse gases within the Chesapeake Bay airshed.  Objective 2:  Determine the predominant fate processes and atmospheric components that influence the fate of agricultural air-borne pollutants.  Objective 3:  Estimate the spatial and temporal variability of emissions using a combination of field measurements, remotely-sensed, and land use data.  Objective 4: Develop a framework to predict the influence of land use changes and agricultural production practices on air quality for use by policy makers, regulators, and natural resource managers.Approach:Rapid detection technologies, such as nano and molecular imprinting technologies, will be developed for measuring agricultural pollutants in air.  Using newly-developed and traditional techniques, the emission of air-borne pollutants will be measured in selected subwatersheds.  Measurements will be taken over several growing seasons in different land use areas and compared to a previously-identified non-urban area where no agricultural activities have occurred for over thirty years.  The fate of identified air borne pollutants will be examined in newly-developed chemical fate models.  In areas where urban land use is adjacent to agricultural lands, available NOx and meteorological data will be utilized to predict the potential of agricultural pollutants to form ozone.  Predictions will be compared to available ozone concentrations.  Measured pollutant concentration data will be combined with land use, physical chemical constants, and meteorological data to produce an estimate of total emissions and potential ozone emission as a function of land use.  These data will then be extrapolated to consider the effects of land-use changes and agricultural activity on air quality in the Chesapeake Bay region."

Fungal pathogens, such as Fusarium head blight and cereal rusts continue to cause major damage and losses.  Development of genetic resistance in small grains to these pathogens is hindered by the lack of information about mechanisms that confer host-plant resistance and the lack of linked DNA markers to assist in the development of improved germplasm.  Our approach will be to use new and existing molecular genetic methods such as gene expression arrays, transient gene silencing and to develop an improved understanding of the genetic and biochemical mechanisms that can confer host-plant resistance disease resistance and utilize this information to develop new strategies for enhancing genetic resistance to cereal viral and fungal diseases.

Assess the impact of mating-type gene evolution on speciation in fungal plant pathogens, including Mycosphaerella graminicola and Septoria passerinii.Objective 2: Analyze the function and chromosomal location of host genes predicted to be involved in disease resistance in wheat and maize. Sub-objective 2a. Investigate mechanisms of host-specific resistance of wheat to Mycosphaerella graminicola and of maize to Exserohilum turcicum. Sub-objective 2b. Elucidate mechanisms of non-host resistance focusing on resistance of barley to Mycosphaerella graminicola and resistance of wheat to Septoria passerinii. Sub-objective 2c. Discover closely linked markers on wheat chromosome 3BS for marker-assisted selection and eventual positional cloning of the Stb2 gene for resistance to Mycosphaerella graminicola.Approach:Fungal genes expressed during critical stages of pathogenesis will be identified by microarray analysis and by subtractive suppressive hybridization; involvement of selected genes, including those for phytotoxin synthesis and conidiation, will be assessed by transformation and gene disruption and silencing methods. Patterns of gene expression in resistant and susceptible genotypes of maize and wheat will be determined with microarrays composed primarily of cDNAs identified from a database of ESTs. The chromosomal location of genes for resistance to fungal pathogens will be determined by employing a variety of PCR-based, molecular methods. BSL-2; Recertified through July 21, 2008."

Over the next five years we will focus on the following objectives: 1)determine factors influencing epidemic development and host-pathogen interactions for rusts, including to identify and monitor emerging races of stripe rust on a national basis and to improve rust prediction and integrated control; 2)evaluate germplasm and breeding lines of wheat and barley for resistance to rusts,including to support breeding programs in developing cultivars with adequate and durable resistance and to identify new sources and genes of effective resistance to stripe rust; and 3)determine the genomic structure and functional genes of the stripe rust pathogen and molecular mechanisms of plant-pathogen interactions.Approach:The prevalence, severity, and distribution of rusts will be monitored  through disease surveys in commercial fields, monitoring nurseries, and  experimental plots of wheat and barley, as well as wild grasses. Stripe  rust races will be identified by testing rust samples on wheat and barley differential genotypes. Rust epidemics will be predicted based on environmental and cropping system factors. Geographic regions where stripe rust can over-winter and over-summer will be mapped by analyzing climatic and cropping data. Disease forecasting models will be developed for various epidemic regions by analyzing historical weather and disease data and tested with rust survey data. Fungicide tests will be conducted to identify new effective fungicides. Germplasms and breeding lines of wheat and barley will be evaluated in  greenhouses with selected races and in field plots under natural infections of rusts to support breeding programs. New sources and genes of effective resistance to stripe rust will be identified through germplasm evaluation, genetic studies, and molecular mapping. Molecular markers for resistance genes will be developed using resistance gene analog, microsatellite, and other marker techniques. The genomic structure and functional genes of the stripe rust pathogen and molecular mechanisms of plant-pathogen interactions will be determined through constructing physical and functional gene maps.  Fingerprinting and end-sequencing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones will be conducted to construct the physical map, which will be filled with functional genes identified from cDNA clones of the pathogen. Functional genes will be identified by comparing the sequences of full-length cDNA clones to genes in GenBank databases. Molecular markers will be developed using sequences of functional genes and BAC-ends for studying population structures of the stripe rust pathogen. Genes of wheat and the stripe rust pathogen involved in the plant-pathogen interactions will be identified. Formerly 5348-22000-010-00D (3/07)."

Devos (University of Georgia), Olin D. Anderson and Ming-Cheng Luo (University of California - Davis)Complete BAC-by-BAC sequencing of large plant genomes, such as those of wheat, barley, and other economically important plants, is currently prohibitively expensive. Next generation sequencing technologies, such as the 454 Life Sciences (Roche), Solexa (Illumina), and SOLiD (Applied BioSystems), offer sequencing with much higher throughputs and at greatly reduced costs. Unfortunately, the short read-lengths complicate the use of these techniques in de novo sequencing of eukaryotic genomes. That is particularly true for large plant genomes that contain vast amounts of repeated DNA sequences. The goal of this project is to assess a novel strategy for de novo sequencing with the SOLiD platform in collaboration with Applied BioSystems. This strategy will employ sequencing of two-dimensional pools of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones of genomic DNA. The strategy will be evaluated using two-dimensional pools of BAC clones of Aegilops tauschii, one of the diploid ancestors of polyploid wheat. A program will be written to deconvolute the pools and assemble sequences of individual clones.Broader impacts: The development of a de novo sequencing strategy for the SOLiD sequencing platform will make it possible to seriously consider genome sequencing of species with large genomes, such as wheat, at realistic costs and in a realistic time frame. It is the hope that the sequencing technique and the software developed will be universally applicable to the sequencing of any large plant genome. The initial repository for public access to the assembly software developed is at http://wheatdb.ucdavis.edu:8080/wheatdb/index.jsp.  The software will also be integrated with public web sites, such as GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml), that provides a compilation of molecular and phenotypic information on wheat and other cereals."

A major aim will therefore be to enable students and post docs to take advantage of emerging genomics data in the cereals. Specific problems and unique challenges exist in cereal genomics. Many of the genomes (for example, maize, wheat, barley) are large and complex, and it is unlikely that we will have completely mapped and sequenced genomes for these species in the foreseeable future. The cereals also provide the primary source of nourishment to the world's human and domesticated animal populations. This workshop will provide young students and scientists with the tools and skills they need to exploit the emerging genome data in all cereal crops including complete genome sequences (rice, maize, sorghum) and extensive EST and genome survey sequence from wheat and other grasses.  The broader impacts of this workshop will be in exposing young students to the excitement of cereal genomics, as well as enabling more senior researchers to develop cutting edge research and curricular activities.

The principal investigators identified specific BR-dependent phosphorylation sites of Arabidopsis BRI1 and BAK1 in planta and isolated a putative cytoplasmic substrate of BRI1 with homology to the mammalian TGF-beta receptor interacting protein (TRIP-1). TRIP-1 (also known as eIF3i) is a dual function protein that regulates TGF-beta signaling in mammals and also plays a critical role in the eIF3 protein translation initiation complex in animals, yeast and plants. Arabidopsis BRI1 interacts with TRIP-1 in planta and phosphorylates TRIP-1 on three specific residues in vitro. Initiation is the rate-limiting step in eukaryotic protein translation and is often regulated by phosphorylation of specific initiation factor subunits in response to various signals. A proteomic screen for novel BRI1 and BAK1 interactors identified an additional four eIF subunits; eIF2B, eIF3g, eIF4A and eIF5, as putative kinase domain substrates for BRI1 and/or BAK1. Taken together, the preliminary evidence suggests that BR-dependent phosphorylation of TRIP-1 (and other eIF subunits) by BRI1 may affect initiation factor activity and/or assembly and thus impact the global cellular phenomenon of protein translation, providing a novel mechanism for BR regulation of plant growth. The research will examine the intersection of BR signal transduction and protein translation initiation by focusing on three objectives. Objective 1. Characterization of Arabidopsis TRIP-1 in vivo phosphorylation sites by a variety of mass spectrometry approaches and analysis of their functional significance with respect to BR signaling and eIF3 activity. Objective 2. Detailed in vivo and in vitro characterization of the putative interaction of eIF3g and eIF5 with BRI1 and BAK1. Objective 3.Generation of an in vivo phosphorylation site database of multiple eIF subunits followed by quantitative studies of BR-dependent phosphorylation in these proteins using label-free mass spectrometry methodologies.Intellectual merit: A great deal is known about genomic effects of BR signaling and BR regulated gene expression, but little is known about non-genomic pathways through which BRs might regulate cellular physiology directly, e.g. by phosphorylating cytoplasmic proteins such as translation initiation factor subunits. Identification of specific in vivo phosphorylation sites in eIF subunits coupled with their functional characterization will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating protein translation in plants.Broader impacts: The proposed research will provide excellent training in biochemistry, molecular biology and mass spectrometry at all levels, including postdoctoral scientists, graduate and undergraduate students and high school student summer interns. A database of eIF phosphorylation sites will be made publicly available and vector constructs and transgenic plants useful to the research community will be distributed via the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. BRs are now firmly established as essential regulators of plant growth and development affecting a broad spectrum of developmental processes. The identification of BR biosynthetic and insensitive mutants in tomato, rice, barley and pea, clearly extends the importance of these compounds from the experimental plant Arabidopsis thaliana to crop plants and recent field experiments have shown slight alterations in rice BRI1 expression can alter rice yields by up to 30%. Understanding the molecular details of BR signal transduction can thus have practical application in regulating the growth of agricultural plants."

Ug99 was first detected in Africa and has recently spread to Iran. The pathogen can be blown long distances and the likelihood of inadvertent human-mediated spread is considerable. The U.S. grows 60 million acres of wheat valued at $13 billion and potential loss to Ug99 could exceed $10 billion. Most U.S. wheat and barley cultivars are susceptible to Ug99. Wide deployment of resistant cultivars will likely require 7-10 years and until then the first line of defense will be applications of fungicides. We will develop research, extension, and education components of an IPM program to provide growers with efficient in-season stem rust management to protect their crop yields and profits between the time Ug99 enters the U.S. and deployment of cultivars with durable long-term resistance to this pathogen. This Integrated Project addresses both 2008 Plant Biosecurity Program priorities. We will develop rapid diagnostic procedures for identifying Ug99, train NPDN staff to use these PCR tools, and facilitate improvement of U.S. wheat germplasm. We will integrate observations from disease monitoring and spore collection networks with aerobiology modeling to provide growers with early warning of disease spread once Ug99 arrives. We will work with stakeholders to enhance monitoring programs and provide an Internet-based platform for communicating information critical for management decision making. Finally, we will develop a university aerobiology course to teach state-of-the-art methods for responding to threats from invasive organisms to the next generation of scientists."

Student projects will include investigating species definitions, developing identification tools, and a morphological and molecular phylogenetic investigation. Student projects will assist in the development of online resources by developing new identification tools and providing technical input to the online information system.

The resulting forecasts will be delivered through web-based systems and will be available to growers on a daily update basis. Risk forecasts can improve crop quality while at the same time reducing fungicide use by allowing growers to improve the timing of fungicide applications. Our goals in reducing fungicide use are of increasing product quality, limiting expenditures, and reducing the amount of chemical released to the environment. We will examine and quantify the accuracy, economic and environmental impacts, and usability of crop disease risk forecasts at both the synoptic and mesoscale (different weather forecasting scales) in the various regions of the U.S. By selecting three very different crop species (peanut, barley, potato) each heavily dependent upon fungicide sprays for the prevention, avoidance, and management of disease in various regions of the country (southeast, northern Great Plains, Great Lakes region), we plan to capture the overall potential of such forecasting systems for widespread use in the U.S. New technologies in the form of improved National Weather Service forecasts (since 2004) and access to high performance computer workflows give us the opportunity to exploit these advances funded through large government technology grants (the LEAD project alone cost $11.5 million) for the benefit of both major and minor agricultural commodity groups. The ultimate goal of any forecast system is reduction of uncertainty that can negatively influence decision making by users. In the case of disease risk forecasting for agriculture, decisions by the target group of users can negatively impact our food supply, environment, and economy by increasing use of pesticides. Increasing accessibility to forecast information through free, thoroughly tested forecast services in the web environment has the potential to dramatically decrease uncertainty in a variety of crop systems. In this project we examine three crops in three regions of the country, but the implications of the project's results are much more far reaching. Many crop diseases have similar meteorological triggers based on temperature and moisture requirements that may be mined from available forecasts. For a number of years, growers, stakeholders , commodity associations, crop consultants and land grant specialists have been requesting disease risk prediction models for all the major crops in the U.S. through Pest Management Strategic Plans. The public availability of weather forecasts and the improved infrastructure to promote the use of these forecasts make this the time to examine usefulness of forecasting as a national priority in agriculture."

In both animals and plants, the Polycomb group genes (PcG) regulate several developmental pathways. In the model dicot plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, the PcG-related Fertilization Independent Seed (FIS) genes, so called because of the ability of the mutants to initiate endosperm growth without fertilization, have been implicated in the control of endosperm initiation and growth patterning. Genetic studies in Arabidopsis have identified four FIS genes called MEDEA, FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED 2, FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM and MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA1. Although there are distinctive differences between endosperm development in dicots versus monocots, none of these genes have thus far been investigated functionally in rice or any other cereals, or generally in any monocots. My long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms controlling endosperm proliferation and patterning in cereals. In this project, I will identify and study potential rice FIS genes and investigate their potential functions in rice endosperm development. This fundamental research into the FIS genes in rice will provide a useful foundation to understanding the critical process of endosperm development in cereals, including other important crops species like maize and wheat."

We have identified a maize gene, Tassel sheath1, which is necessary to block leaf growth in the inflorescence. Our proposed experiments will help determine how Tassel sheath1 controls leaf outgrowth. We will test if this gene has a similar function in other important cereal crops including rice and barley, since this trait appears to have evolved early in the evolution of the cereals. Lastly, to more completely understand this unique developmental process, we will characterize other maize mutants that appear to be similar to tsh1.

Worldwide, this disease results in major epidemics and yield losses of rice. The utility of two historically important strategies for defeating the rice blast fungus, chemical pesticides and naturally occurring resistance in rice, is severely limited by the fungus' ability to overcome these strategies, rendering them ineffective. If we can pinpoint exactly how the fungus infects, grows within, and reproduces in its host plants, we can more accurately design novel disease control strategies. The ultimate goal of our project is to contribute knowledge towards understanding how the rice blast fungus infects its host plants. A successful infection of the host results from the fungus moving smoothly from one infective life cycle stage to the next, which can only be accomplished by careful control over the expression of its genes. There are several levels of gene control in many organisms ranging from humans to fruit flies. We will specifically target one of these levels, called small RNAs, in the rice blast fungus. Small RNAs are short stretches of nucleic acids that can `match' the sequence of specific genes within a genome. Extensive research on small RNAs has revealed that, along with other jobs, these tiny molecules can control whether a gene will be turned on or off; small RNAs represent a sort of `fine-tuning' mechanism for gene regulation. Thus far, little is known about small RNAs in filamentous fungi, particularly plant parasites; our study aims to fill in these gaps. To do this, we are using several approaches that complement each other; the first approach is genetic and involves `breaking' genes in the fungus that, based on their DNA sequences, might be involved in producing small RNAs. Once we have generated these mutants, we can see whether the small RNAs have disappeared, and what effect this has on growth of the fungus and its ability to infect host plants. Because small RNAs can control gene expression, we will look at expression of all fungal genes when small RNAs are gone (i.e. the mutants). What effect will a lack of small RNAs have on gene expression? What types of genes will be most effected? We can achieve this goal by using microarray technology; microarrays are microscope slides that contain every gene from our fungus. We will put the genetic complement from several of the mutants onto these slides, read the slides using a special scanner, and analyze the data; this data will tell us how genes change when small RNAs are no longer present. Finally, we will sequence small RNAs from the fungus under different environmental conditions, including wild type growth conditions, nutrient starvation, and while infecting the host plant. This will tell us quantity and type of small RNAs produced under different conditions. Together, these three approaches will provide a comprehensive survey into the roles of small RNAs- we will be able to see how they impact gene regulation of the fungus, and how this ties into growth and virulence."

Approach:Maize is an important crop as well as a model organism for other cereals such as sorghum, barley, rice and wheat. Our long term goal is to identify and characterize the activity of maize genes involved in plant production including tolerance to stressful growth conditions and regulation of flowering time. Recent work in model systems demonstrates that the circadian regulation of physiological activities is required for optimal plant growth and for tuning of responses to environmental cues. A comprehensive understanding of the circadian system in cereals is lacking; therefore, this proposal seeks to define the maize circadian system and assess the circadian oscillatorÆs contribution to important agronomic traits. Known circadian mutants will be tested for their response to salt and osmotic stress. Genes under circadian regulation in cereals will be identified by expression profiling, and this information used to computationally predict regulatory DNA elements that contribute to circadian gene expression. Reverse genetic approaches will evaluate the role of candidate photoperiodism genes in determining the timing of maize flowering. Maize inbreds and recombinant inbred lines will be analyzed for natural variation in overt circadian rhythms. DNA sequences, genes, mutants, and inbred lines identified here provide two types of tools: a better understanding of fundamental processes in environmental responses and targets that can be used to improve crop productivity.

The overall objectives of this program are to develop effective methods for identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and marker-assisted selection (MAS), and to deliver those methods to breeders and geneticists in publications and software.1: Develop methods for identifying plant breeding quantitative trait loci.2:  Integrate methods for QTL identification into strategies that enable geneticists and breeders to design more efficient experiments and make better selection decisions.3: Develop breeder-friendly tools for genomic and genetic data access and analysis, with a specific focus on optimum analysis and use of molecular marker and agronomic data for small grains breeders and geneticists.Approach:Objective 1: Develop methods for identifying plant breeding quantitative trait loci.Experimental Design. Populations under a Wright-Fisher neutral model will be simulated using a standard coalescent approach using different parameter values to compare three analysis methods: 1.

Objective 2: Integrate methods for QTL identification into strategies that enable geneticists and breeders to design more efficient experiments and make better selection decisions.Experimental Design. To predict specific untested haplotype-environment effects, the covariance matrix of haplotype-within-environment effects will be modeled in two ways. First, the covariance of haplotype main effects can be modeled on the basis of the sequence similarity of the haplotypes. Second, the covariance of haplotype effects across environments can be modeled much as the covariance of genotype effects in multi-environment trials can be modeled. We will also explore a combination of these two options. Simulations of MAS will be applied to data from the Barley CAP for spring, six-row barley. The form of the distribution of QTL effects obtained from the real data will be maintained. Mixed model and whole-genome selection methods will be applied.Objective 3: Develop breeder-friendly tools for genomic and genetic data access and analysis, with a specific focus on optimum analysis and use of molecular marker and agronomic data for small grains breeders and geneticists.Experimental Design. In collaboration with GrainGenes, displays currently available in TASSEL and Haploview will be scoped, resource requirements estimated, and priorities established. In addition, this project will provide association analyses based on diversity data stored in the GrainGenes database, with significant markers to be displayed on a genetic map. Methods developed in the preceding two objectives will be implemented as plugins to the TASSEL software package. TASSEL already handles most of the data input, data management, and output functions.

The primary crops studied are barley and maize. The primary targeted end-uses are for feeds, foods, and biofuel production. Over the next five years the main focus will continue to be the genetics of plant and seed phosphorus.  There are three specific objectives. The first objective will be to identify and characterize genes perturbed in barley low phytic acid mutants. Second, this project will develop a better understanding of the relationship between seed phosphorus and inositol phosphate chemistry, plant performance, and stress tolerance. The third objective is to identify novel crop genotypes conditioning altered plant or seed phosphorus chemistry or related phenotypes that are of end-use value. This includes the development of genetic tools useful in breeding or engineering crops with normal shoot P but altered levels of seed total P, and the development of genetic approaches useful in engineering reduced shoot total P. This last objective involves developing genotypes that are tolerant to reduced plant total P.Approach:For the first objective, the first step is to select target mutant loci as targets. Characterization of phenotypes observed in the barley lpa mutation collection, in combination with chromosomal mapping data, and review of the current knowledge in this field, will be used to identify targets for gene identification.  Fine mapping of selected lpa loci will first be conducted. Genomics resources for barley, or comparative mapping data with other species such as rice, will be used to identify candidate genes. Sequencing of candidate genes will confirm if they are in fact the gene perturbed in the target mutant.  Definitive proof that a mutant phenotype is the result of a mutation in the identified gene may require additional studies such as ôcomplementationö.For the second objective, to develop a better understanding of relationship between seed phosphorus, inositol phosphate and plant performance such as stress tolerance, the first step would be to complete ôtranscription profilingö, using microarray analyses, to identify genes and functions impacted in selected genotypes or in response to selected stress treatments such as heat/drought stress. Genes whose expression or function is greatly impacted will be the focus of more targeted study. Their sequences, map position, and gene family relationships will be obtained. Expression profiles and biochemical/physiological function will be determined. For the third objective, two types of approaches will be used to develop genotypes with useful alterations in plant or seed phosphorus chemistry. These are ôforward geneticsö screens and ôreverse geneticsö approaches. In ôForward geneticsö, screens of various types of mutagenized populations will be conducted to identify mutations that impact plant or seed phosphorus. Populations screened will either be chemically mutagenized, or represent collections of transposon insertions. Mutants with interesting phenotypes such as ôreduced seed total Pö will then be the subject of in depth follow-up study, including chromosomal mapping and agronomic evaluation. Ultimately the gene perturbed in the mutation will be identified, and near-isogenic lines will be developed for use in agronomic and nutritional studies. In the reverse genetics component, mutations such as ôsingle nucleotide polymorphismsö (SNPs) will be isolated in target genes of interest. For example, many genes are already known to be important to phosphorus uptake and transport, but which specific genes or functions are important to seed total phosphorus is not known. Methods such as TILLING will be used to isolate mutations in target genes, which will then be used to determine the effect of such mutations on plant and seed phosphorus. BSL-1; 5/17/07."

The small grains Crop Germplasm Committees (CGC) have previously developed lists of descriptors for evaluation and are consulted regularly for evaluation priorities.  Several evaluations, ongoing for a number of years and considered high priority by the CGC, will be continued.  Ug99 stem rust resistance research will focus on identifying new major and adult-plant genes in wheat landraces and making the new sources of resistance available to breeders for transfer to adapted germplasm for all regions of the U.S.  Evaluation of rice germplasm will be coordinated at the USDA-ARS Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center, Stuttgart, Arkansas and data will be returned to Aberdeen for inclusion in GRIN.  SSR markers will be employed to genotype the NSGC core subsets of wheat and barley, totaling 5,500 and 2,577 accessions, respectively. To eliminate variation due to heterogeneity within accessions, single-plant-selections for each core accession will be generated for genotyping.  Resulting data will be analyzed to better understand genetic variation within the collection, including the relationship between variation and geographic origin of accessions.  Country, state/province, locality, and latitude/longitude data for NSGC accessions are maintained in GRIN.  Traits of interest will be mapped and analyzed using GIS software and appropriate statistical techniques. Because stem and stripe rust of wheat and barley are of current concern worldwide, priority will be given to mapping the geographic origin of resistance.  Accession genetic diversity in the core collections, based on molecular marker data will be mapped to better understand its relationship to accession geographic origin, to elucidate relations between geographic patterns of molecular diversity and trait diversity, and to do gap analysis to identify priority areas for future collection.Replacing 5366-21000-022-00D (3/08).FY09 Program Increase $175,000FY10 Program Increase $37,200"

This will be achieved by accomplishing these four objectives:Objective 1: Conserve and regenerate priority crops, crop varieties, native species, and other NPGS genetic resources adapted to circumpolar and other high latitude regions efficiently and effectively, and distribute samples and associated information worldwide.Objective 2: Strategically expand the genetic diversity in genebank collections and improve associated information for priority genetic resources of crops, crop varieties, and native plant genetic resources adapted to circumpolar and other high latitude regions.Objective 3: Strategically characterize (ôgenotypeö) and evaluate (ôphenotypeö) priority Rheum, Deschampsia, and other selected genetic resources for molecular markers, morphological descriptors, and key agronomic or horticultural traits.Objective 4: Elucidate the effects of key associated insects and pathogens on selected crops, crop varieties, and native plant genetic resources adapted to circumpolar and other high latitude regions.Approach:Agricultural development in circumpolar regions depends upon the availability of a broad genetic base of plant cultivars adapted to long day, short season and cool climate conditions. The biological properties of most high latitude native plant species and crop species are poorly understood, especially in plant hardiness zones not found in the conterminous U.S. Characterizations of germplasm and subsequent documentation of data are critical for germplasm management, utilization and the development of new crops for northern latitudes. There is a need for increased research to improve management of arctic/subarctic germplasm and to understand disease etiologies, host-pathogen interactions, and disease vector relationships. The USDA/ARS/NPGS is responsible for maintaining a diverse collection of plant genetic material in USA. The Subarctic Agricultural Research Unit is the primary U.S. location for preservation of plant germplasm important as food, feed, medicine, land reclamation, and site remediation in arctic/subarctic zones. This project is the only ARS, plant genetic resource conservation unit in the circumpolar region. The germplasm collection in Palmer maintains over 600 accessions. Research projects on targeted plant species include, but are not limited to Rheum, Carex, Juncus, Calamagrostis, Deschampsia, and Angelica spp. Other species such as potato, lupine, clover, black medic, barley, currant, strawberry, and other fruits are or will be studied on the Palmer site to help other NPGS units. Primary goals are: 1. To conserve and regenerate priority crops, crop varieties, native species, and other NPGS genetic resources adapted to circumpolar and high latitude regions, and distribute samples and associated information worldwide. 2. To strategically expand the genetic diversity in genebank collections, and improve associated information for priority genetic resources of crops, crop varieties, and native plant genetic resources adapted to circumpolar and other high latitude regions. 3. To strategically characterize and evaluate priority Rheum, Deschampsia, and other selected genetic resources for molecular markers, morphological descriptors, and key agronomic or horticultural traits. 4. To elucidate the effects of key associated insects and pathogens on selected crops, crop varieties, and native plant genetic resources adapted to circumpolar and other high latitude regions.Replacing 5341-21000-003-00D (04/2008)"

Due to high fiber content, DDGS utilization in poultry and swine diets has been limited. The combination of sieving and air classification, called  Elusieve  process, was found to be effective in separating fiber from DDGS. There is a need to evaluate and demonstrate DDGS fiber separation in pilot scale, in order to facilitate plant scale implementation of Elusieve process. In a recent study, it was found that Elusieve process was effective in separating fiber from corn flour itself. In the study, only one set of parameters (milling sieve opening, milling speed, sieve sizes and air velocities) were evaluated as the study was just a proof-of-concept study. There is a need to determine the best combination of parameters that would result in the most effective fiber separation from corn flour. Ethanol production from barley is hampered by the presence of beta-glucans and hulls. Removal of beta-glucans and hulls from barley flour before fermentation would decrease viscosity of fermentation mash, increase ethanol productivity and increase nutritional value of DDGS coproduct as animal food.

The objectives of this project is to investigate the importance of diseases, maintain and enhance resistance to barley diseases that are realeased to industry and develop timely, practical methods for disease control to ensure that the quantity and quality of barley are not limited by disease. We will do this by finding new resistance genes for important diseases so that they can be used in the breeding programs and investigate in field and greenhouse studies new methods of disease control and new applications of existing disease control methods."

FHB epidemics can cause significant yield losses, shriveled kernels, and deposition of vomitoxin (Deoxynivalenol (DON)) in the infected seeds which renders the grain unsuitable for human consumption and feed (McMullen et al., 1997). Wheat and barley losses caused by FHB epidemics in the USA during the 1990s were estimated at close to $3 billion U.S. dollars (Windels, 2000). The development and deployment of resistant germplasm is an environmentally sustainable method for the control of FHB. Several species of the Fusarium genus are known to cause FHB (Wiese, 1987). F. graminearum and F. culmorum are the primary Fusarium species causing DON contamination and reduced grain quality. F. graminearum survives between wheat crops in living or dead host tissues (Zhu and Fan, 1989). Wheat planted after maize often has significantly more head blight than wheat planted after other crops. Therefore, reduced tillage in soil conservation systems increases the amount of inoculum present (Teich and Hamilton, 1985). Wheat production in Idaho ranks 5th in the nation in 2006. Adding FHB resistance to current cultivars is critical and valuable for our growers to maintain sustainable high quality grain production in national and world markets. FHB epidemics occurred in sprinkler-irrigated wheat and barley fields in south central and eastern Idaho in 1982 and 1984, resulting in estimated yield losses as high as 50% (Michuta-Grimm and Foster, 1989). Scab epidemics occurred in sprinkler-irrigated spring wheat and barley fields in Montana in 2006 and 07 and resulted in estimated yield losses over 50% (Luther Talbert, personal communication). With the increase in corn production (for dairy and biofuel), and no-till or conservation tillage in the area, it would be beneficial to have an active FHB resistance program to insure that future cultivars carry some resistance if corn production, especially under no-till, continues to increase in acreage in the south central and south eastern part of the state. Changing production practices and increasing temperatures in the PNW, as predicted by climate models, may increase the risk of FHB. Therefore, incorporation of FHB resistance into existing germplasm may prevent or reduce future losses."

Cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice and barley are most affected by drought during the time of flowering and initiation of grain formation, causing drastic yield losses. The goal of this project is to develop a systems biology view of drought responses in cereals to understand this complex process and improve drought resistance and water use efficiency. Genome-wide comparative transcriptome analysis of drought responses in rice and maize will be integrated into a cereal drought gene interaction network, using ortholog information to predict conserved functional relationships as a basis for cereals. Conserved orthologous regulatory genes between rice and maize involved in drought responses and resistance will be identified comprising transcription factors (TFs), protein kinases and phosphatases, genes in hormone signaling pathways, chromatin binding proteins, protein degradation and small RNA pathways. As proof of principle, a set of these putative conserved rice and maize genes will be tested by genetic analysis of mutants and natural allelic variants, assessing them for altered drought response phenotypes and perturbation in the drought gene interaction network. These analyses will validate and improve the cereal gene interaction network predictions, and provide candidate genes for improvement of drought resistance/tolerance in cereals. With respect to broader impacts, this project will contribute through the generation of information key to the development of stable food production systems worldwide and through the creation of a transdisciplinary educational environment. Scientifically, the project will demonstrate the use of an integrated network approach to understand complex plant responses such as drought response and resistance. Outreach and training activities are integrated within the transdisciplinary plant-lab-bioinformatics project and will be made accessible to high school and underrepresented undergraduate students from institutions across Virginia and North Carolina through established programs at Virginia Tech and other nearby universities. An outreach program developed as part of a NSF-Cyberinfrastructure Training, Education, Advancement, and Mentoring for Our 21st Century Workforce (CI-TEAM) project will provide modules for quantitative data analysis for teachers and students using socio-environmental case studies from research data. An integrated mentor program for postdoctoral researchers will be used to facilitate career development. International research collaborations with the Generation Challenge Program and CGIAR institutes involved in drought research will add capacity building to agricultural systems worldwide.  Plant genotypes and all data developed in the project will be made available through a project website (http://cereal-drought.vbi.vt.edu/) that will allow interactive access to data and networks. Other publicly available genetic stocks used will be distributed by the respective originators with long term public repositories. Microarray and EST data will be deposited at GEO and NCBI, respectively.  All functional genomics data generated will be periodically deposited in Gramene and other public databases."

Experiments will be conducted using a model system for multi-host vector-borne pathogens: barley yellow dwarf viruses, aphid (insect) vectors that transmit them, and 20 wild grass host species.  First, greenhouse experiments will quantify the phenotypes of these grass species at low and high nitrogen (nutrient) availability.  Phenotypes will be quantified based on a suite of physiological traits including rate of photosynthesis, concentration of nutrients in leaves, leaf growth rate, and leaf lifespan.  Hosts with high nutrient concentrations are expected to also have high metabolic rates (comprising quick-return or QR phenotypes) while hosts with low nutrient concentrations will have low metabolic rates (slow-return or SR phenotypes).  Greenhouse experiments will also test whether QR phenotypes are more heavily fed upon by aphids, are more susceptible to infection by feeding aphids, and are better able to withstand the negative impacts of infection than SR phenotypes.  Field experiments will test whether QR phenotypes experience greater risk than SR phenotypes of disease transmission from other host species, and whether that risk depends on community context.  The field experiments will test whether increased nutrient availability, a major result of human activities, alters disease risk.  Predicting risk of disease is a critical ecological, agricultural, and public health goal.  Of particular concern are vector-borne diseases that infect multiple host species.  For example, West Nile virus is transmitted to humans (hosts) chiefly by mosquitoes (vectors) that fed on infected birds (hosts). Similarly, most pathogens of crops also infect wild plant host species.  Understanding sources of risk will improve management of diseases in wild and domestic plants and animals, as well as humans.  This project will involve both undergraduate and graduate students, and results will be communicated to citizens ranging from local high school students to public health professionals."

LOUIS,MO,63132-2918,UNITED STATES,,,47.074,2009,508688.0,,"Intellectual Merit     Plants constantly encounter pathogen attacks, especially from pathogenic fungi.  As part of various defense strategies to protect themselves against fungal attack, plants produce small antifungal proteins known as defensins.  Defensins are produced during the normal growth and development of plants and also in response to fungal attack.  Some of these proteins are potent inhibitors of fungal pathogens.  The PI and his research team have isolated two plant defensins, MsDef1 and MtDef4, from Medicago spp. that inhibit the growth of Fusarium graminearum, a fungal pathogen which causes devastating head blight disease in wheat and barley.  The constitutive expression of these proteins in transgenic plants affords strong protection from fungal attack.  A critical issue that needs to be addressed for effective use of these proteins in transgenic crops is understanding their structure-activity relationships, modes of action and the mechanisms by which fungal resistance to these proteins might emerge.  Preliminary data suggest that MsDef1 and MtDef4 have different modes of antifungal action and act independently on F. graminearum.  The planned research will identify the structural features and active sites that are essential for the unique antifungal activity of these proteins.  In addition, the fungal toxicity pathway utilized by each protein will be elucidated.  Broader ImpactsThe planned research will shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which antifungal plant defensins inhibit the growth of fungi.  This knowledge will enable an effective long-term use of these proteins for biological control of fungal pathogens in transgenic crops.  The research will also help establish the foundation for crop and mammalian safety, thus providing a greater sense  of security about the use of these proteins in transgenic crops.  Moreover, knowledge gained from the planned studies will facilitate future discovery of environmentally safe fungicides.  In addition, this project provides a training opportunity for a postdoc as well as minority undergraduates and high school students.  The PIs will continue to coordinate with and provide research opportunities through existing programs for students at the Danforth Center.  Participants will learn not only protein biochemistry and engineering, but also cutting-edge fungal genomics and proteomics technologies.  To enhance the wider scientific impact, presentations at professional meetings and publications in peer-reviewed journals are planned."

Oxalate oxidase catalyzes the carbon-carbon bond cleavage of oxalate to yield carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide.  Although there is currently no structural information available for oxalate oxidase from C. subvermispora (CsOxOx), sequence data and homology modeling indicate that it is the first manganese-containing bicupin enzyme identified that catalyzes this reaction.  The best characterized oxalate oxidases are from barley and wheat.  These enzymes, also known as germins, contain a single cupin domain and are therefore classified as monocupins.  Interestingly, CsOxOx shares greatest sequence homology with the bicupin microbial oxalate decarboxylases.  The short term goals of this research are to 1) to characterize the manganese-dependence of oxalate oxidase from C. subvermispora and 2) to identify the active site of the enzyme.  This research is expected to contribute to the understanding of how subtle structural changes effect remarkable functional variation in evolutionarily related proteins.  Characterizing the manganese-dependence of CsOxOx is significant in order to place this enzyme in the context of other oxalate degrading enzymes and that of other cupin proteins.  Identifying the active site of CsOxOx is an important problem.  If only one of the manganese centers mediates catalysis, critical questions are raised concerning the function (if any) of the second Mn-binding domain and the extent to which local protein structure in each domain results in differential reactivity.Broader ImpactsThis project is transforming Gainesville State College (a two-year unit of the University System of Georgia) from an institution that provides excellent coursework in the sciences into one that also provides students the opportunity to participate in meaningful and important laboratory research.  Undergraduate students carry out most of this work at Gainesville State College (GSC), but also have the opportunity to work with collaborators at the University of Florida and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL.  Student researchers are expected to communicate their research experiences to broad audiences through diverse media.  Student researchers also are expected to publish their results and report research findings at professional meetings and to the regional educational community.  Funds from this project are used to acquire, operate, and maintain research equipment that is not otherwise available at GSC."

Guisinger is  Using plant plastid genomes as the model system to develop bioinformatic tools for characterizing genome evolution.  This research is being conducted at the University of California-Berkeley under the sponsorships of Drs. Chelsea Specht and Rasmus Nielsen. Biology is moving into the post-genomics era.  In the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of genome data pubicly available; however, this has led to a bottleneck in terms of analyses. Over 100 land plant plastid (chloroplast) genomes are currently available on GenBank, and this is largely due to their relatively small size, conserved nature, and the development of inexpensive, high-throughput sequencing methods. Crop plants, especially members of the plant order Poales (including the grasses, i.e. wheat, maize, rice, oats, sorghum, sugarcane, and barley), have received particular attention. Several plant nuclear genomes have been sequenced, including rice, and projects are in progress to sequence six additional grass nuclear genomes. Ongoing genome sequencing projects promise to provide an avalanche of data available for researchers. This project is creating tools to automate the examination of rates and patterns of genome evolution using the Poales as a model system. Plastid genome data provide a densely sampled and phylogenetically resolved framework for developing and testing these new methods. The training objectives include developing computational and programming skills and enhancing the understanding of molecular evolution, plant biology, and bioinformatics. Broader impacts include utilizing an interdisciplinary approach leading to collaboration with researchers in the fields of biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics."

FischerProposal #IOS-0918037Towards the end of their life span, most plant leaves turn yellow, a highly visual process known as senescence. Senescence in annual crops is a gradual process, which starts with older leaves and, in cereals, progresses from the leaf tip towards the base. Its importance stems from the fact that a large fraction of the nutrients present in green leaves are remobilized from senescing leaves and retranslocated to surviving structures, such as seeds of annual plants. At present, the biological processes controlling senescence are incompletely understood. This project focuses on a particular gene (coding for a glycine-rich RNA-binding protein, or GRP), which is highly upregulated in leaves of early- as compared to late-senescing barley lines. The biological function of GRP in the control of leaf senescence will be investigated using a combination of physiological, molecular and biochemical approaches. Specifically, the investigators will (1) determine how the control of leaf senescence by GRP is influenced by plant developmental stage (comparing gene function before and after flowering occurs); (2) use a modern molecular biology approach to silence the GRP gene to compare leaf senescence in control plants with plants with reduced gene function; and (3) determine the three-dimensional structure of GRP, a common approach to advance our understanding of protein biological function. The investigators anticipate that this multi-pronged approach will substantially improve our understanding of GRP function in the control of cereal leaf senescence. Gained knowledge will be applicable to the development of crops with improved nutrient (fertilizer) use efficiency, higher quality (higher grain protein from nitrogen remobilization), and possibly higher yield (later senescence could lead to longer green leaf duration and photosynthetic carbon dioxide assimilation). This project will also provide training opportunities for two postdoctoral research associates and a graduate student."

Deborah I. Olszewski and Maysoon al-Nahar will lead an international team on a three-year project investigating late Pleistocene hunter-gatherer adaptations in the Jordanian Western Highlands (Transjordanian Plateau). During this period, changes in behavioral strategies used to exploit landscape resources led to long-term processes that resulted in one of the key economic transitions in prehistory, the origins of agriculture, which in turn fueled the development of civilizations and state-based societies. This Western Highlands project focuses on Early Epipaleolithic (ca. 25,000 to 18,000 calibrated years BP) hunter-gatherer strategies during a period of major climatic change, including the Last Glacial Maximum and a climatic amelioration, all of which impacted plant and animal communities. Previous research at Ohalo II, Sea of Galilee, which dates to the Last Glacial Maximum, documented extensive use of wild cereals (barley). What is not clear, however, is the extent to which intensive use of wild cereals was a strategic economic pattern for these groups across the region and whether this strategy persisted through time or was reintroduced just prior to the onset of food production economies.Much of the Jordanian landscape is currently under-explored from this perspective. To this end, the Western Highlands project will investigate three sites that are situated in different ecological zones - Mediterranean forest, Irano-Turanian steppe, and open parkland - covering the Late Glacial Maximum and the succeeding climatic rebound. Specific tasks include 1) mapping sites with a Total Station; 2) point proveniencing all cultural materials (stone artifacts, fauna, shell, etc.) and samples recovered during excavations with the Total Station for accurate locations and to examine site taphonomy; 3) specialist analysis of fauna and samples for pollen, phytoliths, macrobotanical remains, radiocarbon dating, and geoarchaeology, which will yield data on subsistence, chronology, and landscape use; 4)  field analyzing stone artifacts which will inform about site activities and mobility; 5) labeling and properly curating all cultural materials; and, 6) storing all project data, including images, in databases, as well as making this information available on a project website which will include a public-oriented component (including a section in Arabic). Understanding Early Epipaleolithic decisions and strategy options regarding food resource use in different habitats is the primary intellectual merit of this project and a crucial step that will provide new and important data relevant to how hunter-gatherer settlement and subsistence strategies are modified in the face of climatic and paleoenvironmental changes, leading to more informed insight into how domestication economies may have originated.In terms of its broader impacts, the Western Highlands project is designed as an international partnership between Jordanian and non-Jordanian (U.S., France, Croatia, U.K.) participants at all levels from the Principal Investigators to the student members. In particular, each Jordanian student will be paired with a non-Jordanian student; this will facilitate learning different archaeological methods from each other, as well as result in enhanced cultural understanding. All student participants will be trained in Total Station use, lithic analysis, excavation techniques, and Jordanian prehistory prior to the advent of agriculture. Additionally, the PIs and specialists will offer opportunities for students to use the project materials for theses, and encourage the students to collaborate as co-authors on project publications."

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).The origin of flowering plants represents one of the most significant evolutionary radiations of plants during the last 475 million years.  With over 250,000 extant species, angiosperms are the largest and most diverse group of plants to have evolved.  It has long been assumed that the first flowering plants formed a nutrient-storing and embryo-nourishing tissue called endosperm that is derived from a second fertilization event during the process of double fertilization.  Indeed, many evolutionary biologists have suggested that endosperm represents a key innovation associated with the ecological and evolutionary ?success? and radiation of flowering plants.  Although poorly studied, there is fragmentary evidence that many of the most ancient lineages of angiosperms do not rely upon an endosperm as the primary embryo-nourishing tissue within the seed. It is the explicit goal of the project to study the embryological processes within seeds of ancient extant lineages of flowering plants in order to reconstruct the pattern of embryo-nourishing behavior of the first angiosperms.  The comparative developmental data to be derived from this project have the potential to lead to the discovery of a  missing link  associated with the transition from the ancestors of flowering plants to the earliest angiosperms.  Among the broader impacts of this project, it should be noted that two out of every three calories consumed by humans worldwide are derived from the endosperm of flowering plants (e.g., rice, maize, barley, wheat, coconut).  Thus, examination of seed development in ancient lineages of angiosperms will provide basic biological information that may ultimately be relevant in an applied and agricultural context.  In addition, the questions to be addressed in this project are sufficiently basic to warrant the expectation that the findings will contribute to undergraduate and graduate curriculum development at the national and international levels, as has been the case in the past.  Discoveries from this project can be expected to be widely disseminated to the general public.  During the last grant cycle, research findings were publicized in a number of media outlets including CBS News, USA Today, Natural History Magazine (invited article), New Scientist, Science News, the Telegraph (U.K.), as well as a variety of websites from around the world.  Finally, this project can be expected to contribute to the development of human resources in the sciences and the advancement of members of underrepresented groups in the sciences.  The Friedman lab has consistently included a high proportion of women and members of underrepresented groups, all of who aspire to careers in the life sciences as educators (two recent members of the lab have gone on to teach secondary science in public schools) and/or practicing scientists (the most recent Ph.D. student to graduate is Hispanic).  In essence, while the vast majority of funds associated with this project will go to support the solution of basic and longstanding scientific questions, these funds will also be central to the development of a few of the next generation of biologists and teachers."

John Steinberg, Heather Trigg, Douglas Bolender and their colleagues will use pollen samples to assess the parameters of environmental change around Viking Age farmsteads in Skagafjörður, Iceland.  This work, if successful, will be a prelude to a larger project where the sampling strategy and analysis methods developed during the 2009 season would be applied across a whole range of socio-economic contexts and through the profound changes of Viking Age Iceland.The PI's seek to develop pollen sampling protocols and analysis strategies for investigating local environmental variation during the Viking Age in Iceland.  The pollen record can provide a wealth of information about past regional and local environments and how they have changed.  Properly assessing these changes around archaeological sites requires a high sampling density (temporal and spatial) as well as suitable counts of tree and non-arboreal pollen.  Variation in these parameters can substantially change quality of data recovered beyond issues of time, cost, and area represented.  Data collected in this experimental season will assess these parameters in preparation for a much larger future micro-environmental reconstruction project that would incorporate these methods into a regional study of settlement sequence and variation in farmstead production strategies. To establish sampling protocols and analytic strategies the team will investigate two farmsteads in the same region: Reynistaður and Medalheimur.  Reynistadur, was one of the first farms settled in the region and was politically and economically prominent during the Viking Age and medieval periods. In contrast, Medalheimur was, in all likelihood, a poor sharecropper farm.  The Skagafjörður Archaeological Settlement Survey (SASS) has extensively investigated both farmsteads as part of three previous grants from NSF.  Pollen samples will be obtained from already identified archaeological and natural deposits at these two sites. Pollen results will be compared with macrobotanical and faunal evidence.  The group will take pollen samples from occupational contexts (middens & dwelling floors), agricultural fields and pastures, and at nearby bogs.  At both targeted farms there is macrobotantical evidence of barley consumption, and at Reynistaður, a suggestion of local barley production.  Barley does not release a great deal of pollen and it does not travel far.  A goal of this proposal is to determine if the team can identify cereal pollen and if so, the location of its production. If not, the potential of using a spectrum of pollen that is associated with grain agriculture as a proxy for local production, will be evaluated. The explicit comparison of the environmental history of successful large farmsteads against small, poor and sometimes unsuccessful farmsteads will allow the research team to answer basic questions about the intersecting roles of landscape change, farm production, and political economy in the early history of Iceland.  From that data, The PI's and their colleagues hope to begin to understand the role of the fragile arctic environment in the social evolution of Viking Age chiefdoms to medieval manorial states."

Arabidopsis serves an outstanding model system due to the numerous and varied experimental tools in functional genomics that are available. The transfer of knowledge from Arabidopsis to other plant species, and beyond to other organisms including humans, is increasing due to the efforts of the research community and the leveraging of advances and resources. This conference provides an opportunity for the exchange of ideas among the numerous and diverse researchers of the international Arabidopsis community and beyond to the larger plant community. This year's conference will include a number of speakers whose research involves wheat, rice, maize, and barley. The conference will include a broad range of important and current topics: Genome Organization/The RNA World, Development, Cell Biology, Systems Biology, Signaling in Development, Bioenergy, Environmental Responses, Plant Defense, Plant Growth Regulators, Natural Variation, Hot Topics and Novel Tools/Resources. Important components of the conference include the presentation of current research by approximately 90 speakers (both invited and from selected abstracts) and 600 posters as well as several community organized workshops where smaller groups can explore more specific topics in greater detail. Broader Impact A particular strength of the ICAR lies in its ability to enhance the exchange of information at the forefront of Arabidopsis research worldwide, creating new networks and collaborations. The conference program and abstracts will be publicly available on the conference website and permanently archived. The ICAR also has a long and successful history of being inclusive of young scientists as well as women and minorities. Support of this year's proposal will provide full funding for several underrepresented US minorities and/or faculty as well as partial funding of travel expenses for additional young domestic faculty, postdoctoral scholars, or graduate students. A special luncheon to acknowledge recipients of US-sponsored minority funding and to establish an informal networking venue as well as an  Emerging Scientists Luncheon  is planned. Many of the oral presentations at the sessions and workshops will be given by graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty. This will promote the training of students and postdocs and provide important opportunities for career development.

Seed pods of canola (Brassica spp.) delimit a hypoxic microenvironment around developing embryos. During normal ripening, this microenvironment slowly becomes more oxygenated, and embryo chlorophyll is also degraded, resulting in yellow seeds at harvest. An ill-timed frost disrupts this degreening process, resulting in green seed canola, a serious agricultural problem (reduced oil quality). The phytohormone ABA has been implicated in this process. Because a recent study in barley has shown that embryo sensitivity to ABA is greatly increased by hypoxia, it is imperative to investigate the interaction of oxygen and ABA during seed development. We hypothesize that the non-lethal freezing that induces green seed canola causes a transient rise in pod oxygen at a time when the developing seed would normally be hypoxic, promoting ABA catabolism. We propose to characterize the microenvironment induced by non-lethal freezing and investigate the impact of oxygen on ABA metabolism by using both physiologic and metabolomics tools. The project addresses the program priority for hormonal regulation of growth and development, specifically crosstalk between ABA and oxygen in developing seeds. Because canola is the third most important edible oilseed crop and has growing acreage, the project directly addresses CSREES goal #4: to enhance protection and safety of the Nation's agriculture and food supply."

The latest threat arose in 1999 when a new highly virulent strain, Ug99 (race TTKSK) was identified in Uganda and has since spread into Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen and recently Iran. Ug99 and its variants threaten most of the barley and wheat grown worldwide. The research proposed herein will initiate the work of identifying and characterizing avirulence genes in stem rust races.

The US malting industry has invested heavily in new malting plants in Montana and Idaho, and this industry demands barley of superb quality for use in their plants. Water is a limiting resource in the Northern Plains, and much of the barley that is used in these new malting plants is produced under rainfed conditions. Our collaborative program is increasing the reliability of rainfed quality barley production by producing varieties that better withstand drought stress. We do this through the development of barley varieties with genes contributing to stress tolerance during grainfill, and by developing winter barley varieties that avoid late-season drought. New agronomic practices that enhance the survival of winter barley varieties, and evaluation of pest and pathogen resistance of our potential varieties contribute to our ability to release new, improved varieties. In 2009 we identified and characterized two barley genotypes that produce straw that is high in fructan, a water-soluble carbohydrate that is easily digested and fermented by the yeast, Kluyveromyces marxiana. We obtained funds from the Montana Department of Agriculture to construct a pilot plant. We are currently scaling up our straw fermentation technology to determine the potential of this technology for on-farm fuel ethanol production."

There are 10 research projects in seven states that into three general classes of endeavor for this fiscal year:  Quality means value ,  Biotic Stress Resistance , and  Abiotic Stress Resistance . Barley has unique properties as a human food, as an animal feed, and - of course - as the base of beer. Researchers in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and Wisconsin are leveraging Barley Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP) funds to systematically characterize the genes, proteins, and metabolic pathways involved in malting quality in contemporary and ancestral barley germplasm. Genetic resistance is the most cost-effective and environmentally sound approach to controlling diseases. By locating and characterizing the genes that confer resistance, and understanding how these genes work, researchers in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Washington are developing tools for resistance breeding that will benefit all of American agriculture. Genetic resistance is also the most cost-effective and environmentally sound approach to dealing with abiotic stresses. Greater winterhardiness would allow barley acreage to expand into new geographic areas and assure would assure more sustainable production. By locating and characterizing the genes that confer resistance to low temperature stresses, and understanding how these genes work, researchers in Minnesota, Ohio, and Oregon are developing tools for resistance breeding that will benefit all of American agriculture. Finding and characterizing a gene in barley can provide essential clues for finding similar genes in other crop plants."

IR-4 priority settings, crop profiles, and Pest Management Strategic Plans are not available for summer fallow. As zero tillage practices become more common, herbicide use will continue to increase. Currently, mechanical tillage is the only practical alternative to chemical fallow. However, tillage decreases residue cover, resulting in increased soil erosion. Strategic grazing of grain stubble and weeds by sheep offers an alternative to traditional stubble and weed management, and no-till biomass reduction for seed bed preparation with the added benefit of not negatively influencing soil nutrient cycling or increasing erosion potential. In addition, sheep grazing summer fallow may significantly reduce use and thus selection pressure for glyphosate resistant weeds by precluding the need to control weeds with glyphosate. Our goal is the profitable incorporation of sheep into grain production systems to reduce pesticide and fossil fuel use in fallow and stubble management. Our objectives are: 1: Compare two cropping systems and three management systems on: Above ground and seed bank weed and volunteer crop community composition, The crop systems are 1) Continuous spring wheat. 2) Three year rotation, spring wheat ? spring planted forage pea/hay barley intercrop? summer fallow in a three year rotation with each component present every year. Within each crop rotation, the management systems are: 1) No-till with sheep grazing to manage summer fallow, crop residues, and to harvest the forage crop; 2) Minimum tillage with herbicides use to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage for seed bed preparation; 3) Conventional Tillage used to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage used for seed bed preparation. 2: Using production and input data, compare profitability and cash flow of our two crop rotations and three management systems. We will publish and communicate to both academic and producer clientele results and potential economic and biological advantages of incorporating sheep grazing stubble and weeds into sustainable grain farming systems. Our preliminary results indicate no differences for grain yield among summer fallow systems. Our interdisciplinary team of scientists anticipates a positive long term biological and economical outcome from the integrated system of weed management by sheep grazing, and significant reduction in herbicide use in the Northern Great Plains. The proposed system encourages profitable cooperation between diverse agricultural enterprises by linking a source of inexpensive feed for sheep producers with a successful pest control method for grain farmers."

Many of Kentucky's family farms have been highly dependent upon tobacco as a primary source of income. But the number of farms growing tobacco in Kentucky declined 72% from nearly 30,000 in 2002 to 8,112 in 2007. The market value of tobacco sold in Kentucky in 2008 was $382 million, down from $674 million in 2000. Many of Kentucky's farms are small, averaging 164 acres, compared to the U.S. average of 418 acres. There were 85,300 farms in the state in 2008. According to the 2007 census, 67 percent of all Kentucky farms sold less than $10,000 worth of agricultural products. Interest in alternative crops, including horticultural enterprises, has risen dramatically. This interest continues to increase because of the tobacco quota buyout. Horticultural crops offer Kentucky growers potential alternatives. A number of farms have successfully initiated commercial vegetable enterprises. Other farms are seeing the potential success of horticultural crops, but many lack the technical knowledge and management skills for immediate success with these production/marketing systems. Kentucky's grain producers are searching for ways to improve the market value of the crops they grow. Examples of potential specialty grain types include edamame (green vegetable soybean) and soft white winter wheat. An emphasis on bioenergy has increased the need for research on a variety of crops that have potential for energy production, including hulless barley, sweet sorghum, and biomass crops such as switchgrass. Growth in the organic food industry has led to a need for research on organic production of both horticultural and grains crops. This project is designed to develop and deliver Kentucky farmers the knowledge they need to assess new crop opportunities. Eleven horticulture and specialty grains projects will be conducted by researchers at the University of Kentucky as part of this overall New Crop Opportunities, KY, project. The New Crop Opportunities Center will feature a Web site for 24-hour access to information on new crops for Kentucky, including the horticultural and specialty grains crops that are the focus of the Center's research. Center staff will answer questions from Extension agents and farmers, and will distribute new crop information at field days and conferences. The Center will facilitate the packaging of information from its research and other sources for dissemination. The expected outcomes/impacts of this project will be an increase in knowledge among Kentucky farmers and county extension agents about production and marketing systems for a variety of new crops. This increase in knowledge should allow farmers to make informed decisions about which new crops to try, and how to market those crops, based on information available on the Center's research projects, as well as through its crop and marketing profiles. Anticipated benefits include greater profitability for Kentucky's farmers as they successfully transition to a variety of crops that are new to them."

ND is number one in US production of 10 crops - durum wheat and hard red spring wheat, barley, oats, flax, all dry edible beans, dry edible peas, lentils, sunflower, and canola - is third in sugar beet, fourth in potato, and ninth in soybean (ND Ag. Statistics No. 77, 2008). The value of all crops ranges from $ 4 to $ 6.5 billion/year (ND Ag. Statistics No. 77, 2008). Pest problems may severely impact yield and quality any given year, threatening the economy of the state and region, and export capacity. Examples: Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley resulted in several billion dollars loss to the state's economy from 1993-2005 (Nganje et. al., 2004; McMullen, 2005); other pests impact crops each year (Sugarbeet Research and Extension Report, http://www.sbreb.org; ND Crop and Pest Report (http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/aginfo/entomology/ndsucpr/index.htm). ND producers use pesticides as one management tool to combat pest outbreaks. For example, in 2004, 45.4% of cropland was sprayed with herbicides, 2.3% with insecticides, and 5.4% with fungicides (Pesticide Use and Pest Management Practices Survey in ND, 2004). This survey also showed that ND producers increased their use of IPM practices, such as use of field scouting and forecasting models, between 2000 and 2004 surveys. ND has a short growing season and a harsh winter climate. Citizens place high value on urban plantings which can survive the winter and which are relatively free of pest problems. A recent electronic questionnaire about urban IPM needs, sent to extension educators in 8 states of the High Plains region, including ND, indicated that almost 40% of their pest questions. This IPM project addresses those critical needs, by coordinating a statewide IPM program, providing collaborative efforts in pest management education across two states for two key crops, wheat and soybean, by demonstrating the value of integrated strategies for controlling a key disease of wheat, Fusarium head blight, by supporting the valuable resource of the NDSU Diagnostic Lab that services agriculture, homeowners, and the ornamental industry, and by increasing the outreach capabilities of the Urban IPM programs."

High productivity sorghum as an ethanol feedstock will benefit the environment by reducing greenhouse gases and will benefit rural areas of the U.S. by stimulating local production of a high-value crop and associated ethanol refineries. Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. has identified rice genes that adapted during rice domestication. We have shown that these genes have multiple effects on yield and other commercially important traits in rice lines and hybrids. We have identified equivalents of these rice genes native to other Grass family species (corn and barley), and have shown that these genes control yield and other traits in these species as well. Sorghum is a member of the Grass family, so we hypothesize the equivalent genes native to sorghum may control commercially important traits in sorghum, such as yield of grain, sugar, and biomass. We will evaluate the sorghum candidate genes for association with these traits. We will sequence the sorghum candidate genes in a panel of 200 sorghum lines, and perform allelic association analysis to detect trait associations. If successful, these genes should be excellent tools for breeding higher yielding sorghum and for genetically engineering sorghum using natural or derived alleles of genes that are native to sorghum, which should be more environmentally acceptable than genetically modified plants involving foreign genes."

(Pullman)NP216 Cross-location project associated with Pendleton, OR 5356-13210-003-00D(Long).Approach:1A&B.  Several multi-year field studies will be conducted in numerous locations in the low to intermediate rainfall zones to evaluate seeding date, rate, and methodologies for winter and spring canola in order to improve crop establishment. Data collected include seed-zone water, soil profile water storage, weed populations, crop yield, and oil and meal content.1C.  A multi-year study will be conducted in the high-rainfall zone to compare grain yield and wild oat suppressive ability of facultative wheat planted in late fall with that planted in April/May the following spring. Within each time of planting, wheat will be grown non-treated or treated with recommended or half the recommended rate of a wild oat herbicide. Wild oat population and seed production will be measured prior to grain harvest and crop yield and quality (dockage) will be determined. Consumptive water use will be determined with gravimetric soil profile samples before planting and after harvest.1D. Spring forage triticale will be planted in a naturally infested field of Russian thistle in a 2 to 3-year study. Half the plots will be sprayed with a herbicide to control Russian thistle and the weed will be allowed to grow in the remaining plots. Forage quality of the triticale will be analyzed with and without the weed and the total weed and crop biomass will be weighed. Total systems production costs will be determined and crop water use will be calculated.2A&B. Field experiments will be conducted to evaluate the performance of diversified cropping systems in the low, intermediate, and high rainfall zones. A 3-yr rotation of winter wheat, spring canola, and forage winter triticale will be compared to a rotation of winter wheat, spring barley and spring pea in the high rainfall zone while a 3-yr rotation of winter triticale, spring canola, and fallow will be compared to a rotation of winter wheat, spring barley, and fallow in the intermediate rainfall zone. The bioenergy and forage potential of two perennial species grown along stream channels will be evaluated within all rainfall zones. Biomass, grain yield, and economic and risk analyses will provide insight into overall performance.4B.  Specific themes will be defined that can be flexibly used to derive Agroecological Zones (AEZ) based on criteria that are relevant to the question asked. Three basic steps to design and develop relevant AEZ will be used: 1) Generate raster surfaces of biophysical and socio-economic variables through spatial interpolation of data; 2) Generate a spatial framework of AEZ by combining basic raster themes into more integrated variables; and 3) Characterize spatial units in terms of relevant themes such as zones separating commonly practiced cropping systems. After AEZ development, model calibration, and long-term field studies synthesis, what-if scenarios will be developed and current and future cropping systems will be evaluated. In collaboration with scientists directly involved with specific modeling we will apply calibrated models to long-term data sets to corroborate these models under a wide-range of regional conditions.

F. graminearum causes head blight of wheat and barley and stalk and ear rot of corn. The severe economic effect of this disease on Midwestern growers is due to the reduced grain yield caused by the fungus, and the presence of the mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol, in contaminated grain. The fungus is spread during the growing season by the forcible ejection of spores (ascospores) from small fungal fruiting bodies (perithecia) on the surface of the crop residues. When the airborne spores land on flowers, they infect and begin to colonize the developing grain. Elimination of the ascospores would result in vast reduction in disease. There are several other fungal diseases of Michigan crops that rely on forcible ascospore discharge to initiate the disease cycle. These include apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), white mold of beans (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), brown rot of peaches (Monilinia fructicola) and purple spot of asparagus (Stemphylium vesicarium), as well as others. The mechanism of forcible discharge is not clear in any fungus, but we have used Fusarium graminearum as a model system to develop an understanding of how small cellular cannons called asci function to fire their spores. We have made progress in this arena and have identified several methods to inhibit discharge in this fungus. We are beginning to explore the common effects of these methods on other fungi that similarly launch their spores. This project will investigate the mechanism of forcible ascospore discharge and how the phenomenon can be inhibited. MAES delineated 5 target areas that are the major research foci for the experiment station. This research directly impact 3 of these areas. Since F. graminearum produces two major mycotoxins, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol, elimination of the disease would result in better food safety and health to the people of Michigan. In addition, the severe economic consequences of the disease through low grain weight and mycotoxin contamination, which impact grain value, would be reduced by this research, enhancing the profitability of the grain. Finally, knowledge of how to control ascospore discharge could be potentially applied to all pathogens which rely on this dispersal mechanism. This information would help to control the spread of invasive pathogens."

Crop production represents 28% of KS's agricultural product revenue, and the other 72% is derived primarily from livestock sales. KS produces the most wheat and grain sorghum of all other states, is the fifth leading state for forage production, is tenth for corn production, and eleventh for soybean production (USDA, 2007a). Crop production plays a significant role in KSAEs economy and our national food security. Crop production must remain economically and environmentally sustainable to maintain this important industry. Cropping systems research is required for meeting the increasing demand for agricultural commodities, increasing input costs coupled with historically stagnant commodity prices, and declining rural populations. It is inevitable that large regions of KS and the US will have to transition from full irrigation to limited irrigation or dryland production in the future, yet maintain or increase crop production to meet the ever increasing food, fiber, and bio-fuel demand (KS v. CO, 2001; Schneekloth et al. 1995). In order to maintain the viability of agriculture production, sustainable limited irrigation and dryland cropping systems must be developed. Dryland cropping systems in the semi-arid Great Plains rely on fallow for storing soil moisture for following crop (Anderson et al. 1999). Fallow efficiency has increased from about 19% in 1916 to 33% in 1975 to 40% currently (Greb 1979; Peterson et al. 1996). Fallow efficiency was increased by many factors including improved pest management, particularly effective and timely weed control; increased chemical fallow and no-till production; increasing stubble amount and height; and reduced fallow period length (Peterson et al. 1996; Tanaka and Aase, 1987). Of these factors, reducing the fallow period duration has had the greatest impact on increasing fallow efficiency (Peterson et al. 1996). Fallow efficiency is currently limited in the Great Plains by the amount of residue remaining on the soil after harvest, which averages approximately 3 ton/A for the region (Peterson et al. 1996). Since 2006 the price of many commodities including corn, wheat, and barley increased almost 100% due to a current short world supply and increased bio-fuel production. This has increased the demand for corn and at least in the short term has resulted in a large increase in price. There is a concern that the increase in corn price will result in feed costs that are too high for livestock producers and feedlots to remain economically profitable (Swanson, 2007). If feed costs remain high, forage crops and alternative feed crops will be needed in feedlot rations and cow-calf operations. This is particularly important since 72% of KSAEs agricultural economy is derived from livestock sales (USDA, 2007a). Ultimately finding methods of sustainable dryland crop production that maximize fallow efficiency, meet the demands for food, fiber, and bio-fuel, and support KSAEs livestock industry will help sustain the viability of producers, local rural communities, natural resources, and the viability of the surrounding region."

Stored product losses resulting from insect infestation are extensive and are usually associated with the occurrence of internal feeders such as lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica Fabricious) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) and rice weevils (Sitophilus oryzae Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The reasons why psocids have only recently risen to prominence as serious pests of stored grain in Australia are not fully known. However, it has been suggested that the reduction of residual pesticides to treat grain and structures is a major factor (CSIRO GRL 2003). It's also hypothesized that phosphine and other measures currently used are effective against other insect pests (beetles) but not psocids thereby leaving psocids free from competition and predation (CSIRO GRL 2003). It is also suggested that because psocids are highly mobile insects, they will reinvade fumigated grain before other insects; in the absence of competition and predation, psocid population growth is explosive resulting in spectacular outbreaks (CSIRO GRL 2003). In relation to grain shipments for export, psocid infestation can lead to serious financial penalties. Psocid infestations also lead to significant weight losses in stored grain. They suggest that because psocids erode the surface layers of grains and damage is difficult to see, their status as pests is often underestimated. In ition, infestation of seed grain by psocids can lead to reduced seed germination as a result of psocid preference for grain germ (Kucerova 2002). A major source of concern is the finding that psocid infestations in grain storages, grain processing facilities, and product warehouses could exacerbate other stored-product pest problems (Opit, unpublished data). When psocids are present in large numbers, they taint the food on which they are living, thereby deteriorating the quality of stored commodities (Turner 1994, Kucerova 2002). Psocids also spread spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms and their importance as a health hazard stems from this problem (Kucerova 2002). Psocids are persistent pests in grain storages, grain processing facilities, and product warehouses (Rees and Walker 1990). The reasons they are considered stored-product pests have already been stated. Psocids are highly resistant to entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria; this may be due to cuticular fatty amides that decrease hydrophobicity and static charge, thereby reducing adhesion by microorganisms (Turner 1988, Lord and Howard 2004). The study on diet showed that corn, milo, barley, oats, wheat, and rice are all suitable for rapid multiplication of psocid populations (Opit and Throne 2008b). As already mentioned, little research has been conducted on the biology and ecology of stored-product psocids worldwide and this presents a challenge to the development of effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs to mitigate their economic impact. Without user-friendly sampling protocols that can be recommended by extension personnel and county educators, population-based management programs will not gain widespread acceptance."

At one extreme are tropical-climate cereals such as maize and rice that suffer chilling injury when exposed to 10C for an extended period; while at the other extreme are the temperate-climate cereals such as wheat, barley, and rye that are capable of surviving the temperate-climate winter. This ability to survive the temperate-climate winter is known as winter hardiness. Two key genetic loci are now known to affect winter hardiness, Frost Resistance-1 (FR-1) and FR-2. The FR-1 locus is tightly linked to VRN-1, a gene that determines whether these cereal plants require an extended period of low, nonfreezing temperatures to induce flowering, while FR-2 encompasses a cluster of genes encoding C-Repeat Binding Factor (CBF) proteins, which are DNA binding proteins that activate genetic and biochemical pathways conferring freezing tolerance. A question of fundamental importance in the quest to understand how these cereals survive freezing temperatures is whether FR 1 and VRN 1 are the manifestation of the same gene, or are the affects of two tightly-linked and inseparable genes. Recent studies also indicate that VRN-1/FR-1 is a negative regulator of the CBF genes at FR-2 suggesting that an important aspect of winter hardiness is mediated not only by these two loci but through interactions between them. Multiple lines of evidence also suggest that FR-1 and FR-2 affect drought tolerance, a trait much more difficult to measure, quantify, and breed for than low temperature tolerance. Goals of the work proposed here are (1) to better understand the nature of the interaction between VRN-1/FR-1 and FR-2, (2) to gain greater insight into the regulation of the CBF genes at FR-2 in the absence of the negative affects of VRN-1/FR-1, (3) and to integrate this information with a more complete structural analysis of the FR-2 locus. These studies will contribute fundamental knowledge that will allow for the enhanced productivity of cereal plants through increased tolerances to freezing and drought conditions."

These molecules regulate cellular activities by inhibiting the synthesis or function of longer RNA molecules. This project will identify small RNAs from important crop and model systems, including rice and maize, together representing two of the most important staple foods for the majority of the world's population. Although small RNAs were only found a few years ago to constitute an important regulatory force in animals and plants, several small RNAs have been shown to be associated with plant development and responses to stress. This indicates that small RNAs exist in crop plants such as rice that help plants respond optimally to various environmental and biological stresses. We have developed technologies for identifying and measuring small RNAs at a very large scale. Using this approach, we will identify and measure the changes in the small RNAs that altered in rice in response to different types of environmental or pathogen stress, and understand the mechanisms that regulate the biogenesis or activity of these small RNAs. These small RNAs may regulate other genes during the response to these important stresses. We postulate that some of these small RNAs will be conserved in plant species, and we will test this hypothesis by evaluating several examples from the NPGS using standard techniques. This project has the potential to improve the utility of germplasm in the NPGS with important and novel genetic information about traits of agronomic interest. Because of the similarities among genomes of cereal crops, identification of the genomic locations or genes encoding these small RNAs will also help identify the locations of the homologous genes in other crops such as wheat, and barley."

Mycotoxins can be produced in grain during storage or processing, but are most frequently associated with fungal infection that occur before harvest. Environmental factors that determine fungal infection and mycotoxin production are complex. Generally, a basal level of mycotoxins is present in US grain; however, in some years, environmental conditions lead to localized or widespread outbreaks of mycotoxin contamination. However, there is no organized monitoring system for tracking the incidence and severity of mycotoxin contamination at either the national or regional levels. Although breeding and transgenic technologies have shown promise for reducing the risk of mycotoxin contamination of grain, to date no commercial variety of any major US crop is available with either genetic or transgenic resistance to mycotoxin contamination. The need, as indicated by stakeholders, and likely impacts from completion of the work. For grain and livestock producers, the most important issues are preventing mycotoxin contamination and reducing the effects of mycotoxins on livestock. For grain buyers and food processors, the primary issue is being able to rapidly assess the quality of grain as pertaining to mycotoxins and mycotoxigenic fungi. The worst-case scenario for these stakeholders is to own millions of bushels of corn contaminated with unacceptable levels of aflatoxins and fumonisins, or wheat with excessive concentrations of deoxynivalenol (DON). Rapid methods to detect mycotoxins at the first points of sale (elevators) as well as methods to detect mycotoxigenic fungi in the commodity (e.g. DON-producing Fusarium in barley) would address these concerns. Additionally, these stakeholders need cost-effective methods to detoxify mycotoxins and prevent further deterioration of contaminated grain. The lowering of tolerance limits for mycotoxins in overseas markets has increased the burden for grain buyers and food processors; currently, levels of mycotoxins that are acceptable for some US products are unacceptable in European and Asian markets resulting in non tarrif trade barriers. New methods to monitor and treat contaminated grain would benefit domestic consumers and would allow American commodities to compete more effectively in foreign markets. Finally, workers who are responsible for animal and human health need information about the toxicity, carcinogenicity, modes of action, and biomarkers of exposure and disease for all categories of mycotoxins. This information would be used to train health-care providers to identify exposure and treat related disease, as well as to develop accurate risk assessment recommendations."

Wheat quality will be analyzed for its milling, dough and end-use product quality. Barley and triticale will be evaluated mainly for their protein content as both as used extensively for feed grains. It is well known that the environment plays a key role in grain quality, so samples will be collected from two or more environments. We will also determine the effect of compositing grain from different environments to learn if the composite sample represents the average of the environments, thus greatly reducing the number of samples needed to be analyzed. This project is expected to support the development of new cultivars, germplasm, and scientific publications. Plant breeding is one of the most accountable sciences and can be readily evaluated by the acceptance of the cultivars released. Currently, 57% of the wheat grown in Nebraska has been released by the current breeding team. In the next five years, we expect this percentage to increase.

Small grain cereals (winter and spring wheat and spring barley) account for more than 80% of the acreage annually. Traditional rotation crops are pea and lentil. This has prompted many of the region's growers to investigate alternative crops to avoid the disease build up and other problems associated with monoculture cereal production. Brassicaceae crops such as canola, rapeseed and mustard have shown potential as good rotational crops. The reasons behind high cereal yield following Brassicaceae crops is as yet not fully understood, and are almost certainly a combination of several factors, including; a break from monocot crop production; long tap roots that break up soil compaction; improved water percolation; high plant biomass that improves the soil physical structure and water holding capacity, and reduces erosion; and these crops have glucosinolates, which break down in the soil to produce toxic pesticidal substances . Breeding efforts resulting from this proposal will develop superior Brassica oilseed and mustard cultivars that are highly adapted to a wide range of dryland and irrigated regions of Idaho and other U.S. regions.

The specific objectives are: 1. Assess behavioral responses of aphids to plants at various stages of the disease progression using three pathosystems as models (PLRV- Potato-GPA; BYDV-Wheat-BCOA). 2. Assess if PLRV infection affects virus titer, VIV production, and the resulting distribution of GPA within the plant. 3. Examine effects of VIV on among plant movement by aphids and spread of virus in both pathosystems. 4. Compare responses of viruliferous and nonviruliferous aphids to virus-infected and non-infected plants. Expected outcomes include a research community better informed about the roles of plant cues in spread of important disease causing viruses in crops. This will direct efforts to improve management of aphid-vectored viruses by manipulating their behavior through various means, including plant breeding. Vector management will remain central in efforts to limit virus impacts on key economic and staple crops in the USA and worldwide. Methods based on sound understanding of the biology of these systems are needed and can result from this project."

This is accomplished by selecting parents with desirable characteristics, selectively mating parents, generating families of breeding lines from each mating or cross, and evaluating those progeny for important traits. The most desirable progeny are further evaluated to identify new cultivars or selected as parents to begin the cycle again. For most traits, plant breeders use phenotypic selection (directly measuring the trait(s) of interest) to identify superior individuals. Recently, marker assisted selection (MAS) has been used to increase the efficiency of breeding programs. MAS involves mapping the location of an important gene or genes and using nearby genetic markers (DNA sequence) to track the gene in progeny of breeding populations. This technology can often increase the efficiency and decrease the cost of conducting selection in a plant breeding program. Traditional MAS strategies have proven useful for simply inherited traits, but have generally failed to improve complex traits controlled by many genes. Genomic selection differs from this traditional approach because it uses many genetic markers distributed across the entire genome to predict the performance of a given breeding line. The most valuable asset of genomic selection is that it can dramatically shorten the breeding cycle ? the time from making a cross between two parents to when a progeny of that cross is used as a parent in a new cross. For many programs a breeding cycle will be three to seven years. Using genomic selection this can be shortened to as little as one year. Genomic selection has been investigated through computer simulation, but has not been empirically tested in a plant breeding program. The goal of this project is to measure the effectiveness of genomic selection in a spring barley and winter wheat breeding program."

As zero tillage practices become more common, herbicide use will continue to increase. Currently, mechanical tillage is the only practical alternative to chemical fallow. However, tillage decreases residue cover, resulting in increased soil erosion. Strategic grazing of grain stubble and weeds by sheep offers an alternative to traditional stubble and weed management, and no-till biomass reduction for seed bed preparation with the added benefit of not negatively influencing soil nutrient cycling or increasing erosion potential. In addition, sheep grazing summer fallow may significantly reduce use and thus selection pressure for glyphosate resistant weeds by precluding the need to control weeds with glyphosate. Our goal is the profitable incorporation of sheep into grain production systems to reduce pesticide and fossil fuel use in fallow and stubble management. Our objectives are: 1: Compare two crop systems and three management systems (in 3 year rotation only) on: a) Grain and forage production b) weed composition, c) Population dynamics of two problematic weed species, d) Nitrogen cycling, e) Abundances and diversity of pest and beneficial insects associated with different crops, bordering crops(annual, perennial, and fallow), and fallow treatments, g) Abundances and activities of pollinators associated with alfalfa and flowering weeds. The crop rotations are 1) Continuous spring wheat - long term project control. 2) Three year rotation, spring wheat - spring planted forage pea/hay barley intercrop- summer fallow in a three year rotation with each component present every year. Within the three year rotation the management systems are: 1) No-till with sheep grazing to manage summer fallow, crop residues, and to harvest the forage crop; 2) Minimum tillage with herbicides use to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage for seed bed preparation; 3) Conventional Tillage used to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage used for seed bed preparation. 2: Using production, input data, and peer reviewed published results to compare profitability and cash flow of our two crop systems and three management systems. 3: Conduct `on campus' field demonstrations and cooperate with local high school to include student field and lab work in sustainable ag in the biological sciences. Publish and communicate results and potential economic and biological advantages of incorporating sheep grazing of stubble and weeds into a sustainable grain farming system. Our interdisciplinary team of scientists anticipates a positive long term biological and economical outcome from the integrated system of weed management by sheep grazing, and significant reduction in herbicide use in the Northern Great Plains. The proposed system encourages profitable cooperation between diverse agricultural enterprises by linking a source of inexpensive feed for sheep producers with a successful pest control method for grain farmers."

It ranks third in the US and fourth worldwide among cereals in area of cultivation and quantity produced, and fifth worldwide among all crops. In the US, barley growers ensure a robust crop by interacting with a mainly publicly funded barley support system. Public sector agronomists, plant pathologists and soil scientists within universities and the USDA Agricultural Research Service monitor all aspects of barley cultivation. Plant breeders assimilate the information gathered, and are guided by it to develop and test new varieties to address changing agronomic practices, new markets, and emerging pest and pathogen issues (such as African stem rust). New varieties thereby play a critical role in sustaining barley as a crop in the US. The efficacy of plant breeders is enhanced through improvements in breeding approaches such as marker-assisted breeding, which enables variety development to occur more rapidly and using a broader germplasm base than through traditional plant breeding methods. The USDA-CSREES BarleyCAP (www.barleycap.org) is an example of the development and deployment of new genetic marker technology. The BarleyCAP project is headed by co-PD Muehlbauer. The SNP marker platform of BarleyCAP was developed by PD Close and co-PD Lonardi. The long-term goal of this new project, through accomplishment of short-term gene sequencing and physical map-related goals, is to further facilitate marker-assisted breeding by greatly improving access to knowledge of barley genes. As a corollary, the information developed from this project also will accelerate map-based cloning efforts, which also lead to improved markers as well as alternative strategies for plant improvement using transgenic approaches."

Gloer of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa. With his collaborators, Patrick F. Dowd and Donald T. Wicklow of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Professor Gloer is isolating new natural organic compounds from fungi. The project will continue this distinctive research program in fungal natural products chemistry. Primary focus will be placed on chemical studies of mycoparasitic/fungicolous fungi, and on fungal endophytes that occur in cereal crop plants. Mycoparasitic/fungicolous fungi attack and colonize other fungi in nature. Invasion by these colonists often involves antibiosis toward the host, and therefore, such colonists may be valuable, underexplored sources of natural antifungal agents. Results from prior NSF support provide strong evidence for the validity of this hypothesis. Efforts during the proposed grant period will focus on completion of the studies of a collection of nearly 800 diverse fungal colonists obtained from varied microclimates found on the island of Hawaii. A second direction follows from the discovery that isolates of widespread corn endophytes produce natural products of various types that show antagonistic activity against other, competing fungi encountered in corn plants, including important disease-causing and mycotoxin-producing species. Studies of the occurrence and significance of these metabolites will continue, and will be expanded to include fungi from other crop plants (rye, wheat, barley, sorghum), and a limited number of prairie grasses, in search of further metabolites that show similar biological effects and potential significance. In both projects, the search for new chemistry is guided by assays for activity against two important fungal species and/or an agriculturally important insect pest. An assay for Hsp90 activity will also be included based on a discovery in the most recent grant period that a common corn endophyte produces a potent inhibitor of Hsp90 function. Many new bioactive natural products have been discovered through these hypothesis-guided studies, and further success is expected because of the relatively unexplored nature of these fungal groups. Antifungal and antiinsectan agents are of potential practical value to society in agriculture and medicine, and can also be valuable as tools to assist in discovery of new modes of action. Findings from this project are also expected to contribute to fundamental scientific knowledge in other disciplines, including fungal ecology, taxonomy, biodiversity, crop/food science, and evolutionary biology."

Oxalate oxidase catalyzes the carbon-carbon bond cleavage of oxalate to yield carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide.  Although there is currently no structural information available for oxalate oxidase from C. subvermispora (CsOxOx), sequence data and homology modeling indicate that it is the first manganese-containing bicupin enzyme identified that catalyzes this reaction.  The best characterized oxalate oxidases are from barley and wheat.  These enzymes, also known as germins, contain a single cupin domain and are therefore classified as monocupins.  Interestingly, CsOxOx shares greatest sequence homology with the bicupin microbial oxalate decarboxylases.  The short term goals of this research are to 1) to characterize the manganese-dependence of oxalate oxidase from C. subvermispora and 2) to identify the active site of the enzyme.  This research is expected to contribute to the understanding of how subtle structural changes effect remarkable functional variation in evolutionarily related proteins.  Characterizing the manganese-dependence of CsOxOx is significant in order to place this enzyme in the context of other oxalate degrading enzymes and that of other cupin proteins.  Identifying the active site of CsOxOx is an important problem.  If only one of the manganese centers mediates catalysis, critical questions are raised concerning the function (if any) of the second Mn-binding domain and the extent to which local protein structure in each domain results in differential reactivity.Broader ImpactsThis project is transforming Gainesville State College (a two-year unit of the University System of Georgia) from an institution that provides excellent coursework in the sciences into one that also provides students the opportunity to participate in meaningful and important laboratory research.  Undergraduate students carry out most of this work at Gainesville State College (GSC), but also have the opportunity to work with collaborators at the University of Florida and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL.  Student researchers are expected to communicate their research experiences to broad audiences through diverse media.  Student researchers also are expected to publish their results and report research findings at professional meetings and to the regional educational community.  Funds from this project are used to acquire, operate, and maintain research equipment that is not otherwise available at GSC."

Nettleton, and Adah Leshem-Ackerman (Iowa State University)Collaborator:  Pietro Spanu [Imperial College (UK)]Plant diseases are among the greatest detriments to crop production worldwide.  The plant immune system plays a crucial role in preventing infection by responding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and effector proteins delivered by the pathogen.  This project focuses on the well-characterized barley-powdery mildew pathosystem to address fundamental questions in susceptibility and host resistance. The project will build upon the recent discovery of a new monocot-specific family of cysteine-rich peptides, designated blufensins.  Blufensin1 (Bln1) negatively regulates plant defense during fungal infection.  BLN1 is predicted to be secreted, and contains both structural and sequence similarities to knottins, small disulfide-rich proteins characterized by a unique  disulfide through disulfide knot.   The project team will perform comparative analysis of host (barley) versus nonhost (maize and rice) interactions with powdery mildew that define the interactome of cereals with this important fungal pathogen.  Plants silenced for Bln1 will be interrogated by Barley1 GeneChip transcript profiling to identify significant new genes in the regulation of host innate immunity. Complementary investigations will be carried out with international collaborators that lead the powdery mildew genome sequence consortium to isolate powdery mildew effectors, which will then be used to identify important plant targets that promote or suppress defense.  For this, the project will employ a new Xanthomonas type III secretion delivery vector to determine function in plant cells.  Characterization of effectors will be carried out in all three cereals to identify and compare plant genes that govern host and non-host interactions.  High-throughput reverse genetic tools will be utilized to functionally characterize genes identified via the Bln1- and powdery mildew effector-based approaches.  Data will be integrated into PLEXdb (http://plexdb.org/), the unified gene expression resource for plants and plant pathogens, for genetic and regulatory network analysis. Broader impacts will be achieved by integrating into the project training and mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and NSF/NIH CSBSI summer interns in Bioinformatics. International research exchanges in powdery mildew effector prediction (UK) and functional analysis (USA) will enhance the experiences of graduate students and postdocs.  In addition, underrepresented and underserved students in secondary science education will be engaged by partnering with the Des Moines School District to implement a biology classroom module on Gene Expression and Segregation Analysis in agriculture and human health.  Public access to all project data will be fostered through the PLEXdb on-line relational database for gene expression for plants and plant pathogens as well as NCBI-GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).  Thus, this project will promote research, education, and dissemination of results to a broad audience, while developing a new generation of agricultural scientists."

This approach has been successful for many years and has resulted in the bountiful wheat, oat and barley harvests that feed the world. Traditional breeding, however, is slow and has largely proceeded with little understanding of the actual genes, genetic pathways, and cellular processes that are targeted by artificial selection. Developing new strategies for crop improvement, that employ either traditional crosses or transgenic approaches, will require us to determine the molecular genetic causes of important trait differences. My research strives to understand the genetic basis of drought and heat stress response in grass crops, in particular by asking how common genes affect, for example, both flowering time and drought stress response. In some cases, common genes control different traits, and breeding strategies that seek to optimize one trait (for example, productivity in a dry climate) inadvertently negatively affect a second trait (for example, productivity in a hot environment). My work aims to identify the genetic basis of these correlations, and to develop breeding strategies that allow us to optimize combinations of desirable agricultural traits, particularly in wheat."

The three phytochrome genes present in grasses (PHYA, PHYB and PHYC) play a central role in the detection of light signals and in monitoring seasonal differences in day-length. We have recently obtained mutants of the wheat PHYC gene using a technique called TILLING and observed significant delays in flowering time under long days. We also observed that the PHYC mutations affected the regulation of other important wheat flowering genes. Our overall goal is to dissect the light signaling network involved in the photoperiodic regulation of flowering in wheat and barley. To achieve this we will generate mutants for the phyA and phyB genes using our wheat TILLING populations and combine them with the available phyC mutants into double and triple mutants. We will also characterize the natural variation of wheat and barley PHYC genes. We will then test the effect of the natural and induced phytochrome mutations on flowering time and on the regulation of other flowering genes, including those involved in vernalization, circadian rhythms, and gibberellic acid biosynthesis and degradation. The analysis of the phytochrome mutants will be complemented with the identification of the proteins that interact with the different phytochromes. Finally, we will duplicate the size of our tetraploid wheat TILLING population to increase the chances of detecting useful mutations in all the wheat genes. We will use this expanded TILLING population to generate a public collection of flowering gene mutants in a common tetraploid wheat background. This proposal will generate basic knowledge about PHYC, which is the least explored of the phytochromes. The PHYC protein interactors responsible for the transduction of the light signals to the photoperiod pathway remain largely unknown. In addition to filling this gap in our basic knowledge, a better understanding of the gene network that integrates light signals is required to precisely manipulate flowering time and optimize wheat and barley adaptation to changing environments. This study will provide barley and wheat breeders well characterized PhyC alleles to design better crosses, to predict the effect of the different alleles in flowering initiation and stem elongation, and to engineer varieties with specific flowering characteristics. A better understanding of the effect of photoperiod on spike development is also important because the number of spikelets per spike is established during this developmental stage. The number of spikelets per spike determines the maximum number of grains per spike, which is an important yield component in wheat. Finally, the expansion of the publicly available tetraploid wheat TILLING population and the generation of a public collection of flowering mutants will be tangible and valuable outcomes of this project."

It is important for reviewers to understand that MT is a large state with more than 145,000 square miles and that agriculture is the largest segment of the state economy (30-50% depending on the economist). The large travel distances increase both cost and time required and the relatively few extension specialists at MSU in the IPM area are primary constraints to IPM implementation. Therefore this proposal addresses this need with Extension IPM Associates and funding for travel and program support. Primary Coordination Program Emphasis will include: IPM Implementation for Agronomic Crops: wheat, barley forage crops (alfalfa), oilseeds (safflower, canola and camelina) and seed legumes ( dry peas, lentils and chickpeas);; IPM Implementation for Specialty crops (seed potatoes, sugarbeets, and dry beans); and IPM Training for Consumer and Urban Environments (consumers, home landscape businesses, public facilities (parks, city forestry) and Master Gardner training). Secondary coordination program emphasis includes: IPM Support for Pest Diagnostic Facilities; IPM education for Pesticide Applicators: IPM Training and Implementation in Schools; and IPM Partnerships in Wide-Area Pest Monitoring and Reporting Systems (weather-based pest prediction, cutworm prediction, NPDN) These programs are built on the expertise of the MT IPM team and state needs in terms of pest problems, technical assistance and IPM education with overall goals driven by the National Road Map for IPM. New emphasis will include: IPM Training and Implementation in Schools, IPM, building a web-based weather-based IPM information system linked to regional assets for Montana and continued expansion of the web-based High Plains IPM Guide cooperatively with IPM specialists in Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Outcomes will be better educated growers, landscape and turf businesses and public building mainatinance personnel. These stakeholders and consumers will use pesticides more wisely and with other non-chemical controls."

According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture (2009), the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation has 463 farms and ranches of which 266 are operated by American Indians. This is 57% whereas the population is 90% Indian. The Reservation is primarily grazing land suitable for cattle, bison and horses but some crops grown include barley, corn, oats, soybeans, sunflower, and wheat. Gross sales were $54,541,000 of which only $17,835,000 was received by American Indian producers. One fourth of the 266 American Indian agricultural producers on the reservation gross less than $10,000 annually and less than a fourth of them gross above $100,000. The average gross income per acre of land is approximately $23.49 for all farmers/ranchers on the reservation with American Indian producers averaging only $11.85. OLC's TCEP will address the problems of lack of interest in agriculture and natural resources and lack of financial resources of our students. We will develop agriculture courses to integrate with the other natural resources courses and math and science courses, reflect Native American and Lakota perspective, and utilize the relevant research OLC faculty and students are doing. We will make courses more accessible and effective through online delivery."

Traditionally as much as 80% of the barley crop has been fed to livestock, primarily beef cattle. Currently, most of the barley produced in the West is utilized for malt, a higher value grain product. In the past five years, malting companies have expanded malting capacity in the West by 400,000 tons/year providing barley growers with expanded opportunity to grow high value malt barley. As most of the acreage in the West lacks access to irrigation, malting barley varieties with improved drought tolerance are required. Barley for Rural Development scientists successfully released the winter barley variety 'Charles' and the drought tolerant spring barley variety 'Hockett' to meet this need. Barley varieties with improved feed quality coupled with the potential to produce ethanol from straw, through our high straw fructan character, will make feed barley competitive with imported grain. The market for high &#946;-glucan food varieties is expanding domestically and overseas in order to combat obesity, heart disease and diabetes. Barley for Rural Development scientists in Idaho and Montana are developing varieties to meet this new demand. The uniqueness of this project lies in the coupling of the excellent quality barley genome map with our excellence in barley agronomy and cropping systems, malt sciences and ruminant physiology provided by the faculty of the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station, the North Dakota Institute of Barley and Malt Sciences, the Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station and USDA-ARS staff located at Aberdeen, Idaho. North Dakota, Montana and Idaho are America's dominant barley-producing states. This group effort to revitalize malt and feed barley production and improve dryland production efficiency is appropriate for the mission of the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station, the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station and the Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station and is within our technical capacity."

It not only provides an economically viable alternative to wheat, barley and canola but also helps condition the soil for these other crops through its ability to add nitrogen, its low water use, and its alternate pests, weeds, and diseases. Relatively few public breeding programs service the region. In addition, the recent sequencing of the genome of barrel medic greatly increases the potential for rapid and dramatic improvement in the pea varieties available and our ability to manipulate the crop. The current project will take advantage of the recent developments in our understanding of the legume genome to develop new pea varieties specifically adapted to conditions in Montana and the Northern Great Plains. In addition, it proposes to address certain of the bottlenecks and vulnerable aspects of the pea crop by widening the genetic base of the crop and tagging and identifying several genes critical to our ability to cultivate the crop in the United States. As a species, pea possesses a high genetic diversity, and a wide range of products can be generated by traditional breeding techniques. One novel pea type that will be released as an output of this project is a dry pea that has a high content of slow digesting starch. Such a starch content is particularly suitable for type II diabetics or other individuals who desire to avoid high blood sugar levels. Soup or other products made from such peas is digested gradually, and has a much lower glycemic index than other grains or starchy vegetables. Other genes that will be investigated include several that provide resistance to specific diseases of pea, including powdery mildew, enation virus and fusarium wilt. Each of these diseases is common in pea growing regions, and the loss of their effectiveness would greatly reduce our ability to grow this crop."

The corresponding acreage amount of farms in North Dakota increased from 28,427 thousand acres to 39,400 thousand acres leading to an increase in farm size from 382 acres to 1,300 acres. A century ago, North Dakota was overwhelmingly a wheat state; today the leading crops are oil crops. According to North Dakota Agricultural Statistical Service publication, the state ranks first in the production of barley, durum wheat, spring wheat, all dry edible beans, pinto beans, navy beans, sunflower, canola, flaxseed, oats, dry edible peas. It ranks second in all wheat, lentils and honey, third in sugar beets and rye; fourth in potatoes, and tenth in soybeans. The farm receipts increased from 0.257 billion nominal dollars in 1924 to 3.98 billion nominal dollars in 2006. During the same time period, the crop and livestock receipts increased from 0.197 and 0.60 billion nominal dollars to 3.089 and 0.897 billion nominal dollars respectively. These changes in North Dakota due to technological improvements, farm programs, farm crop insurance programs and public investments will be quantified for the fourteen (including the 2008 farm bill) major farm bills since 1933.

While it affects both grain yield and quality, the major concern with the utilization of FHB infected grain for food and feed is the presence of the fungal toxin, deoxynivalenol (DON). DON survives processing, can contaminate food, and is poisonous to animals and humans. While vigilant monitoring conducted by the grain trade has seemingly assured food and feed safety, current methods of DON analysis have been called into question by recent reports of bound DON that escapes detection during normal testing. The presence of bound DON or other mycotoxins has a number of interesting implications. While bound toxins may not be detected in raw materials by routine analytical methodology, they may be released under food processing conditions or during digestion. The objectives of this project are to determine the prevalence of bound DON in barley that has been infected with FHB, and to study how interactions between the plant and fungus influence levels of bound DON. Both objectives are needed to determine whether the presence of bound DON in grain presents a significant risk to the consumer."

South Dakota's unique geographical location allows crops, normally separated by location or cropping season, to be grown simultaneously and creates a continuum of living hosts that favors many plant viruses. Surveys of South Dakota winter wheat concluded that wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) is an endemic virus problem with an average of 47% of all winter wheat fields containing plants infected with WSMV. WSMV-infected winter wheat loses from 5% to over 70% of its yield depending on the cultivar and environmental conditions. Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) has a heavy impact on South Dakota small grains during years with strong flights of BYDV carrying aphids from southern states. BYDV caused reductions of grain yields in infected plants range from 47 to 81% in South Dakota. Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) has been demonstrated to cause yield losses up to 56% in certain lines and to cause greater yield losses when the infection occurs at early dates. New viruses, such as High Plains virus or Triticum mosaic virus, are new threats that will impact the future crops. Clearly, plant viruses impact the economic potential for South Dakota agriculture. Management of plant viruses relies on preventative actions rather than therapeutic treatments, such as pesticides. Thus, this project promotes management of plant viral diseases through monitoring, identification, detection, and interactive studies with agricultural crops, vectors, and alternate hosts to address the environmental and epidemiological roles of plant viruses, resistance evaluation to identify resistant, tolerant, and susceptible plants for management of plant viruses through prevention, and studies to define how viruses interact with the cellular level of their plant hosts. Information developed will be vital to producers/farmers, plant breeders, extension educators and specialists, entomologists, and other researchers. Communication to stakeholders and scientists will be developed through publications, interaction with national disease databases and platforms, and with stakeholder presentations."

This has resulted in a ranking of third for principal crops harvested, but only a ranking of eleventh in cash receipts for crops, and twenty-eighth in net farm income. Thus, even though producers in North Dakota lead the nation in the production of at least eight crops, they struggle to make a living. The reasons for the low net farm income could include lower yields and higher production costs. However, regardless of the reasons, producers need to discover ways to combat low profit margins per unit of land. Increasing farm size generally is not an option due to high land costs. A viable alternative requiring higher management, but also providing increased income potential, is high-value crop production. These products are typically perishable, of high quality and specific value, and increasingly sold through specialized markets. This production alternative may help diversify farming operations and increase net returns. In addition, numerous communities have developed farmer's markets due to the increase in demand for locally produced food. The United States Department of Agriculture reported that between 1994 and 2006, the number of U.S. farmers' markets more than doubled to over 3,700, and the value of U.S. agricultural products directly sold increased thirty-seven percent from $592 million to $812 million. North Dakota's large diurnal temperature differences during the growing season are ideal for high-quality and high-yielding specialty crops such as vegetables, herbs, and small fruits. Many producers are experimenting with small fruits and vegetables, utilizing limited production information available from nearby states and learning from personal experiences. Sustainable production practices are desperately needed to avoid costly mistakes at a time when financial stability is already a concern. With the introduction of Roundup Ready crops in the 1990's and the explosion in the adoption of glyphosate-resistant crops, the acreage receiving more than one application of glyphosate has increased dramatically nation-wide. Glyphosate label additions allowing pre-harvest applications to several non-glyphosate-resistant crops has further increased the acreage treated with glyphosate. Currently, glyphosate is the largest-selling single crop-protection chemical product in the market. Nontarget injury from glyphosate drift to non-glyphosate-resistant crops has been a concern since the introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops. Most research has shown detrimental effects when drift occurred early in the growing season and that nontarget monocot crops are more sensitive than dicot crops. However, since this chemical is translocated within a plant, there is potential injury to the current season growth as well as tubers used for seed the following year. Potato seed producers as well as commercial producers need to be educated on the potential risks associated with glyphosate applications near a potato field."

Therefore, alternative feed ingredients that may be locally available may fill in the need created by the current corn price increase. Small grains such as barley, oats, and wheat can be useful feedstuffs in swine feeding programs. The other advantage of considering these alternative feed ingredients is most of them contain a substantial amount of prebiotic factors that facilitates the establishment and proliferation of some of the desirable bacteria in the large intestine of the animals. This could be good news to swine producers if successful to feed antibiotics-free diets -- an issue that is currently gathering momentum from consumers regarding the use of antibiotics in animal feed."

These mycotoxins pose major threats to the health of humans and animals. Spot blotch, caused by Cochliobolus sativus (Ito & Kurib.) Drechs. ex Dastur [anamorph: Bipolaris sorokiniana (Sacc. in Sorok.) Shoem.], are also economically important diseases because it causes significant losses in barley and wheat worldwide. Host resistance is considered as the most effective and economically sound method for controlling plant diseases. However, new sources of FHB resistance in wheat are limited and information about the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity and virulence of the spot blotch pathogen is lacking. In this proposed project, we will screen and identify wheat germplasm and breeding lines with a high level of resistance to FHB, map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the resistance using various mapping populations and develop DNA markers associated with the resistance for use in spring wheat breeding programs. In addition, we will characterize the isolates of F. graminearum collected from the North Central region for possible changes in toxin production and aggressiveness. We also will isolate and characterize the genes in C. sativus conferring virulence to barley and wheat using genomics and functional genomics approaches. The research project proposed will not only facilitate the development of new varieties with better resistance to FHB, but also provide basic information about the biology of the two fungal pathogens (F. graminerum and C. sativus) so that we can develop novel approaches for disease control. Identification of FHB resistance and DNA markers associated with the resistance can help in development of new wheat varieties to reduce the impact of the diseases in North Dakota and the US. The FHB resistance-associated DNA markers identified can facilitate the transfer of the resistance loci into spring wheat varieties. DNA markers can also be used for pyramiding QTLs for FHB resistance from different sources to achieve a higher level of and/or more durable FHB resistance in the wheat breeding program. Pathogen population can change over time to overcome the host resistance and thus monitoring and characterization of the population changes in the pathogen are essential to deploy effective resistance genes. Besides, an understanding of the genetic, biochemical, and molecular interactions of the pathogens with their hosts [barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum)] could ultimately lead to the development of novel strategies for controlling these serious diseases of cereals."

The simplest and most common definition of irrigation scheduling is the determination of when and how much water to apply. Improvements in irrigation scheduling must be carefully balanced with the primary economic goal of microirrigation which is to improve crop yield and quality. Field testing of soil-based irrigation scheduling techniques will determine sensor location relative to plants and installation requirements for several the types of soil water sensors. Use of these sensors as appropriate irrigation scheduling tools will be evaluated. A web-based irrigation advisory program (http://oiso.bioe.orst.edu/RealTimeIrrigationSchedule/) developed at Oregon State University will be evaluated under Idaho soil and climate conditions for sugar beets, malting barley, winter and spring wheat, silage corn, and alfalfa. Sustainable water use in the United States can be augmented by the use of non-potable waters through microirrigation systems. This requires careful selection of system components and appropriate system management. Use of non-potable water for irrigation has advantages since the water is often rich in nutrients beneficial to crops and use of the non-potable water for irrigation often reduces treatment costs and environmental impacts. Non-potable water use through microirrigation also has disadvantages since some of the water constituents may adversely impact soil quality and plant growth. One by-product of the dairy industry in Southern Idaho is a large quantity of lagoon water resulting from winter precipitation runoff, and wash pen-milking center cleaning. Because this liquid effluent is high in N, P and K, it must be properly managed to avoid nutrient overloading. Removal of sediment-bound P by filtration would allow higher levels of effluent application per acre for more effective irrigation and N source utilization. Outcomes/Impacts: A grower-accessible, real-time measure of crop performance will be an invaluable tool as a check against any proposed microirrigation schedule. A technical session at a a national irrigation meeting will bring together experts representing different approaches to irrigation scheduling and will contribute to a more integrated approach to this field of research and education. Websites dedicated to soil- and plant-based irrigation scheduling approaches and delivery of ET-based information will allow growers to improve crop production and economics while reducing irrigation withdrawals. Concentrated animal agriculture facility operators who use their effluent for irrigation will be able to determine whether microirrigation is a viable option. Selection of microirrigation equipment and components for livestock effluents will be easier for producers. Growers, scientists, and regulators will have increased knowledge about the safe reuse of reclaimed water."

Secondly, research to understand the basis of what constitutes grain quality is necessary to improve these quality factors if we are to maintain/increase our competitive edge in the global marketplace. We need to identify those biochemical components such as the wheat proteins that determine quality differences and use this information to develop rapid biochemical tests that we do not have at present to predict quality differences such as in a cultivar development program as we have at North Dakota State University."

Nearly 90% of the barley acreage is sown to cultivars classed as  recommended for malting and brewing  by the American Malting Barley Association (AMBA) and about 20% (3 yr. ave.) of the state's barley acreage has been sown to cultivars developed at NDSU. Depending on the quality of the crop, up to 60% of the barley produced in the state is used to produce malt. Barley not sold for malting purposes is fed to livestock on the farm, sold at a lower price for feed, or used as seed. Factors that reduce the value of the crop are those that reduce grain quality. Since 1993, the disease Fusarium head blight has had the largest impact. The U.S. Government Accounting Office estimates that losses in North Dakota between 1993 to 1997 due to FHB of barley were about $200 million (US GAO, 1999). This amount is equal to about 17 percent of the $1.2 billion in total barley revenues that North Dakota growers received during this period. Nganje et al. (2001) estimated losses of $136 million in the same region from 1998-2000. Another factor that has reduced quality and value of the grain is preharvest sprouting (PHS). The occurrence of PHS in 2002 in North Dakota was the most serious since the regional barley crop quality survey was initiated in 1977. Over 25% of barley samples collected from northern North Dakota displayed 1% sprout damage and maximum sprout damage ranged from 11 to 23%. A reduced area devoted to barley production, coupled with limited acceptable crop because of sprouting, raised considerable concern over the availability of barley within North America. Development of cultivars with resistance to FHB and PHS holds the most promise for reducing the negative effects of these problems."

There is increasing concern about adequate irrigation as we potentially enter another year with short water supplies. Simultaneously, there have been substantial changes in the U.S. grain industries. There is an increasing demand for hard white wheat in the domestic and international markets for bread and noodle products, and for specialty high beta-glucan barley varieties. These crops seem even more sensitive to disease and drought stress than their traditional counterparts. Continued effort is required to develop locally adapted wheat and barley varieties and agronomic practices that maximize productivity and profitability. Idaho?s climate provides an excellent environment to consistently produce high quality grain. Almost 73% of Idaho?s barley received a USDA/FGIS grade of #1 in 2008 (Olson, 2008). Most grain produced in the rainfed environments of the Intermountain West suffers little from foliar pathogens that impact quality. The absence of toxin-producing pathogens in our more arid environments makes wheat and barley an excellent choice for toxin-sensitive applications, including animal feed, malt, food, and nutraceuticals. The development of new overseas markets for high beta-glucan food barley and for malt barley will expand the market options for our growers in rural Idaho. Another opportunity is offered by aquaculture with interest in grain-based fish meal. Because current varieties do not meet preferred characteristics, production will not fulfill all the needs of these new markets. We must continue to improve small grain varieties for the rainfed environments of the West that reliably produce high quality feed for cattle, swine and fish, and provide the grain needed for growing food and malt markets. A recognized barrier to grain production under dryland conditions is the water and nutrient-robbing fungi that infect stressed root and crown tissue. Currently, breeders do not routinely screen for resistance to the dryland root rot complex, other than indirectly in variety performance trials located throughout the area. Development of a semi-permanent screening nursery at Aberdeen allows testing of varieties carrying resistance to dryland root rot fungi. In this nursery, heavily inoculated plots are dedicated to screening advanced breeder lines and testing new transgenic lines for resistance to fungal root-rotting organisms. This should advance lines for dryland areas where grains are subject to dry-land foot rot infection, as well as provide a basic understanding of the effectiveness of transgenic and novel genes in grain to resist infection and disease expression."

In addition, California employment is boosted by the production of orchids, especially in the leading producing counties of San Diego, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Luis Obispo, and others (CDFA Report 2008-2009, Agricultural Statistics Review). Other public sectors that will benefit include allied suppliers, equipment and greenhouse manufacturers, orchid-related businesses, families of commercial orchid grower employees, researchers, students that receive fellowships to work on orchids, orchid organizations, and the consumers. In short, the proposed project will provide fundamental and practical knowledge to benefit the public welfare in an integrated manner. This will support the production of orchids with lasting quality and by overall supporting the floriculture industry. In the larger context, scientific knowledge will be advanced that could result in improvement of a broader range of commodity crops, including other floral crops, and food crops such as rice, wheat, sorghum, barley and maize (all monocots)."

Among them, hemipterans are responsible for transmitting 55% of vectored viruses. Often, the vector insect is also a plant pest causing yield damage. In many cases, the only strategy available to control the spread of the disease is the avoidance of vector populations by the use of insecticides. This strategy poses problems such as the risk of development of resistance in insect populations, the pollution generated by pesticides and the cost associated with their use. Novel economically and environmentally friendly control strategies are possible but their development needs a deep understanding of the biology of the vector and the relationship between the plant pathogen and its vector. To develop these strategies the vector components involved in pathogen transmission, the effect of the pathogen on the vector fitness and biology or the route used by the pathogen through the vector need to be known. The development of these new strategies will result in the reduction of the use of pesticides with consequences on the environment, on farmers' economy and farmers' quality of life. These new strategies will contribute in the long term to the control of the spread of plant diseases; however, in the meantime adapted approaches to control the vector populations can be developed. We propose to aid in the development of these new adapted control strategies in vector insects causing damages to crops. Specifically, we will concentrate our initial efforts studying potato psyllids (Bactericera cockerelli) and greenbugs (Schizaphis graminum). The potato psyllid is responsible for the transmission of the causative agent of Zebra Chip, a disease affecting solanaceous. Plants infected with the causative agent of Zebra Chip show reduced yield and/or unmarketable potatoes. Questions as basic as the pathway of the pathogen within the vector body remain unanswered. In the mean time, this disease is costing millions of dollars annually. Similarly, the greenbug aphid is a severe cereal pest damaging crops worldwide. The annual cost this pest generates in crop losses and chemical control is estimated to be $250 million for wheat farmers and $125 million for sorghum farmers. Greenbugs are responsible for the transmission of several viruses, among them members of the Luteoviridae family causing Barley yellow disease. Arthropod-resistant plant cultivars exist but new aphid biotypes capable of overcoming plant resistance threatens their use. The research on the transmission of luteovirids by aphids has advanced rapidly these last years however, the involvement of any aphid proteins in virus transmission has not been identified yet. Today, genomic databases for different hemipterans exist or are being created. The use of these databases will prove essential tools for the development of new control strategies and improved diagnostic abilities. We propose to use genomic tools to identify competence factors in the two previously described systems: potato psyllid- Candidatus liberibacter and greenbug- luteovirids."

Examples of the impact of climate change are numerous and include: increasing CO2 concentration reduces the ability of wheat to assimilate nitrates, higher temperatures result in changes in geographic distribution of pathogens, and altered precipitation patterns increase the likelihood of short-term crop failures and long-term production declines. These constraints, compounded by increasing demand for food, and increasing costs for fertilizer, water and other inputs, require a national breeding strategy that capitalizes on innovations in plant breeding. This project brings together the barley and wheat communities to mitigate the impact of climate change on barley and wheat production. Wheat and barley public breeding programs face similar challenges and use similar technologies. A Triticeae CAP will strengthen the integration of these research, breeding and education communities and avoid unnecessary duplications. The Triticeae CAP will evaluate a broad group of barley and wheat germplasm for disease resistance, water and nitrogen use efficiency, and yield. This germplasm will include the National Small Grains Core Collections for barley and wheat and specialized mapping, association mapping, and nested association mapping populations. The same germplasm will be characterized with thousands of molecular markers to identify the gene variants controlling the different traits. Molecular markers will then be used to accelerate the deployment of the best gene variants into commercial barley and wheat varieties. Improvements in disease resistance and water and nitrogen use efficiency will help mitigate the impact of environmental changes associated with climate change on barley and wheat productivity. An expanded centralized marker and trait database coupled with extensive analysis tools will empower breeders to efficiently identify beneficial alleles and effectively exploit large volumes of data in applied plant breeding. This integrated research project will provide a problem-based learning environment to train a new generation of plant breeders and attract new students to agricultural sciences. A nationally-coordinated plant breeding education network will be used to share expertise in different plant breeding areas in the training of 29 PhDs in plant breeding. Educational programs featuring problem-based learning, collaborations with Minority Serving Institutions and social networking technology will be developed to expand the human capital needed to train and sustain the next generation of plant breeders and to attract new students to agricultural sciences."

Barley is a heart-healthy food, an essential material for brewing, and a premium feed. Understanding the genetic basis of crop quality and resistance to temperature stressed and diseases will allow plant breeders to develop more productive, sustainable and profitable varieties for farmers in Oregon, Minnesota, North Dakota, Washington, Wisconsin and the nation. The purpose of the Project is to stimulate economic activity and improve human health and welfare by using the tools of genomics to develop improved barley varieties adapted to Oregon, the participating states, and elsewhere in the U.S. Genomics is an umbrella term defining the study and selection of naturally occurring genetic variation using the latest tools of biotechnology. Barley is unique in that in addition to its economic importance as a crop, it is also a model genetic system. A vigorous public sector research community, in cooperation with the private sector, has developed a robust set of genomics and molecular breeding tools. These discoveries in basic biology will be used in practical applications to develop varieties more tolerant of stresses caused by diseases, insects, and climate change. This will lead to greater productivity with fewer inputs. Agronomic improvements will be coupled with the superior quality needed to compete in domestic and world markets. Barley was historically a cornerstone of agriculture in the U.S. Due to a number of factors, acreage has declined. This trend can be reversed by targeted research. Currently, many of America's internationally renowned quality brewers and distillers are using imported malting barley. This project will ensure that highly productive locally-grown varieties are available to local industries and processors nationwide. Barley is a heart-healthy grain and a key ingredient in foods which reduce the incidence of obesity and Type II diabetes. This project will support development of varieties that can be used to create a range of nutritious barley-based foods - a cornerstone in the nationwide campaign for a healthier America. Barley provides farmers in the participating states, and throughout the nation, with an option to increase genetic diversity, use resources wisely, and stimulate economic activity."

We will use this information to identify new targets and develop additional mechanisms to screen for improved malting barley genotypes.

(1a). Develop hyperspectral image analysis algorithms for determination of the level of mold damage from Fusarium Head Blight on wheat kernels. This will involve the development of image processing routines that identify the infected kernels in representative samples of intact wheat kernels and determine the regions of Fusarium damage within each infected kernel. (1b) Develop hyperspectral image analysis algorithms for identification of wheat kernels damaged by heat, frost, black point, and insects, as defined by official inspection criteria. (1c) Develop hyperspectral image analysis algorithms for the prediction of flour yield and break flour yield in soft red winter wheat. (2) Develop optical and mechanical methods and instrumentation for grain quality measurement that are applicable at points of sale, such as elevators, terminals, and mills. (2a) Develop rapid and objective optical methods for prediction of starch quality indicators in wheat, such as the ratio of amylose-to-amylopectin, and the identification of wheat into three states of waxiness: waxy, partial waxy, and wild type. (2b) Improve existing procedures or develop replacement procedures that serve as indicators of the level of alpha-amylase activity in harvested wheat.Approach:   Fusarium-inoculated hard red spring and hard red winter wheat samples will be imaged using an in-house near-IR hyperspectral system. Image analysis will be a multistep process. First, for each kernel a mask will be created from one of images whose wavelength creates a strong contrast between kernel and background. The mask will be applied to the images at all other wavelengths in order to remove the background. Principal component analysis (PCA) loadings from images of damaged and normal regions will be examined to identify the wavelengths at local minima and maxima, which inherently possess the greatest contrast between Fusarium damage and healthy endosperm. Hyperspectral image analysis will also be used to examine three wheat milling properties: milling yield (% straight grade flour) defined as the percent by mass of all flour fractions recovered through a 94-mesh screen; solvent retention capacity in 50% (w/w) sucrose solution, a measure of the water affinity of the macro-polymers (starch, arabinoxylans, gluten, and gliadins); and solvent retention capacity in 5% (w/w) lactic acid, an indicator of gluten strength. Near-IR spectroscopy will explored as a method for measuring the degree of waxiness in hexaploid wheat. Wild type, partial waxy (waxy null alleles in one or two genomes), and waxy samples (null alleles in all genomes), drawn from breeders' advanced lines of hexaploid wheat, will be used. Gel electrophoresis will be used to identify the waxy protein (granule bound starch synthase, GBSS) in each sample. Lastly, a near-IR procedure for wheat gluten quality will be developed in conjunction with a rheological procedure. The wheat samples consist of approximately 50 lines grown in field replicated (3x) plots over three consecutive seasons. Half of these lines are transgenic, in which the gene construct modifies the length of the central repeat region within the high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunits. Different levels of gene expression, hence, level of glutenin protein, are represented as a function of the transgenic ancestor. Thus, this set will contain a much wider range in the ratio of glutenin-to-gliadin than naturally encountered. Flour from these samples will be evaluated for glutenin and gliadin contents by SE-HPLC another ARS laboratory. At Beltsville, the flour will be scanned in the NIR and FT-mid-IR regions. Rheological properties, such as the recovery response for a gluten specimen subjected to a controlled regiment of compressive force and hold time, will be measured at a third laboratory. Spectral calibrations for glutenin and gliadin concentrations, as well as calibrations for the rheological parameters (percent recovery and recovery time constant), will be developed using partial least squares regression. Additionally, classification algorithms (PLS discriminant analysis and SVM) algorithms will be developed that will identify the genetically modified lines based on their spectral response."

Co-combustion of biomass in existing coal-fired power plants is an attractive option to increase the share of renewable fuels in the energy market. Designing equipment for these blends requires knowledge of pyrolysis and combustion characteristics to maximize energy output, reduce emissions and optimize fuel ratios. The objectives of this research are to: obtain thermal evolution profiles (kinetics and devolatilized compounds) of region-specific coal-biomass blends and probe the effect of heating rate, particle size, and coal to biomass blend ratios on pyrolysis and combustion behavior. A systematic study on locally available second generation feedstocks (agricultural wastes - woods, wheat and corn stalks, and local manufacturing wastes - cocoa shells, barley, hops, fruit pits) blended with coal used by regional power plants will provide knowledge for the incorporation of locally-sourced organic refuse into power generation, and a broader understanding of optimizing such blends for energy generation. The proposed work aims to bridge the gap between fossil fuel dependency and a green energy future while expanding opportunities for students from underrepresented groups to ensure our future engineering workforce is as diverse as the population it serves.Intellectual Merit: Given infrastructure already in place for coal, the most likely avenue in the immediate future for biomass utilization is as a blended feedstock in coal-fired power plants. Coal-biomass blending has the potential to limit the overall cost of fuel for a power plant, assuming the costs to process the biomass (transportation, drying, milling, etc.) are lower than the coal while lowering the carbon footprint of energy production. This proposal explores the thermodynamics and kinetics behind coal-biomass blend combustion to maximize process efficiency, while simultaneously monitoring devolatilized compounds to ensure the co-combustion of biomass and coal represents an improvement in the emissions profile. The knowledge garnered from this work is immediately applicable to state air resource permitting agencies, and directly addresses the EPA's debate over the next three years on how to regulate biomass emissions. The proposed work also provides fundamental data on the behavior of U.S.-specific biomass-coal blends to assist in the transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources; the design of an effective thermochemical conversion unit requires knowledge of the chemical composition, thermal behavior, and reactivity of the fuel in question.Broader Impacts: Altering our workforce to more accurately mirror the composition of our society is a gradual process, requiring strong mentors and role models. If we are broadly inclusive -seeking out contributions from all perspectives - we can solve issues surrounding energy and the environment for future generations. The potential benefits of the proposed project to society are twofold: first, by investigating the blending of biomass with coal we can potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining current energy production. Second, by actively seeking students (graduate and undergraduate) from traditionally underrepresented groups, we better leverage our human capital to facilitate a diverse, competitive and globally engaged workforce. As many UNH students choose to remain in New England after graduation, a project that specifically addresses local energy needs prepares them to understand regional issues when competing on the job market. To engage the public and industry, the students and PI will present findings from this research at academic conferences and in peer-reviewed publications, and in technical reports to assist in policy-making and industrial energy production schemes. As part of her Broadening Participation Plan, the PI proposes to implement a seminar series called  Engaging Your Future  to the science and engineering community at UNH to work with students on overcoming challenges they face as underrepresented groups, building a resume, and identifying career opportunities. As a woman with a disability, the PI is in a unique position to mentor students from traditionally underrepresented groups through building a research agenda with direct applicability today?s challenges in energy and the environment."

They can also poison food supplies by contributing to mycotoxin contamination. Genetic resistance is the preferred solution because of its low cost and ease of deployment but often resistance is futile. The short generation time and large populations of pathogens and pests enable them to evolve new races that overcome resistance. They similarly overcome pesticides. Many biotic threats to US crops are controlled solely by quarantine. Clearly there is a need to understand crop immune systems sufficiently so that stable, artificial immunity can be generated and deployed. In plants the natural sensors that detect infection produce weak signals but these are amplified to an effective level by a poorly understood mechanism. Our project is focused on understanding how the signals are amplified. The amplification mechanism is based on the creation and detection of specific plant peptides. We will study both creation and detection and we will validate our findings by attempting to generate stable, artificial immunity in maize to fungal infection. Validated findings should be broadly applicable to the other grass crops including wheat, rice, sugarcane, barley, oats, switchgrass, and Miscanthus."

The lesser grain borer (LGB) is a devastating, long-lived pest of stored wheat, corn and other cereal grains in the US and other parts of the world. Adults and larvae are voracious feeders causing damaged kernels, insect fragments in milled products, powdery residues (frass), a characteristic pungent odor, price discounts, and possible rejection of commodity. The LGB can penetrate many types of packaging material including seed sacks in addition to sound grain. Grain production, storage, and processing are important industries. More than 12 billion bushels of corn and wheat are grown in the US each year with a value exceeding $25 billion. Additionally, over a billion bushels of barley, oats, rice, rye, and sorghum are grown each year with a value over $3 billion. It has been estimated that 5-10% of stored grain in developed countries and 35% of stored grain in developing countries is lost to insect damage. Because of the extensive reach of this insect, there is also very broad societal benefit in achieving widespread use of effective sensors for detecting the insects early. Estimates of the cost of grain loss due to insect, mold, and mycotoxin damage to the 15 billion bushels of grain stored in the US each year have ranged from $500 million to more than $1 billion. Domestic flour millers have a low tolerance for live insects: their presence signs of insect feeding can result in grain rejection. Rejection produces additional fumigation and transportation expenses, as much as 10-20% of the grain value. The foundation of a successful integrated pest management (IPM) program is an effective monitoring system. SDC declares that it can provide that foundation with its sensor device. SDC has two objectives in this proposal: 1) Modify the preliminary prototype device for LGB detection, using basic and applied knowledge, and compare its performance and efficacy with current methods in a field test and 2) Demonstrate uniqueness and the concentration levels of marker pheromones associated with infestations of the LGB. SDC's hypothesis is that specific organic volatiles can be good markers to differentiate insects infesting stored crops from other harmless emanations, e.g. gases associated with normal crop odor, or other MVOCs. Marker biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from this insect, the aggregation pheromones dominicalene 1 and dominicalene 2, are found in sufficient concentrations in the headspace in enclosures containing these insects to permit detection with SDC's highly sensitive and selective sensor device. SDC is confident that this work will result in a complete sensor device that can be used effectively to detect BVOCs from lesser grain borers, relate those BVOCs to LGB infestation size, and provide the information needed by farmers and elevator operators to take action to prevent infestation growth in our food and feed supply."

Objective 3: Evaluate oat and barley germplasm for antioxidants and other phytonutrients.Approach:The overarching rationale for these experiments is to determine the role of specific isozymes of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and / or 4-coumaryl CoA ligase (4-CL) in avenanthramide biosynthesis, and their relation to the biosynthesis of specific forms of avenanthramides. Although, a number of plant DNA sequences corresponding to both PAL and 4-CL are found in GenBank, currently there are none from oat. It is expected that, like most plants, oat will possess multiple isozymes of PAL and 4-CL, thus it is important to determine how many genes are present in oat and to obtain DNA sequence information for these isozymes. These data will allow development of isozyme specific probes to evaluate expression of the target genes over the course of seed maturation and in different plant organs in field grown oats. Although a route to the synthesis of avenanthramides is available, this method is cumbersome and time-consuming. We have found the use of the peptide coupling reagent benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexaflurophosphate (BOP) to be effective in the synthesis of avenanthramides. We will also explore the use of other peptide coupling reagents for their utility in avenanthramide synthesis. The synthesized avenanthramides are being used, in collaboration with nutrition scientists at the USDA Jean Mayer Laboratory of Human Nutrition (Tufts University) and at the University of Wisconsin, Department of Kinesiology, to evaluate the effects of avenanthramides in mammalian systems. Oat and barley germplasm will be evaluated for the content of other phytochemical constituents that may have physiological effects, and for unusually high concentrations of known phytochemicals. Entries from the National Small Grains Collections, elite nurseries, and selections from collaborating plant breeders will be analyzed for various constituents, including protein, oil, beta-glucan, and phytochemicals."

Oats are grown both as a grain and a forage crop. They also play key roles in crop rotations to reduce disease, insect and weed buildups, to provide straw for livestock bedding and as a companion crop to establish forage seedings without the use of herbicides. Oat grain has the highest protein levels among temperate cereals and a very desirable amino acid balance for young animals and non-ruminating livestock. In summary, this project will help to identify and test crops for farmers to help them diversify their production systems in terms of economics, labor, environment and social considerations.

The quality of seed, fruit, and other primary products can deteriorate during post-harvest handling, including cold storage. Tolerance of abiotic and biotic stresses from seedling emergence through delivery of the final product can avoid losses of billions of dollar annually in the US. Crop plant germplasm generally contains genetic diversity that remains a rich resource for further gains in plant performance in relation to this suite of environmental stresses. Genetic determinants of tolerance and resistance traits can be located genetically and followed in plant breeding schemes using nearby molecular markers. Each marked trait determinant also provides an opportunity to develop a mechanistic understanding of the underlying genes and proteins by applying molecular cloning methods to identify the gene. Global studies of gene expression patterns and cellular-level studies further refine a mechanistic understanding of how the trait operates, and ultimately lead to perfect genetic markers of the trait. This project provides molecular markers for a range of environmental stress tolerance and resistance traits in crop plants including mainly cowpea, barley and citrus, and to a lesser extent wheat, rice, cassava and banana/plantain. This project integrates molecular markers into plant breeding programs in California, nationally throughout the US, and worldwide. This project also encompasses detailed mechanistic studies of specific stress-related genes and proteins. Mechanistic studies of some of the most promising proteins are being conducted through biochemical and physicochemical analyses.

It is well-established that a considerable fraction of  mobile  plant nutrients is retrieved from senescing tissues, and re-distributed within the plant to surviving structures such as seeds in annul crops. This process has important consequences for parameters such as yield (late leaf senescence or  stay-green  is associated with extended assimilation of carbon dioxide and higher yield), plant nitrogen use efficiency (efficient retrieval of nitrogen from senescing leaves to seeds lowers the plant's overall nitrogen needs) and grain protein content (nitrogen contained in seed proteins is largely derived from its remobilization from leaves). A better understanding of these processes in major crops is therefore a prerequisite for continued crop improvement. Using barley as a model organism, this project strives to identify some of the molecular and cellular details controlling and regulating cereal leaf senescence. As most leaf nitrogen which can be remobilized to developing kernels is present in proteins, an additional goal is the characterization of leaf proteases, enzymes which are instrumental to prepare nitrogen for its transport from leaves to kernels. To achieve these goals, we will utilize a combination of standard and advanced biochemical and molecular tools, which are capable to characterize both the overall senescence process and specific roles for some of its molecular components.

This is directly related to the high proportion of the American population that is overweight or obese continues to increase. Reducing the incidence of diabetes in the American population will be a difficult undertaking that will require a multifactorial approach. Clearly, diet will be one factor that will require changing if there is to be a significant impact on diabetes incidence. However, it remains unclear what changes in diet will lead to a reduced incidence. Based on population studies, greater consumption of whole grains have been associated with a lower incidence of diabetes. However, the few experimental studies of the effect of whole grains on factors related to diabetes incidence, such as insulin resistance, have used mixtures of whole grains. There is essentially no information on how individual whole grains may influence the risk of developing diabetes. The first study to be undertaken will examine the effect of different whole grains on the development of diabetes in a well-accepted animal model of type 2 diabetes, the GK rat. Whole wheat, barley, corn, and oat flours will be fed to GK rats for 5 months, a time sufficient to monitor the development of diabetes. These whole grains were chosen because they vary in their content of both viscous dietary fiber and antioxidant capacity. Sources of viscous fiber have been shown to improve glucose control in both normal and diabetic humans. Further, diabetes is well known to be accompanied by an increase in oxidative stress. Thus, by choosing whole grains that vary in viscosity and antioxidant capacity, it may be possible to identify which of these characteristics of the whole grain is important in reducing diabetes incidence. Wheat bran, a component of whole wheat, has generally been found to have little or no influence on glucose control or improvement of lipid metabolism. However, it is possible that processing methods may be able to alter the bran structure in ways that it would be more biologically active. Since bran is an inexpensive food ingredient and has a positive association with consumers, we will investigate how novel processing methods of wheat bran influence its ability to improve glucose control and lipid metabolism, using an animal model of metabolic disease, the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat. Individuals with metabolic disease often progress to type 2 diabetes. These rats developed poor glucose control, elevated cholesterol, and obesity. If feeding processed bran improves these parameters, this would suggest that adding this processed bran to foods may aid in slowing the development of metabolic disease, and therefore reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes."

Cornell has the only active small grains breeding program, public or private, located in the northeastern U.S. and our research contributes directly to multiple goals of Cornell Cooperative Extension. Small grains production requires minimal inputs, is environmentally friendly, adaptable to organic production and outputs contribute directly to the economic and nutritional well-being of rural communities. Since 1907, this research project has produced more than 70 small grains cultivars. An effective plant breeding research program contributes to enhancing the productivity of small grains varieties and to meeting the changing needs that are specific to northeast agriculture. Improved small grains cultivars are required for farmers, businesses, processors, and food companies to remain competitive. Improved oat and barley cultivars are critical to the NY dairy industry and NY wheat is marketed as a cash crop for processing into grocery products. Small grains production is also important to crop rotation systems, distribution of labor, and soil and water conservation. Variety development is a long-term activity that requires sustained effort over many years. Farmers depend almost entirely on our public, state-wide variety testing programs for unbiased information about varieties of wheat, oats, and barley. Season-long requirements for seed production and evaluation over multiple years and locations are required to assess adaptation and performance. The NY small grains markets are constantly changing. Consumers&#39; increased preference for healthy food products has increased demand for foods that not only taste good but also help to prevent heart disease and cancer. Specialty markets for spelt, triticale, organically grown cereals, and hard wheat have skyrocketed in recent years and new markets are likely. Locally produced farm products can result in substantial savings to the industry and to New York and help maintain local economic vitality. Without this project, there would be no mechanism for developing or testing small grains varieties in this region. New York farmers would have to depend on varieties and recommendations from other regions that do not accurately reflect New York growing conditions. Disease resistant varieties reduce the use of pesticides and cost to the producer. Winter grains prevent erosion of barren soils and redistribute labor requirements. Crop rotations with vegetables and other field crops reduce incidence of disease and insects resulting in higher yields and the use of fewer pesticides. Consumers are the ultimate beneficiaries of the outputs of this project because the results of this project are healthier, cheaper food products that are produced locally. A healthy farm economy depends on locally adapted, competitive varieties of all crops that in turn contribute to the New York state economy. Outputs link to field crops extension activities around the state. Information from this project is presented annually at field days, agent training schools and seed conferences."

Idaho is among the top 10 production states for specialty crops. According to 2009 statistics, Idaho producers are first in the nation in potato production and Austrian winter peas; second in the production of sugarbeets, wrinkled seed peas, lentils, barley, and alfalfa seed; and third in the production of dry edible peas, mint, hops and summer storage onions. Idaho growers also are in the top 10 production states for apples, sweet cherries, prunes and plums, various seed crops and processing sweet corn. Since most specialty crop pesticide registrations or minor uses on major crops are usually not economical for the manufacturer to defend with additional data, one method that chemical registrants can use to reduce their risk is to eliminate certain crops from pesticide labels. In Idaho and many western states, most specialty crops only have one or two choices for pest control options. The loss of one or both pesticide tools could result in crop devastation. Production costs will increase due to changes in agronomic practices. Other impacts could be the loss of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) tools. Pest resistance could develop due to the heavy use of one type of pesticide. This disruption in production could also have impacts to society in the lack of affordable,diversified and nutritious foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables, so important to a healthy diet. The Idaho project will generate data for five new pesticide registration for minor crops as well as supporting new Section 18 registrations. This will result in increased productivity and cash value of Idaho minor crops."

Research is needed to investigate new crop species, crop varieties, and production methods, in order to help producers succeed in streamlining field operations and diversifying crop rotations. Camelina is an emerging crop in Montana, but nutrient requirements and stand establishment are constraints to production. Field experiments will be conducted to investigate the effect of N and S fertility on camelina, as well as the effect of seeding rate on camelina productivity. This will allow for the development of fertilizer and seeding rate guidelines for camelina. Canola is another attractive oilseed crop to producers in Montana; however lack of adequate agronomic information about the crop is a perceived barrier among area farmers. In field trials conducted across Montana, the response of canola to N and S fertilizer will be examined and optimal fertilizer rates will be determined. Additional field experiments will be conducted to assess how seeding date and K fertilizer will affect winter survival in winter canola stands. This will result in the identification of optimal seeding dates and K fertilizer rates for winter canola survival in northwestern Montana. The continuous wheat and wheat-fallow systems common in Montana can be modified to incorporate relatively new and high-yielding crops such as canola, as well as N-fixing legume crops such as pea or lentil. Local producers are encouraged to include these crops in a rotation, but the benefits of doing so have not been explored in many years in northwestern Montana. Field trials will be conducted with the objective of quantifying the N benefit of legume crops, and will provide information about how canola and legume crops best fit into their wheat-based crop rotations. Spring forage barley intercropped with winter forage wheat is a cereal hay combination that remains untested in Montana, but potential benefits include increased hay yield and quality, reduced fall tillage, reduced weeds, and more efficient field operations. Nitrogen management in forage systems is important due to the increased N demand, and because N dynamics influence the nutritional value of the feed. Of current interest to producers are slow-release N fertilizers, which are designed to increase N uptake efficiency. The evaluation of slow-release fertilizer in monocrop and intercropped spring barley/winter wheat forage systems will be evaluated. Research results from all projects will be disseminated to producers and extension personnel at community meetings and through extension publications. Contributions to the scientific community will be made through conference presentations and the publication of scholarly papers."

For grain buyers and food processors, the primary need is a reliable method for rapid assessment of grain quality pertaining to mycotoxins and mycotoxigenic fungi. Rapid methods to detect mycotoxins at the first points of sale (elevators) as well as methods to detect mycotoxigenic fungi in the commodity (e.g. DON-producing Fusarium in barley) would help to address these concerns. Finally, workers who are responsible for animal and human health need information about the toxicity, carcinogenicity, modes of action, and biomarkers of exposure and disease for all categories of mycotoxins. The proposed research is wide-ranging and could lead to negative consequences if not completed. First, the presence of mycotoxins is an important health hazard. Hazard assessments including exposure assessment and evaluation of toxicity are essential. We propose basic research to define the toxicity of several important mycotoxins. Without this information, it is impossible to assess risks associated with mycotoxins. Additionally, the presence of mycotoxins in grain is an economic concern, especially in the context of global markets. Without an aggressive research program to prevent, treat, and contain outbreaks of mycotoxins in grain, US grain producers will suffer the consequences of reduced marketability of their products. Furthermore, the proposed research addresses biosecurity concerns. The natural occurrence of mycotoxins in grain is an important security concern for the grain industry and end-users of grain; mycotoxins have been used as agents of terrorism, e.g. aflatoxin in Iraq. Without a proactive research program to find innovative ways to monitor, prevent, and treat mycotoxin contamination, US agriculture will be unprepared to deal effectively with a mycotoxin outbreak, regardless of its origin. Finally, the production of mycotoxins by mycotoxigenic fungi represents a continuing problem in agriculture. Improving our understanding of how mycotoxin biosynthesis is regulated in grain-associated fungi will not only lead to novel treatment strategies, but will also advance our understanding of fungal pathogenesis in general. The scientists involved in this multistate, multidisciplinary research proposal work individually on mycotoxin issues related to their respective disciplines and areas of expertise. Just as agriculture is diverse and varies greatly from state to state, the occurrence and severity of mycotoxin outbreaks vary widely across the US. A multistate effort ensures a thorough approach to investigate a complex and highly variable phenomenon that has significant impacts on both producers and consumers. Outputs will include information on the action of mycotoxins in livestock and animal models. This information will be applicable to the risk assessment process. The work will also address stakeholders' continuing need for new detection and monitoring methods for grain and in DGs."

Growing need for domestic energy independence, banning of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and policy in the Renewable Fuels Standard has led to a major expansion of domestic fuel ethanol production. Barley is a $6 million industry in Virginia and ranks 11th among agricultural crops (VASS, 2008). Value of the barley industry stands to grow tremendously as a viable barley-to-ethanol industry develops that will purchase over $70 million of barley in the region. Wheat and barley are also valuable to Virginia farmers because of their ability to grow on soils with less water holding capacity than that needed for corn; and they are winter annuals that grow during the fall, winter, and spring months, when evaporation is lowest. Research that will enable farmers to produce these grains more economically and to garner more value for grain is, therefore, important to Virginia."

In cereal grains, the mature seeds are mostly composed of endosperm that is biologically and economically important. In all angiosperms, endosperm provides nutrients and signals to the embryo during seed development and germination. The economic significance of cereal endosperm is its high composition of carbohydrates and proteins, which is an important source of food, feed, and industrial raw materials. Approximately 50% of human calories are derived from cereal endosperm, either directly or indirectly through animal feed. Furthermore, cereal endosperm is used as a raw material for numerous industrial products, including ethanol. Maize is the most important staple food with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one fifth of the calories consumed by large proportion of world's human population. Maize has a long history to be used as an excellent model system for genetics which studies the DNA variation in genes and the regulatory sequences leading to changes of gene expression. Compared to genetic variation, epigenetic modification is another layer of regulatory mechanism that controls gene expression through the chemical modification of chromatin states, such as DNA methylation or histone modifications, without altering the DNA sequences. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the maize endosperm development, and identify the important genes regulating the developmental process. Therefore, the genome-wide identification of the important genes controlling maize seed development will fundamentally advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and will benefit the improvement of grain yield and nutritional quality. In this proposal, we will use a modern biotechnology called Next-Generation high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate the activity of all the 50,000 genes in maize and identify the genes carrying important regulatory chemical modification during the development of maize seed. By analyzing the highly integrated biological data produced in this project, we will develop a series of computational models and algorithms to identify a set of important genes called  transcription factors  that regulate the biological processes of seed development. All these genes and the tools will be implemented as a database, so that the agricultural biologists and the interested researchers can access the data, and select the genes for the bio-engineering experiments. The genes playing similar roles will be also identified in wheat, rice, barley, and other important crops using computational methods and a variety of bioinformatics software. The important genes and knowledge obtained from the proposed experiments can potentially be applied to other cereals and has the promise of guiding further efforts to enhance endosperm content and quality in crop plants."

The efficiency in resource use lies not only in meeting the requirements but also in maintaining quality such that current as well as future generations will benefit. Irrigated agriculture is one of the major consumers of water in the nation and there are increasing concerns about the water quality impairment of rivers, streams, lakes and aquifers due to agricultural activities. In much of the western United States where groundwater is used for irrigation, the imbalance between aquifer recharge and depletion calls for the development of improved methods of irrigation scheduling and water conservation. Furthermore, climate and land use changes have substantial impact on water resources management. The increasing demand for biofuels over the last decade has induced major changes in land use across the nation. In addition to changes in land use, more acres of row crops such as corn, sorghum, barley, wheat and sugarcane are dedicated for bioenergy production. Some of these row crops require more irrigation and fertilizers than conventionally grown crops and this land use change has direct implications on water resources availability and water quality. To ensure a sustainable bioenergy industry, the environmental, hydrologic and economic impacts of land use changes will be investigated and measures for mitigation of negative impacts will be evaluated. Modeling and field experimentation are complementary to each other, and if used together, they can lead to better understanding of the ecological and hydrologic processes that occur in agricultural watersheds. Hydrologic and water quality models together with reliably measured/estimated input parameters will be used to better understand the watershed processes and suggest strategies that conserve water resources and improve groundwater quality."

Weed competition with crops reduces yields by using irrigation water and other resources such as nitrogen and light. Competition occurs in perennial tree (e.g., pecans and lemons), shrub (e.g., guayule), vine and annual crops planted in rows (e.g., cotton and corn), and in annual and perennial broadcast planted crops (e.g., alfalfa, lesquerella, wheat and barley). In western rangeland, riparian areas and wild lands, invasive species change fire ecology, displace native species and reduce the productivity of managed landscapes. Buffelgrass invasion of the Sonoran Desert and potential conversion to savanna grassland, Russian knapweed invasion of cropland and pastures leading to abandonment and invasion of riparian habitats by saltcedar are examples of invasive species impacts in Arizona. This project will use standard field and greenhouse small plot research methods to investigate both old and new herbicide technologies for efficacy on target weedy and invasive species under local environmental conditions and determine the herbicide tolerance of crops and other plant species in non-crop landscapes where appropriate. The objectives for the next several years are: 1) evaluate weed management programs for cotton, 2) evaluate and demonstrate preemergence herbicide efficacy in pecans and assess their usefulness for reducing the risk of selecting for herbicide resistant weeds, 3) determine the tolerance of lesquerella to pre- and post-emergence herbicides and the efficacy of these herbicides for weed management in lequerella, 4) measure the dose-response of buffelgrass to postemergence herbicides, and 5) evaluate herbicides, application timing and methods for control invasive species such as Russian knapweed and saltcedar. Information dissemination to regional farmers, crop consultants, land managers and other interested stakeholders will include presentations at Cooperative Extension and scientific meetings (e.g., WSSA and WSWS), publication of Extension Bulletins describing practices and recommendations for weed management tested as part of this research project, and publication of results in peer-review journals. Arizona crop producers and land managers (e.g., National Forest Service, National Park Service, BLM and NRCS) benefit from research that develops new management strategies because weed and invasive species populations constantly change in respond to changes in land use patterns, cultural practices and global climate change. Crop producers, ranchers and rural areas benefit from increased economic efficiency and economically competitive, safe and stable food and fiber production benefits our population as a whole since we need and use these commodities.

Develop cost-effective systems and sensors for rapid and nondestructive measurement of moisture content and density of cereal grains, oilseeds and nuts that can be used in static and dynamic situations (on line and in process applications). 2. Develop a portable system for moisture measurements of shelled and unshelled peanuts that can be used in the field and at peanut grading stations. 3. Improve peanut grading processes by developing a rapid system for nondestructive determination of peanut kernel moisture from measurements on pre-cleaned samples and samples consisting of a mixture of pods and foreign materials. 4. Develop methods for monitoring water migration in almonds and other nuts and its effect on their quality by dielectric and spectroscopic methods.Approach:   Developing a cost-effective microwave system for rapid moisture measurement will require analysis of existing dielectric properties data to determine the optimum frequency and measurement parameters. From these results, microwave components will be specified, assembled into a low-cost rapid prototype, compared to a network analyzer, then calibrated and validated for moisture content of wheat, corn, soybeans, almonds, oats, sorghum, and barley. For peanuts, dielectric properties from 2 to 18 GHz on Runner, Spanish, Valencia, and Virginia will first be collected on shelled and unshelled peanuts. As with the other grains above, these data will then be analyzed to determine the optimum dielectric properties parameters and associated algorithms for a density- and variety-independent measure of peanut moisture content, and a prototype low-cost rapid peanut moisture measurement system will be developed. From these measurements and system development for peanut moisture content of shelled and unshelled peanuts, further development of a system to measure the moisture content of peanut kernels without shelling will be developed. Additional dielectric properties of both the unshelled and shelled kernels will be collected as needed, along with the moisture content of both the shells and the kernels. From these data, moisture algorithms will be developed. Additional dielectric properties measurements on unshelled peanuts with and without foreign material will also be collected for development of moisture models that are also independent of foreign material (trash). Models will be developed for both pod and kernel moisture contents. Besides kernel moisture content, meat content and percentage of foreign material are also important grading parameters. Attempts to correlate the dielectric properties data with these parameters will also be made. For almonds, since no dielectric properties data exists, fundamental dielectric properties measurements of almonds of varying varieties, growing locations in California, and moisture contents will be collected with a network analyzer. Correlations between moisture content and dielectric properties data will be developed. To investigate the dynamics of water migration in the almond kernels, known amounts of water will be sprayed on almond kernels of known moisture content, mixed, and then sealed in a Styrofoam box. The sealed box will then be placed between two horn-lens antennas for free-space measurement of the dielectric properties between 2 and 18 GHz at room temperature. Changes in the dielectric properties will be recorded over time as water moves from the almond surface to water in equilibrium inside the kernels. The next stage will be the use of these dielectric spectroscopic methods to monitor water migration inside the almonds under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature. In this instance, the water will permeate the almonds from the atmosphere for varying relative humidities from 20 to 80% in a controlled environmental chamber. Additionally, measurements will be repeated over varying temperatures from 0 to 50 oC in 5 oC increments."

Most of our work concentrates on measuring properties of single kernels so that they can be segregated or the distribution of properties in a sample can be ascertained, versus measuring the average quality of a bulk sample. In general, the project will include the development of instruments to improve rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) measurement of grain quality at receiving stations, the development of non-destructive and rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) single-kernel sorting systems to improve post-harvest grain quality and similar systems to help grain breeders rapidly select specific traits for improved lines, and improve grain-storage and handling systems. Specific objectives are: 1. Develop sensors and methods to rapidly and accurately quantify attributes such as protein composition, starch composition, end-use quality, toxins, and micronutrients. 1.A. Develop or apply spectroscopic technologies that offer significant improvements over current technologies used to measure traits of single kernels and other biological materials. 1.B. Adapt a previously developed conductance mill for detection of live-insect infestations in wheat in other grains such as corn, rice, barley, and oats, and to dry beans, such as pinto and navy beans. 1.C. Develop procedures for rapid estimation of insect fragments in milled flour from minimally processed whole wheat. 2.Develop rapid single-kernel sorting systems to accurately remove defects such as fungal or insect-damaged grain and to isolate beneficial traits such as white wheat. 2.A. Develop high-speed, low-cost, image-based sorting systems for a variety of grains and legumes. 2.B. Develop Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) -based, single-seed sorting systems for large grains and legumes. 2.C. Investigate applications of single-kernel NIRS technology to select kernels with specific traits. 3. Develop instrumentation, sensors, and systems to improve monitoring, and management of grain storage. 3.A. Develop traceability and identity-preservation techniques for grain handling. 3.B. Develop new stored-grain packing factors for the common grains in trade with known confidence intervals for a complete range of field conditions. 3.C. Investigate insect-pest densities and commingling of insects in grain that causes the spread of an infestation from bucket elevator boots. 3.D. Develop monitoring systems for grain-storage quality management. 3.E. Develop improved, environmentally-friendly insect-pest control methods for stored grain. While the objectives of this project include pre-harvest (seeds) and post-harvest handling of grain, the work is interconnected in that the overall goal is to improve the quality of grain produced in the United States. Instruments developed to assess grain quality will be used to study how grain quality might change during storage and handling. An instrument previously developed by this group to detect insect-infested grain will be used to study the spread of insect infestations and the storability of grain based on insect population levels.Approach:   U.S. farmers grow over 15 billion bushels of corn, wheat, soybeans, and other grains annually to supply the nation and world with food, animal feed, and biofuels. A significant amount of this grain may be stored for a year or more before it is used or processed. Our goal is to improve U.S. grain quality and international competitiveness through the application of engineering principles, specifically to the areas of rapid (inspection results from at least 60 individual kernels per minute) quality measurement and in maintaining quality during storage. Much of our research concentrates on measuring the distribution of quality within samples, and on detecting traits that are present at very low levels. We propose to develop instruments to rapidly (up to 500 kernels/s) measure quality traits for inspection at the first point of grain delivery, for breeders in selecting traits for new lines, and for processors prior to grain buying or processing. We also propose to develop chemical-free technology to control insects and maintain quality during handing and storage. This research will lead to higher profits for the agriculture sector, higher-quality foods reaching consumers, and more food available for a growing world population."

Preliminary studies indicate difference in hepatic nutrient metabolism between wheat and barley flours was not accounted for by soluble fiber content. We propose to evaluate a variety of cereal grains and seeds for bioactivity by analyzing expression of hepatic genes representative of metabolism of sterols, bile acids, and fat, and indicators of inflammation.Approach:   Food processing technologies will be applied to release the high concentration of polyphenolic components from the matrices of the skin and bran byproducts of juice, wine, oil and flour production. Polyphenolics will be extracted from these processed matrices by systematic application of food grade solvents into broad classes and a fiber fraction. Mice and hamster models of obesity related diseases will be used to determine the potential of the polyphenolic or fiber fractions to reduce or prevent the characteristics of metabolic diseases. Mechanisms will be investigated through gene expression pathway analysis. Of particular interest is the ability of polyphenolics or fiber to reduce the absorption of lipopolysaccharides that trigger adipose inflammatory responses.

Eric Schaller (Dartmouth College) and Ann Loraine (University of North Carolina - Charlotte)Cytokinins are plant hormones that regulate many traits of agricultural importance, including the control of grain size and yield. In this project, genomic approaches will be used to uncover how cytokinin regulates growth and development in rice, using this plant species as a model to understand the regulation of grain size and yield in all cereals. Computational approaches will be used to interrogate and integrate the datasets generated by these studies. It is expected that these studies will illuminate the role of cytokinins in panicle development, and will provide specific information on how cytokinins regulate grain development in an agriculturally important crop. Because of conservation of gene sequence among cereals, information obtained from the study of rice may be applied to other agriculturally important species such as maize, wheat, barley, rye, and sorghum. This project will enhance the infrastructure of research and education by providing training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers. A computation workshop will broaden the ability of the research community to use genomics resources. In addition, through partnerships with local groups including the Montshire Museum of Science (http://montshire.org/), programs aimed at fostering science education in grades K-12 will be created and maintained.

Cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice and barley are most affected by drought during the time of flowering and initiation of grain formation, causing drastic yield losses. The goal of this project is to develop a systems biology view of drought responses in cereals to understand this complex process and improve drought resistance and water use efficiency. Genome-wide comparative transcriptome analysis of drought responses in rice and maize will be integrated into a cereal drought gene interaction network, using ortholog information to predict conserved functional relationships as a basis for cereals. Conserved orthologous regulatory genes between rice and maize involved in drought responses and resistance will be identified comprising transcription factors (TFs), protein kinases and phosphatases, genes in hormone signaling pathways, chromatin binding proteins, protein degradation and small RNA pathways. As proof of principle, a set of these putative conserved rice and maize genes will be tested by genetic analysis of mutants and natural allelic variants, assessing them for altered drought response phenotypes and perturbation in the drought gene interaction network. These analyses will validate and improve the cereal gene interaction network predictions, and provide candidate genes for improvement of drought resistance/tolerance in cereals. With respect to broader impacts, this project will contribute through the generation of information key to the development of stable food production systems worldwide and through the creation of a transdisciplinary educational environment. Scientifically, the project will demonstrate the use of an integrated network approach to understand complex plant responses such as drought response and resistance. Outreach and training activities are integrated within the transdisciplinary plant-lab-bioinformatics project and will be made accessible to high school and underrepresented undergraduate students from institutions across Virginia and North Carolina through established programs at Virginia Tech and other nearby universities. An outreach program developed as part of a NSF-Cyberinfrastructure Training, Education, Advancement, and Mentoring for Our 21st Century Workforce (CI-TEAM) project will provide modules for quantitative data analysis for teachers and students using socio-environmental case studies from research data. An integrated mentor program for postdoctoral researchers will be used to facilitate career development. International research collaborations with the Generation Challenge Program and CGIAR institutes involved in drought research will add capacity building to agricultural systems worldwide.  Plant genotypes and all data developed in the project will be made available through a project website (http://cereal-drought.vbi.vt.edu/) that will allow interactive access to data and networks. Other publicly available genetic stocks used will be distributed by the respective originators with long term public repositories.

Most viruses 'commandeer' the host cell's protein synthesis machinery to make viral proteins.  Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is one of the two most widespread and economically significant plant viruses, affecting wheat, barley and oat crops worldwide. The aims of this project will advance the basic science of plant viruses, while enabling technologies for the improved control of harmful plant viruses and the engineering of modified viruses for production of high-value  proteins using plants. BYDV contains an unusual RNA structure, a translational enhancer (BTE),  in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA that interacts with a 5' UTR stem loop.  This long-range interaction promotes efficient translation of the viral mRNA by a mechanism that is not yet fully understood.  The project will employ the 3' UTR of BYDV as a model system to elucidate mechanisms of long-range RNA interactions involving 3'UTR elements. The overall goal of the project is to identify the molecular interactions that enable viral mRNA to compete efficiently with the much higher concentrations of cellular RNA for access to ribosomes and translation factors. The three critical steps in the assembly of viral protein synthesis initiation complexes will be investigated: 1) The binding of eIFs (eukaryotic initiation factors) to the viral 3'-BTE; 2) the interaction of ribosomes with viral 3'-BTE and 5'-UTR sequences; and 3) the interaction between viral 3'-BTE and 5'-UTR regions. A library of BYDV mRNAs with varying translational efficiency will be used to determine the correlation between eIF binding and translation, the binding affinity of ribosomes for viral RNA sequences, and the role of the interaction between 3' and 5'-UTRs  in each of these steps. The project will employ a range of biochemical and biophysical techniques to achieve these aims, including ribosome 'toeprint' analysis, direct fluorescence assays, and RNA binding assays analyzed by mass spectroscopic analysis.Broader Impacts:  The significance of the research and the range of experimental approaches employed will provide excellent training opportunities for students, ranging from the high school to the graduate school level, in both biochemical assays and quantitative biophysical measurements. Students at each level will receive appropriate training in molecular biology techniques including expression of cloned proteins, translational assays, and other important biochemical techniques.  Fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry used in this project will provide quantitative and biophysical training for more advanced students. Hunter College recruits and enrolls significant numbers of minority students under-represented in the sciences, and  also sponsors a summer research program for them. Students will be recruited from this program to participate in the research.  Thus, the project will contribute to training a diverse workforce in science and technology. High school teachers will carry out research in the lab during the summers, using quantitative fluorescence measurements to determine equilibrium and thermodynamic properties and enhance their content knowledge of applications of thermodynamics to biological systems. The Principal Investigator will work with faculty from the Borough of Manhattan Community College (an Hispanic serving institution) to increase research opportunities for their faculty and students, providing access to state-of-the-art equipment and research guidance when appropriate. By participating in the research project, high school teachers and community college faculty will increase their knowledge of current research techniques and their abilities to convey to their students the excitement of science."

Although pathogens are highly diverse, we lack a more general understanding of how the rules of community ecology apply to them. The objective of this research is to examine what maintains pathogen diversity in nature, and how pathogen diversity affects host community dynamics. The model system being studied is the barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDVs) in California grasslands. B/CYDVs are a group of viruses spread by aphids that infect hundreds cultivated and wild grasses, such as wheat and barley, causing significant damage. The consequences of pathogen diversity include decreased yields and poor grain quality. Mathematical modeling will help researchers understand the causes and consequences of pathogen diversity.The fellowship training will enhance the postdoctoral fellow's mathematical skills and lab skills such as molecular techniques for identifying viruses. B/CYDVs are important not only as a model system for studying disease in wildlife, but also as a crop pest, so results of this fellowship may inform agricultural practices. The postdoctoral fellow will involve undergraduates in research, deliver department seminars, give guest lectures in Population Ecology and Disease Ecology and participate in public outreach via programs at the UC Hopland Research and Extension Center."

Most cellular mRNAs employ a 5' cap and a 3' poly (A) tail, both of which play key roles in translation of the mRNA.  However interactions involving internal ribosome entry sites and 3' RNA elements are also beginning to be identified in cellular RNAs, especially under conditions where overall translation is compromised. A major deviation from the classical model of translation occurs for those mRNAs (often viral) that lack either a cap structure, poly (A) tail or both.  One such virus is barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), one of the most widespread and economically important viruses of barley. BYDV contains an unusual RNA structure in the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA that interacts with a stem-loop in the 5' untranslated region.  This long-range interaction promotes efficient translation of the viral mRNA, but the mechanism is not well understood.  This project will explore the interaction of the BYDV RNA with eIF4F, a protein that controls the rate-limiting step for translation initiation.  The specificity of ribosome binding to the BYDV RNA will also be determined by  toeprint  analysis.  Taken together, these data will lead to a better understanding of how viral mRNA is able to out-compete host cell messenger RNA for effective viral infection. Broader Impacts:  These experiments will provide excellent training for students from high school through graduate school in both biochemical and quantitative measurements. Interactions will continue with faculty from a local high school and from Borough of Manhattan Community College (a Hispanic serving institution) to help improve research for faculty and their students. Many of the students involved in the PI's research in the past have been from underrepresented minority groups, and minority students will also be included in this project. These students will contribute to a diverse and well-trained workforce in science and technology. An additional activity will be the redesign of the advanced lab curriculum to include inquiry-based research and to provide a research experience for more students. The research will have broad scientific impact through its use of a plant virus model for studying a key step in regulation of gene expression. Plant viral diseases affect a significant number of food crops world-wide and can have severe impact both on economic conditions and food supply. There is a potential to use information from this research not only to control viruses but also to develop systems to produce desired proteins which are nutritionally beneficial or economically useful."

One of the most important viruses in cereal crops is called Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV). There are no chemical (acaracide) options for control of the vector, the wheat curl mite (WCM). In some locations in the country there are resistant varieties for WSMV and WCM, but resistance inevitably breaks down due to genetic changes in the pathogen and vector. Also, the current resistance available is sensitive to heat and varieties with resistance genes have lower yields. In addition, varieties resistant to WSMV are not resistant to other WCM-transmitted viruses High Plains virus and Triticum mosaic virus. Co-infection by two or more viruses results in more severe disease and larger crop losses. Cropping practices in many areas favor the perpetuation of wheat viruses because of the green bridge, which is an overlap of green plant material (crops, grassy weeds) between the harvesting of one crop and the planting of the next. In southern states, growers plant winter wheat early in the fall to graze cattle, and then produce a seed crop from this same field, so the green bridge is maintained year round. We will be testing biological and inorganic pesticides for control of WCM, including fungicides which may have secondary effects on mite populations. We will also be testing which green bridge hosts put the crop at the most risk, how management practices including nitrogen application and planting date influence disease, and how plant maturity and geographic origin of the grass influences the potential disease. All of this information will feed into models, publications, and extension education to modify grower practices and reduce the amount of virus disease in the crop. Since wheat viruses are a community disease, which means the practices of one farmer can influence the whole community, changing farmer behaviors is critical to the success of this project."

The management tactics being investigated include the effect of 1) rearing strategies (particularly temperature regimes) on bees, 2) local flowering-plant diversity on pollinators and natural enemies, 3) grazing management and crop rotation on pest and beneficial insects, and 4) the use of artificial nesting materials on populations and activities of beneficial pollinators and predators. The insects that form the focus of the research include alfalfa leafcutting bees (an exotic species that is the most important commercially-used pollinator of seed alfalfa in western North America), native solitary and social bees and wasps that have important roles as pollinators and predators in natural and agricultural ecosystems, and communities of beneficial and pest insects in alfalfa, spring wheat, and barley. Laboratory methods used in the study include the relatively unique use of a laboratory temperature gradient to study the thermal biology of insects and the use of an ether-extraction technique to estimate body fat content in bees (body fat is being used as a measure of adult condition in bees). The field sampling techniques to be used represented a broad set of well-tested methods (e.g., sweep netting, pan traps, baited traps, and trap nests) chosen for their appropriateness to the insect groups being studied. The results will provide information relevant to 1) improved rearing tactics for alfalfa leafcutting bees (for use by alfalfa seed growers and commercial bee managers), 2) conservation strategies for native species of solitary bees and wasps (of interest to land manager and growers), and 3) the use of sheep grazing and traditional fallowing as a weed and insect management tactics in alfalfa, spring wheat, and barley (our goal is to reduce reliance on pesticide and fossil fuel use in grain farming operations by incorporating sheep into dryland farming systems to control weeds"

Data collected by the author (Shaik, S 2007a) from historical census of agriculture and the National Agricultural Statistical Services reveals that the number of farms in North Dakota has declined from 74,400 in 1910 to 30,300 in 2006. The corresponding acreage amount of farms in North Dakota increased from 28,427 thousand acres to 39,400 thousand acres leading to an increase in farm size from 382 acres to 1,300 acres. A century ago, North Dakota was overwhelmingly a wheat state; today the leading crops are oil crops. According to North Dakota Agricultural Statistical Service publication, the state ranks first in the production of barley, durum wheat, spring wheat, all dry edible beans, pinto beans, navy beans, sunflower, canola, flaxseed, oats, dry edible peas. It ranks second in all wheat, lentils and honey, third in sugar beets and rye; fourth in potatoes, and tenth in soybeans. The farm receipts increased from 0.257 billion nominal dollars in 1924 to 3.98 billion nominal dollars in 2006. During the same time period, the crop and livestock receipts increased from 0.197 and 0.60 billion nominal dollars to 3.089 and 0.897 billion nominal dollars respectively. These changes in North Dakota due to technological improvements, farm programs, farm crop insurance programs and public investments will be quantified for the fourteen (including the 2008 farm bill) major farm bills since 1933. The project will collect, construct and analyze original farm-level, county-level, state-level, and regional-level data utilizing statistical econometric, mathematical programming and/or simulation data to provide conclusions of the stated objectives. This project will also develop a ND agriculture sector database for the future researchers and the state."

High maintenance, but low capital investment, which are better suited to small-acreage production by limited-resource famers. In addition, decades of research and marketing development at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the School of Pharmacy of the University of Mississippi, and at the Mississippi State University have laid a firm ground for agricultural production of many medicinal plants in the state. The Ole Miss National Center for Natural Products Research has established a repertoire of medicinal plants that grow well in Mississippi, including Echinacea barley grass, wheat grass, boneset, catnip, skullcap, feverfew, Joe Pye weed, lemon grass and passion flower (Dr. Aruna Weerasooriya, personal communication). The center has also helped to establish a grower's cooperative to receive and market the herbs, and provides quality assessment and certification to growers. The Mississippi state university has also established many medicinal plant crops such as American mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum), from which the effective ingredient of two cytostatic drugs (etoposide and teniposide), Podophyllotoxin, is derived. It is thus imperative for Alcorn State University, as an 1890 land-grant university serving limited-resource farmers in Mississippi, to initiate pertinent research on medicinal plants in collaboration with the two larger Mississippi universities to help limited-resource farmers to grow medicinal plants as alternative cash crops. After consultation with the National Center for Natural Products Research, the Center for Biotechnology & Genomics at Alcorn State University propose to initiate horticulture and biotechnology research on the Danshen plant (Salvia miltiorrhiza), and waterleaf (Tilinum fruticosum) aiming at promoting their cultivation as alternative cash crops for limited resource farmers in Mississippi. The proposed research is aiming at establishing an agro-technological package for optimal and cost-effective crop production of Danshen by local limited-resource farmers. This is expected to be completed in two stages of a four-year period for two crops (Note: this proposal is focused on research at the first stage). This package should enable regular farmers to be able to initiate a S. miltiorrhiza crop with some assistance from an extension agent. The proposed research is also aimed at establishing a Danshen hairy root culture within the first year. Further optimization of culture conditions and various elicitors for maximal production of bioactive phytochemicals will follow in the next two years towards establishing a bioreactor culture."

In addition to causing loss of the grain head, infection with FHB leaves contaminating mycotoxins which are harmful to human and animal health. Screens of wheat and barley accessions and wild relatives have revealed very few natural sources of disease resistance to FHB. The lack of natural FHB resistance in breeding populations creates an opportunity to engineer resistance through the expression of transgenes. A major problems is that functional assay of genes in wheat and barley is time consuming and expensive. We have developed an assay system using a model plant species that allows the properties of genes to be quickly and inexpensively tested. This approach has helped define a number of genes whose over-expression or knockout can enhance resistance to FHB. Genes that perform well in the model system are selected for introduction into wheat and barley using existing methods of crop transformation. These plants can then be assayed for improved FHB resistance in the field. Mycotoxin contamination of crops causes harm to humans and animals. Although the cellular targets of some of the mycotoxins are known, it is clear that these toxins can affect a number of different cellular activities. By examining the effects of these toxins in genetically tractable animal model systems, we are able to define which processes the toxin interferes with. Moreover, this approach can be used to set up screens for natural and synthetic compounds that protect against the effects of FHB-related mycotoxins. This approach should be useful for devising novel strategies to protect livestock and humans from the harmful effects of FHB-derived mycotoxins"

(2011) recently identified the gene underlying Ma1, the major photoperiod-sensitivity locus in sorghum, a short-day, warm-season grass. Interestingly, the orthologs of this gene control vernalization/cold-induced flowering in wheat and barley, which are long-day, cool-season grasses. This exciting discovery facilitates the search for functional diversity at Ma1 and interacting loci across diverse sorghum germplasm. Shared Ma1 function between warm-season and cool-season grasses supports the comparative genomic hypothesis that the biological knowledge obtained from one organism can be applied productively towards the improvement of related species."

The University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) floral trial garden will continue to help green industry professionals determine which flowering plants look great, last the longest, and deliver the greatest yield. The trial garden has greatly benefited the seed companies that participated in the previous trials and has proven to be a valuable resource for the local green industry on the Delmarva Peninsula. Through the continuation of the university floral trials, we will be able to continue to provide information and services to stakeholders and the green industry professionals to enhance the profitability of the lower shore region's green industry. The new project will evaluate plants longer into the fall/winter season. Evaluations will continue until the plants have completely died. This information will be of interest to the stakeholders because they will have evaluation data on plants that may thrive well after their recommended growing season. Beneficial Microorganisms Research: Many greenhouse and nursery production operations use a combination of fertilizers, growth regulators, fungicides, and insecticides to mass-produce ornamental plants in high volumes on small acreages. Non-point sources of pollutants are having a negative impact on the quality of water in watersheds and aquifers throughout the United States. The use of biofertilizers containing beneficial microorganisms instead of synthetic chemicals has been known to improve plant growth through the supply of plant nutrients and may help to sustain environmental health and soil productivity. Beneficial microorganisms, such as mychorrizal fungi, are recognized for their benefits to plant growth and development and improved water relations. The variation in mycorrhizal responsiveness to a specific fungus by cultivars of the same host has been reported for field-grown crops, such as peanuts, basil, onions, alfalfa, cowpea, peas, tomatoes, soybean, corn barley, and rice. However, there has been little research conducted in the United States documenting responsiveness to mycorrhizal inoculation of greenhouse or other ornamental plants where extensive breeding has occurred, and where there are multitudes of cultivars and varieties selected for their aesthetic or landscape traits. Therefore, evaluating the responsiveness to microbial inoculation with isolates of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza fungal species on different cultivars of popular annual and bedding plants can greatly influence the economic and production practice of Maryland's green industry while reducing the negative environmental impacts of chemical fertilizers."

Full-season soybean is usually planted in May and is the only crop grown during that calendar year. The small grain-soybean double-cropping system includes planting winter barley or wheat in October through November, harvesting that crop in June, and planting soybean immediately following small grain harvest. Full-season soybean yields more than soybean double-cropped after wheat, but double-cropped small grain-soybean systems as a whole were more profitable than full-season soybean in Kansas and Virginia. In addition to greater profitability, double-cropping systems provide additional environmental benefits by providing winter cover that reduces offsite soil and nutrient movement and by utilizing nutrients that were unused by the previous summer crop, which could otherwise leach into groundwater. Finally, double cropping soybean after small grain production allows for more total grain production in a time when global demand is increasing.Although benefits of double-cropping are clear, it is necessary to continue annual yield improvement with this system. Several issues put double-cropped soybean at a disadvantage over full-season systems. Global warming or stresses resulting from increasing temperatures may put double-cropped soybean at a disadvantage, as most of this crop's early-season growth will occur during the warmest times of the season. Pest management practices for double-cropped soybean may need re-evaluation since this crop will mature later in the year when incidence of insect pests and disease is greater. Breeders may have unknowingly selected for traits (related or unrelated to environmental changes) that favor full-season production systems. If so, such physiological traits must be identified and better understood. Finally, new ideas to increase crop growth rate in the vegetative stages and extend the seed filling period (recognized as a problem in double-cropping systems) are needed to ensure adequate leaf area development and light capture. In 2011, Mid-Atlantic (PA, DE, MD, VA, NC, SC) producers planted over 780,000 hectares of small grain, most of which will be double-cropped with soybean and valued at over $700 million. Yearly increases in soybean yield must be maintained if double-cropping systems are to remain productive and profitable. To maintain a yield trend similar to the national average, a 30 kg ha-1 yield increase per year for double-cropped soybean is needed. There is a need to evaluate methods to increase early growth and yield of double-cropped soybean. The underlying physiological mechanisms restricting yield improvement, the vegetative response to N and inoculation, and the potential yield response to foliar fungicides of double-cropped soybean need investigation."

DON is toxic in very small amounts, causing vomiting, reproductive problems, and even death. Barley is an important feedstock for fuel ethanol in the eastern U.S., but little is known about the fate of DON in barley across the farm-fuel-food continuum.

The identification of such genes offers the possibility to more fully understand the mechanisms of Fusarium susceptibility and to design transgenic strategies to increase FHB resistance in barley and wheat. We are using activating tagging to identify genes which confer resistance to trichothecenes. Activation tagging uses a modified T-DNA vector which contains multiple copies of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S gene enhancer arranged in tandem. In addition to knocking out genes, the modified T-DNA vector can also function as an enhancer when inserted either upstream or downstream of a gene to produce gain-of-function phenotypes. Using this approach, we have screened ~250,000 activation tagged Arabidopsis seeds for resistance to trichothecin and identified 30 lines that showed resistance. Characterization of one of these lines identified two novel lipid transfer protein (LTP) genes, designated as LTP4 and LTP5, which were overexpressed compared to the wild-type control. LTPs are small cysteine-rich proteins that transfer lipids between membranes in vitro. These results validated activation tagging as a valuable strategy to identify candidate plant genes for trichothecene resistance. The primary goal of this application is to determine if the novel genes identified from the activation tagging screen in Arabidopsis will confer resistance to DON and FHB in transgenic wheat and barley plants."

In 2008, Louisiana faced the destructive insect-vectored plant pathogen, citrus greening which is transmitted by Asian citrus psyllid. Finding of citrus greening resulted in a quarantine of citrus stock sales in two Louisiana parishes (Orleans and Washington). This disease can affect yield, leading to decline and eventual tree death. If citrus greening reaches Plaquemines parish, the leading citrus-producing parish in Louisiana, a total loss of gross farm value would be $4.1 million. In addition, potential new insect vectored plant disease threats exist for Louisiana, such as laurel wilt a fungus pathogen transmitted by the redbay ambrosia beetle. Without an IPM strategy for insect vectored plant pathogens, losses to Louisiana agriculture could be immense. Of EIDs, plant viruses compromise the largest group (47%). Plant viruses can adversely affect agricultural production, being costly to both grower and consumer by limiting yield and impacting quality. For example, the two most important virus pathogens affecting potato production are Potato virus Y (PVY) and Potato leafroll virus (PLRV). These aphid transmitted viruses can reduce yields by as much as 80% with a net loss of $2 billion per year. In sweetpotato, aphid transmitted viruses reduced yields by 30 to 40%. For Louisiana sweetpotato, this could be a potential loss of $16 million. Interactions with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (whitefly transmitted) and Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (aphid transmitted) can cause up to 90% loss. Barley yellow dwarf virus and Cereal yellow dwarf virus, two luteovirues infecting wheat, can reduce yields by 20% in the Midwest. For Louisiana, this could result in $5.2 million. One of the main reasons plant viruses are on the rise is due to changes in vector populations. Of the 531 known vectors of plant viruses, 85% are transmitted by insects and of those, 37% are transmitted by aphids. In North America, the single biggest change in vector populations has been the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura. This has had a profound impact on seed potato production in the Midwest. Current environmental conditions and global climate change favor aphid population growth and thus, favor increased virus transmission. Clearly, viruses and virus vectors can have an incredible impact on U.S. agriculture. To effectively manage insect-vectored pathogens, knowledge of the interactions between the susceptible hosts, viable virus inoculum, favorable environment and insect vector are needed. For most agricultural production systems, these interactions are poorly understood."

Stripe rust of barley can cause significant yield loss in the western U.S. The long-term goal of this project is to reduce losses in wheat and barley yield and quality caused by stripe rust and assure stable, sustainable production while protecting the environment. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding virulence compositions of the pathogen population, identification of new sources of resistance, disease forecasting, and control of the disease using fungicides in recent years. However, more research is needed to monitor dynamic changes of virulent races, obtain better knowledge of resistance genes in elite germplasm, to identify more genes for effective resistance, and to develop molecular markers for use in the efficient incorporation of new genes into wheat and barley cultivars. For the next five years, we will conduct research to achieve the following objectives: 1). Use molecular markers and host plant responses to characterize and differentiate current and emergent virulent races of the stripe rust pathogens of wheat and barley. 2). Determine the distribution, nature, and effectiveness of host plant resistance genes amongst elite wheat and barley germplasm. 3). Identify and determine linkage relationships of new major and minor stripe rust resistance genes, and develop molecular markers for application in wheat and barley breeding efforts. Accomplishment of these objectives will lead to improved knowledge of the disease epidemiology, more resistance genes and germplasm, and more effective technology to achieve sustainable control of stripe rust.  Approach: Rust survey will be conducted in commercial fields, monitoring nurseries, trap plots, and experimental plots of wheat and barley, as well as wild grasses, during the plant growing-season. Rust samples will be collected by collaborators and us during rust survey. Stripe rust samples will be tested in our laboratory for race identification. New races will be tested on genetic stocks, breeding lines, and commercial cultivars to determine their danger potential. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers will be used to characterize races and populations of the stripe rust pathogens.          All germplasm and breeding nurseries of wheat and barley will be evaluated in two locations: Pullman (eastern Washington) and Mt. Vernon (western Washington) under natural infection of the stripe rust pathogens.  Uniform regional nurseries and cultivar monitoring nurseries, which include currently grown cultivars and advanced breeding lines from all U.S. regions and important stripe rust resistance stocks, will be tested with selected races at seedling stage under the low temperature profile (4-20C) and at adult-plant stage under the high temperature profile (10-30C) for determine race-specific all-stage resistance and/or non-race-specific high-temperature adult-plant resistance in wheat and barley germplasm.  Stripe rust resistance genes in elite germplasm will be determined or postulated by testing elite lines, together with single resistance gene lines, with a series of races that will be selected to distinguish important genes; analyzing the pedigrees of the elite lines; testing elite lines, together with known gene lines, with molecular markers associated with particular genes; and conducting genetic studies to identify and map new genes.         To identify and map new genes for effective resistance to stripe rust in wheat.  Crosses have been made with resistant germplasm lines with a susceptible line. The recombinant inbred line s of these crosses will be phenotyped for stripe rust resistance in fields and also in the greenhouse with selected races and genotyped with resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP), SSR, and SNP markers.  The phenotypic and genotypic data will be used to map the resistance gene(s) or QTL in each cross.  New genes will be identified based on their resistant types, reactions to various races, and chromosomal locations in comparison with previously reported genes."

Fusarium head blight (FHB) has been ranked as one of the greatest threats to the production of wheat and barley.  This project is focused on identifying the wheat genes with essential functions in FHB resistance.  This will be accomplished using a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay which can down-regulate, or “knockdown” the expression of chosen genes so that their function can be inferred from the phenotypic change.  This functional assay for genes involved in FHB resistance has been validated and a key role for genes in the ethylene-signaling pathway has already been established.  In the next 5 years of work, we will conduct an in depth survey for genes functioning in FHB resistance, and determine if these genes can be used to engineer improved levels of FHB resistance.   Objective 1:  Determine if over-expression of genes involved in the ethylene signaling pathway can confer improved resistance to Fusarium head blight in wheat.   Objective 2: Determine whether pathogen recognition receptors have essential roles in Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat.    Objective 3: Test if elevated expression of pathogen recognition receptors can be used to improve resistance to Fusarium head blight and other fungal pathogens of wheat.    Objective 4: Determine expression of genes in floral tissue from FHB resistant and susceptible wheat genotypes as they respond to challenge by Fusarium graminearum.  Subobjectives 4A and 4B: A. Employ VIGS to test if the candidate genes identified in the RNA-seq survey encode proteins with functions that are critical for FHB resistance in wheat.  B.  If new genes encoding functions essential for FHB resistance are identified initiate transgenic studies to test if they can be used to improve FHB resistance.  Approach: This project is designed to identify the key genes involved in resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB), and where possible, test if these genes can be utilized to improve FHB resistance.  The project will utilize RNA-seq technology to identify candidate genes with possible roles in FHB resistance and susceptibility.  Candidate genes will be tested by virus-induced gene silencing to assess whether or not they have functional roles in FHB resistance.  Two genetic pathways, ethylene-signaling and pathogen-associated molecular pattern-induced signaling, have already been identified as having significant roles in FHB resistance, and will therefore be an important focus for this research.  Genes in these pathways and others will be utilized in transgenic experiments attempting to improve FHB resistance."

Evaluate wheat, oat and barley germplasm from U.S. breeding programs for rust resistance. Sub-objective 3.B. Identify and characterize new sources of rust resistance in wheat, barley, and oat.   The proposed research objectives are central to the mission of the USDA ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory (CDL): to reduce losses in wheat, oat, and barley to major diseases using host resistance. Research is focused on genetic variation in both the host cereals and their rust pathogens that determine the resistance/susceptible phenotype of the interaction. Isolates of rust fungi obtained from annual surveys of the wheat, barley, and oat crops are used to inform the breeding process. Successful control of cereal rusts with host resistance cannot be achieved without knowledge of variation in cereal rust populations. Studies of virulence and molecular variation in cereal rust populations can answer questions that range from the applied, such as which host resistance genes are effective against the current rust population and what resistance genes are in current cereal cultivars, to more basic questions like what are the origins of new races and how do they spread. Discovery of the molecular  Approach: Cereal rust fungi are dynamic leading to constant changes in the U.S. population which leads to the erosion of effective rust resistance in cereal crops. In addition, the introduction of foreign isolates, such as Ug99, further threaten cereal production. Development of cereal cultivars with effective rust resistance and management strategies of these diseases will depend on the monitoring and characterization, virulence phenotypes and molecular genotypes, of cereal rust pathogen populations. Rust resistant cereal germplasm will be selected by testing wheat, oat, and barley lines from breeding programs throughout the United States for resistance to Puccinia coronata, P. graminis, and P. triticina, using the prevalent races, and races that have high virulence to rust resistance genes common in released cultivars and breeding lines. Testing with selected isolates of the cereal rust pathogens and host genetics studies will identify the rust resistance genes in breeding lines and germplasm. Advanced germplasm lines with combinations of rust resistance genes will be selected. Rust fungi produce a large arsenal of effector proteins in order to infect and colonize the plant host. Genetic and genomic approaches will be used to identify and characterize effector genes from P. graminis."

Numerous libraries will be analyzed from as many treatments as possible to obtain the greatest number of expressed genes, which was shown to be very effective in a previous analysis of EST sequences. Some treatments will consist of the pathogen exclusively in pure culture to identify genes involved in fungal development and responses to light, while others will include the pathogen in its host to identify genes involved in fungal pathogenicity and in host resistance. Most experiments will be done with isolate IPO323 of M. gramincola, the strain that was sequenced. Availability of a completely sequenced genome for M. graminicola provides a unique opportunity to analyze global gene expression to identify candidate genes for pathogenicity, sporulation, mating, light reception/regulation and other important biological processes. For some host-pathogen interactions isolates T48 from Indiana and isolate Pasco from Australia may be used. Isolate T48 is avirulent on all resistance sources tested so far but gives good infection on susceptible controls. It was used to map genes Stb1, Stb4 and Stb8. The Pasco isolate was used to map resistance genes Stb2 and Stb3 and can be used as a backup in case of problems with one of the other isolates."

Our approach will be to:  a) Identify and characterize virulence determinants and host genes important in net form net blotch and spot form net blotch of barley through phenotyping and mapping of segregating host and pathogen populations. Host resistance genes will be mapped and characterized, and pathogen virulence genes will be mapped, characterized, and cloned. Additionally, the newly acquired P. teres f. teres genome sequence will be used to identify necrotrophic effectors (NEs) involved in disease induction. b) Identify and characterize NEs and their corresponding host sensitivity genes important in S. nodorum blotch of wheat. Host-pathogen interactions will be characterized through evaluation of host mapping populations and identification of new NEs through purification and bioinformatic analysis.  c) Identify and characterize factors affecting pathogenicity, virulence, and transmissibility of viruses infecting barley through the characterization of BSMV and OBDV model systems.

Approach: Viruses and cyst nematodes present the United States potato industry with its most severe regula-tory problems. This project primarily focuses on potato cyst nematodes (PCN), Potato virus Y (PVY), and Luteoviruses including Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) and the viruses causing barley yellow dwarf disease of cereal crops. The two species of PCN (Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida) are quaran-tine pests that cause direct crop losses, increase pest control costs, constrain cropping patterns, de-value property, and interfere with domestic and international trade of potato and many other soil-associated crops.  PVY and PLRV cause crop losses, interfere with marketing and trade of potato, and are the major diseases targeted by seed potato certification programs.  Additionally, management options for vector-borne viruses are extremely limited and an understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses are carried between hosts by insects will lead to new targets of opportunity to control these pathogens. In recent years, PCN and the necrotic strains of PVY have been spreading to new areas.  It has been determined that the population genetics of PCN and viral pathogens are far more dynamic than previously thought, and these genetic shifts profoundly influence disease detection and management strategies.  The overarching research goal is to develop an understanding of the major genetic and environmental factors that drive the dynamics of nematode and virus diseases. Multifaceted objectives needed to accomplish this research goal include: the improvement of detection and management strategies of the various pathogen populations, the identification of genetic mechanisms that regulate nematode and virus pathogenicity and pathogen movement within the crops, and the development of new sources of resistance in potato germplasm. Approaches include epidemiological and etiological studies to identify major factors contributing to the spread and diversification of these pathogens, fundamental studies of the mechanisms of pathogenesis and transmission of PCN and viruses, respectively and the collaborative development of potato germplasm with effective resistance to PCN and viruses. Rapid identification and containment, coupled with new strategies for management of nematode and virus diseases will help the U.S. potato industry remain viable and allow them to expand market share."

The function of the genes involved and the timing of the resistance response indicate that the only known Ug99 resistance mechanism in barley, the rpg4/Rpg5 locus, is possibly a remnant of a multilayered non-host resistance mechanism. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that barley is a recent host of wheat stem rust and this pathosystem has not resulted from ancient co-evolution between the pathogen and the host. The investigators expect to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the response and determine if it is an early non-host type of resistance. This information will fill gaps in the limited knowledge of plant innate immune systems and also be utilized to deploy more effective and durable resistance in important cereal crops including wheat and barley. The project will be utilized to recruit and train the next generation of molecular plant pathologists with special emphasis on peoples underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The cutting edge research tools and techniques used in the project and mentoring by the lead investigator will give undergraduate and graduate students an excellent educational opportunity."

These receptors, often called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), typically carry or associate with non-arginine-aspartate (non-RD) kinases that initiate complex signaling networks cumulating in broad-spectrum resistance. While it is now widely appreciated that PRRs play a key role in the immune response of plants and animals, little is known about the signaling pathways governing these responses. This is especially true in monocotyledonous species, which are estimated to contain a ten-fold larger number of PRRs as compared to dicots. This project exploits RiceNet, a previously experimentally validated genome-scale functional gene network of rice genes, to explore PRR-mediated immune responses in cereals on a genome-wide scale. Taking advantage of the observation that genetic modifiers of the same gene often cluster in gene networks, novel regulators of PRR-mediated immune responses can be effectively identified and prioritized based on local connectivity in such networks. The project will identify and validate subnetworks (i.e. sets of genes) governing rice, barley and wheat PRR-mediated immune responses, generate a new dataset for rice based on an innovative proteomics approach, and establish a genome-scale functional network for wheat. Results from these studies will lead to major advances in understanding the PRR-mediated immune response of cereal crops. Because pathways controlling PRR-mediated responses in rice are similar to those in other plants and animals, the expected results will be relevant to other species that will serve as a starting point to develop new strategies for engineering resistance in cereal crops. Researchers at all levels, from undergraduate student interns through postdoctoral scientists, will receive essential training in genomics, proteomics, pathology, and systems biology. The project will organize and hold a Networks in Immunity (NetI) workshop that will facilitate collaborations between increasing numbers of researchers in this important discipline. Results will be made broadly available, allowing for generation of novel hypotheses and biotechnological applications, and serve as a basis for comparative genomics studies. All validated interactions will be deposited into central protein-protein interaction databases such as IntAct, MINT, DIP, or bioGRID. All raw mass spectrometry data will be deposited into the Open Proteomics Database (http://bioinformatics.icmb.utexas.edu/OPD/) and raw proteomics datasets will be submitted to the public repositories PeptideAtlas (http://www.peptideatlas.org) or Tranche (https://proteomecommons.org/tranche/).  Finally, gene expression datasets will be deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public database at the NCBI."

The most significant crop in Montana was wheat (5.4 million acres, $1.4 billion) followed by barley (760k acres, $159 million). Our grain goes not only to support the livestock industry in Montana, but also for the export market. Plant diseases occur on every crop, and many threaten plant yield, quality, and sometimes human health. My project seeks to provide practical disease management options for crops grown in Montana. I will focus on the use of fungicides to control foliar pathogens and the role of viruses in our cropping systems. In 2011 the results of my research were used to save farmers in Montana $100 million in crop losses due to stripe rust throughout the state, and $500,000 in crop losses in Pondera County due to wheat viruses. Fungicides are very useful tools for disease control, but recent marketing for plant health benefit applications without disease in cereal crops may cause the development of disease organisms that cannot be killed by these chemicals (fungicide resistance), as has been seen in Europe. In addition, the economic benefit of spraying fungicides in an arid environment such as Montana is questionable when significant moisture is required for most fungal diseases to grow and infect plants. In the last 5 years I have rarely seen a yield benefit to fungicide application. We will likely see an increase in the number of acres to which a fungicide is applied where the economic benefit of that application is questionable. This project will continue on-farm fungicide trials, measuring disease and resulting yields. The information I provide growers and agricultural professionals via my extension activities including fact sheets, AgAlerts, presentations, field days, and media appearances will be used on farms and contribute to the economic viability of Montana cropping systems. I will also focus my efforts on include wheat viruses. Cereal viruses represent a growing and complex threat to the sustainability of the cereal cropping system. The wheat curl mite vectors multiple viruses among grassy weeds and cereal crops. Moreover, although wheat, barley, corn, oats, rye are all susceptible to viruses including Wheat streak mosaic virus, the impact of the more recently identified Wheat mosaic virus and Triticum mosaic virus are unknown. Understanding the spread of cereal viruses is critical as no effective chemical (acaracide) or genetics-based (plant breeding) management options exist. This project will result in a greater understanding of the susceptibility of wheat varieties to WSMV strains from across the Great Plains of the United States. This will assist wheat breeders in variety selection for resistance against WSMV. Farmers at high risk for WSMV may choose varieties with resistance to viruses to reduce disease losses. This is particularly relevant in southern states, where early planting and grazing of winter wheat facilitates the pathogen survival in green plant material."

Eastern Montana produced nearly 48 million bushels of spring wheat in 2010, about 46% of the spring wheat produced in Montana. Approximately 82% of the Montana durum crop was produced in this region. More foreign markets are showing interest in purchasing durum from this area, including Italy and Japan. Malt barley acres have increased in eastern Montana and western North Dakota, with Anheuser-Busch contracting up to 20 million bushels. While eastern Montana is not a major winter wheat production area, winter wheat can be an important crop in rotation with spring wheat by controlling winter weeds and spreading out the timing of farm work in the spring and fall. About 29% of Montana alfalfa hay was produced in this region in 2010. This project develops and maintains several durum populations, selecting for high gluten strength, low cadmium content, disease resistance, and stem solidness for sawfly resistance. The project evaluates experimental lines and new varieties of various crops to identify those most adapted to this area. All tests are replicated small plots. Experimental lines are evaluated for disease and insect resistance, lodging resistance, and quality characters, including milling and baking, malt production, and pasta production. This resulted in the release of 9 spring wheat varieties, 21 winter wheat varieties, 10 barley varieties, 1 alfalfa variety, 1 forage wheat variety and 1 teff variety. More varieties are on track for release in the near future. This project has developed recommendations for seeding rates, nutrient management, and irrigation rates, and will provide more information to small grain and forage producers about yield and quality of various varieties so that the growers can make informed decisions about which varieties to grow and how best to manage the crop."

Continued genetic improvement of corn is necessary to meet our future food, feed and fuel needs. Modern genome-deciphering technology has identified a novel and large portion of the genome, designated  repetitive elements  that is hypothesized to affect plant growth, yield and development. However, repetitive elements themselves are only recently being investigated and their impact on the corn plant is poorly understood. An interesting feature is the ability of some repetitive elements to move around the genome, disrupting various sub-genome regions. These are called retrotransposons, which actually excise from one area and re-integrate into another area of the genome. Therefore, this research will facilitate an improved understanding of how the repetitive elements of the genome affect gene expression, as variation in gene expression directly affects plant phenotype, growth and yield. As corn is the model of sorts for plants with large genomes (which includes many crop plants such as sugarcane, wheat and barley), the research proposed here will impact crop plants other than corn, if funded."

Development of disease resistant, higher yielding, high-quality, lodging resistant varieties decreases the farmer's per unit cost of production by increasing the yield and quality of his product without increased costs. Control of diseases through the use of resistant varieties rather than through the use of fungicides is preferable because using fungicides increases input costs and fungicide use involves several risks; the risk of ground water contamination, and the risk of ineffective control because of weather limitations on timely application. The development of improved germplasm for use by other public and private sector wheat breeders will gain recognition for the University of Illinois. Use of this germplasm will benefit farmers in Illinois since resultant varieties may be well adapted in Illinois as well as in other states. Basic research studies on wheat will contribute to increased understanding of wheat genetics and development, increased efficiency in breeding and evaluation, and better methods of selection including molecular marker assisted selection. This project also performs service functions in the education of future plant breeders, through evaluation of germplasm from other programs in the Uniform Eastern Soft Red Winter Wheat Nursery, and evaluation of germplasm for resistance to wheat soil borne mosaic virus, scab, and barley yellow dwarf virus."

Wheat is the most important crop and cultivated on large acreages in the state. Many diseases occur on wheat in the region. Tan spot, Stagonospora leaf blotch, spot blotch, bacterial leaf streak, rusts, and Fusarium head blight are the most important diseases that have serious impact on wheat production in the South Dakota. Losses due to these diseases vary from year to year depending on the conditions suitable for disease development, pathogen virulence and cultivar used; however, 5 to 7% yield losses are common in every growing season. Recently, a new race (Ug99) has been identified in Puccinia graminis, causes stem rust of wheat and barley, which has the ability to incite disease in most of the wheat cultivars, resistant to previously identified races, grown worldwide. Host resistance and chemicals applications are considered to be the most effective disease management strategies. However, development of durable resistant cultivars to a particular disease requires a continuous search of new sources of resistance due to potential virulence changes in the pathogen population. Excessive use of fungicides, especially with a single site mode of action could lose their effectiveness quickly due to acquiring resistance due to single point mutation the pathogen population. Additionally, use of frequent fungicides as a disease management strategy provides opportunity to weak pathogens to thrive and becomes major problem and eliminate beneficial microflora. Multiple races have been reported in Pyrenopohra tritici-repentis (Ptr), causes tan spot of wheat based on their ability to incite different symptoms (necrosis and chlorosis) in susceptible wheat. The fungus also produces host-selective toxins (effectors) responsible for either chlorosis or necrosis symptom and considered to be the pathogenicity and/or virulence factor in wheat-tan spot host-pathogen system. Some Ptr isolates have been identified which lacks in producing any toxin (effector) but equally virulent on toxin sensitive and insensitive wheat genotypes. Similarly, some wheat genotypes have shown sensitivity to Ptr ToxA but resistant to its producer race. Multiple host selective effectors have been identified in Stagonospora nodorum, one of the important wheat and barley pathogens causes stagonospora nodorum leaf blotch, and play a significant role in the disease development. Knowledge of genetic variation in the pathogens population, disease epidemiology, pathogen physiology, and sources of resistance in the host plant is very essential in the development of integrated disease management strategies (IDMS). The improved IDMS would make small grains production more profitable that would ultimately improve the lives of their producers in South Dakota and help in eliminating hunger globally."

The vast majority of this production occurred in the eastern dryland production area of the state. Using an average price per bushel of $7.50, the value of the 2012 Washington wheat crop was just shy of $1.1 billion. This is a significant source of revenue for the state of Washington and its citizens. Weeds are major pests in barley and wheat production systems in eastern Washington, and herbicides are a major input expense for growers in conventional and direct-seed production systems. Weeds reduce grain yields as a result of direct competition for water, nutrients, and light. Weed seeds can also reduce the value of harvested grain by increasing dockage or foreign material above acceptable levels. Conservation tillage systems have provided many benefits to growers and the environment including reduced soil erosion by both water and wind; improved soil, water, and air quality; increased soil water storage, particularly in the drier rainfall zones of eastern Washington; and reduced fuel, time, and labor costs. Weeds often pose the single greatest threat to successful adoption and maintenance of conservation tillage cropping systems. Integrated weed management attempts to combine a number of weed control tactics to keep weeds at a manageable level. These tactics include mechanical (tillage), cultural, chemical, and preventative methods. Rattail fescue is a winter annual grass that is difficult to control in dryland direct-seed wheat cropping systems. Russian-thistle has been proven to be difficult to control in summer fallow without tillage. A combination of herbicide resistance and tolerance in weeds is making it very difficult to control a number of weeds in the small grain cropping systems of eastern Washington. New herbicide modes of action are increasingly rare. Eastern Washington small grain growers will need to adopt multiple tactics to control troublesome weeds in their production systems. This is particularly important in conservation tillage systems where tillage is minimized or eliminated. Developing the best combinations of tactics for troublesome weeds that are effective, economical to deploy, and environmentally sustainable will be the focus of the proposed work."

Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is by far the most important winter small grain crop and was planted on slightly more than 600,000 hectares in southern and western Nebraska in 2012. Having one program specifically targeting Nebraska production is needed to ensure that the Nebraska wheat producer has well adapted, high yielding cultivars. Winter triticale (X.Triticosecale rimpaui Wittm.) is an emerging crop that is slowly increasing in acreage, but has great potential as a feed grain and forage crop. Winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) has the smallest potential market, perhaps due to the increased risks involved with growing the least winterhardy small grain when compared to winter wheat and triticale. However, barley is the most drought tolerant grain crop of the three cereals and, with climate change, may increase its production area in the Great Plains. In addition to the changes in where and how small grains are grown, the end-use markets are rapidly evolving. . The purpose of this project is to develop new winter small grains (wheat, triticale, and barley) cultivars with improved performance and stability over diverse environments. The project will also develop germplasm and improved breeding methods. In the germplasm area, transgenic and hybrid wheat are the last great frontiers in wheat and both have potential for significant productivity gains. Hence small efforts in both frontier areas should be undertaken. Biotic and abiotic stresses continue to be the major constraints to increasing productivity and the greatest cause of yield and end-use quality instability. The biotic stresses include diseases and insects. The abiotic stresses include low winter temperatures, high temperatures during grain filling, and drought, which can occur any time during the plant growth cycle, but especially affects winter small grain yields when it occurs during grain filling. Historically the USDA University of Nebraska collaborative research program has been the primary developer of wheat cultivars grown in Nebraska. Cultivars developed by this program are normally grown on 50 to 80% of the wheat acreage. As mentioned earlier, this program is the only public developer of winter barley cultivars, and along with the Texas A & M University program, we are one of only two public winter forage and grain triticale cultivar providers in the Great Plains. This market domination of UNL small grains cultivars has occurred due to the skill of the breeding team, the unique climatic conditions, and the people of Nebraska who provide funds to support cultivar development. Wheat cultivars that increase the state yield by one bushel per acre will increase farm revenue by $13,000,000. Additional benefits will accrue to the milling and baking industries and by the consumer."

Eight of the top ten commodities in Michigan are field crops, or dependent on field crops (livestock, egg production). Corn is the leading crop in the state in acreage (2.5 million acres) and cash value, followed by soybean (1.9 million acres). Unlike neighboring corn-belt states driven by corn and beans, Michigan grows a diversity of field crops, ranking first in several types of dry beans and fourth in sugarbeets. Other field crops include alfalfa, pasture, and other forages; small grains such as wheat, barley, oats, and rye. With the global demand for grain for direct consumption and livestock feed, as well as for biofuels, crop prices are at a high and field crop acreage is expanding in the state. Invasive species were and continue to be a major problem in the U.S. Michigan is a potential hot-spot for insect introductions, home to Great Lakes shipping ports, airports in Detroit and Chicago with non-stop flights to Asia, and a diverse crop base vulnerable to colonization by many species. Other invaders, foreign and native, are expanding in their range into Michigan. Thus producers are presented with new challenges from both foreign-invasive and native-invasive species that increase in pest status or range. Established and new insect invaders are now responsible for the majority of insect-caused yield and quality loss in Michigan field crops, influencing pest management decisions, driving insecticide use and reducing profitability. Tied in with invasive species is the issue of climate change. For some field crop insect pests, damage is getting worse and the damage period is growing longer during the season. A reality in field crop production is the use of biotechnology, specifically genetically modified crops with herbicide resistance or Bt insecticide toxin. According to the USDA Economic Research Service, 86% of the corn, and 91% of the soybean, acres in Michigan were transgenic in the 2012 planting season. Because universities have little role in the development of this technology, land grant entomologists are viewed as neutral observers and thus have an important role to play in education and making public statements. A by-product of the introduction of Bt crops is overuse. Growers plant hybrids expressing insecticides that they don't need, exposing insect populations to traits year-after-year. This is antithetical to the principles of integrated pest management, because it increases the chance for resistance. This project concentrates on understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive species, climate change and use of technology. The long term goal is to generate research and recommendations to producers that reduce unnecessary insecticide use, protecting growers profitability, the environment and human health."

Although members of this family can be found on a variety of niches, the best-known ones are plant pathogens that cause destructive diseases in our crops. For example, species of Mycosphaerella, Cercospora, Alternaria, Pyrenophora, Cochliobolus and Leptosphaeria are all notorious pathogens that produce devastating diseases on wheat, sugarbeet, vegetable crops, barley, corn and the brassicas, respectively. Notably, many Dothideomycetes are known to cause disease on a particular host only or to have a narrow host-range but the genetic and evolutionary bases of host-specificity as well as several aspects of their pathogenesis on plants remain unknown. Microbes secrete numerous proteins (collectively known as the secretome) to alter and adapt to their environment. The secretome has an essential role in microbial physiology, survival and communication with each other and the environment. Effector proteins in particular, are secreted by plant pathogens during pathogenesis to suppress or evade the plant immune system and thus can determine microbial pathogenicity. Comparative genomics analyses have revealed large differences in effector repertoires among microbial pathogens adapted on different or the same host, which contributes to and often sometimes defines the underlying differences in virulence and host-spectra among different species or strains of a species. While differences in effector repertoires can be indicative of changes in life-styles and evolutionary adaptations in particular hosts, similarities on the other hand can reveal the pathogenic core utilized by microbes to infect their hosts and their potential for a host shift. In such cases, host shifts are more likely for pathogens that infect different hosts but have similar effector suites. The aim of this Hatch project is to identify and functionally characterize the effector repertoire of 13 Dothideomycete species that although they are evolutionary relatives they differ in their host-range. These studies will provide a deeper understanding of fungal pathogenesis on plants and will shed further light on the genomic and evolutionary changes associated with adaptation of plant pathogens to different hosts and life-styles. This is extremely important in today's global ecosystem, not only because infectious diseases caused by fungi are increasingly recognized as a major threat to global food production and security, but also because globalization continuously brings previously isolated hosts and pathogens in contact with each other, thus increasing the risk for the emergence of new diseases. The engineering of durable resistance is one of the main goals of plant pathology and the successful completion of this project will generate novel opportunities for achieving this goal. Effector pathogenomics will facilitate the discovery and functional profiling of microbial effectors and cognate plant resistance genes at a high rate that will accelerate the engineering of resistance in plants through molecular breeding programs."

However, there are many parts of this market which are not being fulfilled; two of the missing pieces are various styles of gluten-free beers (e.g. IPAs, stouts, porters, etc.) and gluten-free malts for the craft brewer, microbrewer, brewpub, and homebrewer who want to make their own gluten-free beer. To address these shortcomings, it is necessary to produce gluten-free malts from which beer can be brewed. The two approaches to produce gluten-free malts are to use gluten-free grains or to reduce the gluten content of existing malts. We have chosen to use gluten-free sorghum to produce gluten-free malts. The proposed research and development initiative focuses on developing new gluten-free malts based on New Mexico grown sorghum to provide the necessary ingredients to produce a wide range of gluten-free beer styles. The research will initially focus on developing three types of malt from sorghum: base malts which provide the majority of sugars for fermentation; caramel malts which provide body, color, sweetness, and head retention; and roasted malts which provide flavors such as coffee and chocolate and color. By blending these malts in different proportions and by carefully selecting the hops and yeast used in brewing, a wide range of styles from pale ales to stouts and porters can be made. Once optimum process conditions for producing the gluten-free malts have been identified, the project will shift focus to how the malts can be used. Here, attention will be given to the production of wort (the sugar containing solution that is fermented into beer) using the gluten-free malts. Of concern is the possible lack of the enzymes necessary to convert carbohydrates into fermentable sugars. The necessary chemistry and engineering studies to obtain an optimum conversion will be conducted. When successfully completed, this project should result in a wide range of gluten-free malts suitable for brewing. These malts could be sold in packages ranging from 1 pound bags for homebrewers to 50 pound sacks for micro- and craft brewers, to truck and train loads for regional brewers. Given the current retail prices for similar barley products (a single pound sells for $1.50 to $3.00 while a 50 pound bag sells for $50 to $70), these represent a significant value added opportunity for New Mexico sorghum growers."

An estimated 79% of Idaho's dairy cows are located in only 7 counties in Southwestern and South-central Idaho. Cows in the intensive dairy-producing counties produce an estimated 13.2 million tons of manure every year. In this same region, large acreage is dedicated to a variety of high-value crops. Specifically, there are 118,000 acres of sugar beets, 68,000 acres of potatoes, 111,200 acres of barley, and 231,450 acres of wheat. Fields that are nearer dairies commonly receive the highest rates of applications, as a means to dispose of the manure while avoiding expensive transportation costs to move the manure to fields further away from the dairies. Alternatively, many Idaho growers are realizing the benefit of manure as a nutrient source and soil amendment, and are applying manure to their fields as an affordable source of phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients. However, there are concerns that manure does not contain enough P and/or K to replace fertilizers at lower application rates. At the higher rates used for waste disposal, there are concerns with degraded soil quality due to salt and copper accumulations, degraded water quality due to phosphorus accumulation and nitrate leaching, crop yield losses, and crop nutrient toxicities. To avoid some of the issues related pest and pathogen pressure, sugar beet and potato growers commonly apply manures prior to establishing the grain crop in their rotation due to the perception that root crops are more susceptible to pathogen and disease issues than grain crops. Some fields near dairies continue to receive manure applications on a yearly basis, regardless of crop. The majority of the research regarding manure applications and plant growth in southern Idaho has been focused on only one, two, or three annual manure applications. These research efforts have not captured the impact of repeated manure applications over several years on crop production. These types of applications are more realistic to the common practices of a dairy operation, and will better reflect soil quality, soil nutrient, crop yield, crop quality, microbial, and pest pressure responses than shorter-term manure applications. The goal of this project is to determine the impact of repeated manure applications to a wheat-potato-barley-sugar beet irrigated crop rotation at varying rates and timings on yield, crop quality, plant nutrient uptake, soil nutrient accumulations, soil organic matter, and soluble salts. We will achieve this goal by conducting an eight-year field study focused on dairy manure application rate and timing. Three manure rates (7, 14, and 21 dry ton/acre) and two timings (every year and every other year) will be evaluated. We will observe how these treatments impact crop growth and soil quality. Crops to be evaluated will include wheat, barley, potatoes, and sugar beets. Using information generated by this study, the expected impact is improved crop quality, soil quality, and water quality on crop fields receiving repeated dairy manure field applications."

These grasses provide more than 20% of the caloric intake for the human population. The ability of these crops to flower at the appropriate time, is critical not only for the plant&#39;s reproductive success, but also to maximize grain production for human consumption. The plant&#39;s capacity to target flowering-time to the optimal seasonal window requires the coordination of two main environmental seasonal signals: day length (photoperiod), and long exposures to cold temperature (vernalization). Additional local environmental signals, such as drought and salinity stresses, or nutrient availability, also affect flowering-time. A precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the coordination of these seasonal and local environmental signals is required to engineer cereal varieties adapted to a changing environment - in particular global warming. This is exceptionally urgent in crop plants, where fundamental research into flower-time lags behind that of popular plant model systems (i.e. Arabidopsis). A direct translation of the information from model systems to the temperate grasses is not always possible because the vernalization and photoperiod responses in these two plant lineages evolved independently using different types of genes, resulting in very different flowering-time regulatory pathways. Thus, research efforts dedicated to investigating flowering-time in the temperate cereals must be carried out if we are to understand flowering-time in these crop plants. Recent studies in wheat have shown specific components of the flowering-time pathway to associate with a distinct family of proteins known as Nuclear Factor Y proteins (NF-Y). These proteins have been extensively studied in mammals and fungi where they exist as three individual gene subunits (NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC) that form a trimeric protein complex that regulates multiple genes. Interestingly, in plants, there has been an unprecedented expansion of these NF-Y gene families, where ~10 copies for each subunit are present. This increase in NF-Y gene number, together with their interactions with the flowering-time components, has the potential to generate a vast number of molecular combinations, providing a flexible system to integrate the many environmental signals involved in the regulation of flowering-time. However, the functional role of the different NF-Y genes in regulating flowering-time in the temperate cereals has not been studied so far. This is problematic because these genes play a central role in the integration of different environmental signals. This research uses a diploid temperate grass (barley) to elucidate the specific roles of the NF-YB proteins in the integration of photoperiod, vernalization and stress signals in the flowering-time pathway. The knowledge generated form this project is expected to accelerate the development of new barley and wheat varieties better adapted to a changing environment."

Genetic analyses suggest that FHB resistance in wheat is quantitative, controlled by two or three major genes plus some minor genes. Extensive mapping efforts have indicated that QTL Fhb1 plays a major role in FHB resistance in wheat. Our previous studies identified a candidate gene for Fhb1 (WFhb1_c1). Partial cDNA sequence obtained for WFhb1_c1 may encode a pectin methyl esterase inhibitor (PMEI). The goal of this proposal is to examine the role of WFhb1_c1 gene in FHB resistance in wheat. Our specific objectives include: to uncover potential DNA sequence polymorphism between the resistant and susceptible alleles of WFhb1_c1; to examine WFhb1_c1&#39;s role in FHB resistance in planta; and to study WFhb1_c1&#39;s potential PMEI activity. We will clone the gene including regulatory sequences from wheat varing in resistance. The gene will be overexpressed or silenced in wheat using a transient expression system for functional analysis. Recombinant proteins of WFhb1_c1 will be produced for PMEI activity assay. This project directly aligns with Program Priority Area-Understanding Plant-Associated Microorganism and Plant-Microbe Interactions (A1121) and two of the research area foci. A thorough understanding of the mechanism by which wheat interacts with Fusarium should help identify key step(s) that can be manipulated to mitigate FHB epidemics, which offers significant economic value to US agricultural production."

Over the past five crop seasons (2007-2012), these crops have been grown on an average of 1,260,000 acres in the US with an average harvest value of over $320 million. These crops also contribute to the success of the US wheat and barley industry by serving as useful rotation crops in small grain production systems.   This research project has three objectives that focus on developing new and improved varieties of cool season food legumes (peas, lentils, and chickpeas) and effective integrated disease control strategies for these crops.   1) Develop and release new varieties and germplasm of peas, lentils, and chickpea that have higher seed mineral concentrations; improved host-plant resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, Sclerotinia wilt and Ascochyta blight; and higher yields than existing commercial varieties.   2) Identify genetic markers closely associated with superior yield, optimal plant height for harvest, seed mineral concentration, resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, and improved cold tolerance for autumn-sown peas, and validate their utility for marker-assisted plant breeding. Sub-objective 2A:  Identify molecular markers in adapted pea populations that are associated with important traits including concentrations of minerals in seed, resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, and winter hardiness.  Sub-objective 2B:  Identify molecular markers in adapted chickpea populations that are associated with seed size and early maturity.   3) Develop efficient techniques to screen peas, lentils, and chickpeas for host-plant resistance to Ascochyta blight and Sclerotinia wilt, and characterize genetic and physiological factors responsible for the virulence of these pathogens.  Sub-objective 3A:  Develop efficient techniques to screen peas, lentils and chickpeas for resistance to Ascochyta blight and Sclerotinia white mold. Sub-objective 3B:  Deter  Approach: New varieties and germplasm will be developed from pure lines selected from among segregating populations of peas, lentils, and chickpeas. Cyclical hybridization will be conducted to combine favorable alleles for traits of interest. Parental lines will include adapted germplasm, commercial cultivars and accessions from the various international breeding programs. Promising breeding lines will be released as either germplasm or varieties based on a rigorous comparison of their performance relative to that of commercial check varieties.   Linkage analysis and the detection of associations between markers and different traits will be done using simple sequence repeats (SSRs), expressed sequence tagged- SSRs, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pea recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations will be developed from a cross between Aragorn and Kiflica to identify markers associated with seed mineral concentrations. RILs from a cross between the pea cultivars Medora and Melrose will be used to identify markers associated with cold tolerance. Molecular markers associated with seed size and early maturity in chickpea will be detected using a RIL population developed from an interspecific cross between C. arientinum line Flip 90-27 and PI599072 (C. reticulatum). Associations between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) conditioning traits of interest  will be detected by composite interval mapping.  Improved methods will be developed to screen chickpea for reaction to Ascochyta blight. Toxins will be purified from liquid cultures of A. rabiei. Toxins will be adjusted to various concentrations and applied to detached chickpea leaflets. Leaflets treated with water will be used as controls. The speed of lesion development and final lesion size will be used to compare the reactions of different chickpea genotypes. The relationship between field disease scores of the chickpea genotypes and their sensitivity to the toxin will be determined. Studies to develop more efficient methods to screen peas and lentils for reaction to Sclerotinia white mold will initially examine resistant and susceptible materials reported in prior studies. Plants will be grown in the greenhouse and inoculated with agar plugs containing mycelia of S. sclerotiorum. Disease reaction will be scored by measuring the length of the lesion produced by the fungus over different time points.   Two approaches will be taken to investigate the genetic factors responsible for pathogenicity and virulence of S. sclerotiorum. One approach will be to use Agrobacterium mediated transformation (AMT) to generate random mutations that will be screened to detect mutants with reduced virulence. The other approach will be to identify genes of S. sclerotiorum that are differentially expressed during the processes of infection and disease development."

More than 140,000 small grains accessions will be conserved. Each year 5-10 percent of National Small Grains Collection (NSGC) accessions will be regenerated. Seeds and associated information will be distributed on request to scientists. 2) Conduct genetic characterizations and phenotypic evaluations of wheat, barley, oats, rye, and other small grains and related wild species for priority genetic and agronomic traits. Apply the preceding knowledge to genetic resource acquisition and curation of selected taxa. Ploidy levels of wheat landraces and wild species of wheat, barley, and oats will be verified. Characterization data will be completed for key descriptors in wheat, barley, and oats. Kernel hardness will be determined for accessions of common bread wheat. 3) Identify and genetically characterize host-plant resistance to the virulent stem rust race Ug99 from NSGC wheat accessions.  Approach: Established procedures will be followed to maintain all NSGC germplasm accessions, with special attention to seed preparation and planting, plant pathogen monitoring, harvest, and laboratory processing. Seed of NSGC accessions are held in medium-term storage under controlled temperature (5-6 C) and relative humidity (25%). Inventory records, including quantity of seed on hand, viability, and date of last regeneration, are maintained in GRIN. Accessions will be scheduled for regeneration based on a priority matrix. Seed will be provided to the NCGRP for safety back up. Standard procedures for GRIN Order Processing will be followed. Distributions outside of the US will follow phytosanitary requirements of the recipient country, including import permits, phytosanitary certificates, and additional declarations. USDA-APHIS will be consulted regularly for the latest information on seed export. The ploidy analyses will be conducted with the Partec CyFlow Ploidy Analyser® following protocols from the manufacturer and modifications developed locally for more efficient analyses of small grains species. Descriptor data will primarily be collected from the voucher images, but direct field and laboratory observations will also be used. Kernel hardness analyses will be performed with the Perten® Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS 4100), which is the wheat industry standard and is supported by USDA-Federal Grain Inspection Service. To identify new sources of resistance to the Ug99 lineage of Pgt, winter habit wheat landraces from the NSGC will be screened. Because field testing capacity at Njoro, Kenya is limited, the accessions will first be tested for adult plant resistance to US races in field trials St. Paul, MN in cooperation with an ARS scientist at the USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory (CDL). Accessions with resistance to the US races will then be tested as adult plants in the field for resistance to Ug99 and its variants in the USDA nursery in Kenya.   Accessions showing resistance in one Kenya test will be re-tested to confirm results and tested for seedling resistance to race TTKSK at the CDL. To map resistance to the Ug99 lineage of Pgt in spring wheat landraces and ascertain the relationship to known sources of resistance, mapping populations will be developed from crosses previously made with the susceptible spring line LMPG-6. Mapping populations will be generated either through single seed descent to the F6 generation or through doubled haploid (DH) production. At least 150 DH lines or recombinant inbred lines (RIL) per cross will be generated. The lines will be evaluated for adult plant resistance in the USDA nursery in Kenya and as seedlings against race TTKSK at the CDL."

The main focus will be the genetics/epigenetics of grain phosphorus (P) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L) and maize (Zea mays L.). Since grain total P represents a major pool in the flux of P through agricultural ecosystems, variants for this trait will provide new resources for managing P use in agriculture, thus will contribute to its long-term sustainability.  Objective 1:  Analyze the physiology and genetics of total phosphorus, phytic acid, and other seed constituents important to end-use quality in barley and maize.  [NP301, C3, PS3A] Sub-objective 1.1: Continued genetic analyses of barley High Inorganic P mutants. Sub-objective 1.2: Isolation and study of recessive alleles of barley lpa1 and its maize homolog. Sub-objective 1.3: Forward genetics screens for seed total P mutants in barley and maize.  Objective 2:  Determine the relative roles of genetic and epigenetic factors in the phytate and related pathways in barley and maize.  [NP301, C3, PS3A] Sub-objective 2.1: Epigenetics of maize lpa1. Sub-objective 2.2: Environmental induction of heritable epigenetic change in barley.  Sub-objective 2.3: The epigenetic contribution to recurrent selection gain in barley.  Approach: Sub-objective 1.1: Hypothesis: Barley MAz423 is a novel “high seed total P” mutant with no impact on yield. Analyses of barely MAz423 will define mode of inheritance, confirmation of seed P phenotype and correlation or lack with seed yield. If warranted, mapping and gene identification will proceed. Studies of additional barley lpa mutants will continue.  Sub-objective 1.2: Hypotheses: Barley lpa1 encodes a novel seed P transporter important to phytic acid and total P. “Complementation” and “knock-out” will determine if the putative P transporter is the gene perturbed in barley lpa1. New recessive alleles of the transporter in both barley and maize will be isolated using “TILLING”. Analyses of these new alleles will determine if the barley lpa1 phenotype can be engineered in maize. Sub-objective 1.3: Hypothesis: We can isolate alleles that impact seed total P but have little or no impact on maternal plant P. Chemically-mutagenized maize and barley populations will be screened for mutations that perturb seed total P amount and distribution. Genetics and inheritance of selected mutations will be studied in greater detail to identify those that perturb seed P without perturbing maternal plant P.    Sub-objective 2.1: Hypothesis: Epigenetic silencing at lpa1 occurs both spontaneously and via paramutation. Analyses will describe the occurrence of these phenomena at maize lpa1, defining rate and critical sequences/modifications. Next-generation sequencing combined with bisulfite sequencing will be used in mapping/sequencing cytosine methylation and sequence changes and additional methods will be used to study histone modification.  Sub-objective 2.2: Hypotheses: heritable plant growth phenotype changes and other molecular adaptations, in response to environmental stresses such as P nutrient deficiency, will be observed with barley and can be used to develop lines more productive under nutrient or other stress. Plants will be grown to maturity under various P nutritional or other stresses, and the seed they produce will be used to study inheritance of growth habit and molecular adaptations. The genetic versus epigenetic contribution to heritable adaptive responses will be determined using current methods including high-throughput, low-cost next-generation sequencing. Sub-objective 2.3: Hypotheses: Heritable epigenetic change contributes substantially to gains due to recurrent selection; recurrent selection for yield or stress tolerance can substantially enhance performance of low-phytate lines. Various recurrent selection schemes for performance under field conditions or under experimentally-induced abiotic stress, will be conducted with sets of barley low phytic acid isolines. Gain-due-to-selection for various performance parameters will be quantitated. Current methods of such as mapping-by-sequencing and techniques including bulked-segregant analyses, low-cost high-throughput next-generation sequencing, bisulfite sequencing, and sample multiplexing will be used to quantitate the contribution of genetic versus epigenetics to gain-due-to-selection."

Subobjective 2B: Validation of SNP markers linked to ß-glucan content, malt extract, and diastatic power.  Objective 3: Develop novel biotechnological approaches for the production of genetically engineered barley and oat.    Subobjective 3A: Develop Ds-based and/or recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) gene delivery systems.  Subobjective 3B: Develop transgenic barley lines resistant to Fusarium infection and/or deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation  Approach: The three objectives are separate but complementary.  Objective 1: Germplasm improvement is based on modified pedigree breeding with single seed descent, multi-location in-house and collaborative test locations, off-site winter nurseries, and winter greenhouse facilities to minimize time for varietal development. Multiple breeding targets, corresponding to specific end uses, include: spring malting barley, spring barley, and oat for food and feed. The process is similar for barley and oat, except for the specific set of targeted characteristics. Procedures are based primarily on phenotypic measurements and laboratory analyses of grain quality. Markers are being developed for key traits to enable more efficient allelic selection for trait improvement and will be used as they are developed. Failure to make adequate progress will be corrected by incorporating alternative germplasm, increasing numbers of crosses, and by increasing test environment numbers and/or quality to increase the frequency of obtaining superior progeny.   Objective 2: Based on the hypothesis that SNP markers closely linked to genes for OCR and BSR resistance genes, and for malting quality, will exist. OCR resistance will be assessed and mapped within five oat populations with markers from the oat 6K SNP iSelect Illumina array. BSR resistance will be assessed and mapped within four barley populations, and malting quality in two barley populations, with markers from the barley 9K SNP iSelect Illumina array. Phenotyping will be based on multi-year, multi-location field and/or greenhouse trials. Markers identified will be validated as useful by examination of allelic effects in alternative existing or newly-created populations. Multiple genomic databases will be examined to assist the identification of candidate genes underlying QTLs. Failure to identify useful QTLs or candidate gene may require development and testing of additional populations, novel markers, or analysis of new genomic reces as they become available.   Objective 3: Based on the hypothesis that Ds-mediated transposition will produce plants with single-copy loci in regions suitable for high expression, the  goal is to produce  clean  transgenic plants without with intact, single-copy transgenes free of extraneous DNA derived from bacterial vectors or selectable markers genes. This system utilizes two very short (~600 bp in total length) sequences derived from another food crop, maize, that when flanking other sequences can transpose--along with the intervening sequences--to new location. Transposition is controlled by introducing the relevant enzymatic activity via crosses to Ac transposase--expressing plants. Vectors will be constructed and introduced via Agrobacterium-mediated delivery. Research will concentrate on commercial cultivars, and genes with activity against Fusarium head blight or that suppress mycotoxin production will be introduced. Failure of proper gene expression is guarded against by using. The use of Ds transposition to deliver genes tends to promote good expression, and multiple candidate genes are available, some of which have imparted useful levels of resistance in preliminary work."

Examine the role of the plant hormones ABA and GA in controlling seed dormancy, germination, and preharvest sprouting tolerance.  Approach: Objective 1.  We will evaluate a total of 6,356 accessions for resistance to freezing injury, Fusarium crown rot, lesion nematodes, cyst nematodes, and stripe rust. We will conduct these evaluations using facilities at WSU, including controlled environments in the WSU Plant growth facility and at the Spillman Agronomy Farm. We will use the genomic information generated by the T-CAP for the existing core collection to link phenotypes to genotypes. We will also screen germplasm from U.S. regional nurseries. These selections will be genotyped to determine relationships and, on the theory that genetic control of resistance will be different among genetically diverse genotypes, traits from the most diverse will be introgressed into adapted cultivars, and germplasm adapted to various regions of the U.S. carrying unique new sources of resistance and molecular markers that can be used to select for these new resistance loci.   Objective 2.  Specific areas that are being targeted in SNP development include identification of SNP markers linked to stem and stripe rust resistance genes, climatic resilience and identification of SNP in wheat responsible for regional and market class adaptation. The current small grains single plant core collections are being evaluated for SNP linkages to drought, stripe, leaf and stem rust response. As new, verified markers are identified, they will be made available to the customers of the genotyping laboratory as applicable to the customers’ research and breeding objectives. Our goal is to transition away from single gene selection using SSR markers, genotyping by sequencing and incorporate genome selection utilizing SNPs through SNP-chip platforms.  Objective 3.  Pathways and mechanisms controlling drought and cold tolerance, pre-harvest sprouting, and rust resistance in wheat will be elucidated. Indirect selection for tolerance to freezing and to drought based on physiological traits associated with drought and freezing tolerance will be carried out as part of the selection process. Plant lines will be selected for higher water use efficiency, deeper roots, and higher photosynthetic efficiency to develop better grain yield and grain-filling under drought stress. Transcriptome analysis will be used to identify pathways and mechanisms responding to freezing stress and stripe rust. Key genes will be identified and their expression monitored under stress conditions, thereby identifying plant lines differing in their abilities to respond to parts of the freezing or infection process. Variation in sensitivity to plant hormones will be investigated as a means to control and improve seedling emergence and preharvest sprouting tolerance. These different abilities and sensitivities will be genetically combined, resulting in improved stress tolerance."

Transform and test barley with candidate genes for reduced FHB and DON identified through model systems. Sub-objective 3b. Transform and test barley with RNAi constructs against fungal genes for reduced FHB and DON.  Approach: The goal of this project is the genetic improvement of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) by application of molecular genetics and biotechnology to increase disease and pest resistance. Research will target molecular mapping approaches for resistance to greenbug [Schizaphis graminum (Rondari)] and Russian wheat aphid [RWA Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov)], insect pests that are of increasing importance as barley production moves west and additional aphid biotypes are discovered. Initial association mapping of RWA resistance suggests involvement of genes for domestication. This association will be further investigated using an expanded population and single nucleotide repeat (SNP) markers to identify candidate genes in key genomic positions. Additional biotypes of RWA will be tested on the expanded population to identify biotype-specific resistance. The two named greenbug resistance genes Rsg1 and Rsg2 do not provide protection against some of the new isolates emerging in farmers’ fields. Eight new sources will be mapped using F6 derived lines from crosses to a winter barley cultivar. Fusarium head blight (FHB) and resultant contamination of grain with the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) are ongoing problems in major barley production regions. Genetic transformation research will continue with candidate genes for resistance and low DON. In conjunction, ongoing research to improve tissue culture regeneration and transformation systems will continue to examine the role of ethylene in regeneration and to test improved transformation constructs carrying genes for reducing FHB and DON. Transformation constructs will be designed to separate genes of interest from selectable marker genes, and to insert the genes of interest into euchromatic areas that provide stable expression."

Subobjective 3.2. Determine the sequence of cereal, pulse and oilseed crops in no-till dryland rotations that optimizes yield, crop water productivity, and N-use efficiency.  Approach: Agriculture is facing major challenges in providing food, fiber, and fuel to a growing population with limited land and water resources. With rising incomes, longer life spans, changes in dietary preferences, and demands for improved nutrition, pressures are mounting to double agricultural production by 2050. In the Northern Great Plains, traditional dryland cropping systems that include conventional tillage with crop-fallow are uneconomical and unsustainable. Also, with the availability of unallocated irrigation water in the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers, areas under irrigated cropping systems are poised to increase in the MonDak region (eastern Montana, western North Dakota), resulting in new markets and potential for increased crop diversity. To address these critical issues, best practices for conservation tillage and diversified dryland and irrigated cropping systems must be developed. Our proposed research addresses these needs by utilizing cropping system trials to develop scientifically-sound, diversified dryland and irrigated cropping strategies that: (1) improve management of water, soil, nutrients, and agrochemicals through increased efficiency, (2) diversify crop rotations to include cereals, pulse, oilseed, and bioethanol crops, (3) utilize biological control and cultural management for reduced infestation of pests, diseases, and weeds, and (4) increase net farm productivity. Successful completion of this project will provide stakeholders and customers with tools to reduce labor, water, input, and energy requirements while increasing crop yield and quality and improving soil and environmental quality. These tools will be transferred to stakeholders through research paper publications, field tours, focus group meetings, agricultural fairs, bulletins, websites, and other outreach activities."

Morrell (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities)CoPIs: Kevin P. Smith (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities) and Justin C. Fay (Washington University)Through examination of the prevalence of deleterious mutations, the project will address a longstanding issue of both theoretical and practical importance. Important crops such as barley, rice, soybeans, and wheat are inbreeding and deleterious mutations could be of greater consequence on yield in these crops, as the mutations will more frequently occur in the homozygous state in inbreds than in hybrid cultivars. Once identified, deleterious mutations can be eliminated through marker-assisted selection using genomics tools that are independent of the cost and inaccuracy of phenotyping to increase yield and reduce disease prevalence in crop plants. The barley system to be used in this study is ideally suited to translate our understanding of the nature and importance of deleterious mutations to application within a nationally organized and primarily public sector plant breeding community. USDA regional genotyping laboratories serve barley and wheat breeding programs across the country, using contemporary genotyping platforms to perform selection with informative SNPs. Several large collaborative research projects in barley are developing next generation mapping populations, a centralized trait and genotype database and analysis tools, and other resources that can be employed to further explore the role of deleterious mutations in barley. The public nature of the national barley breeding community will make application of this research in commercially relevant breeding lines broadly visible to the agricultural research community. This provides a uniquely open research system where results can serve as a model for other plant species that are used for food, fuel, and other natural products. Finally, the project will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and an undergraduate in crop genomics, evolutionary genetics, and computational biology. Through involvement with outreach programs at both universities, the project will engage students from populations underrepresented in the sciences.The research aims to characterize the potentially conflicting effects of self-fertilization and strong selection on the proportion of deleterious mutations harbored in individual plant genomes. Using resequencing of barley exomes from wild accessions, landraces (local cultivars), and modern elite (high yielding) inbred lines, the project will determine the extent to which selection for yield has affected the proportion of deleterious mutations present across genomes. Given sufficient population sizes, active selection of progeny that are more productive than either parent clearly has the potential to reduce the proportion of deleterious mutations present in elite lines. Nevertheless, strong selection for alleles that improve inbred lines or adaptation to agronomic environments may also increase the frequency of linked deleterious mutations. Genome-level comparisons will permit the identification of loci subject to artificial selection and estimation of the degree to which barley breeding programs have eliminated deleterious mutations across the genome while simultaneously contaminating the genome with deleterious mutations through hitchhiking at agriculturally important loci. All data generated in this project will be accessible through long-term repositories such as the NCBI SRA, GrainGenes and the Triticeae Toolbox (T3) database.  Germplasm used in this project will be available upon request and through the USDA-ARS National Plant Germplasm System and Grin-Global."

Although there is wide variation in maize resistance to herbivory, very little is known about the underlying genetic basis of these differences among maize cultivars. Genetic mapping, transcript profiling, insect bioassays, and biochemical approaches will be used to identify maize herbivore resistance genes. A particular focus area of this project will be the identification of biosynthetic and regulatory genes contributing to the production and transport of benzoxazinoids, a class of secondary metabolites with important defensive functions in maize, wheat, rye, wild barley, and other grasses. Research involving maize benzoxazinoid metabolism will provide a tractable model system for studying these agriculturally and ecologically important plant metabolites. Genetic mapping using a panel of diverse maize inbred lines will identify novel genes contributing to aphid and caterpillar resistance. Given the wide array of pests and pathogens against which maize plants protect themselves, there are likely to be interactions among the identified defense pathways. Defensive synergies and tradeoffs will be detected by comparing the genomic locations and biochemical functions of the identified maize genes that contribute to natural variation in herbivore resistance.  This project will lead to the identification of previously unknown maize genes that influence plant-herbivore interactions. Potential metabolic limitations and tradeoffs in maize defense against different classes of insect herbivores will be documented. It is anticipated that these expected results will open up new opportunities for using molecular breeding and transgenic approaches to improve herbivore resistance in maize, the most important agricultural crop in the United States. Research conducted through this project will help to train a new generation of students and postdocs for future careers in academia, industry, or government service. International research exchanges with the European ERA-CAPS (http://www.eracaps.org/) companion project entitled  Biosynthesis, transport and exudation of 1,4-benzoxazin-3-ones as determinants of plant biotic interactions (BENZEX)  will enhance the training of students and postdocs.  Experiments involving maize-herbivore interactions will be fully integrated into an established education and outreach program at the Boyce Thompson Institute. Undergraduate students from throughout the United States will be recruited to be part of a ten-week summer internship program. In one-week training sessions, biology teachers from under-resourced schools will develop new plant science modules for their classes. Experimental kits for conducting caterpillar-feeding assays in local science classrooms will not only provide students with hands-on research experience, but also generate new information about the mechanisms of maize defense against insect herbivory.  All data and resources generated through this project will be publicly accessible.  A major output of this project will be a publicly available toolkit for studying the role of benzoxazinoids in maize defense against herbivores and pathogens. Seeds of near-isogenic lines and mutants will be deposited in the Maize Genetics Cooperation stock center, DNA clones will be available upon request and assay methods will be published in scientific journals.  All DNA sequences will be deposited in public databases such as the NCBI SRA, Gramene, and MaizeGDB. Metabolite and metabolomics data will be deposited at METLIN (http://metlin.scripps.edu/). Education and outreach materials will be published and available for use via the Boyce Thompson Institute website (http://bti.cornell.edu/education/)."

Genetic exchange among species has played a major role in the group?s complicated evolutionary history, so a clear understanding of the relationships among species remains elusive. In species that exchange genetic material, the genomes can be mosaics derived from multiple sources, and as a result, evolutionary relationships inferred from genetic data can differ depending on which portion of the genome is used for the inference. Gene exchange has been convincingly implicated in the Triticeae, but the extent is still unknown. This research addresses the question by applying a genome-wide approach, sampling large numbers of short DNA sequences from throughout the entire genome from a broad sample of Triticeae species. The density of genome sampling, combined with the ability to determine the genomic location of the sampled sequences, will lead to a better assessment of the extent of genetic exchange, including which species are involved, and which regions of the genome are most affected.The results of this work will be informative to Triticeae breeders who rely on the processes of hybridization and gene exchange as tools for crop improvement. The methods of data analysis developed in this project will be useful for studies of other groups of organisms that undergo gene exchange. The funding will support training for one graduate student, along with discussion groups and training for a selected group of undergraduates from Olive-Harvey College, a minority-serving two-year college in Chicago."

Maize, and closely related grasses, produce spikelets in pairs, doubling the number of kernels produced in contrast to other, more distantly related cereals, such as rice, wheat and barley, which produce spikelets singly. Understanding the molecular and developmental basis for paired spikelet formation is of great practical significance as this information could be used to double yield in cereals that produce single spikelets. Collaborative comparative genomic studies also provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand the molecular basis for the evolution of this derived trait. The identification of the suppressor of sessile spikelet (sos) loci in maize provides a breakthrough into the understanding of the formation of the paired spikelet. Molecular, cellular and developmental approaches will be used to dissect the function of Sos1.  Additional molecular and developmental studies of Sos2 and Sos3 will enable the identification of additional genes regulating paired spikelet formation. The paired spikelet is produced by a meristem called the spikelet pair meristem.  Meristems continually produce organs through balancing the functions of maintenance and determinacy. The Sos loci will enable the dissection of the interaction between these two fundamental developmental processes, as well as providing insight into the evolution of grass inflorescence architecture.This research involves collaboration between a maize developmental geneticist and an expert in the evolution of grasses, and hence is interdisciplinary in nature. One graduate student and at least six undergraduate students will be trained in the McSteen laboratory. A summer seminar series will be developed to provide training for undergraduates in understanding the broader implications of evolutionary studies in science, education, and society. The PI will also speak to the public on the domestication of corn."

Co-combustion of biomass in existing coal-fired power plants is an attractive option to increase the share of renewable fuels in the energy market. Designing equipment for these blends requires knowledge of pyrolysis and combustion characteristics to maximize energy output, reduce emissions and optimize fuel ratios. The objectives of this research are to: obtain thermal evolution profiles (kinetics and devolatilized compounds) of region-specific coal-biomass blends and probe the effect of heating rate, particle size, and coal to biomass blend ratios on pyrolysis and combustion behavior. A systematic study on locally available second generation feedstocks (agricultural wastes - woods, wheat and corn stalks, and local manufacturing wastes - cocoa shells, barley, hops, fruit pits) blended with coal used by regional power plants will provide knowledge for the incorporation of locally-sourced organic refuse into power generation, and a broader understanding of optimizing such blends for energy generation. The proposed work aims to bridge the gap between fossil fuel dependency and a green energy future while expanding opportunities for students from underrepresented groups to ensure our future engineering workforce is as diverse as the population it serves.Intellectual Merit: Given infrastructure already in place for coal, the most likely avenue in the immediate future for biomass utilization is as a blended feedstock in coal-fired power plants. Coal-biomass blending has the potential to limit the overall cost of fuel for a power plant, assuming the costs to process the biomass (transportation, drying, milling, etc.) are lower than the coal while lowering the carbon footprint of energy production. This proposal explores the thermodynamics and kinetics behind coal-biomass blend combustion to maximize process efficiency, while simultaneously monitoring devolatilized compounds to ensure the co-combustion of biomass and coal represents an improvement in the emissions profile. The knowledge garnered from this work is immediately applicable to state air resource permitting agencies, and directly addresses the EPA's debate over the next three years on how to regulate biomass emissions. The proposed work also provides fundamental data on the behavior of U.S.-specific biomass-coal blends to assist in the transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources; the design of an effective thermochemical conversion unit requires knowledge of the chemical composition, thermal behavior, and reactivity of the fuel in question.Broader Impacts: Altering our workforce to more accurately mirror the composition of our society is a gradual process, requiring strong mentors and role models. If we are broadly inclusive -seeking out contributions from all perspectives - we can solve issues surrounding energy and the environment for future generations. The potential benefits of the proposed project to society are twofold: first, by investigating the blending of biomass with coal we can potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining current energy production. Second, by actively seeking students (graduate and undergraduate) from traditionally underrepresented groups, we better leverage our human capital to facilitate a diverse, competitive and globally engaged workforce. As many UNH students choose to remain in New England after graduation, a project that specifically addresses local energy needs prepares them to understand regional issues when competing on the job market. To engage the public and industry, the students and PI will present findings from this research at academic conferences and in peer-reviewed publications, and in technical reports to assist in policy-making and industrial energy production schemes. As part of her Broadening Participation Plan, the PI proposes to implement a seminar series called  Engaging Your Future  to the science and engineering community at UNH to work with students on overcoming challenges they face as underrepresented groups, building a resume, and identifying career opportunities. As a woman with a disability, the PI is in a unique position to mentor students from traditionally underrepresented groups through building a research agenda with direct applicability today?s challenges in energy and the environment."

The amount of beer that can be produced from a given amount of malt has traditionally been viewed as being determined malt extract, or the percentage of the malt that is extracted in brewing. However, fermentability, or the amount of extract that is fermented is equally important. This is particularly true in the current marketplace, as low calorie beers represent the largest share. The production of low calorie beers requires malts with a high level of fermentability. Nevertheless, fermentability is not determined as part of the quality selection process, when developing new malting barley varieties. The objective of the proposed research is to development a rapid method for determining the fermentability of barley lines. Results from this study will aid in the development of new high quality varieties that desired by both growers and processors."

Spring wheat and winter wheat are the major grain cereal crops grown in Montana. The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus is major pest and infesting both winter and spring wheat in the Golden Triangle Area. In contrast, two species of wireworms Limonius californicus and Hypnoidus bicolor are recently found to be serious pests infesting wheat and barley. All these species are causing millions of dollars annually ever since the management has been very difficult and challenging. The biological control program with entomopathogens, pheromone-based trapping technique to improve the capture efficiency of wheat stem sawfly and role of nutrients in C. cinctus management will be investigated. Since the pheromone compounds are not identified for the wireworm species found in Golden Triangle; the pheromone compounds of European based wireworm species will be evaluated. These works are as a part of the development of pheromone trapping techniques for monitoring and management for the wireworms and wheat stem sawfly. Canola is an important oilseed crop in the northern Great Plains of the United States and Canada. Flea beetles, Phyllotreta cruciferae and P. striolata, and diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, are the most serious insect pests of canola. The damage to oilseed Brassica crops from these beetles alone can exceed $300 million annually in North America. Producers are frustrated by the high incidence of flea beetles and diamondback moth on canola. Even small numbers of adults on plants can cause severe damage to the cotyledons and true leaves. While some control methods do exist, chemical application is both undesirable and expensive. Without appropriate effective controls, these insect pests are likely to cause significant reduction or complete loss of canola production in Montana. Canola growers in the Golden Triangle areas of Montana are applying various chemical pesticides and often seem to be expensive and not environmentally safe. The action threshold levels are used in pest management programs and are known to reduce insecticide usage. There are reports of flea beetle and diamondback moth infesting canola in several locations in the Golden Triangle areas of Montana. These insect populations can build rapidly, and cause problems in canola when plants start to bloom. We do not currently have any research-based economic thresholds from Montana for managing insect pests on canola, so the study will be undertaken to develop nominal threshold levels for P. cruciferae and P. striolata, and P. xylostella in spring canola. Once these threshold levels are developed, a sustainable pest management program will be developed based the action threshold levels. Research results from all projects will be disseminated to producers and extension personnel at community meetings and through extension publications. Contributions to the scientific community will be made through conference presentations and the publication of scholarly papers."

This project will assemble a collection of diverse barberry germplasm from around the world and develop needed molecular tools to aid researchers conducting barberry surveillance work in the region and globally. The anticipated outcome of this germplasm characterization (pre-breeding) project is a set of robust molecular tools that can discriminate among the nearly 500 species of barberry and lay the foundation for identifying the genetic mechanisms of rust resistance in the alternate host. The anticipated impact of this project is to help reduce the threat of wheat stem and stripe rust globally, as well as to educate growers of the risk posed by barberries in New England, in the face of increasing demand for local grain production."

The shoot apical meristem (SAM) produces all above-ground organs including: leaves, nodes, internodes, inflorescence and AXMs. Tillers, or branches, are derived from AXMs in the axils of leaves and are an important factor in overall grain and biomass yield. Tiller development proceeds in three general stages: AXM initiation, axillary bud development, and tiller outgrowth. However, little is known regarding the genetic control of these processes in grass species. The diversity in branching phenotypes in various plant species indicates that the regulation of branching is complex, and to obtain a comprehensive understanding will require studying multiple plant species. Our previous work resulted in cloning a set of barley genes (LNT1, CUL4, INT-C, and SCU2) that regulate vegetative AXM development and tillering, identifying the potential role of jasmonic acid in vegetative AXM and axillary bud development, and the morphological and genetic characterization of a set of low tillering mutants in barley. However, the understanding of the genetic and hormonal controlling of tillering is still fragmented. We plan to develop a foundational framework of gene expression for the SAM and vegetative AXM in barley that can be used for functional characterization of genes controlling AXM development and tillering and to alter tiller number for increasing yield. To address this overall goal, we will develop an atlas of gene expression for the barley SAM and AXM and identify gene expression profiles that are specific to the barley AXM."

The roles played by individual proteins and enzymes of saliva is unclear. Research done has begun to enumerate the proteins, enzymes, and aphid saliva. The identification of the roles of these proteins and enzymes is just beginning. Identification and enumeration efforts on saliva-proteins/enzymes have featured mainly transcriptomics and proteomics. We will look at the insights in the pea aphid system from a combined proteomic and transcriptomic approach. Given our incomplete understanding of the aphid salivary-gland secretome, the goal of further identifying proteins and enzymes of aphid saliva will be central in our research. Obj B: The Russian Wheat Aphid (RWA) exists in biotypes which differ in the ability to feed on cultivars of wheat and barley. These differences may lie in the proteins/enzymes of saliva, allowing individuals of a given biotype to feed or be unable to feed on a given cultivar. Understanding biotype differences in proteins of saliva could lead new approaches to lessening the agricultural impact of RWA by genetic engineering of wheat and barley. The biotypes of most importance in the US are RWA1 and RWA2, and they have strikingly different abilities to feed on various cultivars of grains. Obj C: Of the various proteins/enzymes that have been identified, protein C002 is the one for which there is the clearest evidence of a required role in aphid feeding on a host plant. We provided the initial evidence, largely through a combination of transcript-knockdown by injection of dsRNA and electrophysiological studies. Knockdown of the C002 transcript resulted in early death of the aphids and a lack of feeding. Other researchers have provided different evidence that supports a role of protein C002 as an effector in aphid feeding on plant tissue. We have shown C002 knockdown has no effect on feeding by pea aphids on artificial diet. It appears that protein C002 is involved with the interaction of the aphid with the plant, and in particular in establishing or maintaining prolonged contact with the sieve element and the phloem sap. Obj D: We have found that levels of transcripts of proteins of pea aphid saliva increase up to 30-fold when aphids are moved from artificial liquid diet to a host plant. Only some of these changes are observed when the aphids are placed on a non-host soybean. Measuring changes in levels of transcripts that encode proteins/enzymes of saliva appears promising as a means of determining the roles played by the proteins now believed to occur in aphid saliva and the different classes of proteins of saliva. We will investigate the Russian Wheat Aphid, where the existence of biotypes provides a beautiful experimental system and an opportunity to gain insight into the mechanisms by which ability to feed on a cultivar of wheat is established. Obj E: The only aphid for which a genome sequence has been reported is the pea aphid. Efforts are underway now on the green peach aphid genome. Undertaking a genome sequencing project on the RWA is also important, given the agricultural impact of this aphid and the existence of RWA biotypes."

Barley is an important cereal crop that is the critical and primary raw material for the brewing industry in the United States. Total US barley production has averaged 218 million bushels per year with an estimated annual value of $785 million as a raw agricultural commodity (2003-2012). The state of North Dakota normally ranks first in the nation in total barley production and in 2012 ND was ranked number one by producing 30% of the nations barley with ~ 62 million bushels produced at an estimated value of ~ $404 million (National Agricultural Statistics Service; http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov). Fungal pathogens are the major disease issue for barley production in ND and although fungicide application is effective in managing many of these diseases it costs the producers millions of dollars annually. Thus, growing cultivars with genetic resistance is the most cost-effective and environmentally sustainable means of disease management. The goal of developing barley cultivars with durable resistance against these pathogens requires the combination of many resistance genes from a diversity of genetic backgrounds. The goal of this project is to use classical pathology techniques and cutting edge molecular technology to expedite the process of deploying genetic resistance against broad spectra of fungal pathogens that are important to barley production in the state of North Dakota and the region. The metrics of success for this project will be the impact on expediting the process of achieving this goal."

Acute viruses are well studied and cause symptoms and plant diseases. In contrast to acute viruses, persistent viruses do not appear to affect the phenotype of the plant host. The genus Endornavirus contains persistent viruses that infect plants without causing visible symptoms. Infections by endornaviruses have been reported in many economically important crops, such as avocado, barley, common bean, melon, pepper, and rice. However, little is known about the effect they have on their hosts. The overall objective of the proposed project is to elucidate the nature of the symbiotic interaction between endornaviruses and their hosts. Some specific objectives include (a) developing endornavirus-infected and endornavirus-free Black Turtle Soup common bean and Marengo bell pepper, (b) to evaluate the phenotype, grain and fruit yield of endornavirus-free and endornavirus-infected isogenic lines under greenhouse conditions, and (c) to study the interactions between selected acute viruses and endornaviruses. It is likely that the endornaviruses of bell pepper and common bean are in a mutualistic relationship with the host and provide tolerance to biotic or abiotic agents. Nevertheless, it is also possible that the endornaviruses could interact synergistically with acute viruses and indirectly or directly cause harmful effects. Therefore, the addition or elimination of endornaviruses from some crop germplasm will be an action that will have to be taken."

Development of crops with broad-spectrum and stable viral resistance is crucial for fighting mixed infections, which are common in the fields. For example, synergistic infection of soybean by Soybean mosaic virus and Bean pod mottle virus causes much severe infections than that of each virus. A universal feature of (+)RNA virus replication is that they assemble their replication complexes in association with host intracellular membranes, which are usually remodeled by viral proteins during infections. However, the mechanisms of virus-induced membrane rearrangements are not well-understood and the lipid microenvironment of viral replication complexes is not well-defined. A better understanding of such processes will identify novel and promising targets for designing broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. Our project targets the above knowledge gap by using Brome mosaic virus (BMV), which invaginates endoplasmic reticulum membranes to form spherular structures in barley, Nicotiana benthamiana and the baker&#39;s yeast. The primary objectives of this proposal are to determine the lipidomic alterations induced by BMV infection in various hosts, dissect the mechanisms by which BMV modulates lipid synthesis, and develop a pipeline to generate crop plants that are resistant to multiple viruses, intially by manipulating host lipid synthesis. Specifically, by using lipidomic and electron microscopic analyses, we will test the hypothesis that BMV recruits host lipid synthesis enzymes to promote phospholipid synthesis dedicated to viral replication. Building on previously work and our preliminary data that unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) are required for replication of a number of plant viruses, we will generate crop plants that express artificial microRNAs to knock down the expression of UFA synthesis genes to achieve resistance to multiple viruses. By completion of the project, we expect to provide new knowledge on virus-host interactions and new ways to control viral infection."

At one extreme are tropical-climate cereals such as maize and rice that suffer chilling injury when exposed to 10oC. At the other extreme are the temperate-climate cereals including barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum spp.), and rye (Secale cereal) capable of surviving the temperate-climate winter. This ability to survive the temperate-climate winter is known as winter hardiness. Wheat, barley, and rye are generally classified as being of either a winter or a spring growth habit. Spring growth habit types are inherently reproductively competent and are typically sown in the spring. In comparison, winter growth habit types are sown in the autumn. They grow vegetatively for a short period before overwintering and then develop reproductively the following spring. If spring-sown they fail to properly develop reproductively. Spring and winter growth habit types also differ from one another in their ability to survive the temperate-climate winter. Typically winter growth habit types are able to survive colder temperatures than spring types and have greater winter hardiness. Winter genotypes are often preferred because they are capable of returning yields 40% greater than that of their spring counterparts. Winter genotypes are also much more efficient at making use of available water due to an extended vegetative growth phase and a much more extensive root system over spring genotypes. In Ohio and other states of the East North Central Midwest, winter barley and winter wheats are essential components in the crop rotation cycle with maize and soybean. Spring types have not been recommended for Ohio as conditions early in the spring are erratic leading to unpredictable and generally poor yields. Recent studies in wheat and barley have led to the identification of several key factors underlying the molecular basis of winter hardiness. These studies also reveal that expression of the genes underlying these factors are themselves affected by developmental programming inherent to the genetic makeup of the plant, and by environmental factors. Moreover, current data strongly supports the premise that the key factors act antagonistic to one another. It is these phenomena and the genetic basis underlying them that I am working to better understand. A goal of the work proposed here is to gain greater insight into their regulation, to better understand the nature of this interaction between the factors, and how their regulation is affected by the environment. These studies will contribute fundamental knowledge that can be used to enhance the productivity and freezing tolerance of cereal plants."

In grasses this polymer seems to be in immature tissues and in mature tissues. More recent gene knockout evidence shows that reduction of this polymer has consequences mainly to the mature plant suggesting that MLG plays a role in the structure of the cell wall. MLG is also used as a storage polymer in the endosperm tissue of grass seeds. The amount of MLG or starch in the endosperm is species specific with barley and Brachypodium having high amounts of MLG.The substrate for MLG synthesis, is ubiquitous in cells and because it is composed only of glucose it represents an idea compound for the production of biofuels. We propose to express and characterize the MLG synthesis genes in grass stem parenchyma cells to mimic the condition of Brachypodium endosperm cells. We believe that it is possible to produce thick cells walls in such tissue with a high content of MLG and low or limited amounts of lignin. We posit that such tissue would store carbon from photosynthesis in a stable manner that would be easily released as glucose during processing. Such plants, if produced could increase the yield of fermentable sugars from bioenergy crops, which would increase the value of such crops."

Improved control over water application leads to less nutrient loss, while increased soil organic matter (SOM) from conservation tillage increases water and nutrient supplying potential of soils. Both present opportunities for improved crop nutrient management, but altering irrigation and tillage without changing fertilizer practices can reduce yield and quality of crops such as sugarbeet and malting barley from oversupply of nitrogen (N). Phosphorus (P) fertilizer management on calcareous soils is also a long-term issue for Wyoming producers and could be affected by management changes. Also, many Wyoming production areas do not receive adequate irrigation water for whole growing seasons. Improved understanding of interactions among conservation tillage, water supply and use, and nutrient management are needed. We propose a combined on-farm/on-station experiment to investigate factors that support improved yields and quality in irrigated sugarbeet-dry bean-barley (SB-DB-BY) production. This research project will assess nutrient use and requirements, SOM dynamics, N and P cycling, and water use under three tillage practices:conventional (CT), no till (NT), and strip till (ST); and two irrigation levels (full and 75% of plant needs) under the lateral-move sprinkler irrigation system of the UW Research &amp; Extension Center located in Powell, WY. We will also evaluate effects of incorporating cover crops following barley and beans in the rotation. Trials will be replicated on farms in northwestern Wyoming as well. Our primary objectives are to (1) develop revised soil fertility recommendations for N and phosphorus (P) under the six irrigation x tillage scenarios, (2) evaluate effects of incorporating cover crops into rotations; (3) monitor soil organic matter and moisture dynamics, and (4) engage producers and ag advisers through extension education activities and materials.

Zebra chip disease, which is caused by the vector-borne pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso), was first reported in 2011 in potato production areas in Idaho, and is now of a major concern. This proposal is set to address four specific objectives: The first objective quantifies the level of susceptibility in four of the most commonly used wheat cultivars in Idaho, to BYDV infection, at different stages of plant growth. Variables used to measure the degree of susceptibility include visual assessment, titer quantification, and biochemical evaluation of the plant tissue.The next two objectives address the wireworm issue in small grains. A survey of wireworm species will be conducted to determine most damaging wireworm species in central and eastern Idaho. For the most damaging species, insect movement and the inflicted damage will be correlated with environmental variables to determine suitability and timing of different management approaches in order to achieve reduction in insect pressure.The last objective addresses Lso-plant (potato tuber) interactions post-harvest and during storage, in relation to the time of infection and vector density. Practices which would trigger pathogen development post-harvest will be identified.Findings will be communicated to the producers and scientific community through extension publications, presentations, and refereed research papers."

Nonetheless, most modern beer is cold-fermented using alloploid hybrids of S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus (S. pastorianus syn. S. carlsbergensis), resulting the in the quarter-trillion dollar lagerbrewing industry. The discovery of S. eubayanus in 2011 offered important hints about its domestication, ecology, and which traits may be relevant to lager production3, but a systematic genetic investigation of S. eubayanus-specific traits has not yet begun. As the sister species of S. eubayanus, S. uvarum offers a particularly attractive comparative model to genetically investigate the traits that make S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids such successful lager-brewing strains. S. uvarum and S. eubayanus are ecologically isolated in nature, but they can be easily crossed in the laboratory to producehybrids that produce 7-20% viable spores. Moreover, each species can be precisely manipulated by genetic transformation (Baker &amp; Hittinger, unpublished). Thus, the system is amenable to studies that use classic genetic mapping techniques, as well as modern genome sequencing and genome editing or engineering techniques. Despite its prevalence in natural settings in Europe and its use in other industrial fermentations (e.g. champagne), yeast strains with genomic contributions from S. uvarum are generally regarded as contaminants and are not generally used in brewing.Here we seek to determine 1) how S. uvarum and S. eubayanus differ genetically; 2) how specific genetic differences impact traits relevant to brewing; and 3) whetherS. eubayanus could be improved for some applications with specific genes from S. uvarum. Specifically, we will use several modern genomic approaches to investigate the genetic basis of differences in their growth and viability across a range of temperatures, maltose utilization, sucrose utilization, ethanol production, glycerol production, flocculation, and direct fermentation performance in brewing wort. The long-term goal of this research is to understand which specific traits S. eubayanus contributes to lager-brewing and how they are encoded genetically so that yeast strains can be improved through breeding or engineering for custom local and industrial processing applications that add value to the barley crop."

Currently poultry meat consumption is the primary animal protein consumed in the United States. The majority of US broiler and turkey feed is pelleted. The pelleting process involves the application of heat, moisture, and pressure to induce conformational changes in feed nutrients in order to bind ingredients and create pellets of high structural integrity. Thermal processes of feed manufacture may also effect nutrient availability. Pelleting of wheat and Barley based diets typically increases nutrient availability; however, corn and soybean based diets (most common in US poultry feed formulation) have been consistently demonstrated to be reduced in nutrient availability due to pelleting. In addition, feed additives such as enzymes are common in today&#39;s feed formulation and susceptible to denaturation during feed processing. Enzymes and other micronutrients can also be difficult to assess in terms of activity level and batch uniformity.Feed manufacture equipment and technique are highly variable among commercial feed mills in the US. Changes in ambient temperature, ingredient nutrient level, and feed manufacture technique adjustments contribute to the complexity of the feed manufacture process. Due to the small number of US Universities with feed manufacture research programs and the inability of commercial mills to perform in-house research, the relationship between feed manufacture variables, pellet quality, nutrient availability, poultry performance, and overall production economics is poorly understood.Our long term goal would be to develop a protocol to properly sample feed during manufacture for nutrient, feed additive, and mycotoxin content. These specific inclusion types vary from kg/tonne inclusion to parts per billion inclusion and will likely impact protocol. Next variations in feed processing that decrease nutrient availability as determined by poultry performance and in vivo digestibility assays would be correlated with numerous in vitro assays post proper sampling technique. The best in vitro assay could then be used as an indicator of nutritional quality of pelleted poultry feed."

There is a potential to use information from this research not only to control viruses but also to develop systems for production of proteins that are nutritionally beneficial, protein antibodies or proteins that have economic uses. At a more fundamental level, because of similarities in translation, this knowledge may be relevant to other major viral diseases such as hepatitis C, HIV and West Nile. Because of their relatively small size and well-defined components, plant viruses serve as a model system to increase the understanding of more complex viral and cellular translation.

These students will contribute to a diverse and well trained workforce in science and technology. This project will also involve high school teachers and community college faculty.  When an RNA virus infects a cell, it must out-compete host cell mRNA to produce viral proteins.  Viruses accomplish this by a number of strategies, many involving unique viral RNA structures.

In preliminary results, it was shown that the BTE binds ribosomes, eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) and interacts with a 5' UTR stem loop.  The details of this novel mechanism of protein synthesis initiation are unknown. This project will investigate three critical steps in assembly of an initiation complex. These include 1) determining the rate-limiting steps for 40S/43S ribosomal subunit binding to the 3' BTE of BYDV; 2) analysis of ribosome transfer to the 5' UTR and 3) 3' BTE and 5' UTR interactions. Fluorescence spectroscopy will be used to determine the effects of each of the isolated proteins on ribosomal subunit binding.  The site of ribosome transfer at the 5' UTR and the rates of scanning and influence of eIFs on those rates will be measured by FRET techniques.  In a novel application of single molecule fluorescence, the rate of transfer of the 40S ribosomal subunit from the 3' UTR binding site to the 5' UTR will be determined. The BYDV 5'-3' RNA interaction appears to be transient and it is therefore difficult to elucidate the effects of the complex on ribosomal subunit transfer.  To further quantitate these interactions, the related, but much more stable interaction of the carnation Italian ringspot virus 5'-3' UTRs will be used.  The experiments described here will increase understanding of the molecular interactions that allow viral mRNA to compete efficiently with the much higher concentration of cellular RNA for translation."

Information about growth and development is encoded in a plant's DNA, which has four fundamental chemical components, often referred to as A, C, G and T. However, the C can also be modified by a process called methylation, which allows it to function as a 5th information component in DNA. While it is apparent that methylated Cs play an important role in plant growth and development, their role has yet to be fully understood. In this proposal, the number and pattern of methylated Cs among different crop plants will be compared, including barley, einkorn wheat and sorghum. These comparisons will be used to investigate the influence of methylated Cs on the function of genes. The overall goal is to better understand the contribution of methylated Cs to plant growth and development, so that eventually this information can be used for crop improvement.  DNA methylation is one of several epigenetic modifications that are crucial to plant genome function. Recent work has also shown that methylation has broad consequences for genome evolution, including the composition of intergenic DNA, as a fundamental evolutionary property of specific genes, and as a driver of compositional biases among genomic regions. Given the importance of epigenetic mechanisms, a thorough understanding of the evolution and function of plant genomes requires characterization of epigenetic variation among plant species. Yet, such a characterization is presently lacking. This project will generate and analyze whole genome bisulfite sequencing (BSseq) and transcript (RNAseq) data for an array of grass species. The data will be released to the Short Read Archive and Gene Expression Omnibus databases prior to publication. The goal is to use the data to better understand the relationship among DNA methylation, gene evolution and gene function, as measured by gene expression. To achieve this end, a series of unique evolutionary analyses will be developed that will address three specific hypotheses: 1) that gene-body methylation is a conserved feature of functionally important genes and maintained over evolutionary time by natural selection; 2) that evolutionary shifts in gene body methylation (and/or the methylation of flanking regions) drive shifts in gene expression between species; and 3) that DNA methylation variation among tissues - specifically in genes and flanking regions - contributes to tissue-specific gene expression."

Among herbivores that feed on plant tissues, insects are by far the best characterized. However, plant-feeding mites, which are distant relatives of insects, can also be major pests in agriculture. In particular, many mite species thrive on and damage drought-stressed plants, including major cereal crops like maize and wheat. Under these situations, mites pose a significant challenge for control as they are often resistant to commonly used pesticides. Plants can defend themselves against attack and damage by herbivores.  For example, for a number of plant species, certain varieties are known to be more resistant to mites than others because of their ability to produce compounds toxic to herbivores. The objective of this research is to understand the genetic and genomic nature of plant defense pathways that function to deter agriculturally important mites. The mite species to be examined are the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and the Banks grass mite (Oligonychus pratensis) that are associated with significant outbreaks on drought-stressed maize or other cereal species. The research will use genomic and genetic methods to elucidate which plant defense pathways in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) respond to mite herbivory, and how variation in these pathways impacts plant resistance. Moreover, the effect of drought (water stress) on these defense pathways will be assessed, an objective motivated by the observation that each of these pests can be economically damaging during droughts. This project has relevance, therefore, to efforts to develop more mite resistant crop plants. All data will be accessible to the public through long-term public repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and MaizeGDB. Biological resources generated during the project will be available upon request. As part of the project, the work will train undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate scholars.  In addition, educational material will be developed on plant-mite interactions for distribution to the public on the Learn.Genetics website (http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/).  To identify genetic pathways in plants that respond to spider mite pests, gene expression profiling using the RNA-seq method (high throughput sequencing of cDNA) will be performed on maize and barley leaves infested with both two-spotted spider mites (a generalist pest on both dicot and monocot plants) and Banks grass mites (a specialist pest on grasses). Further, to understand the effect of an agriculturally important abiotic stress on plant defense pathways, expression profiling for mite responses will be performed on both well watered and water stressed plants. Comparisons of plant transcriptional response to the two herbivores, and as a function of an abiotic stress relevant to mite outbreaks, will shed light on the specificity of plant responses to generalist and specialist herbivores, and how the environment affects the interaction in plants. A specific outcome will be the identification of gene regulatory networks underlying mite resistance. Further, susceptibility to mite damage is known to vary among individuals within plant species, including maize. To investigate this, a collection of inbred maize lines used to create the Nested Association Mapping (NAM) community genetic mapping resource will be screened for susceptibility or resistance to each mite herbivore. Gene expression studies with sensitive and resistant maize lines will then be used to assess the genomic basis of variation in plant mite resistance. In parallel, and to relate plant molecular phenotypes of mite response to plant performance upon mite infestation in an agricultural setting, field trials for resistance will be performed on plants under high water and drought stress conditions for a subset of maize inbred lines."

More than 80% of crop and turf diseases are due to fungal infections. Direct application of chemical fungicides continues to be the most effective and widely used strategy to control these diseases. A large fraction of the crop fungicide market includes two fungicide classes: The triazoles and strobulins. Both classes are used in increasingly larger amounts to overcome developing resistance, and both have known human and animal toxicities when used at high levels. Emerging resistance to therapeutic antifungals for treatment of acute human and animal fungal diseases (e.g. aspergillosis) has been directly linked to the overuse of the most widely used triazole crop fungicides. Therefore, declining effectiveness due to resistance, environmental impacts, animal/human toxicity, and costs challenge the use of these and other chemical fungicides. The research and use of the novel antifungal aminoglycoside K20 that acts synergistically with triazoles and strobulins as described in this proposal address these challenges, and the need for such transformative strategies.  This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop the synthetic protocol for production of aminoglycoside fungicide K20 in high yield and purity, and determine the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) for each batch of K20 in combination with metconazole or pyrachlostrobin using standard checkerboard analyses.  In addition, the plan is to conduct greenhouse and field tests of K20-fungicide combinations against Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease of wheat. Among the combinations showing synergy are K20 mixed with metconazole and pyrachlostrobin. The widespread and heavy use of these fungicides has been linked to a number of environmental and human/animal health issues. Striking and consistent synergistic inhibitory activities are observed with the crop pathogen Fusarium graminearum - the causative agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat, barley and corn. The synergism between K20 and these widely used fungicides has broad and important implications. It offers the possibility of using dramatically smaller amounts of fungicides for crop protection, which will counter the increases in global fungal resistance, and reverse the rise in human and animal health problems."

The most evident symptom and important consequence of Al toxicity is root growth inhibition on acidic soils. A prominent example is barley, which is one of the most important crops in temperate regions including Europe and North America. Barley is very sensitive to Al toxicity and yield losses of up to 30% have been associated with growth in acidic soils. It has been previously argued that Al toxicity was an intractable problem due to its apparent complexity. The goal of this project is to define the biochemical mechanism that underlies inhibition of root growth in Arabidopsis and barley following chronic exposure to Al. It is the expectation that an inclusive understanding of this novel process will enable the development of agricultural crop plants that can grow and thrive in the presence of Al. With regard to outreach and training, this project will provide research training opportunities for a diverse group of high school, undergraduate and graduate students from a range of ethnic and social backgrounds. Student training will be enhanced by international research exchanges and collaborations with colleagues from Belgium, Germany and Poland who lead the European ERA-CAPS (http://www.eracaps.org/) companion project entitled  Towards a molecular understanding of aluminium genotoxicity for crop improvement (Al-UCIDATE) . Finally, the project will provide a summer research training internship for a local high school teacher from a local school district that serves a significant Hispanic student population. Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust. When found in acidic environments, Al converts to the highly toxic Al3+ form. While the mechanisms of Al exclusion from plants are relatively simple, little is known about the biochemical basis of Al toxicity and why Al leads to severe root growth inhibition with profound effects on yield. Recent work in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that Al may act as a genotoxic agent, with DNA damage caused by Al triggering a cell cycle checkpoint pathway that is regulated largely by the cell cycle checkpoint factor Ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR).  Specifically, mutations in ATR appear to confer substantial Al tolerance to the plant by suppressing cell cycle progression which forces terminal differentiation of the root in response to Al. The finding that Al acts as a DNA-stress inducing compound represents a new perspective on Al toxicity that bears further investigation. The goal of this project is to study this novel effect of Al on root growth in barley and Arabidopsis using a combination of transcriptomic, phylogenetic, genomic and phenotypic analyses. By developing a model by which root growth is halted following chronic exposure to Al, it is anticipated that the information will enable the exploitation of checkpoint control to confer Al tolerance to economically important crop plants. All data and resources generated through this project will be publicly accessible. Genome, sequence, and proteome datasets will be accessible through a consortium website and through publicly available data repositories that include ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) and the PRIDE Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) for proteomics data. Biological materials (seeds, plasmids, etc.) will be made available upon request. Seeds of key lines will also be deposited at and disseminated through the appropriate stock centers such as the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC) for Arabidopsis lines."

Plant stress from non-living factors in the environment such as extreme temperatures or drought causes immense yield decreases.  Understanding how plants deal with and adapt to such stress will be essential to maintaining the world's food supply. Barley is a good system to study the mechanisms underlying stress tolerance. Since its domestication, barley cultivation has spread to almost every continent. Along the way, breeders have selected varieties that are best suited for their local regions, particularly with regard to local stresses.  There has been strong evidence that the highland of China and neighboring Tibet are a site of domestication for barley and varieties from that region provide a different snapshot of alleles that may have emerged from domestication.  This grant will study the adaptations of local varieties of barley from the highlands of China and Tibet compared to other, lowland barleys. The research work will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Jia Li at Lanzhou University in China. Dr. Li is an expert in the field of highland barleys, and his lab, being in the native habitat, is situated perfectly to study these adaptations in the native barley.  The Tibetan plateau has recently been characterized as a second center of barley domestication and therefore represents a different snapshot of alleles that may have emerged from the bottleneck that occurs with domestication. However, few studies have been performed using landraces from this region.  The aim of this study is to compare barley landraces, which come from this independent domestication event, with those grown more broadly, in order to identify sequence and expression differences that impart differential stress tolerance. The ultimate goal is to understand the mechanism of that tolerance, and to disseminate that knowledge for future agricultural improvements. Mentorship and on-site experiments at the Li lab will be very important for the progress of this research. Dr. Li's team has experience with studying highland barleys, and has done some preliminary RNA-seq experiments on this crop. This NSF EAPSI award supports research by a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

It has been the source of low-cost, efficient, and high-speed electronics for numerous applications. This trend, however, is about to slow down or even stop in the next few years due to several limitations. This is particularly consequential for high-speed and high-power electronics as they become extremely challenging to implement due to the technology limitations. For example, millimeter wave (mm-wave) and terahertz (THz) systems are known to have unique and significant applications in health, security and industry. Detection of concealed weapons, cancer diagnosis, high-resolution radar, medical imaging, 3D imaging, and semiconductor wafer/device inspection, along with bio/molecular spectroscopy for drug detection, food quality control, and breath analyses for disease diagnosis are among many examples of these applications. In particular remote sensing, active/passive imaging and short-range communication are continually evolving at a rapid pace toward mm-wave and THz frequencies in order to achieve superior resolution and higher data rate. Today, however, THz systems are realized using expensive and bulky devices such as gas lasers and discrete bulky components. If compact and on-chip THz systems are realized the numerous related applications will rapidly flourish, resulting in new opportunities in high-tech marketplace and research and teaching institutions. Today's solid-state technologies including silicon and compound semiconductors can barley cover the lower part of the THz band with useful amount of radiated power. Moreover, phased arrays are essential in some of these applications to boost and localize the radiated power. Phase shifters are critical in a conventional phased array system but they are extremely lossy at high frequencies. The complications of integrating these phase shifters and a stable signal in phased array systems have prevented designers to implement THz high power transmitters on chip. To overcome these problems the PI introduces fundamentally new approaches to design harmonic voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO), radiator array and phased array systems at THz and mm-wave frequencies. The PI's research plan is to use these approaches to make solid-state electronics the default platform for high-performance on-chip THz systems, which are hard to envision today.  First the PI introduces novel array structures based on the unique properties of traveling and standing waves that enable efficient and high power signal generation and radiation. The important properties of these structures are as follows: 1- they greatly simplify the structure of the array and result in high radiated power and high DC to RF efficiency, 2- no additional global or local routing is needed other than the ones that belong to the oscillator structure, thereby making this architecture inherently scalable to larger array sizes for both the radiator and the phased array, 3- when used in the phased array they completely eliminate the need of phase shifters anywhere in the structure, and 4- only one high frequency divider is needed to sense the fundamental frequency and lock the whole array in a frequency synthesizer, resulting in a low power operation. Next, the PI uses the  Optimum Signal Condition  methodology and introduces a new technique to shape the transistor signals and boost the harmonic power in oscillators. Combining the scalable array structures with the signal shaping technique the PI proposes VCOs, radiator arrays and phased arrays that have significantly higher performances than the state of the art. The PI believes the proposed radiator and phased array would be the cornerstone of future phased array systems for radar, sensor and communication applications at THz and mm-wave frequencies."

Rice and beans merit biomarkers for nutritional assessment without reliance on self-reported intakes for whole grains and legumes during nutrition assessments as wheat, barley, rye and soybeans have been studied in dietary patterns and for relationships with disease risk. A major challenge with validating dietary biomarkers is that an elevated level of consumption is often required for reliable quantification, and emerging evidence supports that the overall dietary pattern (e.g. vegetarian, omnivore) can influence the profile of metabolites detected. The identification and validation of dietary biomarkers using metabolomics is an emerging field of investigation with broad-spectrum applications of health importance, and is the major focus of the research strategy for developing rice bran and navy bean biomarkers in children and adults herein.

Due to their natural occurrence in food and high toxicity, trichothecene contamination of food and livestock feed (&gt;78% toxin present) poses a great threat to food safety and human, animal, and planthealth.However, there is a critical gap in our knowledge about the way the toxin works in living cells leading to toxicity that endangersanimals and humans. Previous studies identified novel mechanisms for trichothecene-induced cell death involving themitochondria, an important component of thecell that functions to help produce energy. These studies have shown that the toxin-induced cell death involved mitochondria and genes involved in lipid metabolisms which mediated sensitivity to these toxins. Therefore, the proposed project will study the role oflipid signaling as a mitochondrial &#39;surveillance&#39; mechanism induced in response to trichothecene-mediated stress.Applying high-throughput methods in molecular biology and biochemistry, this research will identify lipids altered in response to toxin treatment and determine if lipid signaling is important for trichothecene-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation. It will also measure therecognition and degradation of trichothecene-damaged mitochondria by mitophagy, a selective degradation of damaged mitochondria. The research will identify critical components of the mitochondrial-nuclear signaling pathways using yeast (highly conserved between yeasts and animal cells) and then investigate them in more detail in animal cells. This research will leadto new insights into how these toxins modulate themitochondria and mitochondrial signaling and advance our understanding of mechanisms whereby environmental toxins derail the fate of mitochondria in the affected animals. The knowledge gained here will aid efforts to mitigate the impacts of trichothecene contamination in food and food safety; facilitating the development of safer practice and standards in human and animal consumption of contaminated products.Ultimately, the project will aid in promoting safer food, developing potential applications for animal health improvement, and reducing economic losses due to trichothecene contamination."

This challenging goal is further complicated by growing competition for land, water and energy, as well as by the potential negative impacts of climate change on crop productivity. Therefore, continued and dedicated research efforts are essential to increase yields and to expand the range of locations and environments where these crops can be grown productively.One of the most critical factors underlying grain crop productivity is a precise timing of the developmental transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages to optimize seed production. For example, in environments with hot summers, early-flowering photoperiod insensitive wheat varieties mature prior to the onset of damaging high temperatures and show significantly higher yields than photoperiod-sensitive later-flowering varieties (&gt;35% in Southern Europe). By contrast, photoperiod sensitive wheat varieties show yield advantages in milder climates, as their delayed flowering extends the period of vegetative growth providing more resources for biomass and grain production. Similarly, late-flowering forage and energy sorghums show increased biomass, whereas grain sorghums are selected for early flowering to ensure sufficient time for grain maturation while avoiding drought. This proposal is focused on improving our understanding of the photoperiodic regulation of flowering in the grass family to assist breeders in selecting better adapted crops with improved yield and wider production environments.A critical factor underlying crop productivity is a precise adjustment of the developmental transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages to optimize seed production. In wheat and sorghum this adjustment is regulated mainly by the PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 37 (PRR37), a gene that accounts for most natural variation in photoperiodic response in several economically important grass species. In spite of its central role, it is still not known how PRR37 promotes flowering in wheat but represses flowering in sorghum under long days. The first objective of this proposal is to determine the cause of the reverse activity of PRR37 in short-day (sorghum) and long-day (wheat) grasses using transgenic approaches to exchange critical photoperiod genes between the two species. The second objective is to understand the interactions between the different photoperiod genes. Populations segregating simultaneously for the different genes will be used to determine their interdependencies in the regulation of flowering genes and heading time. The final objective is to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms involved in the differential activity of PRR37 in the regulation of its downstream targets by analyzing PRR37 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.A precise understanding of the similarities and differences in photoperiod regulation of flowering time in wheat and sorghum can have a significant impact on the development of novel varieties better adapted to a wider range of environments. In addition, the understanding of the similarities and differences in photoperiod regulation of flowering time in crops as diverse as sorghum and wheat will also enable the translation of this knowledge to other economically-important crops, including both short day (e.g. rice) and long day species (e.g. barley)."

The disease is caused by the fungus, Cochliobolus victoriae which can only infect oats if it makes a peptide called  victorin  and interacts with oats carrying a gene called  Vb . Various analyses suggest that the Vb gene, which confers Victoria blight susceptibility and sensitivity to victorin, is identical to a gene called Pc2 which confers resistance to a different disease called  crown rust of oats  caused by the fungus Puccinia coronata. Consistent with this interpretation, molecular analyses reveal that victorin activates a resistance protein (NB-LRR) which leads to cell death and that C. victoriae exploits this defense response to cause disease. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that victorin sensitivity is conditioned by genes encoding resistance proteins across diverse crop species including barley, rice and bean. We hypothesize that these resistance proteins (NB-LRRs) are functionally, and perhaps structurally, related to the protein encoded by the Vb/Pc2 gene in oats. This proposal will address this hypothesis and in addition investigates the diversity of targets for victorin and the resistance proteins activated."

The constraints imposed by crops&#39; intolerance to low temperature and the natural variations of the climate cause significant economic impacts to farmers, either directly through loss of crops or indirectly through reduced potential yield. While many aspects of plant biochemistry affect the overall tolerance of plants towards cold, a single modification of membrane lipids in the otherwise cold-hardy plant Arabidopsis thaliana is sufficient to make that plant extremely sensitive to even a mild cooling. This modification, a desaturation of the very long-chain fatty acids in sphingolipids, is relatively uncommon in nature, being found only in a few cold-tolerant plant species. Along with other evidence pointing towards a critical role for sphingolipid desaturation in determining plant cold-tolerance, it is hypothesized that sphingolipid desaturation is an adaptation that imparts cold-tolerance and that it can be used to improve the cold tolerance of cold-sensitive crops. This hypothesis will be tested by disrupting sphingolipid desaturation in the cold tolerant crops barley and Cammelina and introducing sphingolipid desaturation into the cold-sensitive crops sorghum and maize. The expected outcome of these experiments is a new means by which it will be possible to modify cold-tolerance in plants that could be broadly applicable to engineering cold-tolerance into a wide variety of important crop species"

Relatively few public germplasm improvement programs service the region. In addition, the availability of a genomic sequence for barrel medic greatly increases the potential for rapid and dramatic improvement in the pea varieties available and our ability to manipulate the crop. As a species, pea possesses a high genetic diversity, and a wide range of crop types can be generated by traditional breeding techniques. We will focus on developing yellow dry pea varieties that have a high content of slow digesting starch. Such a starch content is particularly suitable for Type II diabetics or other individuals who desire to avoid high blood sugar levels. Products made from such peas or their flour are digested gradually and have a much lower glycemic index than other grains or starchy vegetables. Other genes that will be investigated include several that provide resistance to specific diseases of pea, including powdery mildew, enation virus and fusarium wilt. Each of these diseases is common in pea growing regions, and the loss of their effectiveness would greatly reduce our ability to grow this crop.

The basic objective of the program is to develop and release improved germplasm acceptable to barley producers of North Dakota and adjacent areas in the United States, and to those who use or process this barley. Plant characters that receive the most attention are those that affect quality of the grain, resulting in losses to producers and processors. These characters include yield, resistance to spikeand foliar diseases, resistance to preharvest sprouting, and malt quality.North Dakota is the leader in barley acreage and production (1.00 million acres and 57.4 million bushels with a value of $281 million - 5 yr. ave.) and produces around 27% of all U.S. barley (USDA-NASS). Nearly 90% of the barley acreage is sown to cultivars classed as  recommended for malting and brewing  by the American Malting Barley Association (AMBA) and about 16.2% (5 yr. ave.; USDA-NASS) of the state&#39;s barley acreage has been sown to cultivars developed at NDSU. Since 1993, Fusarium head blight (FHB) epidemics have substantially impacted the barley crop grown in North Dakota and western Minnesota. In the most severe years of the epidemic, less than one-fourth of the North Dakota barley crop was purchased by the malting and brewing industries because of contamination of the crop with the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) that is produced by the fungus that causes FHB. This resulted in significant revenue losses to growers because they could not receive the malting barley premium and had to sell their barley for livestock feed.Cultural and chemical controls of FHB in barley, by themselves, have been unsuccessful. There is only one six-rowed cultivar, Quest released by the University of Minnesota, and one two-rowed cultivar, Conlon released by NDSU, with moderate resistance to FHB that are adapted to North Dakota and currently on the American Malting Barley Association&#39;s (AMBA)  List of Recommended Malting Barley Varieties.  Conlon accumulates less DON than any cultivar on the AMBA list. Production of barley with low to no FHB symptoms and DON accumulation below 1 ppm during years favorable for disease is going to require an integrated approach that includes use of proper cultural practices, fungicides, and FHB-resistant cultivars. North Dakota is the largest producer of six-rowed malting barley in the U.S. Until about 2000, the largest users of six-rowed malt in the U.S., Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI) and MillerCoors Brewing Co., desired malt with similar quality profiles. However, today MillerCoors Brewing desires cultivars that have moderate levels of protein modification during malting and have moderate levels of enzymatic activity. Robust (Rasmusson and Wilcoxson, 1983) is a cultivar that meets this profile. Anheuser-Busch InBev prefers cultivars that have higher levels of protein modification and higher levels of enzymatic activity. Stander (Rasmusson et al., 1993) is a cultivar that meets this profile. Determining the genetic basis for the differences in the malt quality profiles of MillerCoors and ABI would allow for efficient development of cultivars for these large purchasers of six-rowed malt.The cost of using molecular markers as routine selection tools in barley is now at a level where public breeding programs can utilize them during early generation selection (e.g. F3-F5 generations). Markers derived from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found that are putatively associated with agronomic performance, disease resistance, and malt quality traits in NDSU lines. Additionally, new SNP markers being identified by researchers at NDSU and other institutions worldwide using DNA sequence (genotyping by sequence; GBS) data have the potential to be more effective than the current SNP markers. A major need for the NDSU barley breeding programs is to validate the existing SNP and emerging GBS-derived SNP markers for utility in efficiently selecting lines acceptable to growers and end-users.The specific objective of this project are to: Develop two-and six-rowed malting barley germplasm with improved FHB that is acceptable to growers and those who process the grain.Determine the genetic basis of differences in malt quality and agronomic performance of Robust and Stander six-rowed malting barley.Validate molecular marker-trait associations for agronomic performance, disease resistance and malt quality traits identified in previous research for utility across NDSU germplasm."

One group of important but under-investigated pathogens specifically infects floral tissues (non-pathogenic on leaves or stems) (Ngugi &amp; Scherm, 2006). Some of them can mimic pollen tubes to invade and grow inside floral tissues (Ngugi &amp; Scherm, 2004). Because it is too late for disease control when symptoms become visible, crop diseases caused by floral pathogens such as wheat head blight, rice false smut, and ergots often result in significant yield losses and mycotoxin contaminations. Fusarium graminearum is the causal agent of wheat head blight or scab, which is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat in the US. On adult plants, this pathogen specifically infects flowering wheat heads and produces a trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which is an important virulence factor (Proctor et al., 2002). The expression of TRI genes responsible for DON biosynthesis, including the TRI5 trichodiene synthase gene was detectable at early infection stages and infection cushions, which is likely trigged by plant factors. Earlier studies have indicated that certain compounds in floral tissues could stimulate fungal growth and virulence (Ngugi &amp; Scherm, 2006). Floral pathogens must be able to recognize these compounds as signals for the expression of infection-related genes. To date, no such factors that predispose floral tissues to fungal infection have been identified and confirmed by molecular studies. The proposed study aims to take advantages of recent advances in analytical technologies and molecular biology studies to identify wheat compounds in anthers that stimulate virulence in F. graminearum and fungal genes involved in the recognition and responses to these compounds. Identification of the compounds in wheat anthers that stimulate virulence and DON production will have a broader impact because F. graminearum also infects other small grains, such as barley and millets. Results from proposed experiments will provide much needed information for understanding the recognition of floral tissues by pathogens. Characterizing their biosynthesis pathoways in plants and molecular mechanisms involved in its recognition by F. graminearum can be developed in to future fundable research projects. In addition, reducing or disrupting its biosynthesis in wheat anthers can be developed as a novel disease control strategy, which is a likely practical application out of this study."

The spring canola varieties grown in this region are developed elsewhere (mostly in Saskatoon, Canada) and might not be highly adapted to this climatic and agronomic region. To facilitate this expansion, new germplasm with high seed yield, high oil and better agronomy adapted to increased drought or temperature conditions is needed.

People are frequently exposed to PAHs through the food they eat, especially foods that have been grilled, barbecued or smoked. A variety of PAHs, which normally exist in complex mixtures, have been recognized as carcinogenic and capable of eliciting negative health effects in humans. The association between high PAH exposure and the risk of cancer has been established in various epidemiological studies. PAHs are also harmful to the human immune system and can significantly interfere with development of a fetus and/or child resulting in brain defects. Furthermore, early life exposures to PAHs are thought to increase incidence of liver cancer later in life. While a portion of PAH exposures result from inhalation of airborne contaminants, dietary exposure has also been shown to play a significant role in the formation of DNA damage, which could lead to cancer. Our recent survey in a US city with high incidence of liver cancer in San Antonio, TX indicated that approximately half of study participants had detectable levels of a PAH biomarker in their urine, suggesting considerable exposure to one or more PAHs. In addition, our laboratory reported increased levels of a urinary aflatoxin (AF) biomarker in the same community, which correlated with consumption of corn tortillas, rice, and nuts. AFs are naturally occurring toxins produced by Aspergillus fungi that frequently contaminate commodities such as maize, peanuts and tree nuts and exposure to the most prevalent and potent type of aflatoxin, AFB1, can cause liver toxicity, suppression of the immune system, and decreased growth rate in animals and humans. Chronic exposure to AFs is a major risk factor for the development of liver cancer. The aflatoxin problem is especially pronounced in traditionally underserved communities and high risk areas due to the frequent consumption of moldy foods or disproportionate consumption of foods containing aflatoxin-contaminated ingredients. In fact, a study recently completed by our laboratory indicated that approximately 85% of the Texas study population exhibited detectable aflatoxin B1-albumin adducts, an exposure biomarker found in the blood. This is increased from 21% in 2009 and likely a result of recent droughts (unpublished data). Thus, strategies that reduce multiple exposures to PAHs and AFs are highly desirable for populations at risk for both agents. The PAH, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), is similar to AFB1 in that both AFB1 and BaP are toxic to the immune system and are strong carcinogens, leading to the development of tumors. Among various strategies that have been successfully used to reduce human exposures to mycotoxins, the binding of AFs in the gastrointestinal tract by a specific type of clay has been shown to be a safe and viable approach. This conclusion is based on previous studies by our laboratry using multiple animal models and clinical intervention trials in humans in the US and Ghana where it was shown that NovaSil (NS) clay, administered by capsule or in food, significantly reduced exposure to AFs. Although no successful clinical interventions have been reported for PAHs using similar clay enterosorbent strategies, certain food ingredients, including powdered young barley leaves, rice bran fiber, lignin and other plant-based components such as quercitin and chlorogenic acid may bind to a variety of PAHs, thereby reducing their absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. The findings from this research will be of direct relevance to vulnerable populations where consumption of a diet contaminated with PAHs and AF occurs frequently."

We also will tackle more practical challenges in the use of the clays and layered double hydroxide in removing or inactivating the mycotoxins in vitro (fermentation) and in vivo. The specific objectives are to: 1) Modify smectites to ensure the nanominerals&#39; binding efficacy for aflatoxins in real corn fermentation solutions; 2) Modify smectites to improve the nanominerals&#39; catalytic functions in degrading adsorbed aflatoxins in corn fermentation solutions; 3) Engineer smectites to detoxify aflatoxins in vivo at realistic toxin levels in broiler chickens; and 4) explore and modify clays and layered double hydroxides for binding fumonisin, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone. Once implemented in practices, the adverse effects of the mycotoxins to animals and humans; and the economical losses of corn growers, biofuel industry, and animal industry can be minimized.Arsenic, zinc, lead, copper, nickel and many other heavy metals are the major concerns of acid mine drainage (AMD) resulting from the oxidation of sulfide minerals exposed to air. In theory, acid mine drainage and heavy metal contamination should not be problems in limestone areas due to the abundance of carbonate minerals that can neutralize the acidity. Poorly crystalline nanoparticles such as various iron oxides, silica, and the oxides of heavy metals are the most reactive compounds in regulating the heavy metals. Unfortunately, our knowledge on these reactive particles in the limestone environment or the liming reclamation areas is very limited due to the difficulties of characterization of these materials with common methods and instruments. The general objectives of our study are to: 1) characterize on an atomic scale low-crystallinity nanoparticles and colloids generated in AMD and examine their transformations in a limestone environment, 2) characterize As (the major focus), Zn, Cu, and Pb speciation in each associated solid phase and quantify the mobilization and transformation of As and the heavy metals associated with the mineral phase conversions, and 3) model the reactivity of the nanoparticles and the geochemistry of As and heavy metals in the limestone environment. This proposed study will characterize both representative field samples and simulation samples, combine several advanced spectroscopic and microscopic methods and geochemical modeling to address the speciation, composition, atomic scale structures and the influence of the heavy metals and metalloid on the nanoparticles. The results will offer more insight to the geochemistry of the nanoparticles AMD and offer more structural and thermodynamic parameters for modeling."

Farm bills define and authorize agricultural programs for the subsequent five or six years. The policy changes in the new farm bill are the most far reaching since the 1996 bill when policy changes were largely driven by efforts to comply with World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations that stipulate member nations must reduce their use of production-promoting and trade-distorting agricultural policies.As a result of a recent trade dispute brought before the World Trade Organization&#39;s dispute settlement panel, cotton was singled out for the first time in the 81 year history of field crop subsidy programs in the 2014 bill. Cotton is excluded from two new crop programs but is eligible to received payments under a new insurance program exclusive to cotton. While these unprecedented changes to the treatment of cotton in the new farm bill make significant progress towards reforming cotton subsidy programs, the question remains whether the new policies are less trade-distorting than the predecessor policies. In addition, it has yet to be determined whether or not the policies awarded to cotton are more or less distorting than policies awarded to other feed grains (referred to as  program crops  which include corn, wheat, oats, barley, soybeans, and rice). This research seeks to address these questions using USDA data and simulation analyses.Furthermore, cotton is now excluded from receiving payments from programs upon which payments are calculated based on historic production determined by crop specific acreage and yields during a specific previous time period. These historic acres are referred to as  base acres . While cotton producers are no longer entitled to payments calculated using base acres, cotton producers with historic base acres associated with cotton production now have the ability to reassign these cotton base acres, referred to as  generic base , each year to another planted program crop. For that year, those generic base acres are considered base acres for the program crop to which they were assigned for the purposes of calculating program payments. Thus, producers with generic base acres have an incentive to make planting decision based on expected support payments for the various supported commodities and market price expectations. This is likely to lead to production distortions. This research seeks to estimate the potential production distortions associated with producers reallocating their base acres using USDA data and simulation analyses."

Their life cycle is characterized by &#39;monocarpic senescence&#39; - after fertilization, over a time span of a few weeks, parental plants turn yellow and die. Importantly, this process is characterized by massive remobilization of nutrients (including nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, sulfur and more) from senescing parental plants to the developing grains. Senescence timing therefore influences key agronomic traits including nutrient use efficiency, yield (with late-senescing or &#39;stay-green&#39; varieties often exhibiting higher yields), grain protein and micronutrient concentration. Senescence onset and rate are controlled by genetic and environmental factors; water deficit stress is the most important external factor inducing early/rapid senescence, and leading to lower yield. In this general context, the present project will (1) analyze the function of a regulatory protein at the intersection of plant senescence control and water deficit response, investigating different plant developmental stages, and (2) identify and characterize some of the enzymes (&#39;proteases&#39;) which are important for nitrogen remobilization from senescing leaves to developing grains. These goals will be achieved using a combination of greenhouse and field-based drought experiments, advanced molecular techniques for gene/protein functional analysis in senescence regulation and drought response, and advanced biochemical techniques to characterize N remobilization from senescing leaves. The project will provide novel information about molecular processes controlling cereal performance under water-limited conditions, and will identify and characterize genes contributing to nitrogen use efficiency, grain protein concentration and (indirectly) yield. This information will establish a physiological basis for breeding efforts aimed at improving several important crop performance parameters."

Until screenings of dry bean and barley genotypes are completed under Wyoming conditions, producers may not have the best adapted genotypes for their field operations and for economic/environmental sustainability.The proposed project will test experimental genotypes of major crops grown in Wyoming and nearby regions (including but not restricted to dry bean, hard red winter wheat, and barley) for their performance under limited-irrigation conditions. Some experiments will also be conducted in the greenhouse where water availability can be controlled very closely. Field studies will be performed in northwestern and southeastern Wyoming. As drought-tolerant genotypes are identified, the PI will work with breeders to make crosses between the drought-tolerant types and adapted public lines with the ultimate goal to develop new cultivars with higher yield and/or quality than existing varieties."

We will pursue testing of winter wheat and dry bean as new varieties and experimental lines become available. For example, Colorado State University has been developing upright varieties of dry bean, which offer advantages in terms of disease control, drying, and harvesting. In 2014, irrigated malting barley averaged 145 bu/acre and met or exceeded all the quality standards for malting. We will continue testing malting barley for its yield potential, quality, and economic viability. There is a lot of interest in industrial hemp but information about its adaptability or potential benefits for southwestern Colorado is lacking. We will test several industrial hemp varieties in 2015 to evaluate their performance and adaptation to our environment. One opportunity that may generate additional income for growers in southwestern Colorado is the production of virus Y-free seed potatoes. Potato Y virus (PVY) is a serious threat to potato production in the San Luis Valley and even though potatoes have been grown sporadically in southwestern Colorado on a small scale, it is conceivable to find isolated areas where the likelihood of PVY infestation is small. We will explore this possibility as well as the potential to produce specialty potatoes, which may have additional benefits compared to conventional (e.g., white-fleshed) potatoes. Regardless of the crops grown, water is the most limiting factor to crop production in southwestern Colorado. There are approximately 169,000 acres of irrigated land in southwestern Colorado but water availability fluctuates from year to year. For example, there were severe irrigation water shortages as recently as 2013. We will continue developing management practices and strategies to conserve water and optimize its use efficiency. The emphasis will be on alfalfa, which is the largest irrigated crop in southwestern Colorado and the one that uses the most water compared to other field crops. We will determine the effects of water stress on alfalfa stand, dry matter, and time of recovery. Even though irrigation accounts for a significant percentage of crop production in southwestern Colorado, dryland farming is still important. Constraints include low and erratic precipitation, low soil organic matter, wind and water erosion, and low yields. We will test cover crops as an environmentally friendly way to enhance soil quality and health and to reduce soil erosion. Cover crops will be grown during the fallow period in (winter) wheat-fallow, wheat-bean, and wheat-safflower-fallow rotations. We will monitor soil moisture, soil fertility, soil erosion, weed infestation, soil biological activity, and crop yields and returns. We will identify cover crop mixtures and management practices that will enhance the sustainability of dryland farming in SW Colorado and SE Utah. The information generated by this project will be shared with a large audience via field tours and workshops, social media, annual technical reports or bulletins, journal articles, and presentations at relevant events. Success will be measured by how well the research and outreach objectives are met and by the impact this project will have on the sustainability of crop production in southwestern Colorado."

Improved sustainablity benefits not only the grower in turns of economic and agronomic returns, but the society as a whole as costs of production can be reduced and potentially negative environmental impacts minimized.Investigations of mutliple soil tests and subsequent correlation and calibration will be conducted for spring barley, and nitrogen response curves will be developed for winter-malt barley with nitrogen applied at multiple rates and timings. Field studies will be conducted at research and extension centers at the University of Idaho. The overall goal is to improve nitrogen management strategies for barley production in Idaho. The project hopes to improve site-specific nitrogen management leading to improved agronomic efficiency and decrease potential for negative environmental impacts. This would lead to a more sustainablity produced crop and thus, improvement in overall production efficiency."

Winter barley is poised to allow such a shift, as it can mature earlier and allow growers to focus equipment, labor, and water resources on other crops, such as hay, later in the summer season.Because both environmental stresses and diseases and insects differ markedly between geographical areas, it is important to develop cultivars that perform particularly well in a given production area. In addition, as management practices change to become more sustainable, plant breeding must continually shift emphases to develop adapted material for current and future production systems. Food safety and food nutrition requirements also change with increased knowledge, and plant breeding is responsible for providing cultivars to meet the needs of increasingly more sophisticated consumers and allied industries. Plant breeders are tasked with development of these improved cultivars to meet the agronomic needs of local producers; cereal chemistry and rheology needs of the industries that processes these grains; and safety and nutrition needs of the consumers who purchase and feed their families with them. In addition to the direct research, the value of including undergraduate and graduate students as part of building and maintaining capacity in plant breeding and genetics should not be undervalued.Conventional and genomic breeding of improved cultivars will result in new cultivars released for acceptance by stakeholders including farmers and the feed and malting industries."

Grain shape, especially rice grain length, is a major agronomic trait affecting yield and quality of the grain product. Grain length is genetically controlled by a large number of genetic loci. During the past two decades, intensive genetic research work worldwide has led to the cloning of about a dozen genes that regulate grain length in rice. More genetic loci that may play a role in grain length determination have also been mapped to chromosomes. Working with our collaborators, we have recently identified a genetic locus that has a major effect on grain length control in rice. The mutant allele of this gene leads to the development of long grains in mutant rice lines. The putative gene underlying this mutation has been mapped to a small region of chromosome 2. The gene has been cloned and sequenced. In this project, we will characterize the isolated gene at the molecular level. We will investigate how this gene exerts its function to regulate grain development. Finally, we expect to identify its homologous genes in barley and wheat, and will explore the possibility of increasing grain length of barley and wheat by manipulating the function of this gene. An improvement in grain length may eventually help breeders to develop new cultivars of barley and wheat with increased grain yield and improved grain quality. Thus, the knowledge gained from the proposed work is important not only for rice research and production, but may also have potential applications to the improvement of grain size, yield and quality of wheat and barley, two major crops in Idaho and the whole USA."

Sustainability of crop production in semi-arid and arid regions of the Western U.S. is threatened by limited water availability, which results in increasing competition from urban development, environmental restrictions, and energy production sector. Altered geographic distribution, intensity, and frequency of extreme climate events (such as heat and drought), and the recently approved water rights will continue to present challenges for agricultural producers in terms of water resource use and socio-economic stability. This phenomenon is compounded by the inefficient use of precious irrigated water due to the lack of solid scientific knowledge and clearly demonstrated methodologies for water and nutrient conservation.Nitrogen fertilizer is the principal (and the most costly) nutrient input, yet its use efficiency is only about 40 -50% in most U.S. agricultural operations. Thus, 50-60% of N fertilizer applied to cropland is not used by the crops and is lost to the environment. Low N use efficiency (pounds of N applied per bushel of crop produced) are resulting from a loss of applied N from the soil - plant system via various pathways including gaseous plant emission, denitrification, leaching, surface runoff and volatilization. An increase of N use efficiency in cereal production, by just 10 %, would translate into savings of about US $5 billion annually and, substantial improvement in environmental quality. Improving N use efficiency in cereal crops is a challenging task that encompasses the ability to accurately estimate a crops need for N and developing nutrient management practices that would provide the best return from fertilizer application.Wheat is an integral crop for Western U.S., where it is grown as a main cash crop or as a vital rotational crop in combination with other high-value crops such as vegetables. There is an urgent need to develop more efficient nutrient management strategies in order to maximize wheat grain yields and enhance grain quality.Advanced crop canopy sensors utilize the optical characteristics of plants and their associated vitality and health properties. The newly emerged hyperspectral remote sensing entails acquiring images in narrow and continuous spectral bands; these sensors are very useful for detection of specific characteristics and differences in vegetation. The recent technologies such as high-resolution multispectral sensors, hyperspectral digital cameras, spectroradiometers, and other optical sensors could play an important role in managing nutrients within the crop production systems. The specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum - i.e. narrow bands - have shown significant improvement in accuracy of discrimination capabilities among various types of plant stresses. Accurate and timely information regarding both water and N status obtained with remote sensors can be of tremendous help for irrigation and fertilization decision making. The proposed study aims to demonstrate that sensor-based technologies, utilized in combination with traditional practices such as soil testing and evapotranspiration (ET) monitoring, can substantially improve the management of N and water use.This study will serve as an initial step in developing robust practical sensor-based water and N management methodology for a variety of key crops grown in semi-arid regions. This project will enable us to identify the most valuable environmental and plant measurements for developing such a methodology. Agronomy Advisory Committee and Fertilizer Tax Advisory Committee are two key stakeholder groups in Idaho and Montana, respectively, advising University research and extension faculty. These two groups, as well as several commodity groups (Idaho Wheat Commission, Idaho Barley Commission, Montana Wheat and Barley Commission) have highly supported this proposed collaborative project. Addressing sustainability of crop production and food security in the context of continuously rising fertilizer costs and water limiting environment has been identified as the primary objective by many of these stakeholder groups.In close collaboration with wheat producers, we choose to conduct the field studies in Southern Idaho (where wheat is grown as a primary rotational component in cropping systems dominated by potatoes, sugar beets and seed crops) and Northwestern Montana (where exceptionally high yield and exceptional quality wheat is a primary cash crop).The project incorporates research and education is focused on: 1) conducting a field study for determining the minimum N and water requirements for optimum wheat grain yield and quality, 2) developing a sensor-based system for identifying - and distinguishing between - N and water stresses, 3) developing an empirical model for predicting wheat grain yield and protein content in varying water x N interactions, 4) developing water and N use recommendations for growers based on the developed model, and 5) deliver extensive educational outreach programs (workshops, field demonstrations, scholarly and educational materials) focused on water and nutrient conservation and utilization of sensor-based technologies.Expected outcomes: 1) developing grower recommendations derived from scientifically sound and robust model based on locally obtained data; and 2) improved grower understanding of how sensor-based methodologies can be successfully utilized for improving the efficiency of water and nutrient use."

In Idaho, 2014 production was estimated at 100 million bushels of wheat and 50 million bushels of barley (Idaho Wheat Commission, Idaho Barley Commission, 2015). Idaho now ranks first in the nation for barley production over the last five years. The malt capacity expansion of Anheuser-Busch, the addition of the Grupo Modelo malt facility in Idaho Falls, and the expansion of the craft brewing industry in Idaho has increased the production demand for quality malt barley. At 39 million bushels annually, Idaho&#39;s malting barley production is the second largest in the nation. Maintenance of this strength requires continual efforts to improve crop quality and productivity. This can only be accomplished by investing in progressive agricultural research programs that keep the industry at the forefront of the development and implementation of new agricultural technologies. Idaho&#39;s climate provides an excellent environment to consistently produce high quality grain. Almost 73% of Idaho&#39;s barley received a USDA/FGIS grade of #1 in 2008 (Olson, 2008). Most grain produced in the rainfed environments of the Intermountain West suffers little from foliar pathogens that impact quality. The development of new overseas markets for high beta-glucan food barley and for malt barley will expand the market options for our growers in rural Idaho. Another opportunity is offered by aquaculture with interest in grain-based fish meal. Because current varieties do not meet preferred characteristics, current production will not fulfill all the needs of these new markets. We must continue to improve small grain varieties for the rainfed environments of the West that reliably produce high quality feed for cattle, swine and fish, and provide the grain needed for growing food and malt markets.In the water-limited environments of Southern and Southeastern Idaho, production of dryland grain is hampered by fungal root rots that invade stress-compromised plants. There is increasing concern about adequate irrigation as we potentially enter another year with short water supplies. Simultaneously, there have been substantial changes in the U.S. grain industries. There is an increasing demand for hard white wheat in the domestic and international markets for bread and noodle products, and for specialty high beta-glucan barley varieties. These crops seem even more sensitive to disease and drought stress than their traditional counterparts. Continued effort is required to develop locally adapted wheat and barley varieties and agronomic practices that maximize productivity and profitability.We face increasing demands on water for irrigated crops, but supplies are limited. In 2015, snow pack estimates for the Snake River Basin above Palisades Reservoir that directly feeds Southeast Idaho indicated moisture content at 90% of average, but other water basins are well below 70%. A call on water by Idaho producers with senior water rights threatened to idle irrigated crop land (Idaho Mountain Express, 2015, http://www.mtexpress.com/news/blaine_county/), and force growers to stop pumping groundwater in Wood River Valley. While year water diversions were averted by record spring rains, such actions may not be avoidable in the future and would have devastating economic impacts on south \east Idaho. Barley, in particular, can be produced with less water than any other field crop grown in the region.A recognized barrier to grain production under dryland conditions is the water and nutrient-robbing fungi that infect stressed root and crown tissue. Currently, breeders do not routinely screen for resistance to the dryland root rot complex, other than indirectly in variety performance trials located throughout the area. Development of a semi-permanent screening nursery at Aberdeen allows testing of varieties carrying resistance to dryland root rot fungi. In this nursery, heavily inoculated plots are dedicated to screening advanced breeder lines and testing new transgenic lines for resistance to fungal root-rotting organisms. This should allow for identification of lines for dryland areas where grains are subject to dry-land foot rot infection, as well as provide a basic understanding of the effectiveness of transgenic and novel genes in grain to resist infection and disease expression.PREVIOUS WORK AND PRESENT OUTLOOK: Previous research at the University of Idaho identified prevalent root pathogens in dryland production areas of southern and southeast Idaho. These included Bipolaris sorokiniana, various Fusarium species, Rhizoctonia solani, and Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Strausbaugh et al., 2004). Dryland root rot, caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana and various Fusarium species, was present in 90% of the tested fields. Utilizing these isolates in trials conducted in growth chambers indicated significant differences in seedling tolerance among named cultivars for both Bipolaris sorokiniana and Fusarium species. Isolates of these fungi also were used in the field to screen several wheat cultivars for potential tolerance or resistance. Smiley et al., 2005, found that Fusarium culmorum and F. pseudograminearum caused the greatest disease severity and plant damage and were the only pathogens in their Oregon studies that reduced grain yield. While both of these pathogens were isolated from infected cereals in Southern and Southeast Idaho, the most frequently isolated species was F. culmorum (Strausbaugh, et al., 2004). Environmental factors play a significant role in determining the relative prevalence of various Fusarium species, as well as in the manifestation of symptoms by infected plants (Strausbaugh, et al., 2004, Smiley and Patterson, 1996, Klaasen et al., 1992, Pettit and Parry, 2001). Dry growing conditions will favor the development of dryland root rots, while humid, moist conditions can result in the development Fusarium head blight (FHB), often caused by the same species of the Fusarium pathogens. In the past in Idaho, there have been few reported instances of FHB infections . However, production of corn grown for cattle silage in Idaho has more than doubled from 1987 to 2014, and corn is another host for Fusarium fungi. With environmentally conducive conditions occurring under irrigation, there have been serious and devastating outbreaks of FHB occurring in spring wheat. Direct seeding of spring cereals in the PNW constitutes about 6% of production acreage (Paulitz, et al., 2002). Cereals under dryland or direct seed production are exposed to greater disease pressure from foot rot fungi. Screening of currently grown cultivars of wheat and barley will allow us to identify those cultivars with tolerance or resistance to dryland foot rot. In addition to reducing yield, Fusarium species produce tricothecenes, mycotoxins involved in pathogenicity (Edwards, et al., 2001). These mycotoxins can have serious detrimental effects on animal and human health (D&#39;Mello et al., 1999). Various labs have produced genetically transformed cultivars of wheat and barley with genes specifically to resist Fusarium infection (tricothecene efflux pumps and acetyltransferases that inactivate tricothecenes), (Okubara, et al., 2002, Dahleen et al. 2000), or that resist general fungal invasion (endochitinaseses, exochitinases, and other thaumatin-like proteins). The effectiveness of these genes in improving root rot resistance needs to be tested in the greenhouse and the field."

Harvested barley acreage in Washington State decreased from ~500,000 acres seeded in 2000 to ~81,000 acres seed in 2010. This has been followed by four years of fluctuating harvested barley acreages, from 115,000 in 2011 to 175,000 in 2012, 195,000 in 2013 and 105,000 in 2014 (Small Grains 2014 Summary (September 2014), USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service). Including spring barley in crop rotations has been shown to be beneficial to winter wheat, yet barley acreage remains relatively low when compared to reported acreages from the 1950&#39;s to 2002. Washington ranks 4th among all states in barley production (WASS and USDA-NASS annual Washington Agricultural Statistics). Typically, barley production in Washington involves &gt; 95% spring and &lt; 5% winter types.Spring barley is well established in cropping systems as the preferred rotation crop with wheat, as more annual and three-year crop rotations and reduced tillage seeding systems are being utilized to reduce soil erosion and better utilize water and energy (Cook and Veseth, 1991; Schillinger et al., 1999; Cook, 2000). Plant back restrictions on barley due to grass weed herbicides used on winter wheat have begun to limit the amount of acreage where spring barley can be grown (Newhouse et al., 1992; Lee et al., 2010; Rustgi et al., 2014). For example, when spring barley is grown after a herbicide resistant winter wheat that was sprayed with Imazamox, the plants will germinate, grow to the two to four leaf stage, and then die due to the residual herbicide in the soil. Imazamox resistant spring barley is primarily intended to tolerate the residual herbicide in the soil rather than to be sprayed directly, as grassy weeds are not a major problem in spring cereals in the Palouse. These plant back restrictions have effectively removed the option to grow barley on many acres in the PNW because barley typically follows winter wheat.In addition to Washington being a major producer of feed barley, malting barley is also produced, and there is potential for specialty food type barley production as well. Production analyses indicate the demand for malting barley in the West will continue to increase largely because of the Fusarium head blight (scab) problem in the upper Midwest states (Steffenson, 2003). In 2006 the FDA approved a health benefit endorsement for barley based on its &beta;-glucan content and role in lowering blood cholesterol level in humans (Lazaridou and Biliaderis, 2007). With this endorsement the demand for barley for food will likely rise in domestic as well as export markets, especially Japan. This means that high yielding, especially multi-purpose cultivars that are suitable for malt and feed or food are needed to meet the needs of producers and users and to circumvent the development of numerous cultivars of either feed or malting types, especially for the higher yielding environments. A barley cultivar with yields competitive with the best feed cultivars that is acceptable for malting and brewing (as well as feed) would represent a breakthrough in barley cultivar development. In order to return this traditional malting barley region to maximum production, new varieties that possess premium malting quality, superior nutritional quality, and that are adapted to dryland production conditions must be developed.A better understanding of the factors affecting nutritional quality characteristics of barley is occurring due to increasing intensity of research (Bowman et al., 2000; Baik and Ullrich, 2008). The feed industry more fully realizes and appreciates the variability of feed quality characteristics and the value of barley in feed rations. The food industry, too, realizes the value of barley especially in terms of soluble and insoluble fiber (Lazaridou and Biliaderis, 2007). The opportunity to develop improved barley for feed and food is increasing. Specialty food types such as hulless, waxy, proanthocyanidin-free, and low phytate types are being developed (Bregitzer et al., 2008). Hulless types are somewhat utilized domestically and especially in Canada and eastern Pacific Rim countries. Again, the FDA health benefit endorsement is beginning to have a positive impact.All of the major types of commercial barley (2-row, 6-row; food, feed, and malt; spring and winter types) can successfully be produced in the Pacific Northwest, which provide growers production options and multiple market outlets. However, this situation dilutes breeding programs and spreads resources thin. To deal with this, especially in light of decreasing government funds, the breeders in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho are collaborating to some extent by dividing up the efforts in cultivar development. As a result, the WSU program is concentrating on spring barley while relying on Oregon and Idaho (USDA-ARS) to develop primary germplasm pools for winter barley.For decades, diploid barley has been used as a model experimental organism for plant genetics and physiological studies. The first and best organized comprehensive, high-density genome mapping and genome project--Enhanced Barley Through Genomics (EBTG, a.k.a. USBGP, a.k.a. NABGP, a.k.a. NABGMP; http://barleyworld.org/northamericanbarley.php) - using molecular marker and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses is underway in barley with many milestone results since 1992 (e.g., Kleinhofs, et al., 1993; Hayes, et al., 1993; Tinker et al., 1995; Han et al., 1997a; Marquez-Cedillo et al., 2000, 2001; Ullrich et al., 2004; Schmierer et al., 2004; Hayes and Szucs, 2006; Xu and Jia, 2007, Druka et al., 2008).Other techniques, especially advanced genome wide analyses and molecular breeding tools provide opportunities for the application of biotechnology to barley cultivar development. Since 2006, the multi-disciplinary, multi-state Barley Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP) has made advancements in these areas through gene chip and association mapping technologies (http://barleycap.cfans.umn.edu/, Waugh et al., 2009; Zhong et al., 2009). Much of the barley genetics knowledge base is applicable to other crop plants, especially other cereals that are more complicated genetically, e.g., wheat."

This region covers 1,557,000 cropland hectares and is, by far, the largest contiguous cropping zone in the Western United States. A single family operates most farms and average farm size is 1,800 hectares. Since land was broken out of native grassland and sage in the 1880s, farming has been almost exclusively a tillage-based winter wheat-summer fallow system, where only one crop is grown every two years.Intensive tillage operations during fallow often bury surface crop residue, pulverize soil clods, and reduce surface roughness. Blowing dust from excessively tilled fields leads to major soil loss and reduces air quality. Wind erosion from dryland farms is a major cause of soil loss and degrades off-site urban air quality by small particulate emissions. These soils are dominated by particles &lt;100 um in diameter that are readily suspended and transported long distances during windstorms. Farmers need to convert to minimum and delayed conservation tillage methods using herbicides instead of tillage whenever feasible to reduce wind erosion. No-till fallow is successfully used in many regions of the world, but is not yet widely practiced in the low-precipitation winter wheat-summer fallow zone in the Pacific Northwest because of seed-zone drying during the summer. Wide-spread adoption of conservation-till and no-till fallow would, without question, sharply reduce wind erosion, blowing dust, and air quality problems.The overriding goal of all research conducted under this CRIS is to develop and extend new cropping systems and farming methods that reduce wind erosion and that can be profitably practiced by farmers. The long-term dryland cropping systems experiments (objectives 1, 3, and 6) will provide an in-depth knowledge base for the feasibility of intensive no-till and conservation-till systems with wheat, barley, triticale, canola, pea, and camelina.Removing emergence-impeding dwarfing genes from winter wheat varieties (objective 2) will enhance seedling emergence from deep planting depths in the winter wheat-fallow region of east-central Washington. Development and testing of a commercial-size deep-furrow drill prototype that will pass through and retain residue (objective 4) will reduce, and hopefully eliminate, the last road block (i.e., plugging the drill during planting) that farmers face in the adoption of conservation-till fallow of summer-fallowed soils.The irrigated winter canola planting method experiment (objective 5) will identify environmentally friendly methods for winter canola production in lieu of burning and heavy disking of winter wheat stubble prior to planting.Research on winter triticale agronomy (objective 7) will determine how this crop can compete with winter wheat and the rotation advantages (if any) that it provides.Approximately 80 percent of the research under this CRIS will be conducted in the field and 20% in the laboratory. Research results will be disseminated through local, regional, national, and international meetings, through field tours at research sites, and through popular and scientific journal articles."

We will use a state-of-the-artin situ root imager to study root development in the field as well as develop quantitative approaches to identify traits associated with beneficial root traits to increase yield. In addition, we will use molecular and genetic tools to study how plant roots optimize the uptake of essential nutrients such at phosphate and how they are best able to resist the onslaught of biotic and abiotic stresses they face.

Identify, develop, validate, and implement new measurements of malting quality, especially those relating to protein mobilization during germination, in barley germplasm in order to identify those genotypes showing enhanced malting quality attributes. Objective 2. Apply standard malting quality assessments to germplasm submitted by collaborating public sector barley breeding programs, researchers, and other stakeholder organizations in order to identify new (barley) varieties with suitable malting quality attributes.  Approach: Surveying populations that have been extensively genotyped and mapped for malting quality will allow us to generate datasets that include process (proteinase activity), phenotype (malting quality), and genotype (>3000 SNP loci) information. Examining a range of barley genetic resources will enable us to use that genetic diversity to identify fundamental processes underlying malting quality. We will use this information to identify new targets and develop additional mechanisms to screen for improved malting barley genotypes. The new screening mechanisms may involve biochemical measurements that we could implement in our malting quality analysis program. Alternatively, the new tests could utilize genetic tools that breeders could incorporate into their own germplasm characterization, simplifying and streamlining their malting quality selection process."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial ôrhizobacteriaö, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or ôgapsö, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments. Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics.  Approach: Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems. Hypothesis: Dry bean genotypes interact with tillage management to affect yield performance under drought conditions.  Eight pinto bean genotypes with varying drought tolerance will be tested in a field previously sown to wheat. A split, split block with four replications with irrigation level the main plot, tillage level the split plot, and genotypes the split, split plot will be used. Irrigation will be manipulated to impose a terminal drought stress. Conventional tillage and strip tillage will treatments will both include use of a nonselective herbicide. Variables will include plant biomass, soil compaction, soil moisture, measures of plant stress and various yield components.    Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments.   Hypothesis a) Timing of herbicide application when available soil moisture and likelihood of precipitation is greater impacts weed control in chickpea.  Four herbicides will be tested at three application timings; 4 and 2 weeks prior to seeding chickpea, and post-plant, preemergence. Herbicide treatments will be replicated in a randomized complete block. Soil moisture will be monitored gravimetrically for 4 weeks after each application. Weed control and chickpea tolerance will be determined by taking weed counts and visual control ratings at 3 and 6 weeks after planting (WAP) and crop stand counts at 4 WAP, and chickpea seed yield.  Hypothesis b) Roller-packing impacts performance of pre-emergence herbicides in chickpea in dry soil conditions.  Four herbicide combinations applied post-plant, pre-emergence will be tested in chickpea with and without roller-packing. Experiments will be designed as a split block with herbicide as the main treatment and roller packer as the split treatment and each treatment replicated four times. Half of each plot will be roller-packed immediately after herbicide applications. Weed control and chickpea injury will be evaluated and visually compared to a non-treated check. Analysis of variance will be used to statistically separate treatment effects in all experiments.   Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Hypothesis: Rhizobacteria strains, soilborne pathogens and cultivar class significantly impact biological nitrogen fixation and yields of pea and chickpea genotypes.  The interactions between the root rot pathogen Fusarium solani, commercial rhizobacteria inoculants, and foliar applications of phosphorous acid, on nitrogen fixation and rhizobial colonization of the most popular dry pea cultivars grown in Washington and Idaho will be assessed in field and greenhouse trials. Plants will be evaluated for elemental content, plant height, dry shoot/root weight, root disease severity, nodulation and yield."

Some ingredients are developed in-house and we have both laboratory and pilot scale production capabilities. Digestibility of nutrients from specific ingredients has traditionally been conducted with large fish. The effect of strain and size will be determined. A tank system is available to collect feces both by sedimentation and stripping. The effect of strain and size on protein and amino acid retention will be conducted to determine the need for strain or life stage specific diets. Most trout culture use water from one raceway to another up to 5 times. A 36 tank system located on a commercial farm that receives water from 1st, 3rd, or 5th use will be used to determine the effect of water quality as a stressor on specific mineral and fat soluble vitamins in the tissues. A strain of trout selected  to utilize plant-based diets is available and the effect of the gut microflora communities will be characterized. Fish oil has been the source of the heart/brain healthy fatty acids, EPA/DHA. This source is limited by supply and cost. Variability among trout in a specific strain for their ability to biosynthesize EPA/DHA has been identified. Trout with this trait will be bred to enhance the nutritional quality of the fillet for the benefit of the consumer.  Objective 1: Develop and evaluate new ingredients and ingredient processing methods to increase nutritional and economic value. 1.A: Develop an improved soybean processing method to simultaneously separate protein and oil and remove anti-nutrients. 1.B: Development of alternative methods for the concentration of protein from wheat, barley, and oats.  1.C: Determine the nutritional and economic value of new and modified ingredients.   Objective 2: Determine whether stage specific and strain specific diets are needed by evaluating nutrient digestibility at  Approach: Objective 1: 1.A: An improved aqueous processing method that results in high oil and protein recovery and removal of anti-nutrients will reduce the diarrheic effect of soybeans for trout. Experiments to optimize pretreatment and extraction conditions will be conducted.  1.B: Improved processing methods will increase the nutritional and economic value of protein concentrates from wheat, barley and oats. Trials will be conducted with wheat to optimize starting material and processing conditions to concentrate to 70% protein, and remove the binding effect. This effect of wheat gluten limits inclusion level in extruded feeds. Protein concentrates of barley and oats will be produced using another aqueous fractionation method that features alkaline extraction, centrifugation, and acid precipitation of supernatant.  1.C: A seven phase program will evaluate the nutritional value of alternative ingredients. Complete nutrient and anti-nutrient analysis, fry screening trials, effect on feed intake and extrusion, nutrient digestibility, growth trials, and effect on fecal size will be conducted.   Objective 2: 2.A: Nutrient digestibility is affected by either fish size or strain or both. The ADC’s for major nutrients and amino acids will be determined with four unique strains of trout at three sizes (15, 500, 1500 g, 12 trials).  2.B: Nutrient retention efficiency is affected by fish size or strain or both. The same strains and fish size will be used as in 2.A in 12 week growth studies to evaluate protein and amino acid retention. Four diets varying in protein (40/45%) and lipid (20/25%) will be fed.  Objective 3: 3.A: Improved diets containing elevated levels of stress-affected minerals and fat soluble vitamins will improve performance of rainbow trout raised in serial-reuse water. The effect of water source (1st, 3rd, & 5th use) as a stressor in three strains of rainbow trout on tissue concentrations of fat soluble vitamins and minerals will be determined. 3.B: Specific combinations of ingredients and prebiotics affect intestinal inflammation and the consistency of rainbow trout feces. To improve waste management dietary factors that affect fecal particle size will be determined.   Objective 4: 4.A: Intestinal microflora community structure in rainbow trout is affected by diet and host genotype. Microbial communities will be identified in two strains of trout, one susceptible to soy enteritis and the other resistant.  4.B: Transplantation of microbiota from selected trout fed plant-based feed into non-selected trout will reduce intestinal enteritis when fed plant-based feeds. A cross-over experimental design will be used to determine if different microbial communities can protect a trout from soy induced intestinal enteritis.   Objective 5: The ability to biosynthesize EPA and DHA in muscle tissue of rainbow trout fed diets containing plant oils can be selectively enhanced. To evaluate the potential to increase the ability of trout to biosynthesize EPA and DHA in their muscle, variation among individuals and families of rainbow trout will be determined. Individuals with known performance values for this trait will then be selectively bred."

A. Identify sources of variation in viscometry-based methodologies (e.g., falling number) that are used to indicate starch soundness, then develop and test alternative procedures to reduce precision error. B. Develop a near-infrared spectroscopy model, or alternatively a Raman spectroscopy model, for ascertaining mixture levels of conventional and waxy hexaploid wheat. 2: Enable new, real-time rapid optical methods to measure defects and vitreousness in commercial wheat kernels. A. Develop hyperspectral imaging procedures for identification of wheat kernels damaged by scab (Fusarium head blight), black point, heat, and frost, as defined by official inspection criteria. B. Develop imaging system for assessing the percentage of vitreous kernels in durum and hard red spring wheat.  Approach: Determine the underlying precision of the falling number procedure under ideal conditions, that is, the test when run with samples for which sampling error has been minimized. Samples of soft white wheat and three samples of club wheat that are representative pre-harvest sprouting will be evaluated. Within each subclass, the three samples are designed to be representative of low ( 375 s) falling number. All thermal conditions of the falling number instrument within a test day will be held constant as practicable, including the starting temperature of the meal-water mixture, the temperature of the instrument’s bath, the volume of water within the bath, and the mass and volume of the meal-water test sample. In addition to the runs that are based on the conventional amount of meal and water (treatment A: 7 g + 25 mL), three alternate preparations will be examined. Treatment (A, B, C, D) and wheat class or subclass (SWW, Club) will be specified as fixed factors. Samples within wheat class, grind, and portions will be specified as random factors. Minimum-width 95% confidence intervals for the variance estimates will be calculated as wil best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) obtained from the mixed model provide estimates of FN averages for each treatment and wheat class sample. Once the precision of the FN method under standard and modified conditions has been established, the research will proceed in two tacks. First, the issue of sampling error will be addressed. Sampling will occur at typical transfer points, such as the truck dump bin at the country elevator, railcar fill sites, and the entry point to the mill. Second, if under standard operation the procedure produces coefficients of variation greater than 3%, modifications to the mixing and heating stage will be explored in an attempt to reduce air bubble entrainment, with rheological measurements (conducted in parallel) performed using a rheometer under constant shear and heating rate conditions.  NIR calibrations for mixture levels of conventional and waxy wheat will be developed with accuracies < 5%. Both Linear and non-linear quantitative modeling will be performed on both whole kernel and ground meal binary mixtures.  In hyperspectral imaging research of wheat kernels for damage or vitreousness, PCA will be examined to identify the wavelengths at local minima and maxima which inherently possess the greatest contrast. The 10 most sensitive wavelengths will be examined in paired combinations exhaustively (45 trials) using reflectance ratios. Linear discriminant analysis will be used to identify the wavelength pair whose image band ratio produces the greatest percentage of correctly classified kernels, and so on for the next pair. Three regions of interest (ROI) on the kernel, namely the endosperm, germ, and entire kernel, will be separately examined. With each ROI, image processing will be done at the pixel level, whereby subregions of damage in the ROI are first identified; then, depending on the size of the subregion, a decision will be made on whether to categorize the ROI and/or the kernel as normal or damaged."

Our goal is to improve U.S. grain quality and international competitiveness through the application of engineering principles to rapidly measure grain traits, and to maintain grain quality during storage. We propose to develop instruments to rapidly measure quality traits for inspection at the first point of grain delivery, for breeders when selecting traits for new lines, and for processors prior to grain buying or processing. We also propose to develop chemical-free technology to control insects and maintain quality during handling and storage. This research will lead to higher profits for the agriculture sector, higher-quality foods reaching consumers, and more food available for a growing world population."

Manipulate swine dietary ingredients to improve nutrient utilization and reduce nutrient excretion and the emission of gasses into the environment. 2. Quantify and modify swine gastrointestinal microflora to improve nutrient utilization and reduce the emission of gasses into the environment. 3. Quantify the impact of swine dietary regimens on nutrient metabolism and immune function of the gastrointestinal tract and the whole animal in order to assess the potential tradeoffs between environmental concerns and production. 4. Exploit genetically-mediated mechanisms involved in Salmonella colonization of the swine gastrointestinal tract to reduce subsequent shedding into manure.  Approach: The impact of dietary ingredients on nutrient utilization in the pig and subsequent nutrient excretion and emission of gasses into the environment will be assessed through altering the source and level of dietary protein and carbohydrate. The protein level will be adjusted relative to the level of soybean meal and amino acid supplementation utilized in diet formulation, while the protein source factor will be accomplished by replacing soybean meal with either canola meal, corn gluten meal, or poultry meal. The source and level of complex carbohydrate will be accomplished by utilizing barley, beet pulp, distillers dried grains with solubles, soybean hulls, and wheat bran as a partial replacement of soybean meal. Nutrient retention, excretion, and gas emissions will be accomplished using animal metabolism trials and the employment of a manure storage system currently in place at the lab. Microbial ecology of the large intestine (via fresh feces) and manure, as affected by the source and level of protein and carbohydrate, will be assessed by classical and molecular methods currently employed at the Unit, using the same pigs and diets as described above. The impact of dietary regimens on nutrient metabolism and immune function will be accomplished by utilizing similarly formulated diets as above, but on a separate group of pigs, with assessment of systemic and intestinal immune system function using techniques currently being utilized within the Unit. Lastly, reduction of Salmonella colonization of the swine gastrointestinal tract for subsequent reduction of shedding into the environment will be accomplished by administration of a chemical compound to disrupt pathogen sensing, vaccination using an attenuated S. Typhimurium strain, and manipulation of crude protein levels in the diet (as described above)."

A recent study reveals that nutrient supply dramatically changed the prevalence and interaction strength between two plant viruses, barley yellow dwarf virus and cereal yellow dwarf virus. Since viruses hijack host cell machinery to replicate which requires nitrogen and phosphorus to synthesis nucleic acids and proteins, given more amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus, one would expect to see higher numbers of virus replication.  By studying and understanding the complex relationship between key nutrients and disease dynamics, we may help in planning and advising the future of agricultural practice.  This project will also provide opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students in research and instructional environments; interdisciplinary training and professional development for graduate students; and broad dissemination of our results to a diverse range of mathematicians, modelers, ecologists and biomedical researchers.  Our efforts will provide undergraduate and graduate students of diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds with first-hand educational experience in cross-disciplinary communication and exploration.  All cells are made of chemical elements. Ecological stoichiometry (ES), is the study of the balance of chemical elements in ecological interactions.  ES and the theory of evolution have been found to be crucial lenses through which one can view and understand the dynamics of populations and communities of microorganisms.  ES covers multiple biological scales, and it allows the construction of robust, mechanistic, and predictive mathematical models based on cell nutrient levels.  Within this theory, the utilization of energy and multiple chemical elements (especially carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) between organisms and their environment occupies a central position.  However, the ES framework has yet to be effectively integrated into the modeling of host-pathogen interactions.  This project seeks to identify the relationships of some key biological mechanisms to the rich dynamics often observed in simulating host (plant)-pathogen models incorporating nutrient quality and quantity in host and pathogen populations.  These relationships may provide novel insights for better plant disease control. Specifically, we will construct mathematical models of host-pathogen interactions that are based on empirical discoveries.  The models that the research team will investigate are novel both mathematically and computationally, as they will motivate challenging problems in areas of qualitative and computational studies of nonlinear differential equations and delay differential equations."

These microbial communities influence the growth, reproduction, and death rates of their hosts. Not all microbes are detrimental; the effects of microbes span the full range from causing deadly disease to being essential for host health. Despite the importance of microbial diversity to host well-being, we have little ability to predict the diversity and composition of microbial communities within hosts. This project will address this knowledge gap by testing whether a mathematical model developed originally for plants and algae ('resource-ratio theory') can be used to understand what determines the diversity and composition of the microbes that inhabit plant hosts. The data from these experiments will be used to understand when the predictions of the resource-ratio model apply to microbial communities and how it can be modified to make better predictions. A deeper understanding of the controls on microbial diversity will lead to more accurate predictions about microbes within hosts, which may speed advances in medicine and agriculture.The researchers will grow plants in conditions that vary in the supply of critical soil nutrients, and they will manipulate and measure the abundance and diversity of a group of plant viruses that cause one of the most widespread and devastating diseases of cereal crops worldwide (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses; B/CYDV's). Five B/CYD virus species will be used to test the resource-ratio model in a series of growth-chamber and field experiments. In each experiment, they will create a wide range of conditions experienced by the viruses by growing host plants under different resource (nitrogen and phosphorus) supply rates. The researchers will measure viral abundance (titer) within individuals, using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) for each virus grown alone and in mixture. They will use viral abundance measurements through time to estimate virus population growth rates. The resource-ratio model will be tested with lab experiments, in order to predict viral diversity in each host. The resource-ratio model will also be modified to include elements of the virus and host biology that could cause deviations from the classic theory, such as host defences against infection by microbes and microbial effects on host nutrient content. To test the relevance of this model to more complex natural communities, the researchers will collect data on B/CYDV titers in field experiments replicated at a local field site and in 30 grasslands spanning 5 continents."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Danelle Seymour is  Exploring the causes and consequences of rapid transposon evolution in grass genomes  The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California, Irvine and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Brandon Gaut.The most economically important crop species, including rice, maize, wheat, and barley are members of the grass family. The genomes of these species are extremely variable in size, and this is largely the result of rapid proliferation of mobile genetic elements, or transposons. While the genomic distribution of transposons in each species has been reported, the evolutionary forces that shape rapid, global changes in their distributions are unknown. This project aims to characterize the evolutionary forces that drive large changes in genome structure in eight grass species and whether such changes also have functional consequences. This project will provide the fellow with an evolutionary perspective important for connecting basic genomics research to plant phenotype, as well as the opportunity to provide long-term mentoring to undergraduates interested in genomics research.Transposons are insertional mutagens and host genomes have evolved mechanisms to mitigate their spread. Transposon silencing can reduce transcription of flanking endogenous genes, but the duration of these changes is unclear due to the rapid evolution of inserted sequences. Exploring the interplay between these two forces, transposon proliferation and host silencing of transposition, is central to understanding how plant genomes evolve. This research aims to characterize the extent that transposon proliferation impacts the evolution of host genomes and ultimately the host phenotype using a comparative phylogenetic approach focusing on eight grass species. First, a unified framework for transposon identification and annotation in all eight species will be developed which will serve as an important community resource. Next, this resource will be used to characterize the role of transposons in the evolution of gene expression. Using a phylogenetic approach, it is possible to characterize the duration of transposon-induced phenotypic changes, in this case gene expression, and the extent that such changes shape the evolution of gene expression networks in this important plant family."

Objective 2: Characterize temperature responses of four cereal grain crops using an exceptionally wide range of natural air temperatures that emphasize near-lethal high temperature regimes, and assess quantitative responses simulated by crop models. Objective 3: Develop proximal sensing approaches for field-based, high-throughput phenotyping for drought and heat tolerance, including sensor testing, vehicle design, and software for work flows and data analysis.  Approach: Process-based ecophysiological models are among the best tools for quantifying how crop genetics (G), growing environments (E) and management (M) interact to determine productivity as well as ancillary properties of crop production including net greenhouse gas sequestration or releases, nutrient runoff and leaching, and water use. Crop models are especially useful where climate uncertainty or geospatial variability are of prime concerns and where information is needed for scenarios that are not readily adduced from historical data or field experiments. Modeling analyses are constrained by the accuracy of the responses quantified in the models, and recent modeling intercomparisons have identified numerous weaknesses and areas of high uncertainty in widely-used crop models. Our research seeks to improve model accuracy via three interrelated activities.   Insights from genomics and molecular biology will be used to strengthen how processes are represented in crop models and how parameters are estimated for individual cultivars. We propose to use existing large crop performance datasets and recently available genetic data (e.g., the soybean “SoySNP50K” initiative) to improve models. The two target topics are temperature interactions with water deficits and with nitrogen and representation of genetically controlled differences in phenology.   Because semi-arid desert regions experience wide temperature ranges, intra- and inter-annual variations in ambient temperature provide a cost-effective means to obtain robust data across multiple cereal grain crops simultaneously. To refine modeled thermal responses of crops at higher temperatures, we will conduct a Thermal Regime Agronomic Cereal Experiment (TRACE) using sequential sowing dates that range from the normal, commercial December plantings to very late dates in April and May, with closer intervals between plantings. The genotypes will include hard red and durum wheat, barley and triticale. Sowing the four crop types (with four replicates) over 8 planting dates and 2 years will provide data from 256 genotype x air temperature conditions, with air temperatures ranging from -2 to 42°C. These data will be assembled and formatted in accordance with ICASA Version 2.0 standards and distributed to the AgMIP-wheat team for model intercomparisons and improvement.  Novel proximal sensing methods will be developed, assessed and applied in characterizing crop responses (phenotypes) to effects of G x E x M both in the context of crop genetics and crop management research. These activities include testing promising new sensors, refining data logging procedures, improving cart- and tractor-based vehicles, and promoting their application in field-based phenotyping via collaborations with other research programs."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial “rhizobacteria”, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or “gaps”, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.

Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems. Hypothesis: Dry bean genotypes interact with tillage management to affect yield performance under drought conditions.  Eight pinto bean genotypes with varying drought tolerance will be tested in a field previously sown to wheat. A split, split block with four replications with irrigation level the main plot, tillage level the split plot, and genotypes the split, split plot will be used. Irrigation will be manipulated to impose a terminal drought stress. Conventional tillage and strip tillage will treatments will both include use of a nonselective herbicide. Variables will include plant biomass, soil compaction, soil moisture, measures of plant stress and various yield components.    Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments.   Hypothesis a) Timing of herbicide application when available soil moisture and likelihood of precipitation is greater impacts weed control in chickpea.  Four herbicides will be tested at three application timings; 4 and 2 weeks prior to seeding chickpea, and post-plant, preemergence. Herbicide treatments will be replicated in a randomized complete block. Soil moisture will be monitored gravimetrically for 4 weeks after each application. Weed control and chickpea tolerance will be determined by taking weed counts and visual control ratings at 3 and 6 weeks after planting (WAP) and crop stand counts at 4 WAP, and chickpea seed yield.  Hypothesis b) Roller-packing impacts performance of pre-emergence herbicides in chickpea in dry soil conditions.  Four herbicide combinations applied post-plant, pre-emergence will be tested in chickpea with and without roller-packing. Experiments will be designed as a split block with herbicide as the main treatment and roller packer as the split treatment and each treatment replicated four times. Half of each plot will be roller-packed immediately after herbicide applications. Weed control and chickpea injury will be evaluated and visually compared to a non-treated check. Analysis of variance will be used to statistically separate treatment effects in all experiments.   Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Hypothesis: Rhizobacteria strains, soilborne pathogens and cultivar class significantly impact biological nitrogen fixation and yields of pea and chickpea genotypes.  The interactions between the root rot pathogen Fusarium solani, commercial rhizobacteria inoculants, and foliar applications of phosphorous acid, on nitrogen fixation and rhizobial colonization of the most popular dry pea cultivars grown in Washington and Idaho will be assessed in field and greenhouse trials. Plants will be evaluated for elemental content, plant height, dry shoot/root weight, root disease severity, nodulation and yield."

Some experiments will investigate only one or two nutrient or pathogen pathways, while others will be more comprehensive, including, for example, surface runoff, gaseous emission, and plant removal. Computer modeling will investigate the whole-farm system. Our research team also has a longer-term goal, which is to integrate information across experiments to more completely describe, quantify, model, and manage the entire dairy-farm for improved efficiency and sustainability. Achieving this goal will help ensure the existence of profitable, environmentally acceptable dairy farming for coming decades."

This is a major plant disease of small grains that has caused devastating crop losses for wheat and barley (~$2.7 billion between 1998-2001), where most of the damage has occurred in the Midwest. At the present time there is no satisfactory way of controlling FHB or inactivating the mycotoxins associated with this plant disease. Thus, there is a compelling need to find new solutions to this agricultural problem.Trichothecenes are remarkably stable to both temperature and changes in pH and as such persist through milling, baking, and brewing. This problem would be resolved in part if enzymes could be identified that irreversibly inactivate the trichothecenes. Excitingly, bacterial isolates have been discovered that contain several unknown activities that lead to destruction of the trichothecenes. The nature of the enzyme(s) responsible for inactivation of trichothecenes in these organisms is unknown, but clearly they have potential to revolutionize the treatment of contaminated grain and the development of new resistance traits in wheat and barley. The goal of this study is to identify enzymes that deepoxidate the trichothecenes implicated in FHB."

Specifically, our project uses state-of-the-art molecular profiling to simultaneously identify field-collected Fusarium fungi to species and to the toxin(s) produced (= chemotype). Fusarium head blight (FHB) affects wheat, barley and other small grain cereal crops. In addition to yield loss from reduced seed weight or failure to set seed altogether, the remaining crop may be downgraded due to mycotoxin production. Both the fungi responsible for FHB in North America, and the toxin produced by these fungi, are changing. Current GIPSA-approved rapid detection methods for Fusarium mycotoxins, used at point of sale, focus on one toxin, deoxynivalenol (DON), and are limited in their ability to detect and quantify related toxins. Therefore, it is crucial to know what toxins are present in which localities, to ensure that detection methods are adequate for the prevalent toxins.As the newly emerging chemotypesare less detectable with current methods, more toxic, increasing in range, and the pathogen isolates producing them cause more disease and produce more mycotoxins than the historically dominant strainongoing surveillance is key to timely deployment of appropriate and location-specific disease and mycotoxin management strategies."

The most important issues facing grain and livestock producers are preventing mycotoxin contamination of food and feed, and reducing the deleterious effects of mycotoxins on livestock. Mycotoxins in grains processed for biofuels becomes concentrated in the solid byproduct known as distillers grain (DG), thus mycotoxin contamination is also a major concern for producers of DG. For grain buyers and food processors, the primary need is a reliable method for rapid assessment of grain quality pertaining to mycotoxins and mycotoxigenic fungi. These stakeholders need cost-effective methods to predict, monitor, and minimize mycotoxin production in the field, and to detoxify mycotoxins. Our research focuses on several of the most important mycotoxins and the fungi that produce them. Fusarium graminearum causes a devastating disease in wheat, barley and corn (Fusarium Head Blight-FHB). The impact of this disease on human and animal health is primarily due to production of mycotoxins by the fungus, which then contaminate grain. Our work focuses on understanding how and why the fungus infects these grains, how it survives through the winter, and how it reinfects in the spring. Barley malt is crucial for the beer industry, so we are studying FHB toxin development especially in barley. We use studies of gene expression and genetic manipulation to determine what factors are important to the fungal life cycle. An assay system using a model plant species has helped define genes that enhance resistance to FHB, which have been selected for introduction into wheat and barley and which will then be tested for improved FHB resistance in the field. In genetically modifiable animal model systems, we are working to define which processes mycotoxins interfere with; this approach can be used to screen for compounds that protect against FHB-related mycotoxins. In the southeastern region of the United States, the infection of maize by A. flavus, producing aflatoxin (AF) is a chronic problem because commercial maize hybrids are generally susceptible. Significant levels of resistance to the fungus have been bred into some inbred maize lines such as Mp313E and Mp715. However, the resistance, controlled by many genes, must be integrated into commercial maize lines to improve corn production. Our research will speed up molecular-marker aided resistance breeding. We are also involved in the identification of corn metabolites inhibiting A. flavus propagation in the rachis (corn cob). We study fungal dispersal and AF production, with a focus on a fungus-specific regulator VelB. This project will test its central role by identifying genes that it controls and defining associated gene networks related to fungal growth and AF production. VelB may be an excellent broad-spectrum anti-fungal target. Another fungal virulence factor we study is LaeA; its signaling pathways are important in fungal pathogenicity and A. flavus receptor targets that impede aflatoxin synthesis are being investigated. Our project&#39;s cooperative efforts are intended to accelerate progress in understanding mycotoxigenic fungal biology to facilitate diminishing fungal hazards to our food supply."

In recent years, the presence of mycotoxins in the solid byproduct of grains processed for biofuels, known as distillers grain (DG), has also become an important issue. The sale of DGs for animal feed has become an important source of supplemental income for biofuel producers. For grain buyers and food processors, the primary need is a reliable method for rapid assessment of grain quality pertaining to mycotoxins and mycotoxigenic fungi. Rapid methods to detect mycotoxins at the first points of sale (elevators), as well as methods to detect mycotoxigenic fungi in the commodity (e.g. DON-producing Fusarium in barley), would prevent these stakeholders from purchasing corn contaminated with unacceptable levels of aflatoxins and fumonisins, or wheat with excessive concentrations of deoxynivalenol (DON), e.g. Additionally, cost-effective methods to predict, monitor, and minimize mycotoxin production in the field, and to detoxify mycotoxins and prevent further deterioration in contaminated feed, are needed by producers of grain and livestock. The lowering of tolerance limits for mycotoxins in overseas markets has increased the burden for grain buyers and food processors; currently, levels of mycotoxins that are acceptable for some US products are unacceptable in European and Asian markets, resulting in non-tariff trade barriers. New methods to monitor and treat contaminated grain would benefit domestic consumers, and would also allow American commodities to compete more effectively in foreign markets. Finally, workers who are responsible for animal and human health need information about the toxicity, carcinogenicity, modes of action, and biomarkers of exposure and disease for all categories of mycotoxins. This information would be used to train health-care providers to identify exposure and treat related disease, as well as to develop accurate risk assessment recommendations.The importance of the work, and consequences if it is not doneMycotoxins are a serious, chronic problem throughout the cereal- and forage- producing regions of the U.S. (e.g., see http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=JEysXbJisf0). If research is not applied broadly to address this problem, serious negative consequences will result. First, the presence of mycotoxins is an important health hazard. Accurate hazard assessments are essential in order to maintain exposures by animal and human consumers within safe limits. We propose basic research to define the toxicity of several important mycotoxins. Without this information, it is impossible to assess the risks associated with these mycotoxins. Additionally, the presence of mycotoxins in grain is an economic concern, especially in the context of global markets. Without an aggressive research program to prevent, treat, and contain outbreaks of mycotoxins in grain, U.S. grain producers suffer the consequences of reduced marketability of their products. Furthermore, the proposed research addresses biosecurity concerns. The natural occurrence of mycotoxins in grain is an important security concern for producers and end-users of the grain; mycotoxins have been used as agents of terrorism, e.g. aflatoxin in Iraq. Without a proactive research program to find innovative ways to monitor, prevent, and treat mycotoxin contamination of grains and forage, US agriculture will be unprepared to deal effectively with a mycotoxin outbreak, regardless of its origin. Finally, the production of mycotoxins by mycotoxigenic fungi in grains and forage represents a continuing problem in agriculture. Improving our understanding of factors relevant to allowing these fungi to colonize their hosts, and how mycotoxin biosynthesis is regulated, will not only lead to novel treatment strategies, but will also advance our understanding of fungal pathogenesis in general."

These crops have undergone very strong selection pressure from the time of early domestication through today&#39;s modern plant breeding, resulting in the loss of valuable genetic diversity. Moreover, cultivation of genetically uniform crops over vast acreages has lead to catastrophic losses due to plant disease epidemics, insect outbreaks, and various abiotic stresses such as drought. This lack of crop diversity, coupled with changes in climate, present new and serious constraints for cereal production. To feed the world&#39;s burgeoning population, plant scientists must increase the food supply by at least 50% within the next half century. This increase must come largely from the genetic improvement of food crops since the world&#39;s agricultural land base is shrinking and inputs such as fertilizer and water have become more costly. Biotic (diseases and insects) abiotic (drought, heat, and salinity) stresses are the most important constraints to sustainable cereal production worldwide. Deployment of cultivars with resistance/tolerance to biotic/abiotic stresses is a sound means for ameliorating such production losses. The wild relatives of wheat and barley are known to be rich sources of disease resistance and also many other traits contributing to crop productivity, nutritional value, and adaptation. Thus, our long-term goal is the improvement of small grain cereals with genes derived from wild progenitor species. This research will facilitate the development of cereal cultivars with higher yield, multiple disease resistance, greater stress tolerance and enhanced quality traits, thereby increasing the productivity, profitability and sustainability of small grain production in Minnesota and other parts of the world."

The pesticide industry lacks financial incentives to support registrations for these specialty crops. They have concerns about reduced return on their registration investment due to lower acreages, and liability associated with product stewardship. Many of the pesticide products do not have sufficient crop safety and performance data, for these specialty crops. Idaho has always played a major role in specialty crop production, with crops such as malt barley, dry beans, dry bulb onions, dry peas and chickpeas, table and wine grapes, hops, lentils, mint, seed crops, sweet corn, teff, and tree fruits. Idaho ranks 19th overall in agricultural products sold.Several organophosphate and carbamate pesticides have been cancelled or have new reduced usage patterns due to residue concerns, worker protection concerns, or lack of registrant support to supply additional data. Many Idaho commodities are dependent upon these pesticides for their pest management needs. Other concerns with pest management tools may be pesticide resistance, impacts to pollinators, and lack of diverse mode of action. In Idaho and many western states, most specialty crops only have one or two choices for pest control options. The loss of one or both pesticide tools could result in crop devastation. Production costs will increase due to changes in agronomic practices, and may disrupt production of these specialty crops. This disruption in production could also have impacts to society in the lack of affordable, diversified and nutritious foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables, so important to a healthy diet.It is important that the Idaho IR-4 program continue to support the development of specialty crop pesticide registrations for Idaho and Pacific Northwest producers."

Research has shown that weed competition reduces crop yields by using irrigation water and other resources such as nitrogen and light. This competition occurs in perennial tree (e.g., pecans, pistachios and lemons), shrub (e.g., guayule), vine and annual crops planted in rows (e.g., cotton, chili peppers and corn), and in annual and perennial broadcast planted crops (e.g., alfalfa, lesquerella, wheat and barley). In western rangeland, riparian areas and wild lands, invasive species change fire ecology, displace native species and reduce the productivity of managed landscapes. Buffelgrass invasion of the Sonoran Desert and potential conversion to savanna grassland, Russian knapweed invasion of cropland and pastures leading to abandonmentand invasion of riparian habitats by saltcedar are examples of invasive species impacts in Arizona. Tools that can be used to manage weeds in Arizona&#39;s irrigated crops include cultural practices, biological control, tillage and herbicides but in range, riparian and wild landscapes, herbicides and biological control agents are often the only management tools available. An additional aspect of managing invasive species is the restoration of degraded sites after treatment to control the invasive plants.Arizona crop producers and land managers (e.g., ranchers, National Forest Service, National Park Service, BLM and NRCS) benefit from the development and registration of new herbicides and new uses of older herbicides. They benefit from research that develops new management strategies because weed and invasive species populations change in response to changes in land use patterns, cultural practices and climate variation and change. This project will investigate weed management in cropland, rangeland and wild landscapes using herbicides and other technology and will prioritize projects based on need, available collaborators and availability of funding sources to support research. General themes will be the investigation of new herbicide technology in crops, development of weed management programs including strategies that delay the risk of developing herbicide resistant weed populations and the management of invasive species.The objectives of this project are to evaluate new herbicide technologies to determine their efficacy on target weedy and invasive species under local environmental conditions and determine the herbicide tolerance of crops and other plant species in non-crop landscapes where appropriate. Each year a research decision matrix will be assembled ranking the target species, crops, herbicides, herbicide application methods and uses, potential for funding and potential impact of the research on Arizona&#39;s agricultural and natural resource based economy. Potential projects are discussed with commodity groups, government (e.g., USDA, BLM, and Forest Service) personnel and academic and industry scientists, often at scientific or Extension meetings, and attempts are made to secure funding for the projects. The herbicides and crops investigated change from year to year although most of the projects are multi-year in duration with an annual funding cycle. The general procedure for conducting the research outlined in this project is to establish small and large scale research plots on University of Arizona experiment stations and in commercial pecan, chili pepper, guayule fields and research plots on private, federal and state lands with cooperating ranchers and agency personnel. The experiments will be replicated using standard experimental designs (e.g., completely random in greenhouse experiments and randomized complete block, factorial and split-plot designs in field experiments).The broad goal of this project is to facilitate the development of new crops, improve weed management and increase plant yields thereby directly increasing productivity. Indirect effects include improving the economic status of Arizonan&#39;s involved in various plant production industries in rural Arizona and sustaining rural economies."

Programmed cell death is best defined as genetically encoded, actively controlled cellular suicide. Programmed cell death is of fundamental importance in plant development. For example, xylem cells undergo programmed cell death and create an interconnected network of hollow tubes essential for water transport. Despite its importance, developmentally regulated programmed cell death is far less understood than processes like cell division and differentiation (reviewed in Van Hautegem et al., 2015).In the grasses, programmed cell death has a particular role to play in floral development. Maize flowers are initially hermaphroditic, but become either male or female through differential organ abortion. In male flowers, the female floral organs (the carpels) stop growing after they have formed, and eventually undergo programmed cell death. Programmed cell death in the carpels of the male maize floret is partially under the control of the transcription factor grassy tillers1. In gt1 mutants, the carpels in male flowers do not abort completely (Whipple et al.; Bartlett et al., 2015). However, gt1 mutant flowers are not fully hermaphroditic, indicating the existence of other genes that act with gt1 to regulate carpel abortion and programmed cell death. Which other genes are involved in carpel abortion? How do they interact with known sex determination genes in maize?We have designed a series of genetic experiments geared at answering these questions. We will use mutant analysis to investigate whether gt1 is part of known sex determination pathways in maize. In addition, we have isolated four maize mutants where the gt1 mutant phenotype is strongly enhanced and programmed cell death in male flowers is disrupted. Using genetic and genomic tools, we will identify the genes that have been disrupted in these mutants, and work to determine their precise roles in mediating growth repression and programmed cell death.Surprisingly, gt1-like genes control growth repression and organ abortion not only in maize, but also in barley (a grass distantly related to maize) (Komatsuda et al., 2007), and even in persimmons (separated from grasses by more than 200 million years) (Akagi et al., 2014). In maize, barley, and persimmons, gt1- like genes are associated with the development of sterile or male flowers. However, sterile or male flowers have evolved separately in each lineage. Have gt1-like genes been repeatedly deployed throughout evolution to mediate floral sexuality? We will explore the expression of gt1-like genes in grass flowers from species spanning grass diversity.This sex determination project is uniquely suited for the Hatch program because it has the potential to considerably advance our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of grass development, while at the same time having transformative applications for crop design. Once we understand how growth repression is controlled in maize and other grasses, there is the potential for deactivating and activating growth repression at will, and drastically increasing cereal productivity. For example, rice flowers are hermaphroditic, which makes generating hybrid rice challenging. Targeted regulation of floral organ abortion has the potential to jump start hybrid rice breeding. Indeed, gt1-like genes were the targets of selection by ancient agronomists in both barley and maize [Komatsuda, 2007 #2179;Whipple, 2011 #2928;Wills, 2013 #3443]. As modern plant scientists, we can use our understanding of the genes and gene networks controlling plant development for rational crop design."

While these commodities are grown over a vast area, specific geographic areas face unique challenges to the successful production of these crops. This requires that new varieties be evaluated under local conditions in order to identify which materials are best adapted to a given region.In western Montana, particular attention must be paid to indentify varieties with improved resistance to lodging, and foliar diseases. While these issues are not unique to western Montana, these traits have historically had a significant economic impact on both grain yield and quality in this area. In addition, an insect pest called the orange wheat blossom midge, has recently become a serious production issue in northwestern Montana.The initial outbreak of the orange wheat blossom midge reduced spring wheat yields by more than 90 percent. It is therefore critical that efforts now be directed to identifying spring wheat varieties with resistance against this new insect pest.Winter wheat, spring wheat, and barley nurseries will be established to evaluate promising new materials for adaptability in western Montana, with emphasis on those traits which locally impact grain yield and quality. Special efforts will focus on identifying spring wheat varieties with resistance to the orange wheat blossom midge and in developing ways to improve the expression of the resistant trait. The identification of varieties with improved resistance to the midge, foliar disease, Fusarium head blight, and lodging will improve economic conditions in western Montana. Moreover, the results of these efforts should provide benefits where ever these same production issues occur."

During 2015 South Dakota was ranked 7th in the U.S. for soybeanproduction (235,520,000 bushels), 6th for wheat production (103,406,000 bushels), and 1st forsunflower production (1,230,040,000 lbs). When the annual production of these crops is compared between 2013 and 2015 there was a 12% increase for soybean, a 9.7% increase for wheat, and a 21% increase for sunflower (NASS 2016). As the harvested acres and observed yields of soybean, wheat, and sunflower continue to increase, there is also an increased need for improved management recommendations for the insect pests of these crops. One strategy that has been employed is the use of insecticide seed treatments, and as a result their use in South Dakota has been steadily increasing (USGS 2016). Soybean, wheat, and sunflower productivity is often negatively affected by early season soil dwelling and also foliar feeding insect pests. Due to a limited selection of products available for management of these insect pests, and the systemic nature and ease of use associated with insecticide seed treatments, they are often used for insectmanagement. The insecticide active ingredients used for seed treatments for soybean, wheat, andsunflower are exclusively neonicotinoids.Insecticide seed treatments are used on approximately 31% of soybean acres across the U.S., however, it is believed that in areas of the Midwest they are used on as much as 73% of the planted soybean acres (Douglas and Tooker 2015). Although these insecticide products are applied to seed that is planted on millions of acres of cropland there are limited use recommendations available, and as a result they are often used prophylactically (Douglas and Tooker 2015). Concerns regarding the value of insecticide seed treatments for soybean in the Midwest have been a topic of discussion since 2014 when a report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was released. The Biological and Economic Analysis Division (BEAD) of the EPA determined that the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments in soybean most likely provided farmers with a $0/acre benefit, and at most $6/acre benefit (EPA 2014). However, an analysis of the same data by AgInformatics, LLC determined that the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments provide a net yield benefit of 2.8%(approximately $10.60/acre) when compared to untreated soybean (Mitchell 2014). In their report, the EPA BEAD also stated that according to surveys of soybean farmers the insect pests that were being managed through the use of insecticide seed treatments included soybean aphids and bean leaf beetles (EPA 2014). Although they are major commodities, there is limited data available regarding the use of insecticide seed treatments for wheat and sunflower production.Identifying early season above-ground insect pests is relatively easy, and relies on observing the insect or signs of defoliation. However, identification of belowground insect pests can be difficult and as a result they are often overlooked and ignored. The early season insect pests associated with soybean include wireworm, seedcorn maggots, white grubs, and bean leaf beetles (Bailey et al. 2015). Early season pests of both spring and winter wheat include bird cherry oat aphid, English grain aphid, greenbug, Hessian fly, and wireworms (Dyer at al. 2012, Hunger et al. 2012). An additional concern, aside from yield losses due to direct feeding is that the three aphid species that feed on wheat are also competent vectors of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). Exploration of the impact of insecticide seed treatments on the incidence of BYDV in wheat is necessary. For sunflower, early season insect pests include wireworms, seedcorn maggots, striped flea beetle, and sunflower beetle (Knodel and Charlet 2007). While this list does account for bean leaf beetles as an early season pest, it does not account for soybean aphids due to their late season arrival in soybean. The contradiction between the EPA&#39;s survey data and the known early season insect pests of soybean are likely due to a lack of extension and outreach from state universities. Also, if this discrepancy exists for one crop such as soybean, it likely exists for other crops including wheat and sunflower. Although insecticide seed treatments are labeled for wheat and sunflower there is limited data available regarding their efficacy and benefit to farmers in the U.S., and especially in South Dakota.Therefore, it is critical that the use of insecticide seed treatments is explored in soybean, wheat and sunflower in South Dakota to determine their benefit for farmers. In addition, for each crop itwill also be imperative to explore factors (e.g., planting date, seeding density, soil type, weatherconditions) to determine when insecticide seed treatments provide the greatest economic benefit to farmers. Through these efforts, management recommendations for insecticideuse on soybean, wheat, and sunflower will be developed."

Rather than exporting raw grain farmers and rural communities in Montana (and other states with significant small grains production) would benefit significantly from value added grain based manufacturing. In Montana feed barley is an important rotation crop for wheat especially in dry land cropping systems but production has declined due to lack of markets. Principals with Montana BioAgriculture Inc. (MBAI) developed a patented biological process to produce 60% protein concentrates from barley and working with USDA ARS developed potential markets as a protein ingredient in aquaculture feeds. Commercializing barley protein concentrate (BPC) would create a significant new market for barley and increase employment in rural communities. The process has been scaled up and currently operates at 500 ton/year BPC in a large pilot facility. The BPC process as currently operated produces ethanol as a co-product. However the price of ethanol has been volatile and declined significantly with the drop in oil prices. MBAI sees an opportunity to increase protein production and integrate organic acids and beta glucans as more valuable co-products. Multiple co-products independent of volatile energy prices would make this technology much more economically resilient and ensure long term benefits to farmers and rural communities.In the current process design yeast are used to ferment sugars from carbohydrate hydrolysis to ethanol. In the proposed project, yeast would be replaced with selected fungi to produce both high protein cell mass and organic acids with value as bio-based chemicals. Beta glucans in the barley will also be recovered. Proof of concept for the phase 1 project is to design and test at lab scale an overall process integrating increased protein, organic acids and beta glucan production with the BPC process. Specific objectives and work plan will: 1) Select a fungal strain, design process for increased protein and organic acid production 2) Design beta glucan recovery process 3) Design and test integrated process and determine product yields 4) Evaluate different barley varieties for superior characteristics in the process 5) Assess BPC co-product economics and benefits to the rural economy of North Central Montana. Phase II will scale the process in the existing pilot plant to design process integration in the commercial plant."

We will assemble stakeholders from throughout the organic barley value chain in order to identify opportunities and challenges for a new form of the world&#39;s oldest crop: naked (hull-less) barley. Our long term goal is to provide organic growers, processors, and consumers with a crop, food, and raw material alternative that will be economically rewarding. Currently, organic barley end-uses and markets are stratified due the presence of the adhering hull and grain &beta;-glucan content. Varieties intended for malting/brewing have hulls and low &beta;-glucan due to prevalent brewing techniques. There are brewing technology solutions that allow for capitalizing on the significant advantages of naked barley, provided it has a moderate level of &beta;-glucan. The hull precludes direct food use: it must be removed by pearling, and this process makes the grain ineligible for whole grain status. Therefore, food varieties should be naked, but if they have been bred for high &beta;-glucan content they will be unsuitable for malting and feed. A moderate level of &beta;-glucan can be achieved that will meet FDA guidelines for soluble dietary fiber in human diets and make varieties suitable for brewing and animal feed. Organic feed barley commands a premium, and naked varieties capitalize on this advantage. Our outreach objectives will be to familiarize growers, processors and consumers with the benefits and challenges of naked varieties and to provide guidance for capitalizing on the advantages these varieties offer can offer."

Our goal is to evaluate alternative integrated pest management (IPM) tactics for wireworms in cereal crops that would allow growers to reduce their use of prophylactic seed-applied neonicotinoids in cereal crops. We will achieve three complementary objectives: (1) Investigate the use of entomopathogenic pathogens as a complement or replacement to neonicotinoid seed treatments in wheat and barley crops; (2) Examine whether the use of pesticides in rotational legume crops provides benefits for wireworm control in subsequent cereal crops; and (3) Develop an extension program focused on wireworms. Overall, our project will develop new tactics for wireworms that are cost-effective and targeted for specific species and environmental conditions. Our research could have broad applicability beyond cereals as the resurgence of wireworms is a matter of national concern, with over 45 crops affected. Our project addresses three CPPM Focus Areas: (1)  Plant Protection Tactics  (by developing IPM tactics for a major crop pest); (2)  Diversified IPM Systems  (by evaluating IPM strategies that integrate biological, cultural, and insecticidal controls); and (3)  Developing the Next Generation of IPM Scientists  (by training two MS students in IPM tactics and extension)."

The long-term goal of this project is to understand the molecular basis of disease in cereal grain crops, with a focus on an important fungal disease of barley. A basic understanding of how pathogens cause disease is a critical part of developing crops with enhanced resistance. While many diseases can be controlled through the use of pesticides, genetic resistance remains the safest and most attractive method for pathogen control. However, our current lack of knowledge of how fungal pathogens manipulate plant cells during infection is a major hurdle to developing resistant crops. Ultimately, results from this project can be used in crop breeding programs to improve disease resistance in agriculture. This research is a fundamental step towards making crops able to fight off new and emerging pathogen threats. This is an important part of ensuring our nation&#39;s food security while protecting the environment.Plant pathogens use virulence proteins to manipulate host cells during infection. One goal of this project is to understand how these virulence proteins function by identifying which proteins they interact with once inside the plant cell. Host proteins are likely targeted by the pathogen because they control some aspect of plant resistance or susceptibility. Another goal of this research is to quantify key cellular changes that occur within resistant and susceptible plants during pathogen infection. Changes in protein levels will be incorporated into a global model that can predict key genes that control plant immunity. These models will be validated by testing genes for their role in plant resistance and/or susceptibility. Completion of the project will open a window into the cereal immune system and identify weak points (i.e. proteins targeted by the pathogen) that can be pursued in breeding programs for enhanced disease resistance. This research will lead to improvement of barley genetic stocks and there is high likelihood that knowledge gained will be easily transferred to other important cereals such as wheat."

In dryland conditions, current barley varieties have an increased risk of rejection due to poor malt quality, resulting in a significant economic loss to farmers of more than half of the potential crop value. Therefore, growers are often reluctant to plant malting barley due to the increased risk, resulting in an unstable malt barley supply for end-users, which will only increase with climate change. In addition, &#39;all-malt&#39; brewing is a new focus in the beer industry, requiring unique quality traits compared to adjunct-malt brewing, which utilizes additional grains. Currently, most barley breeding is focused on adjunct-brewing, and few efforts exist to improve dryland production. Thus, breeding for all-malt brewing requires a cooperative effort to facilitate this growing sector. Here, we propose a three-year project to establish the RMMBC, bringing together growers, maltsters, brewers and researchers to develop barley varieties adapted to dryland farming with quality traits that facilitate all-malt brewing. The outcomes of this cooperative include (i) the establishment of an academic-industry partnership to design breeding and research priorities for Rocky Mountain barley growers (ii) increased stability for malting quality traits produced in dryland agriculture and (iii) the development of new varieties with enhanced quality for flavor and flavor stability. This cooperative will also facilitate regional production of malt for brewing in the Rocky Mountain region."

The goal of this project is to develop nanomaterials which can positively enhance plant growth, disease resistance, and crop yields with no or minimal impacts on the environment. Use of crops (e.g., barley) for nanoparticle production that can be used in agriculture to deliver nutrients and pesticides will provide farmers with better agronomic tools for more efficient production with less cost inputs. The research findings will address some of the engineering grand challenges (nitrogen cycling, better medicine, and clean water) as the ENMs developed here can also be used in environmental clean-up and drug delivery. ENMs and plant-borne polyphenols are extensively used in medical science and the proposed research will contribute to better delivery and curative materials in the long run. Two graduate students and one undergraduate student will be trained in this interdisciplinary project. The outreach programs proposed in rural North Dakota schools, with a focus on reaching female students, will broaden these students' participation in science providing them with an understanding of the relationship between science and technology as well as help them relate these to the agri-based societal issues (e,g., pest control in crops). The outreach programs are expected to inspire them to consider STEM education and careers. This is of paramount importance for North Dakota as the state is experiencing decline in STEM students. The educational materials developed for high school chemistry and biology laboratory classes can be adopted across the country and beyond.The long-term goals of this research proposal are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ENM induced physiological reprogramming of plant innate immunity that results in both enhanced and compromised resistance to microbial pathogens. Then use this knowledge to engineer nanomaterial that retain beneficial attributes (i.e., fertilizer and fungicide delivery) while mitigating negative impacts. Within the project period, this interdisciplinary (Engineering and Plant Pathology) research will address issues immediately related to food security. The project will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that determine the interactions of nanomaterials with plants. This knowledge is pivotal in our ability to engineer ENMs for agricultural uses that have positive attributes while evading unwanted negative impacts on yield, quality, and agricultural- and natural-ecosystems. The research proposed on nanomaterial synthesis will lead to the understanding of the mechanism of ENM formation using plant extracts, specifically polyphenols. It will further lead to the development of ENMs, which will have multiple benefits to plants and other ecosystem components (e.g., rhizosphere bacteria). Thus, the specific goals of the project are: (1) characterize the variability of physiological reprogramming in response to different classes of ENMs; (2) resolve the mechanisms by which ENMs interact with the extracellular matrix and/or cell surface receptor complexes resulting in the perception of non-self, eliciting or suppressing immunity responses; and (3) develop nanomaterials utilizing plant-borne polyphenols and plant-based decorations to maintain or enhance positive physiological responses while mitigating negative responses."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. This award supports a collaboration between an anthropologist and a soil and crop scientist to investigate several lost crops - plants that were cultivated by Indigenous people in Eastern North America (ENA) for several thousand years, but which fell out of use hundreds of years ago. When the indigenous foods of ENA are invoked, most people imagine maize, beans, and squash - the bountiful harvest spilling out of the archetypal Thanksgiving cornucopia. These crops, also known as the Three Sisters, were historically grown together by Indigenous people across ENA by the time European colonization began. But maize, beans, and many squash varieties (including pumpkins and closely related varieties) were not domesticated in ENA, nor were they a part of its earliest agricultural system. These plants were obtained through trade from Mexico then adapted by eastern farmers to local conditions by around AD 1000 (later for beans). For thousands of years before, beginning in the Late Archaic period around 3800 years ago, ancient farmers in ENA cultivated a group of native seed crops. These pre-maize crops are referred to as the Eastern Agricultural Complex (EAC). They are a botanically diverse group that includes familiar crops that are still widely grown, such as sunflower and acorn squash, as well as lost crops that are native North American relatives of barley, quinoa, and canary grass, among others. Most of the EAC crops fell out of cultivation before the arrival of European chroniclers and are not recalled in the oral traditions of Indigenous descendent communities, leaving many questions about how they were cultivated. The objective of this research is to study the living progenitors of these crops in the wild and under cultivation in order to better understand the deep history of North America and the dynamics of human-plant co-evolution in general. In addition to these research goals, this project expands the Lost Crops Garden Network, a collaboration among several anthropologists using experimental gardens as tools for experiential learning and research. Several of the EAC crops are now endangered by increased herbicide use and invasive weeds. This project documents the locations of remaining populations of lost crops, an important first step towards conserving a group of plants that have the potential to be re-domesticated and commercialized. One of the key activities funded by this award is the creation of a seed bank, which will facilitate further experimental studies by providing correctly sourced and viable seed to other researchers. These plants were important crops for millennia. With further study and improvement, they have the potential to enhance the food and economic security of contemporary farmers.This project 1) establishes the current range and habitat of EAC crop progenitors and assesses their conservation needs; 2) creates an institutionalized seed bank for EAC crop seeds; 3) studies the effects of different cultivation techniques and environmental factors on plant phenotypes and yield; 4) investigates the role of developmental plasticity and epigenetics in plant domestication; and 5) establishes an accurate range of yield estimates for each crop. This research creates interpretative links between morphologies and/or ancient DNA attributes of archaeobotanical specimens and the agricultural practices that created and maintained them. By doing so, it also 1) helps bridge the gap between historically and ethnographically recorded maize-based agriculture, and the unknown EAC agricultural system that preceded and gave rise to it; and 2) contributes to the study of social change in the eventful last 500 years prior to European colonization, an era which saw the rise of maize agriculture, structural inequality, and regional political confederacies. Globally, this project contributes to an emerging body of research on the role of developmental plasticity and epigenetics in domestication, in particular, and in evolutionary biology in general. Growth experiments will measure the effects of the agroecosystem on plants' development and reproduction, allowing the construction of more accurate optimal foraging models that take into account the immediate effects of cultivation and environmental engineering. This project also explores the epigenetic effects of DNA methylation on crop morphology. Comparative methylome sequencing of control and experimental plants can be used to identify epigenetic signals underpinning phenotypic effects. DNA methylation survives in ancient tissues, so the ancient DNA of archaeobotanical specimens can be used to assess the influence of epigenetics in the domestication process. This research requires an interdisciplinary effort, while also providing training that will enable its recipient to make an experimental approach to the study of ancient agriculture central to her future research and teaching."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California, Riverside and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Daniel Koenig. Barley is the world's fourth most important grain crop, and is unusually robust to a diversity of environmental stresses earning the moniker, the crop at the edge of the desert. Understanding the genetic basis of crop performance in variable environments is imperative, but long-term studies translating genotype to phenotype are exceedingly rare. To fill this gap, the genetic basis of local adaptation will be explored in a near century long agricultural experiment, the barley composite cross II (CCII). The CCII was initiated in the 1920's and has been allowed to adapt to the local conditions in Davis, CA for over 50 generations. With this unique resource, cutting edge high-throughput phenotype and genotype characterization methods will be employed to elucidate the genetic basis of agricultural performance.  The ultimate goal of this study is to predict successful genotypes in variable environmental conditions. Thriving during climatic extremes will minimize potential food insecurity arising from environmental factors. This project will focus on the characterization of 1000 individuals drawn from four time points in the CCII experiment to elucidate the effect of local selective pressures on phenotype and genotype. Phenotypic data will be collected at three resolutions: single time point measurements of whole plant and inflorescence traits, temporal growth rate measurements using webcam monitoring, and inflorescence 3D renderings using CT scanning. Using a combination of genome-wide SNP discovery and ascertainment strategies, adaptive shifts in phenotype will be linked to specific genetic changes. The results of this project will be shared with the general public through multiple outreach programs, increasing the understanding of how crops adapt to changing environments."

Stripe rust of barley can cause significant yield loss in the western U.S. The long-term goal of this project is to reduce losses in wheat and barley yield and quality caused by stripe rust and assure stable, sustainable production while protecting the environment. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding virulence compositions of the pathogen population, identification of new sources of resistance, disease forecasting, and control of the disease using fungicides in recent years. However, more research is needed to monitor dynamic changes of virulent races, obtain better knowledge of resistance genes in elite germplasm, to identify more genes for effective resistance, and to develop molecular markers for use in the efficient incorporation of new genes into wheat and barley cultivars. For the next five years, we will conduct research to achieve the following objectives: 1). Use molecular markers and host plant responses to characterize and differentiate current and emergent virulent races of the stripe rust pathogens of wheat and barley. 2). Determine the distribution, nature, and effectiveness of host plant resistance genes amongst elite wheat and barley germplasm. 3). Identify and determine linkage relationships of new major and minor stripe rust resistance genes, and develop molecular markers for application in wheat and barley breeding efforts. Accomplishment of these objectives will lead to improved knowledge of the disease epidemiology, more resistance genes and germplasm, and more effective technology to achieve sustainable control of stripe rust."

Fusarium head blight (FHB) has been ranked as one of the greatest threats to the production of wheat and barley.  This project is focused on identifying the wheat genes with essential functions in FHB resistance.  This will be accomplished using a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay which can down-regulate, or knockdown the expression of chosen genes so that their function can be inferred from the phenotypic change.  This functional assay for genes involved in FHB resistance has been validated and a key role for genes in the ethylene-signaling pathway has already been established.  In the next 5 years of work, we will conduct an in depth survey for genes functioning in FHB resistance, and determine if these genes can be used to engineer improved levels of FHB resistance.   Objective 1:  Determine if over-expression of genes involved in the ethylene signaling pathway can confer improved resistance to Fusarium head blight in wheat.   Objective 2: Determine whether pathogen recognition receptors have essential roles in Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat.    Objective 3: Test if elevated expression of pathogen recognition receptors can be used to improve resistance to Fusarium head blight and other fungal pathogens of wheat.    Objective 4: Determine expression of genes in floral tissue from FHB resistant and susceptible wheat genotypes as they respond to challenge by Fusarium graminearum.  Subobjectives 4A and 4B: A. Employ VIGS to test if the candidate genes identified in the RNA-seq survey encode proteins with functions that are critical for FHB resistance in wheat.  B.  If new genes encoding functions essential for FHB resistance are identified initiate transgenic studies to test if they can be used to improve FHB resistance."

Evaluate wheat, oat and barley germplasm from U.S. breeding programs for rust resistance. Sub-objective 3.B. Identify and characterize new sources of rust resistance in wheat, barley, and oat.   The proposed research objectives are central to the mission of the USDA ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory (CDL): to reduce losses in wheat, oat, and barley to major diseases using host resistance. Research is focused on genetic variation in both the host cereals and their rust pathogens that determine the resistance/susceptible phenotype of the interaction. Isolates of rust fungi obtained from annual surveys of the wheat, barley, and oat crops are used to inform the breeding process. Successful control of cereal rusts with host resistance cannot be achieved without knowledge of variation in cereal rust populations. Studies of virulence and molecular variation in cereal rust populations can answer questions that range from the applied, such as which host resistance genes are effective against the current rust population and what resistance genes are in current cereal cultivars, to more basic questions like what are the origins of new races and how do they spread. Discovery of the molecular determinants of pathogenesis and obligate biotrophy in cereal rust fungi via genomic approaches offers intriguing leads in the development of novel resistance mechanisms. Identification, characterization, and introgression of new host resistance to cereal rusts are key to increasing the diversity of resistance genes in our cereals and staying ahead of these   shifty   pathogens."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments. Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.

Therefore, this project has the following objectives for the next five years:   Objective 1: Monitor and characterize stripe rust pathogen populations for providing essential information to growers for implementing appropriate measures to reduce damage on wheat and barley.   Subobjective 1A: Identify virulent races of stripe rust pathogens to determine effectiveness of resistance genes in wheat and barley.  Subobjective 1B: Develop molecular markers and characterize stripe rust pathogen populations to identify factors and mechanisms of pathogen dynamics for developing new management strategies.   Objective 2: Enhance resistance in wheat and barley cultivars for sustainable control of stripe rusts.   Subobjective 2A: Identify and map new genes for stripe rust resistance, and develop new germplasm for use in breeding programs. Subobjective 2B: Screen breeding lines for supporting breeding programs to develop wheat and barley cultivars with adequate and durable resistance to stripe rust.   Accomplishment of these objectives will lead to improved knowledge of the disease epidemiology for developing more effective control strategies, more resistance genes and resistant germplasm to be used by breeders to develop stripe rust resistant wheat and barley cultivars, and more effective technology to be used by wheat and barley growers to achieve sustainable control of stripe rust."

The European Union Scientific Panel onContaminants in the Food Chain concluded that a consistent relationship between the alkaloidconcentration in the sclerotia and total ergot alkaloid concentration could not be established(EFSA 2005). No country has limits for individual ergot alkaloids in food or feed. Several recentfactors have increased ergot invasion in crops, including no-till farming practices leaving thevegetation and ergot sclerotia on the soil surface for increased infection rates, the move toorganic farming and avoiding fungicides, and the dramatic weather patterns with huge rainfallsthat enhance increased Claviceps purpurea invasion of cereals and grasses in thespring/summer.No US veterinary diagnostic laboratory is providing a validated ergot alkaloid analysis of cerealgrains and grasses by LC/MS/MS for the main Claviceps ergot alkaloids, the ergopeptines (-ines, biologically active) include ergotamine, ergosine, ergocristine, ergocryptine, andergocornine, and their diastereomers the ergopeptinines (-inines, biologically inactive). Innature, ergopeptinines always accompany ergopeptines, and during storage of raw materialsover time or improper storage, more ergopeptinines may form. The conversion of -ines to -ininescan be rapid under certain laboratory conditions and -inines can be reactivated to -ines undercertain conditions. Therefore, both epimers have to be determined for ergot alkaloidcontamination of foods and feeds (Krska and Crews).This proposal is to develop and validate a sensitive LC/MS/MS method for ergpopeptines,ergotamine, ergosine, ergocristine, ergocryptine and ergocornine, and their -inines in cerealgrains of wheat, barley, rye and grasses. The inclusion of a grass matrix for ergot alkaloidanalysis by LC/MS/MS is not commonly addressed in any method but is extremely important forveterinary livestock exposures. The analytical range of detection chosen for the assay, 20 to8000 ug/kg, represents veterinary toxicological important data for interpretation of animal feedand food contamination.RELEVANCEThe LC/MS/MS analytical method for ergopeptines and ergopeptinines in small cereals andgrasses will provide chemical analysis of potentially contaminated feed to be used for foodanimals or sold into the food chain. The current US Official Grain Standards of determiningpercentage contamination by ergot sclerotia in cereal grains is often inaccurate and ignores thegreat variation of alkaloid content in individual sclerotia. The increased use of no-till farmingand leaving vegetation and sclerotia on the soil surface for the successive crops, consumerdesire to utilize organic foods without chemicals, and dramatic weather events will tend toincrease the incidence of Claviceps purpurea in cereal crops and grasses and exposure to ergotalkaloids."

Thus, crops that produce more per unit area with fewer resources and are both resilient and adaptable will be key components in addressing this Grand Challenge. An important first step towards robust agricultural systems is to develop a deep understanding of the genetic control of yield. In barley, yield is determined by many components and the ability to increase yield through standard breeding approaches has slowed. The primary goal of this ERA-CAPS project is to identify genes that control yield-related traits in the small grain temperate cereal crop barley, and to begin to understand how they contribute to this complex phenotype. The three partners in this project will separately focus on seed, spike (inflorescence) and tiller (seed bearing stem) traits. The project will benefit from bringing together a collection of genetic resources and expertise from the three partners. Long-term community integration will be assured by sharing the resources, tools and information with the broader barley genetics and breeding community and by training the next generation of molecular breeders and scientists.In barley, yield is determined by many components and the ability to increase yield through standard breeding approaches has slowed. Barley grain yield is impacted by three components including: seed (size and number), spike (inflorescence) and tillers (vegetative branches). The overall goal of this ERA-CAPS funded project is to identify genes that control morphological and developmental components of yield in barley, and to begin to understand how they contribute to this complex phenotype. The research leverages a previously exome captured sequenced germplasm panel, which will be phenotyped for yield-related traits. These data will provide the opportunity to gain an increased understanding of GxE interactions for key traits. The team will conduct transcriptome sequencing of six trait-related tissues per genotype and analyze how gene expression relates to trait development. To enable accurate quantification of transcript read depth, a reference transcript dataset will be developed by using deep paired-end Illumina RNA-seq and PacBio ISO-seq data from six tissues from cv. Morex. This will be used to quantify transcript abundance from RNA-seq data collected from the same six tissues sampled across the population. RNA-seq derived SNP alleles will supplement the exome capture SNPs and both SNP datasets and transcript read depth variation will be used for association analysis with yield-related traits. Gene co-expression networks will be constructed using reference transcript dataset from Morex and RNA-seq data from the six tissues sampled from the germplasm panel. Both datasets will be integrated to identify candidate genes or key regulators of yield related traits. Functional characterization of candidate genes will be initiated by identifying deleterious alleles from TILLING populations available in each of the three partner labs. The project will provide global community resources of broad impact including: a reference transcript dataset, additional SNPs derived from the landrace collection, and gene co-expression networks for exploring key regulatory genes and their relationship to yield-related traits.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pathogens that survive this first line of defense are met by a second line of defense that results in a higher amplitude programmed cell death response, which effectively sequesters some pathogens in foci of dead cells. However, in the case of necrotrophic pathogens, the class of plant pathogens that acquire nutrients from dead tissue, this defense response is hijacked and utilized by the pathogen to further disease proliferation, translating to crop failure. The project will fill knowledge gaps in the understanding of how plants perceive this important class of pathogens and how immunity responses result in a positive outcome for the plant host (disease resistance). Thus, the project will contribute to understanding of how plant immunity responses are effective at stopping the necrotrophic pathogens which is important as they are becoming well known for their roles in causing disease on important crops and are significantly contributing to world food security issues. The information generated will transect multiple pathosystems important to crop production through characterizing and defining the mechanism that regulates host signaling and immunity against diverse pathogens. The molecular genetic and genomic data generated and molecular tools developed, will broadly benefit the plant-microbe interactions scientific community as well as answer fundamental questions that will facilitate the deployment of genetic resistance in crops contributing to a more secure food supply. This research will also be used in cross-disciplinary training of high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students in molecular genetics and molecular plant pathology from both the host and pathogen perspective. A collaborative outreach program developed through this grant will involve education of young Native American scientists in order to effectively recruit them into the scientific fields effectively broadening the participation of the most under represented group in the STEM fields.The overarching hypothesis is that early immunity responses are effective at stopping the necrotrophic pathogens, yet later elicited immunity responses result in programmed cell death that is effectively hijacked by the necrotophic specialists to complete their lifecycle, contributing to disease susceptibility. The two specific objectives to test this hypothesis focus on a comprehensive evaluation of the temporally and spatially distinct immunity and virulence responses from the host (barley) and pathogen (Pyrenophora teres f. teres), respectively. These aims will address fundamental questions: 1) is a diverse receptor-like protein targeted by multiple necrotrophic effectors to elicit necrotrophic effector triggered susceptibility (NETS); and 2) does a highly effective dominant resistance gene activate early defense responses, arresting the necrotrophic specialist before it colonizes and deploys its necrotrophic effector repertoire? The first component of the plant immune system investigated is a highly variable receptor-like protein, Spt1, which is targeted by multiple diverse necrotrophic effectors located throughout the genomes which evolved to incite disease. This receptor contains unprecedented variability at a localized region that correlates with specific susceptibilities, suggesting that the pathogen populations continually evolved to target this unknown domain and the host has been undergoing a high level of diversifying selection at this domain to evade pathogen virulence. The information gathered on the receptor and necrotrophic effectors will fill fundamental gaps in the knowledge of how necrotrophic specialists target the host and manipulate a weak link in its immune system to cause disease.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All genes in an organism use a simple, four-letter alphabet (A, C, G, T) to make three-letter words (codons) to specify each amino acid of a protein. There is redundancy in this genetic code with multiple, similar codons often coding for the same amino acid. In the DNA, the overall G+C content of genes within any given species is often very similar. However, in grass species there are high-GC and low-GC genes, and there is evidence that high-GC and low-GC genes may be transcribed from DNA into RNA and translated from RNA into protein differently. This project will test whether proteins from high-GC and low-GC genes are transcribed and translated with equal efficiency and, specifically, whether that differential regulation is used when responding to heat, cold and drought stress. This work will also discover rules about codon usage and protein synthesis that can be used to design transgenes for efficient protein production. Finally, current gene prediction software does not account for the high-GC and low-GC genes found in grasses. This project will create a new gene prediction program that will more accurately predict genes in grasses. Better gene prediction will benefit the larger community of plant researchers, including those who work with economically important grasses such as maize, rice, wheat, oats and barley.Grass genes have a bimodal GC distribution and a significant 5' to 3' GC gradient. Little is known about the consequence of such variation on gene and protein expression. High gene GC content and strong negative 5' to 3' gradients in grasses strongly affect codon usage bias. It is possible that both GC biased gene conversion and codon usage bias are important in shaping the unusual GC features that are found in grass genes. GC biased gene conversion may help to move gene mutation towards a particular codon usage program, and then selection on that codon bias may maintain a gene's GC content and gradient. GC biased gene conversion in rice will be examined. Transcriptional and translational characteristics of native and transgenes that differ only in their GC content will also be studied in rice. Translational efficiency may also be affected by regulation of tRNAs in a tissue or condition-specific manner. Therefore, regulation of tRNAs will be examined to determine if changes in tRNA abundances affect protein translational efficiency. Recent published data indicate that due to the variation of GC content in grass genes, a notable number of genes in grasses have been missed or mis-annotated by existing gene finders. A new gene prediction tool that accounts for grass bimodal GC distribution will be designed to improve gene annotation in grasses. The results from this project will provide novel insights into gene evolution in grasses as well as important guidance for crop improvement via genetic modification.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B.

Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics."
