The aim is to improve activity at low pH, and increase catalytic conversion to lower the chemical and energy cost of liquefaction and saccharification.Objective 2: Develop novel enzymes and enzyme-based systems for solubilization and saccharification of hemicellulose components of corn fibers, crop residues, straws and grasses to simple sugars.  Special focus will be to engineer high activity xylanases with decreased end-product inhibition and that can be produced in microbes, which make active cellulases.Objective 3: Utilize and evaluate the evolved enzymes and enzyme systems for the hydrolysis of corn, wheat, and barley starch (Objective 1) and solubilization and saccharification of hemicellulose components of corn fibers, crop residues, straws, and grasses (Objective 2) in laboratory and pilot scale operations.  The improved enzymes will be evaluated on industrial substrates.  Large-scale process development will be conducted in collaboration with corn ethanol companies.Objective 4: Develop and evaluate ethanol-based separation systems for the biorefining of wheat to produce conventional and new fractions as platforms for both food and non-food applications. Characterize the functional material properties of the refined fractions produced in these new systems for their use in both food and non-food applications.Objective 5: Develop and evaluate improved biorefining methods utilizing barrier or membrane-based separation technologies to manage the recovery of ethanol or other biobased chemicals for use as a platform chemical, a biofuel, and a processing fluid.Approach:New biocatalysts are created through directed evolution, in which libraries of enzyme variants are created by the mutation of encoding genes.  The libraries are screened for target properties, and the candidate molecules selected can further undergo cycles of mutation, amplification, and selection until the desired enzyme variant is obtained.  To create novel starch-degrading enzymes toward improved performance, the following steps are involved:   (1) isolate, clone and express amylase genes; (2) mutate the gene sequences to create libraries; (3) screen the libraries for desired functions; (4) Purify the evolved enzymes for biochemical studies; (5) define the structure-function relationship; and (6) construct novel hybrid enzymes.  To develop enzymes for the solubilization of hemicelluloses, the following approach is used: (1) screen by molecular techniques for a full set of genes encoding xylanolytic enzymes that are individually or collectively highly active in xylan degradation; (2) clone and express the genes in suitable expression systems; (3) conduct directed evolution by computational and experimental enzyme mutation; (4) purify the evolved enzymes for biochemical studies; (5) test the enzymes by combinatorial approaches; and (6) produce the enzymes in microbial systems which also produce active cellulases.  As the best-fit enzymes are evolved and selected, the enzyme will be purified to homogeneity for the determination of kinetic properties. A variety of microscopic techniques will be applied to elucidate the action of the individual enzymes developed in this research. Several formats of bench scale enzyme reactions will be evaluated. These include liquefaction and saccharification as a distinct process, liquefaction and saccharification integrated with fermentation, and differentiated liquefaction and saccharification at high solids concentrations.To develop new separation systems, determine and account for (a) unique wheat gluten protein properties in the hydrated and developed state that enhance separation from starch and (b) unique solvent properties of ethanol that enable subfractionation of proteins, recovery of minor components (pentosan), and production of a dry product.

Specifically, determine effects of carbon dioxide on belowground processes which affect crop productivity, soil physicochemical/biological properties, carbon/nutrient cycling, and trace gas efflux from soil.Approach:Two-year rotational cycles of sorghum and soybean will be maintained under two cropping systems: conventional, using tillage without cover crops; and conservation, using no-till with winter cover crops in rotation (wheat, crimson clover, and sunn hemp). Each cropping system will be grown under current and projected levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. In addition, a Southeastern pasture system study, using bahiagrass exposed to these carbon dioxide levels, has been initiated. Carbon flux to plants (growth, physiology, and yield) and soil will be determined with supporting data on soil physicochemical properties.

The research also will determine the roles of specific non-gluten proteins in effects of temperature during grain development on flour quality. This objective addresses a major concern of millers and bakers and explores two hypotheses: 1) changes in glutenin polymer amount, size, structure and composition as a result of high temperatures during grain development are responsible for decreases in flour quality and 2) non-gluten proteins that increase in the grain under high temperature conditions are involved in quality or allergenicity. The second objective of the research is to identify and characterize wheat proteins responsible for human intolerances and allergies that affect nearly 2% of the US population and to develop methods to detect allergenic proteins in downstream products. This objective will determine whether mass spectrometry (MS) can be used to identify potential wheat allergens in flour and detect these proteins in food ingredients and products. Approach:To address the first objective, MS methods coupled with improved methods for protease digestion will be developed so that closely related gluten proteins can be distinguished. Size-exclusion (SE) chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) will be used to separate glutenin polymers into size classes for determination of subunit composition and key linkages between high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) and low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS). Gluten proteins that act as chain terminators in polymer structure will be identified and their roles in polymer structure and size will be evaluated. Polymer composition and size will be measured during grain development under different temperature regimens. The effect of different temperature regimens on accumulation profiles of a specific set of non-gluten proteins and their transcripts during grain development also will be characterized using 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Since many of these proteins may be involved in stabilizing gas bubbles in dough, experiments will be performed to test whether the levels of these proteins increase in dough liquor prepared from flour from grain grown under high temperatures. Tissue localization studies will be performed and the roles that specific proteins play in flour quality and allergenicity will be investigated using transgenic plants in which the corresponding genes are suppressed.To address the second objective, the allergenic potential of non-gluten proteins that increase under high temperature conditions will be tested using sera from patients with defined wheat allergies. MS will be used to determine mass profiles of protein fractions from wheat flour. These profiles will be examined for signatures of specific allergenic proteins. Methods will be extended to samples from baked products such as bread. (FY03 Program Increase $89,415. Replacing 5325-43000-025-00D 1/06)."

A. Determine the effect of cover crops on the fate of nutrients applied in swine manure by measuring (a) cover crop N and P uptake and leaching, (b) cover crop survival after manure application, and (c) losses of N2O from manured fields with and without a cover crop.B. Determine the effect of alternative swine manure application methods on nutrient fate and bacterial transport in systems with and without cover crops.  1) Determine effect of application method (surface application with disking versus low disturbance injection) on crop and cover crop uptake of N and P.2) Determine retention and form of 15N-manure after application to soil.3) Determine the distribution of bioavailable P in the root zone after manure application.4) Determine loss of N, P and E. coli in runoff. C. Determine the effects of composted animal manure, tillage and their interaction on C and N cycling in extended corn-soybean rotations containing small grains and/or legumes.1) Determine the effects of application of composted animal manure on soil and crop C and N within a corn-soybean-winter wheat/red clover rotation under three tillage treatments (fall moldboard plow, fall chisel plow, and no-tillage).2) Determine the contribution of N from composted animal manure to plant available N within corn-soybean rotations.Approach:This research examines the use of a rye-oat cover crop to increase manure nutrient retention and to prevent losses of nutrients and fecal bacteria in runoff.  The research tests the feasibility of this concept and provides an initial demonstration of this practice to selected growers.  If successful the research would form the foundation for field-scale testing and the development of guidelines for producers. Cover crops have been previously shown to be effective in preventing erosion and nitrate leaching, thus they have the potential to mitigate the off-site effects of manure application.  Cover crops in the Midwest are established following soybean harvest in October or early November.  Swine manure is also applied at this time either as a surface application or by injection.  Manure application causes considerable disturbance, thus cover crop survival and function will be assessed.  Furthermore, the effects of conventional and low disturbance manure injection equipment will be compared with respect N and P retention and cover crop survival.  This research would evaluate the cover crop uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus. The ability of cover crops to mitigate runoff losses of nutrients and fecal bacteria will also be examined in rainfall simulation experiments.  In addition, we will determine the effects of composted manure on nitrogen utilization by corn in a rotational cropping system."

The large number of genetic mutants, in combination with the ease of obtaining and mapping additional mutants, makes maize an excellent system for determining the function of genes. We propose to identify genes that regulate maize leaf development and shoot architecture. We will carry out mutagenesis with defined inbreds using the chemical mutagen EMS. Mutants will be characterized genetically and histologically. The genes will be mapped to position and cloned. The functions will be determined by expression analysis and further genetics. We already have two mutants at different stages of analysis. The dominant Liguleless narrow mutant has been mapped to position and beginning characterization is under way. The dominant Wavy auricle in blade1 (Wab1) mutant has been localized to a BAC contig. Once we clone Wab1, we will determine the function of the wild-type gene product.

Specific objectives include: 1) Measure the effects of tillage, residue management, fertility, and crop rotation on physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils in agricultural crop production systems. 2) Develop crop rotation, nutrient, soil, residue, and pest management practices that improve farming efficiency (increase unit output/unit input), maintain or increase soil productivity, and improve crop yield and quality. 3) Measure the effects of corn stover/residue removed for biofuel feedstock on: (1) short-term balances of soil C and N; (2) crop yield and quality; and (3) soil resource condition.Approach:Established long-term field experiments evaluating the effect of crop rotation, residue management, fertility and tillage will be utilized to evaluate the research hypothesis that crop rotations, crop diversity, and crop sequence improves soil quality and productivity and that increased crop diversity, attained through the introduction of alternative crops and improved crop sequences into the traditional corn/soybean rotation, will improve crop yield and quality while maintaining or improving soil quality.  To address the hypothesis that no significant effect of genetic modification of corn genotype on soil microbes (DNA compositional measures) and their processes (e.g., C&N transformations) will be detectable, a field experiment will be established evaluating several different corn isolines with and with out genetically modified organisms.  To evaluate the hypothesis that cover crops and integrated weed management strategies will increase biodiversity and enhance sustainable crop production, research will be conducted in two phases.  Phase 1 will consist of a small-plot field experiment in which different species of grasses and legumes will be evaluated as cover crops in a corn/soybean/spring wheat rotation. The viability of cover crops as a management tool for weeds and insects relative to chemically-driven pest management will be investigated in Phase 2 of the research.  Field and greenhouse experiments will be established evaluating a number of different soybean genotypes to test the hypothesis that soybean genotypes with significantly more root length and mass in the top 10 cm of soil (extensive fibrous root system) will have a more positive impact on soil organic matter, aggregate stability, and soil strength than other soybean genotypes."

Improve infiltration and minimize soil water evaporation for increased soil water storage for efficient use of soil water under dryland and deficit irrigated cropping systems.2.  Develop conservation tillage and residue management systems that optimize crop and integrated crop-livestock productivity and restore degraded soils.3.  Adapt, refine, develop, and implement soil water and crop simulation models to evaluate alternative agronomic and water management strategies, specifically for a semi-arid, advective environment for dryland and deficit irrigated lands.Approach:Tillage practices that retain residue on the soil surface typically improve water availability to crops by increasing infiltration and/or ameliorating micrometeorological factors that drive the evaporation process.  Because of limitations in sensor technology, past research studying water storage and use by crops has not elucidated the tillage induced changes in short-term processes that govern water infiltration, redistribution, and evaporation.  Knowledge of the relative importance of each of these processes during a growing season will facilitate refinement of models to simulate seasonal water balance and assist in assessing the merits of alternative management practices.  In addition, long-term studies used to quantify cumulative benefits of reduced tillage to increase crop yield, water use efficiency, and soil conservation for established wheat-sorghum-fallow crop rotations will be modified for comparisons of tillage benefits on annual sorghum-cotton crop rotations.  Therefore, several experiments focusing on different hydrological aspects and time scales will investigate management effects on soil water and availability to crops."

Develop an N budget framework for N management decision-aid tools for conservation cropping systems.Approach:Objective 1 consists of five subobjectives.  Our first subobjective is to determine the effects of C quality and quantity on soil biophysical properties and function in the seed-zone including aggregation, soil biology community dynamics and plant-microbe interactions.  The research will document tillage and undercutting disturbance effects on the soil microbial populations, community structure and activity. Analyses include soil pH and electrical conductivity, aggregate distribution, bulk density and soil moisture content. Total C and N will be determined.  We will investigate soil organic matter (SOM) components by fractionation, isolation and characterization. The second subobjective will be to determine tillage and cropping system effects on soil organic and inorganic N and C dynamics, and greenhouse gas emission.  We will study microbially mediated transformations and the factors controlling these transformations at the landscape level.  We will set up permanent areas on the USDA Conservation farm and the Cunningham Research Farm in Pullman, Washington.  We will use in situ gross mineralization rates of native soil organic matter to predict the cropÆs extra fertilizer needs to meet yield goals. In addition, we will monitor the microclimate of each area for parameters such as temperature, moisture and solar radiation and normalizing the N transformation data for each area and thus predict N availability over time across landscape areas.  These analyses will be conducted on different cropping systems and tillage management to determine the N efficiency of each system and for predicting fertilizer needs of each system. Subobjectives 4 and 5 will evaluate the economic and natural resource trade-offs in harvesting crop residues for bio-energy. Field-scale crop residue and soil C data from the WSU Cook Agronomy Farm will be analyzed including crop residue quantities, value as a bio-fuel, nutrient content and contribution to soil C sequestration using standard laboratory, geospatial techniques and the CropSyst model. The third objective in the overall project plan in collaboration with Pendleton, is to develop and evaluate tillage and crop residue management practices for successful conservation systems.  Field experiments will consist of two N management treatments (uniform application of N fertilizer and site-specific N management) with extensive measurements that capture the full variability of the field. Our approach will be to collect field-scale data that will allow spatial and temporal analyses. Site-specific yield and protein maps will be combined to establish realistic yield and protein goals for geo-referenced locations within a field. The combination of yield and grain protein data also provides information on the amount of N removed in the grain at harvest and will be used with GIS methods to compute variable-rate N recommendations for wheat.

Fungal pathogens, such as Fusarium head blight and cereal rusts continue to cause major damage and losses.  Development of genetic resistance in small grains to these pathogens is hindered by the lack of information about mechanisms that confer host-plant resistance and the lack of linked DNA markers to assist in the development of improved germplasm.  Our approach will be to use new and existing molecular genetic methods such as gene expression arrays, transient gene silencing and to develop an improved understanding of the genetic and biochemical mechanisms that can confer host-plant resistance disease resistance and utilize this information to develop new strategies for enhancing genetic resistance to cereal viral and fungal diseases.

Increased demands on our limited water resources necessitates that we more accurately determine these criteria since many waters deemed unsuitable can be used under specified conditions. Application of these criteria and application of recycled irrigation drainage water and treated municipal waste water will reduce the margin of error and require that we carefully monitor changes in soil properties, and thus develop improved monitoring protocols and practices. Based on these needs the research project is focused under two objectives: Objective 1: Develop new knowledge and guidelines related to major ion, B, and Mo concentrations for the sustained use of degraded waters including drainage waters and municipal waste waters.  Objective 2: Evaluate the use of geophysical and geographic information system technology to monitor spatio-temporal changes of soil properties, salinity, trace elements and N.Both of these objectives are necessary for effective and protective implementation of irrigation with impaired waters. Although the stated objectives can be achieved by pursuing parallel lines of research, they will be combined in development of management practices. The monitoring technology objective is also essential to future field evaluation of the criteria and predictions made relative to objective one.Approach:1:The adsorption behavior of B and Mo will be studied as a function of solution pH, solution anion concentration, electrolyte composition, and competing anion concentration in batch systems on soils chosen to represent a variety of soil orders. The adsorption behavior will be described using a chemical surface complexation model, allowing for development of improved management of degraded waters high in B and Mo.The desorption behavior of both native soil B and recently added B will be characterized in batch systems to determine the extent of desorption hysteresis in the presence and absence of competing ions. If desorption hysteresis is found, mathematical equations will be developed to describe the B desorption process in batch systems.  Data will be analyzed, and B movement predicted using initial soil characteristics, ET calculations, and water composition using the UNSATCHEM model. New B transport routines will be developed if needed.  Waters of varying composition including salinity, SAR, pH, alkalinity, and Ca/Mg ratio, will be applied to soils in outdoor containers with measurement of the water infiltration rate for both irrigation water and alternate application of rain using a rainfall simulator. The results of these experiments will be incorporated into predicted routines in UNSATCHEM and in guidelines for use of impaired waters.We will evaluate the impact of use of degraded water on soil quality, productivity and forage quality of a marginally productive saline-sodic soil.   Characterization of soil spatial variability will utilize ECa measured by electromagnetic induction equipment, where each site is geo-referenced using GPS.  2: Validation of use of ECa-directed sampling to spatially characterize soil properties (salinity, texture, water content) will be made at a drainage water reuse site.  ECa measurements will be used to determine 40 site locations from a response surface sampling design algorithm.  Additional sites will be randomly selected for a validation data set.  Correlating properties will be predicted from spatial regression models and compared to randomly chosen positions where validation sample data have been collected with development of a protocol for model validation of directed sampling techniques.A site in semi-arid CO under no-till will be used to evaluate ECa-delineated zones as a framework for site-specific N management in winter wheat and for field-scale monitoring of soil quality response and identification of soil quality trends. To evaluate site specific management, using ECa zones, 3 years of yield, ECa zone, and N-treatment maps will be compared with geo-referenced soil sample analyses for N-use efficiency and optimal N rates for each ECa zone.   A phenomenological model of salinity development will be formulated based on spatial data of potential soil salinization factors (e.g., soil type, poor drainage areas, topography, leaching fraction, depth to groundwater, groundwater quality, etc.) for the Red River Valley basin of North Dakota and Minnesota.  The phenomenological model will be used to create an inventory map of salinity for the entire Red River Valley.  Formerly 5310-5310-61000-012-00D."

The growing information on gene sequence and function stimulates interest in pathways expected to have large effects on important agronomic and quality traits. Nevertheless, while more and more genes are valuable inactivation targets, approaches for crop gene modification that can flexibly target 50 to 3000 genes per crop species are limited. This project will apply ultra-high throughput sequencing to TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes), a general method for the discovery of induced mutations in genes of interest. Working with rice and wheat TILLING lines, it will employ PCR-mediated amplification from pooled genomic templates to target dozens to hundreds of genes. The research will test and implement several technical and computational methods to resolve real mutations from errors in highly complex templates. To target hundreds to thousands of genes, the project will use sequence barcoding to create DNA pools of short adapter-ligated random fragments from hundreds or thousands of existing TILLING lines of Arabidopsis, and later rice and wheat. Aliquots from an amplified pool will be subjected to a capture procedure using custom programmable arrays or long oligos attached to either microarrays or beads, and the eluted fragments subjected to Solexa sequencing. The project will build an economical and effective pipeline that will be sustainable as a user-supported service, superseding more laborious and expensive nucleotide mismatch-detection technology. Rice and wheat span the range of critical characteristics and can therefore serve as models for all crops. They differ in ploidy, diploid versus allopolyploid, sequence information, high versus low, genome size, small versus large, and mutation density, moderate versus very high. While developing a sequencing approach to TILLING, the project will use already existing and tested populations to target a set of genes in each crop that will be useful to the community of scientist and breeders. Thus, this research will facilitate breeding of improved crop varieties by providing facile isolation and analysis of variants. This research will provide methods for efficient TILLING of crop plants. By doing so, it will stimulate both basic discovery as well as targeted trait improvement. For example, in wheat independent inactivation of homeologous gene sets followed by breeding can address a host of important agronomic and quality traits. Because discovery of mutations by direct sequencing will allow researchers to choose ab initio which mutant to characterize, in silico collections of induced mutations will provide powerful resources for breeding communities. The developed methods will not only be useful for TILLING but also to discover natural variation, or to identify allelic changes underlying quantitative trait loci. The connected outreach program combines the undergraduate and professional training. It is based on three approaches: an internship program that will pair students and teachers from underrepresented populations with laboratory-to-field experimental genomic pipeline, a database and methods web site, and a yearly workshop for training crop scientists. Data and methods will be accessible to the public through the project web site (http://tilling.ucdavis.edu) and through established genomics databases (http://www.gramene.org/; http://www.arabidopsis.org/)."

Devos (University of Georgia), Olin D. Anderson and Ming-Cheng Luo (University of California - Davis)Complete BAC-by-BAC sequencing of large plant genomes, such as those of wheat, barley, and other economically important plants, is currently prohibitively expensive. Next generation sequencing technologies, such as the 454 Life Sciences (Roche), Solexa (Illumina), and SOLiD (Applied BioSystems), offer sequencing with much higher throughputs and at greatly reduced costs. Unfortunately, the short read-lengths complicate the use of these techniques in de novo sequencing of eukaryotic genomes. That is particularly true for large plant genomes that contain vast amounts of repeated DNA sequences. The goal of this project is to assess a novel strategy for de novo sequencing with the SOLiD platform in collaboration with Applied BioSystems. This strategy will employ sequencing of two-dimensional pools of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones of genomic DNA. The strategy will be evaluated using two-dimensional pools of BAC clones of Aegilops tauschii, one of the diploid ancestors of polyploid wheat. A program will be written to deconvolute the pools and assemble sequences of individual clones.Broader impacts: The development of a de novo sequencing strategy for the SOLiD sequencing platform will make it possible to seriously consider genome sequencing of species with large genomes, such as wheat, at realistic costs and in a realistic time frame. It is the hope that the sequencing technique and the software developed will be universally applicable to the sequencing of any large plant genome. The initial repository for public access to the assembly software developed is at http://wheatdb.ucdavis.edu:8080/wheatdb/index.jsp.  The software will also be integrated with public web sites, such as GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml), that provides a compilation of molecular and phenotypic information on wheat and other cereals."

Many of the genomes (for example, maize, wheat, barley) are large and complex, and it is unlikely that we will have completely mapped and sequenced genomes for these species in the foreseeable future. The cereals also provide the primary source of nourishment to the world's human and domesticated animal populations. This workshop will provide young students and scientists with the tools and skills they need to exploit the emerging genome data in all cereal crops including complete genome sequences (rice, maize, sorghum) and extensive EST and genome survey sequence from wheat and other grasses.

Anderson, UC Davis/USDA-ARS, Albany, CACo-PI: Bikram S. Gill, Kansas State UniversityCo-PI: Mingcheng Luo, University of California, DavisSenior Personnel: Wanlong Li, Kansas State UniversityAdvances in wheat genetics and genomics are essential for the sustained development of wheat varieties with enhanced yield potential, resistance to pests and diseases, and tolerance of adverse environmental conditions. Wheat has an exceptionally large amount of DNA in its nucleus. Wheat is also polyploid; it originated by interspecific hybridization, and its nucleus contains three different genomes, designated A, B, and D, each contributed by a different diploid species. The goal of this project is to develop genomic resources for physical mapping of wheat chromosomes and to deploy them in physical mapping of chromosomes of the wheat D genome. A physical map of a chromosome is a physical representation of the linear order of genes and other landmarks along the chromosome. To construct a physical map, genomic DNA is fragmented, DNA fragments are cloned and each clone is ?fingerprinted?. Overlaps between fingerprints are used to identify DNA fragments from neighboring regions of a chromosome. The location of genes and other markers in these fragments is determined and the sequence of overlapping DNA fragments is aligned to the linear order of markers along a chromosome. Physical maps are important for gene cloning, the development of genetic markers for tagging genes during breeding, and often a prerequisite for genome sequencing. Wheat polyploidy and large genomes require the use of novel strategies in the physical mapping of its chromosomes. Instead of attempting to construct wheat physical maps globally, the physical maps of the chromosomes of Aegilops tauschii, the diploid ancestor of the wheat D genome, will be constructed first. These maps will then be used as templates for the construction of the physical maps of three individual chromosomes of the wheat D genome in the cultivar Chinese Spring (CS). This step will be facilitated by international collaboration with the Institute of Experimental Botany (IEB), Czech Republic, which developed a technique for the isolation of individual wheat chromosomes by chromosome flow-sorting. This project complements ongoing national and international work toward wheat genome sequencing and it provides opportunities for training of US postdoctoral researchers and students at several educational levels.Sequence-ready physical maps of the three CS chromosomes will make it theoretically possible to initiate wheat genome sequencing at the end of this project. While it will take other projects and an unknown number of years before the full wheat genomic sequence will be available to the research community, the anchored physical maps generated in this project will provide a valuable resource for genetic and genomic projects and studies of polyploid genome evolution. Research planned in this project parallels several other national and international projects aiming at knowledge acquisition or resource development needed for the completion of the physical maps of all 21 CS chromosomes. Synergy among these projects will greatly broaden their individual impacts. To broaden further the impact of this project, the following specific activities will be organized: nationally advertised internships for undergraduate students in each of the participating laboratories, a nationally advertised workshop at UC Davis in fingerprinting and physical mapping for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees, and a nationally advertised international internship for US graduate students and postdoctoral trainees at IEB to acquire skills in plant chromosome isolation by flow-sorting, currently unavailable in this country, and other plant molecular cytogenetic techniques. Finally, several project laboratories will host high school and junior college students supported by summer research programs in genomics and biotechnology in the home institutions.The project database(WheatDB) will be accessible at http://wheatdb.ucdavis.edu:8080/wheatdb/index.jsp. This public database will be the initial repository of fingerprints, physical mapping information and all other deliverables generated by the project. It also provides the tools for easy access, display, and analysis of the generated data. The project data will also be integrated into GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml) and Gramene (http://www.gramene.org/), both curated public websites. GrainGenes provides a compilation of molecular and phenotypic information on wheat and other cereals. Gramene is an open-source, data resource for comparative genome analysis in the grasses."

One simple mode of infection used by some fungal plant pathogens is the infection of the space between the cells of the leaf, the apoplast.  Even though the infection mechanism is not complex, there are many questions which remain unanswered about how these fungi are able to enter the host, avoid detection, and gain nutrients, events which together comprise pathogenesis.  The specific aim of this project is to determine the role that ambient pH signaling plays in the pathogenesis of an apoplast-infecting fungus (Mycosphaerella graminicola) on wheat.  M. graminicola is an excellent pathogen for investigation because it exhibits two possible types of growth in culture (single celled and filamentous), two different phases of growth in its plant host (biotrophic (where plant cells are not damaged) and necrotrophic (where plant cells are damaged) and has a sequenced genome.  Mutant fungi which lack components of the pH signaling cascade will be created and evaluated with respect to growth under various pH conditions and in plant hosts.  The project will rely upon molecular, biochemical and genetic approaches.  As a result, the role that pH is playing in influencing the infection process and how pH is sensed by M. graminicola will be understood.  The project should provide information about a novel signaling mechanism in this fungus which may be more broadly applicable to other fungal plant pathogens. The broader impacts of this work also include providing research experiences for undergraduate students at Lawrence Technological University."

To harness this power requires only that flour particles be suspended and exposed to a spark.  Consequently, industries expend significant efforts to control static charging in powders.  Despite these precautions, static discharges regularly cause fatal dust explosions. Less dramatically, electrostatic charging of particles is widely applied industrially, for example in conventional printing5, electrocoating6, and filtration, as well as in more modern applications such as crystal self-assembly. Electrification is ubiquitous in natural granular systems as well, where it influences Aeolian sand transport9 and geological sedimentation patterning.  Surprisingly, after centuries of study, some of the most basic properties of electrification of solids defy explanation. As one brief example, anyone who has received a shock after scuffing their shoes on a nylon rug in wintertime can attest that insulators, which lack free charge carriers, transfer charge more readily than conductors. This effect has been extensively studied and proven to be independent of the ability of conductors to carry charges to ground.Intellectual Merit: Nowhere is the importance of granular electrification more pressing than in pharmaceutical development. Probably the best known example of this is in the aerosol delivery of pharmaceuticals, used both for pulmonary therapeutics (as in asthma) and to deliver drugs that either will not survive in the digestive tract (e.g. insulin) or are otherwise unsuitable for other dosage forms (e.g. agents with low water solubility, or macromolecules that are too large to diffuse transdermally).  Aerosolization depends critically on control of particle charging to prevent aggregation and to promote delivery to the deep lung.  Less widely known, it has recently been demonstrated that many of the flow and mixing complications that plague granular processing are directly attributable to electrostatic charging. Such complications include spontaneous segregation of mechanically indistinguishable materials, and aggregation of grains into complex clusters that can alternatively impede or augment a granular flow depending on subtle experimental details.  Until recently, no major research program has dealt with these basic, yet practically important, problems: industrially, they are addressed on a trouble-shooting basis where little is learned for the long term, and fundamentally, their root causes are ignored. The objective of this proposal is to advance the understanding of granular behaviors in the presence of static charging.  A major part of this work will be to produce experimentally validated computational tools.  This will improve existing industrial granular processes that are notorious for poorly understood mixing and flow difficulties, and will produce new insights into very basic, yet deceptively complex, granular behaviors. The methods that will be used to achieve this objective combine focused experiments in generally applicable geometries side-by-side with the development of direct computational simulations of flow, mixing, segregation, and aggregation of charged grains. Broader Impacts: One does not need to look hard to find broad implications of this research. On the industrial side, the implications are clearcut: in the pharmaceutical industry, beyond aerosol applications, entire production plants and product lines are not infrequently shut down due to failures to control granular flow and mixing, and better understanding of granular electrostatics will improve the reliability of these processes. Further afield, there is a longstanding, unresolved paradox in geophysics that grains in sandstorms generate large charge gradients although they have little beyond other sand grains to rub against. Despite both field and laboratory investigations, the sources of these gradients remain elusive as they depend on poorly understood dynamics between charged particles. Mechanisms have also recently been proposed to link granular charging to Martian landforms. Granular electrostatics also will impact new technologies, including nanocomposites under development for applications such as high energy Lithium batteries, and novel semiconductor devices.  These applications involve the preparation, processing and mixing of grains with highly charged crystal habits, and will benefit from the improved understanding of both the basic and the applied sciences of charged particle behaviors that this proposal will bring. The research in this proposal will be integrated with educational and outreach initiatives including graduate, undergraduate and high school research training in particle technology. In addition, the Rutgers PI's will continue to target the recruitment of women and minorities."

For example, the fungus produces multiple protein toxins each of which is required for its ability to cause disease depending on the genetic makeup of the host. Understanding how these toxins function should provide substantial insight into how pathogens cause disease and how plants become vulnerable to pathogens. This project will evaluate one of these toxins called Ptr ToxA and investigates how and where this protein interacts at the cellular level.  The experimental protocol is highly integrative and incorporates a diversity of approaches including biochemical, cytological, molecular, and genetical analyses designed to identify interacting plant partners. Such partners include host proteins that mediate its uptake, facilitate intracellular transport, and comprise the toxin's site-of-action.  Successful completion of the objectives promises to be transformative not only for its contribution to understanding the basic biology of pathogen virulence and mechanisms that govern host disease susceptibility, but also for understanding processes fundamentally important to plant biology including, receptor biology and function, intracellular protein transport and chloroplast structure and function.  The project will support training and outreach activities in several ways including: the implementation of a workshop in molecular plant-microbe interactions at Heritage University, a nondenominational private, accreted institution of higher education sited on the Yakama Indian Nation Reservation in Toppenish Washington; conducting an eleven-week internship program at Oregon State University hosting select Heritage University students; and direct training experiences in an area with broad implications to the plant sciences for a postdoctoral associate or a research assistant and graduate and undergraduate students."

In plants, it is apparent that much of this diversity is due to both doubling of the chromosomes of species (polyploidy) as well as hybridization among species. However, it remains unclear how these two processes interact in the evolution of new species. This project will test the hypothesis that polyploidy increases rates of hybridization among species relative to nonpolyploids using a group of closely related native plant species (Houstonia) as the study system. Chromosome numbers of natural populations of these species will be determined using cytological techniques. Molecular markers will then be used to assess the historical rate of hybridization among species with varying chromosome numbers. The results of this research will enhance our understanding of polyploidy and hybridization, two of the most important modes of speciation in plants. Many of our most important crop species are either polyploids or hybrids, or both, including corn, cotton, and wheat, so understanding the interaction between hybridization and polyploidy could enhance agricultural breeding programs as well. This research will train both undergraduate and graduate students in biological research methods by giving them an opportunity to participate in data collection, management, and analysis, and conducting independent research."

It is part of a comprehensive, integrated structural analysis of the filamentous plant viruses, aimed at explaining the processes of viral infection, dissemination, and host interactions, and understanding the relationships among these important viruses. The viruses to be studied include members of the potexvirus, potyvirus, and closterovirus groups. The potexviruses are of great significance as models for fundamental virology and cell biology; they have enormous potential in biotechnology, and they are of considerable importance for the damage they cause in agriculture. The potyviruses are responsible for half the viral crop damage in the world, and are of interest because of their close relationship to the animal rhinoviruses (responsible for such diverse conditions as the common cold, polio, and foot-and-mouth disease). The closteroviruses are also of major agricultural significance. To utilize the full potential of the flexible filamentous viruses as models and in biotechnology, and to combat their effects in agriculture, knowledge of three-dimensional structures in atomic detail is required. Apart from this group's preliminary results, there are no three-dimensional structures known for any flexible filamentous virus. Virus structures to be determined will include the most important of the potexviruses, potato virus X, as well as the potyviruses soybean mosaic virus and wheat streak mosaic virus and the closterovirus beet yellows virus. Structures will be determined by cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray fiber diffraction; models derived from cryo-electron microscopy will be used as starting points for more detailed analysis using fiber diffraction data. Fiber diffraction specimen preparation methods developed in this laboratory have greatly improved the quality of data from potexviruses and potyviruses; before this project began, no useful diffraction data had been obtained from potyviruses. Broader impacts will be through the integration of research and education, and through the application of this research to new developments in crop protection and plant biotechnology, particularly in the production of pharmacologically useful products. This laboratory has a strong program of involvement of undergraduates and K-12 teachers in research, and the project activities will include undergraduates, graduate students, and K-12 teachers and students."

Transformations are especially significant for agricultural biodiversity, the part of biological diversity related to food and agriculture, which is maintained in farmers' fields in the form of landraces. For almost 10,000 years farmers in Turkey have relied on and maintained wheat landraces to adapt to socio-economic and environmental changes. However, extensive political and economic transformations in Turkey since the late 1990s are beginning to affect farmers in ways that threaten biodiversity of wheat. These transformations derive from a general process of neoliberal reform, and commitments to various international organizations, including the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, and especially the European Union. This doctoral dissertation research project explores the linkages and articulation between neoliberalism, the state and agricultural biodiversity. The project asks three primary questions: 1) What is the role of the Turkish state in articulation of neoliberal agricultural policies and conservation of agricultural biodiversity? 2) How will recent agricultural policies affect access to and distribution of crop genetic resources? 3) How do farmers respond to current legislative and agricultural policy changes, especially to those that directly affect the grains and seed sector? The investigators will identify the goals and the articulation of the state's policies on agriculture through analysis of 1) documents on agriculture produced by the state and by international organizations, and 2) semi-structured interviews with state officials and international experts. The project will also include local ethnographies at two separate research sites in Turkey, in northwestern and central Anatolia, to understand responses of farmers and farmers' organizations to changes in agriculture. This project on how state projects of neoliberalism affect farmers' ability to grow and maintain wheat landraces makes multiple contributions. In terms of theoretical advances, the research brings together scholarship on the neoliberal state and on agricultural biodiversity.  In so doing, the project will broaden and deepen understanding of the relationship between neoliberalism and nature.  In terms of practical advances, the results will offer theoretical, empirical and practical insights that will provide important and timely data to state, non-governmental, and farmers' organizations, which can be used for formulation of in situ conservation policies.  Turkey is the only country in the Middle East region that as a collaborator of an international program develops disease-resistant and high-yielding winter wheat varieties and distributes them internationally. Therefore, understanding linkages between neoliberalism and agricultural biodiversity in Turkey has potential implications for food security and crop improvement, for not only Turkey and the Middle East, but the world in general. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

It is a particularly important genetic process in flowering plants, and many cultivated plants (e.g., wheat, maize, cotton, soybean) are polyploid. Polyploidy can lead to profound genomic changes, even beyond duplicating all of the genes in the genome. Polyploidy has long been known to affect physiology, anatomy, and biochemistry, but few studies have sought to connect phenotype with changes at the molecular level to understand how plants achieve an integrated response to polyploidy in natural populations. Such investigations hold the key to understanding why polyploids are so prevalent among plants, and why polyploids often have been considered more adaptable or more successful than their diploid progenitors.This project will study photoprotection - an important physiological process by which plants avoid damage from excess light energy - in several recently formed polyploid species of Glycine, the genus that includes the cultivated soybean. These species formed by hybridization and genome doubling (allopolyploidy) within the last 50,000 years. The diploid species that gave rise to them have been identified. Chlorophyll fluorescence assays will be used to compare photoprotection in the polyploid species with their diploid progenitors. At the molecular level, it will be determined how the gene copies contributed by the two diploid progenitors have changed in sequence and expression in the polyploidy species since their formation, and whether changes in DNA sequence, dosage, and/or expression patterns correlate with photoprotection phenotype.Broader Impacts. This project is of broad significance and impact because it will elucidate the effects of a ubiquitous genetic phenomenon, polyploidy, on a physiological process essential to plant fitness, and will connect this to changes in the genes underlying photoprotection. In addition, the project involves training graduate and undergraduate students and is linked to an ongoing high-school teacher outreach program at Cornell."

B. subtilis can be divided into two major subgroups:168 and W23. The only genome sequence available to date is a representative of the 168 group that has been extensively adapted to laboratory conditions. This adaptive process, which includes  serial passaging and X-ray irradiation, has resulted in the loss of a number of ecologically-relevant social behaviors exhibited by newly isolated environmental members of this species.  To fully appreciate the diversity within this important model organism a whole genome shotgun sequencing approach will be used to sequence the genome of an additional four B. subtilis isolates: B. subtilis TU-B-10 (type strain of the W23 group), Bacillus mojavensis RO-H-1 (close relative associated with wheat blight, hydrocarbon recovery and novel antifungal properties), B. subtilis NCIB3610 (the ancestor to B. subtilis 168) and B. subtilis RO-NN-1 (a recent environmental isolate within the 168 group that has a larger genome than other B. subtilis strains). Bacillus subtilis is the second most studied microbe after Escherichia coli. It is the subject of more that 20,000 scientific publications and a model organism for many biological processes. Currently there are more than 20 genome sequences available or in progress for E. coli and only one genome sequence for B. subtilis. The comparative analysis of these genome sequences will generate a better insight into the evolution of this important model organism. More significantly, the large and international scientific community (academic,industrial and biodefense) will be better served by having access to these sequences. The project will also involve significant training at the postdoctoral and undergraduate levels, and the development of a website of B. subtilis comparative genomics."

This proposal focuses on tool development for diagnosis of wheat blast pathogens and identification of resistance resources for disease control. At the same time, wheat blast will be developed as a model for integrating research with training of students, decision-makers and responders in plant biosecurity issues. Students will contribute directly to the analysis of an emerging plant disease and gain a comprehensive understanding of plant biosecurity as an emerging area of study. Resources will be developed for rapid dissemination of information and tools for diagnosticians and field specialists charged with early detection of disease outbreaks. Hands on training workshops and web-based resources will be implemented for agricultural producers, industry professionals, extension professionals, policy makers, and the general public.

This method of pest control eliminates the negative environmental impacts and the high costs associated with chemical pesticides. However, the efficacy of any single R gene has a limited durability. This problem is caused by  virulence  mutations in insect avirulence (Avr) genes that arise and spread in the pest populations. These mutations permit the pests to overcome the resistance conferred by the R genes. A complete lack of knowledge regarding the structure and function of Avr genes and virulence mutations in insects compounds this problem. To date, no insect Avr gene has been molecularly characterized. Moreover, the manner in which insect Avr gene products physically interact with plant R gene products is also unknown because a corresponding insect-Avr/plant-R gene-pair has not to be isolated. This research will remedy this situation by cloning both an insect Avr gene and its corresponding plant R gene. The Avr gene, named vH9 will be cloned from the Hessian fly, the world's most important insect pest of wheat. The corresponding Hessian fly R gene (H9) will be cloned from wheat. H9 is still an effective R gene in much of the U.S. However, virulence mutations in vH9 have already been detected in Hessian fly populations in both the laboratory and the field. Importantly, previous work has already genetically mapped vH9 within a relatively small (84-kb) segment of sequenced Hessian fly DNA. vH9 will be identified among the genes that reside in this segment by comparing their structures and expression in individuals isolated from genetic-mapping and field-collected populations. Gene discovery and allelic comparisons within this segment of the Hessian fly genome will be made using DNA amplification, RNA amplification, DNA-RNA hybridization, and DNA sequencing. The Hessian fly susceptible form of the H9 R gene has also been isolated and sequenced. This knowledge will be used to isolate the resistant form of H9 from CI 17714 wheat plants, which carry this allele. DNA amplification, and DNA hybridization techniques will be used to discover the resistant H9 allele in small fragments of CI 17714 genomic DNA. Those same fragments will then be transformed into the genomes of susceptible wheat plants to confirm that they confer H9 resistance to the Hessian fly. Three short-term outcomes of this investigation are expected: 1) the ability to predict the structures of the H9 and vH9 gene products, 2) molecular diagnostics for Hessian fly H9-virulence in the field, and 3) the ability to examine the interactions between the products of a plant R gene and a corresponding insect Avr gene for the first time. Results are expected to be immediately transferable to other plant pest problems. The long-term outcome of this investigation is expected to be the ability to design a more durable form of pest management."

Ug99 was first detected in Africa and has recently spread to Iran. The pathogen can be blown long distances and the likelihood of inadvertent human-mediated spread is considerable. The U.S. grows 60 million acres of wheat valued at $13 billion and potential loss to Ug99 could exceed $10 billion. Most U.S. wheat and barley cultivars are susceptible to Ug99. Wide deployment of resistant cultivars will likely require 7-10 years and until then the first line of defense will be applications of fungicides. We will develop research, extension, and education components of an IPM program to provide growers with efficient in-season stem rust management to protect their crop yields and profits between the time Ug99 enters the U.S. and deployment of cultivars with durable long-term resistance to this pathogen. This Integrated Project addresses both 2008 Plant Biosecurity Program priorities. We will develop rapid diagnostic procedures for identifying Ug99, train NPDN staff to use these PCR tools, and facilitate improvement of U.S. wheat germplasm. We will integrate observations from disease monitoring and spore collection networks with aerobiology modeling to provide growers with early warning of disease spread once Ug99 arrives. We will work with stakeholders to enhance monitoring programs and provide an Internet-based platform for communicating information critical for management decision making. Finally, we will develop a university aerobiology course to teach state-of-the-art methods for responding to threats from invasive organisms to the next generation of scientists."

Our hypothesis is that both seed and leaf AGPase activity constrain leaf photosynthetic rates and limit plant growth under conditions found under modern intensive agriculture. To test this hypothesis we will create and test rice plants containing an upregulated AGPase under the control of a seed and/or leaf specific promoter. The two most novel aspects of our proposed research are the comprehensive nature of the work proposed and that the experiments will be performed using an agronomic crop. Successful completion of our proposed objectives would likely indicate that the native allosteric properties of both leaf and seed AGPase limit both photosynthetic rates and plant productivity. Improvements in both photosynthetic rates and plant yield via direct selection for modified AGP allosteric properties or the use of transgenic plants then may result in improved agronomic yield and contribute to the long-range improvement in and sustainability of U.S. agriculture.

Frequent comments from prospective producers reflect two interests: 1) having a glyphosate weed control option in a winter crop, and 2) a market in the Region where producers can sell the crop. Project personnel regularly receive inquiries from producer clientele or an occasional business entity regarding the suitability of canola in the region. Several growers have tested small plantings `to see how it will do,' whether for seed production or grazing potential. In addition, the Texas High Plains is also the site of numerous seed blocks for canola seed production. Also, there is growing interest in canola as an oil source in the developing biodiesel market. The Southern High Plains (SHP) region encompasses much of west Texas, eastern New Mexico, and southeastern Colorado where elevations range from 3,000' to 4,500' and natural precipitation is <20 , of which about 20% falls in November-February. Though the region experiences a distinct and sometimes harsh winter, canola winter hardiness is much less a concern relative to northwest Kansas, northeast Colorado, and western Nebraska, where winter canola may still experience significant winterkill, most notably in dry conditions. Furthermore, the SHP region covered by this proposal averages over 5 million acres of planted wheat annually, 30% of which is irrigated. This proposal will address four general components: 1) Testing of reduced irrigation levels that may still foster significant canola production in a region where irrigation levels have declined. This will include testing across a range of irrigation levels; 2) Testing the effect of existing stubble (most likely wheat) on canola establishment, survival, and yield. Recent Oklahoma research suggests that canola yields are reduced with high stubble, but the High Plains region experiences quicker, deeper cold, and the protection of residue may enhance canola production; 3) Canola seeding dates that are too late may lead to reduced or failed stands, hence a range of planting dates will help producers understand the risks of delayed planting. Also, harvesting canola directly with combines means potential delays in harvest, but chemicals that might enable earlier combine harvest or cutting the canola when significant portion of the crop is mature may allow the canola to dry quicker and harvest earlier thus avoiding storm damage. Also, canola is a hotbed of aphid activity, and the ongoing assessment of insects in canola and their potential damage will be assessed, including response to and duration of the benefits of seed treatments."

An interactive morphology guide will assist users with technical terminology. As part of project, two students will be trained in systematic entomology through investigations of the problematic genus Delphacodes. Student projects will include investigating species definitions, developing identification tools, and a morphological and molecular phylogenetic investigation. Student projects will assist in the development of online resources by developing new identification tools and providing technical input to the online information system.

The project evaluates the effectiveness of a Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) as a source of real-time correction for tractors equipped with Real Time Kinematic (RTK) level auto-steer. To further investigate guidance options for producers, mid-level (approx. 1 ft pass-to-pass accuracy) guidance systems will be compared to traditional techniques to evaluate product application efficiencies. By evaluating soil properties of long-term conservation systems versus traditional agronomic practices, a better understanding of the sustainability of our soil resources will be obtained. Sensor technologies will be evaluted for use in nitrogen management of cotton, corn and wheat. The sensor technologies can be used with variable rate technologies to make real time site-specific applications that reduce cost and improve efficiency of agrochemical applications. Irrigation effects will be assessed using TIR data, which provides synoptic assessment of the crop-soil-water continuum. This could provide an additional tool for water management. The final component of the project is the Automated Response System (ARS), which will allow producers to respond to questions posed by members of the Precision Agriculture Team, who will then compile the responses to ensure that the producer needs are being addressed through research and extension efforts."

Therefore, the incorporation of this allele into cultivated wheat has the potential to contribute to an increase in the number of spikelets per spike of the commercial varieties. In addition, the Eps-A1 gene affects the duration of the vegetative phase and can be used to fine tune wheat heading time to specific environmental conditions. Understanding the mechanisms, interactions, and the sources of variation in the Eps-A1 gene will not only accelerate the development of the practical applications described above, but will also contribute to our knowledge of the basic mechanism of regulation of spike development.

Severe epidemics caused by leaf rust and stem rust, caused by the related species P. graminis f. sp. tritici, plague North-American wheat production. Wheat resistance to cereal rusts is precarious at all times, as new races evolve regularly and threaten sustainable crop production. By sequencing the genome of P. triticina and comparing it to that of P. graminis, we can define common features of rust fungi as well as those which make these two pathogens different. Rust fungi (Pucciniales) are obligate plant parasites with a wide range of plant hosts that include ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms. The order Pucciniales is comprised of more than 7,000 species and is one of the most important groups of plant pathogens worldwide. This project will thus allow a wide community of researchers to use genomic approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of pathogenicity and the biotrophic life-style of rust fungi. The successful completion of this project will primarily impact the scientific community by providing information on the genome and expression of an important fungal plant pathogen. Several groups are prepared to use the genome sequence for work in proteomics, genetic mapping, and expression analysis. A comparative website for rust fungi will be developed at the Broad Institute to disseminate the information on the genome of P. triticina, as well as allow comparison to other genomes, including P. graminis. These resources will be used by a broad community of scientists in the public and private sector interested in basic fungal biology, host-parasite interactions, fungal evolution and the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from rust diseases. Furthermore, this project will provide educational opportunities for students to actively participate in fungal genomics and bio-informatics research and broaden the participation in basic science by underrepresented groups.

Our long-term goal is to improve frost tolerance in cultivated wheat. Our pr oposed research combines fundamental and mission based research to generate knowledge of the genetic components involved in wheat response to freezing. The use of this knowledge will increase agricultural productivity by identifying specific major regulators of cold induced gene expression in wheat. The frost tolerance Fr-2 locus that we discovered in the diploid wheat, T. monococcum, and validated in cultivated wheat, T. aestivum, is a conserved component of improved frost tolerance in winter wheat. Thus, although other areas of the wheat genome have been identified that are associated with frost tolerance, the CBF genes at the Fr-2 locus seem to act as a common denominator to affect resistance to freezing in multiple genotypes of wheat and related species. Therefore, the knowledge of the specific temperature response of each of the individual CBF genes and of their effect on the response of the downstream COR genes is essential to focus selection efforts to improve tolerance of winter wheat to freezing. In addition to the sequencing and characterization of the critical CBF genes, we will develop new populations segregating for frost tolerance, new molecular markers for frost tolerance and new allelic diversity by TILLING. Because two of the co-PIs (Garland Campbell and Dubcovsky) are active wheat breeders, research discoveries will be incorporated immediately into wheat improvement programs. The third co-PI (See) manages the USDA-ARS Western Regional Small Grains Genotyping Laboratory and molecular markers associated with frost tolerance can rapidly be incorporated into high throughput screening for improved frost tolerance in wheat breeding programs in the US. Alleles that improve wheat response to freezing injury will be identified in existing adapted germplasm facilitating a rapid deployment of the selected alleles. Since CBF genes are also involved in the regulation of plant responses to dehydration the genotypes developed from this project, including lines for the different CBF haplotypes and the TILLING mutants for the targeted CBF genes, may be also useful tools to improve our understanding of different CBF genes in the plant responses to dehydration and drought."

Despite their importance, we have limited knowledge of the genes controlling endosperm initiation and growth in cereals. In both animals and plants, the Polycomb group genes (PcG) regulate several developmental pathways. In the model dicot plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, the PcG-related Fertilization Independent Seed (FIS) genes, so called because of the ability of the mutants to initiate endosperm growth without fertilization, have been implicated in the control of endosperm initiation and growth patterning. Genetic studies in Arabidopsis have identified four FIS genes called MEDEA, FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED 2, FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM and MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA1. Although there are distinctive differences between endosperm development in dicots versus monocots, none of these genes have thus far been investigated functionally in rice or any other cereals, or generally in any monocots. My long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms controlling endosperm proliferation and patterning in cereals. In this project, I will identify and study potential rice FIS genes and investigate their potential functions in rice endosperm development. This fundamental research into the FIS genes in rice will provide a useful foundation to understanding the critical process of endosperm development in cereals, including other important crops species like maize and wheat."

The properties and processing behavior of whole grain flour doughs are modified at each stage of the process, from mixing to dividing through sheeting and make-up. Dough rheology and gas cell stability are highly important to the final quality of baked products. During the mixing process small air cells are incorporated into the dough. The bubbles serve as nucleation sites for the diffusion of carbon dioxide and continue to grow during fermentation and proofing. The stability of the cell walls surrounding these cells has a great effect on the texture of baked end products. As cells slowly expand product volume increases. The failure or coalescence of the cells eventually leads to an open sponge like structure that is commonly seen in bread. Cell wall stability during the proofing and baking stages in important in preventing premature coalescence. Understanding how the presence of bran particles, their content and particle size affect dough microstructure during proofing and baking is a fundamental first step in developing baked food systems containing whole grain wheat flour. The overall hypothesis underlying this proposal is that the nature and extent of bran interactions with the gluten protein matrix play a dominant role in both 'in-process' dough and final product quality of whole grain baked goods. Therefore, the purposeful manipulation of those interactions should be able ameliorate or minimize adverse processing or product characteristics resulting from bran inclusion/presence. However, to affect that manipulation on anything other than a trial and error basis requires a detailed fundamental understanding of the biochemical, fundamental rheological and micro-structural role(s) of bran in yeast leavened dough systems. This proposal seeks to provide that fundamental understanding. The approach we are taking is to study the effects of bran milled to different particle sizes on dough development during and after dough mixing using new and innovative techniques involving infrared spectroscopy and x-ray microtomography, combined with fundamental rheology and traditional cereal science approaches. This information will then be combined to create a better understanding of how bran effects dough development, processing characteristics and final product quality so as to facilitate the development of mixing, processing or formulation strategies that will allow for the control of these effects."

We will identify new sources of RWA resistance in exotic wheat germplasm and incorporate it into cultivars adapted to Colorado conditions. To develop longer term strategies to control RWA, we will determine the mechanisms of RWA toxicity against wheat and identify wheat genes involved in the defense response against RWA. We will help improve the breadmaking quality of Colorado wheat by incorporating high-throughput near infrared spectroscopy evaluations, and by identifying molecular markers for quality traits. Efforts to improve drought stress tolerance will be advanced by evaluating germplasm for tolerance under field and greenhouse conditions and identifying molecular markers linked to stress tolerance traits. Anticipated benefits of the project are improved cultivars that are better able to withstand biotic and environmental stresses and meet market demands, thereby contributing to the overall sustainability of farming systems in the west central Great Plains."

Experiments have revealed that enhanced UVB light has adverse impacts on growth, yield, and quality of crops such as soybean, wheat, rice, sorghum, cotton, and corn. On-going experiments in growth chambers at Mississippi State University study the effects of enhanced UVB radiation and high temperature on cowpeas. The effects of UVB radiation and soil moisture on leaf litter decomposition were investigated through experiments in a greenhouse at CSU, and the results are currently being analyzed. Experiments were carried out to evaluate and quantify the effects of UV radiation on the early development of soybean. Two cotton growth simulation models were incorporated into a regional climate model in order to quantify the impact on cotton yields of enhanced UVB radiation combined with drought stress. These effects are being specified and quantified by our research group and incorporated into crop models. We are also working with other scientists to couple the crop models with a regional climate model as well as other models to develop an integrated assessment system to evaluate the risks of climate change and variation in the national agriculture and the international food security.

Potyviruses regularly attack potato, wheat, and many fruit and vegetable crops. The most efficient way to control potyviruses is by genetic resistance. A more expensive and less environmentally sustainable way is to spray pesticides to control the aphids that transmit potyviruses. But viruses often evolve to overcome the resistance. A better understanding of how viruses work is necessary to identify resistance targets in the viral genome. Using bioinformatics methods we discovered a tiny new gene (called pipo) that is present in all sequenced potyvirus genomes. Pipo overlaps with the large polyprotein gene that was thought to be the only gene in the potyvirus genome. We also showed that the pipo gene is essential for the virus to infect plants. Discovery of pipo is revolutionary because it reveals new coding capacity and potential gene function that has been ignored in all previous research on viruses of the Potyviridae. In soybean mosaic virus, pipo is located in a portion of the genome known to determine whether the virus is susceptible to a host resistance gene. Thus, it is possible that pipo determines whether viruses like soybean mosaic can infect normally resistant soybean plants. Our research will determine this possibility. Also, because pipo overlaps with another gene, the mechanism by which the protein encoded by pipo is expressed (made by the host protein synthesis machinery) must be novel. We will investigate this mechanism of gene expression and it should shed fundamental new light on possibilities for protein synthesis control in plants. Finally, we will determine the role that pipo has in the virus replication process, be it multiplication of the viral genome, moving the virus from cell to cell, or overcoming the RNA-mediated innate immune response known in all plants. The OUTCOME/IMPACT of this research will be new knowledge that may guide (1) virologists in engineering improved virus vectors for expressing foreign genes or knocking out host genes, (2) plant breeders in screening for durable resistance to potyviruses, and (3) molecular biologists in understanding the mechanisms of protein synthesis in plants."

It also contributes significantly to the national economy and trade balance by accounting for approximately 13% of the U.S. production of wheat (about 300 million bushels annually on 10 million acres of cropland), 80% of which is exported. The PNW wheat region is also subject to severe wind and water erosion, with documented loss rates of 20 tons/acre/year. On the ridge tops and side slopes of the hilly terrain in the higher rainfall areas, water erosion has reduced potential soil productivity by as much as 50%. Wind erosion on the sandy soils in the lower rainfall areas has also reduced productivity. In addition to the loss of on-site soil productivity, the damage from sediment to waterways, recreational areas, and roads costs taxpayers millions of dollars annually and impacts health of PNW residents. Erosion on PNW farmlands is more difficult to control than in other areas of the U.S. because of great variations in topography, soils, freeze-thaw action, and cropping systems used. Most fields in the higher rainfall areas are classified as highly erodible lands and require some form of protective treatment to meet conservation compliance provisions of the 1985 and 1990 Farm Bills. Wind erosion susceptibility in dryland and irrigated areas is caused by high and variable wind speeds; rolling topography, which distorts wind patterns; high volcanic ash content of soils with low particle density; and limited cover on fallow fields during critical time periods. New strategies and cropping systems for the protection of soil, water, and air resources are being developed and evaluated through collaborative research conducted by scientists in the three-state PNW region. Through adoption of reduced- and no-till (direct seeding), we encourage both crop and alternative management practices that better protect soil, water, and air resources. In FY 2008, six research projects were identified for funding. Four of these proposals request capstone funding to complete key long-term cropping systems research across the major environments of north-central Oregon, Central and eastern Washington, and northern Idaho. These projects are designed to develop and evaluate more efficient practices for nutrient use, enhance pest management and control, improve soil quality, and assess and enhance agronomic and economic viability of rotations that represent more sustainable alternatives to conventional tillage. The fifth project addresses technology transfer of STEEP research through a variety of traditional and innovative mechanisms. The sixth and final project seeks to identify key crop residue properties controlling decomposition of tissues in order to facilitate breeding and management to maximize residue retention in low rainfall areas where it is needed, and enhance residue decomposition in high rainfall areas where excess residue is a barrier to adoption of conservation tillage practices."

Despite their importance in polyploid evolution, the function of the nuclear genes involved in NM interactions in wheat is not known. Thus, the isolation and characterization of genes involved in NM interactions is crucial to our understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms and improvement of modern cultivars. A single genetic locus, scs (species cytoplasm specific), influences gene regulatory mechanisms responsible for a number of developmental processes in durum wheat, including embryo/seed development and overall plant vigor. We plan to clone the scsti gene(s) and characterize its role in the development of wheat plant and polyploid species.

Future farming in this region under energy-constrained scenarios must focus on increasing the energetic net gain associated with N inputs. A new class of crops, the pulses (annual grain legumes), are poised to play a major role in diversifying cropping systems in the NGP, due to their inherent profit potential, and due to farmer perceptions of meaningful N contributions to their wheat crops. Area devoted to pea and lentil crops increased several fold in the NGP over the past decade and may increase further. There are two key limitations related to using pulse crops to offset N fertilizer. First, N contributions from pulse crops are difficult to estimate accurately, especially in the short term. It will be important to investigate pulse crop effects in the medium- (and long-) term to better understand their role in conditioning cropping system energy budgets, and especially with respect to changes in soil stasis in the form of embodied soil N supply. The role of pulse crops in conditioning soil organic N stasis is being hotly debated and must move toward resolution. Second, and perhaps more important, some agroecozones within the NGP do not receive sufficiently consistent rainfall to permit annual cropping, and are reliant on fallow - wheat systems. There may be an unmet opportunity to `green' fallow in a more sustainable fashion, with the use of annual legume green manures (LGM), if the balance between soil water use and N contribution can be managed to be energetically and economically favorable. However, optimal tactics for managing this water use - soil N balance are not understood. Unresolved questions relate to tactical tillage (perhaps within reduced till systems), seasonality and duration of LGM growth, and optimal LGM species. The major objective of this study is to determine the energetic and economic worth of legume crop inclusion in semiarid wheat-based cropping systems. Using an energy budget approach we will quantify the potential for offsetting a portion of N fertilizer use, with a special emphasis on using legume green manures in conventional cropping systems. Results from this effort, combined with previous work, will aid producers in adapting their cropping systems to best meet production and ecosystem service goals. Ecosystem services that will be provided are reduced greenhouse gas concentrations, improved soil quality, and improved water quality. Quantification of the `significance' of this research can be estimated with limited precision. For example, it will be possible to chronicle increases in pulse crop and LGM acreage in the NGP (and elsewhere), and not difficult to estimate associated energy savings. Although it would not be known to what degree this particular research project was responsible for enacting this change, the potential impact on agricultural sustainability is very large."

But in 2007, Kentucky tobacco cash receipts totaled approximately $300 million, down from $674 million in 2000. Many of Kentucky's farms are small, averaging 163 acres, well below the U.S. average of 449 acres. Of the 84,000 farms in Kentucky in 2006, 63 percent had sales of less than $10,000 per year. As income from tobacco has declined, interest in alternative crops, including horticultural enterprises, has risen dramatically. This interest continues to increase because of the tobacco quota buyout. Horticultural crops offer Kentucky growers potential alternatives, as the state trails neighboring states Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia in produce and nursery crop acreage. A number of farms have successfully initiated commercial vegetable enterprises. Other farms are seeing the potential success of horticultural crops, but most lack the technical knowledge and management skills for immediate success with the required production/marketing systems. Kentucky's grain crop producers are actively searching for ways to improve the market value of the crops they grow. An emphasis on bioenergy has increased the value of corn, and research is needed to determine which hybrids are best for ethanol production. Research is also needed to look at potential energy production utilizing other crops, including switchgrass. Other potential specialty grain types include green vegetable soybean and organic corn, wheat, and soybeans. Twelve horticulture and specialty grains projects will be conducted by researchers at the University of Kentucky as part of this overall New Crop Opportunities, KY, project. The New Crop Opportunities Center will feature a Web site for 24-hour access to information on new crops for Kentucky, including the horticultural and specialty grains crops that are the focus of the Center's research. Center staff will answer questions from Extension agents and farmers, and will distribute new crop information at field days and conferences. The Center will facilitate the packaging of information from its field research and other sources for dissemination. The expected outcomes/impacts of this project will be an increase in knowledge among Kentucky farmers and county extension agents about production and marketing systems for a variety of new crops. This increase in knowledge should allow farmers to make informed decisions about which new crops to try, and how to market those crops, based on information available on the Center's specific research projects, as well as through its Crop and Marketing Profiles. The anticipated benefits include greater profitability for Kentucky's farmers as they successfully transition to a variety of crops that are new to them."

The recent emergence of pathogen races with virulence on two widely used resistance genes presents a new threat to wheat production in the U.S. The USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Lab (CDL) currently coordinates a surveillance network for cereal rusts involving members of the multi-state research committees, NCERA-184 and WERA-097. However, the sampling provided by this network may miss some epidemiologically important areas and may be too infrequent in other areas to find new races of stem rust before they become widespread. Furthermore, most cereal pathologists in the U.S. have little experience managing stem rust, because regional epidemics have been rare during recent decades. Given the threat posed by the new races of the fungus, NCERA-184 and WERA-097 propose a cooperative project that will enhance the existing surveillance for stem rust in the U.S. and provide disease management recommendations for producers. Specific activities of this project include (1) a workshop that will bring disease specialists from the USDA and land grant universities together with key stakeholders to develop enhanced surveillance protocols and best management practices; and (2) a pilot program that will evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced surveillance using stripe rust and leaf rust as model systems."

We are suggesting control by a means not currently used in the United States, but has been shown and analyzed elsewhere to be the most cost-effective means of control-baiting with a lethal toxicant. Although feral hogs are protected as a game species in some states, their damage is well-known by those who are in direct contact with them: farmers, ranchers, federal and state wildlife managers, forest managers, city and county municipalities, and other private organizations and citizens. Damage has occurred in agriculture and silviculture and feral hogs represent a means of disease transmission to livestock. Physical damage includes rooting of pastures, forests, vineyards; consumption of crops (milo, corn, wheat, rice, peanuts, and potatoes, etc.); land erosion; and preying upon calves, lambs, and kids. More recently, as the populations increase at an alarming rate, concern has shifted to disease transmission. Feral hogs harbor diseases and parasites that can be transferred to livestock including: foot and mouth disease, pseudorabies, cholera, trichinosis, African swine fever, brucellosis, leptospirosis, salmonellosis, anthrax, ticks, fleas, lice, and various flukes and worms. Many of these diseases could be used in bioterrorism attacks and greatly threaten the livestock industry as a whole. Upon live-capture, tests will be initiated to determine a viable bait formulation that can be tested in the field and in the future be available to consumers as a market bait. The bait will add another tool and technology to a growing problem by supplying the public and private sectors with a cost-effective solution."

Approach:Maize is an important crop as well as a model organism for other cereals such as sorghum, barley, rice and wheat. Our long term goal is to identify and characterize the activity of maize genes involved in plant production including tolerance to stressful growth conditions and regulation of flowering time. Recent work in model systems demonstrates that the circadian regulation of physiological activities is required for optimal plant growth and for tuning of responses to environmental cues. A comprehensive understanding of the circadian system in cereals is lacking; therefore, this proposal seeks to define the maize circadian system and assess the circadian oscillatorÆs contribution to important agronomic traits. Known circadian mutants will be tested for their response to salt and osmotic stress. Genes under circadian regulation in cereals will be identified by expression profiling, and this information used to computationally predict regulatory DNA elements that contribute to circadian gene expression. Reverse genetic approaches will evaluate the role of candidate photoperiodism genes in determining the timing of maize flowering. Maize inbreds and recombinant inbred lines will be analyzed for natural variation in overt circadian rhythms. DNA sequences, genes, mutants, and inbred lines identified here provide two types of tools: a better understanding of fundamental processes in environmental responses and targets that can be used to improve crop productivity.

The research objective is to develop genetic resistance to FHB in durum, or macaroni, wheat (Triticum turgidum L., 2n = 4x = 28; AABB genomes) by exploiting novel sources of resistance in the wild relatives.  It has been difficult to identify effective sources of resistance in durum wheat cultivars.  However, several wild grasses, including diploid wheatgrasses in the secondary or tertiary gene pool of wheat, are excellent sources of FHB resistance that may be incorporated into durum germplasm.  Improved durum germplasm with reliable FHB resistance could then be used to incorporate resistance genes into durum and bread wheat cultivars.Specific subobjectives of this project are to:a.	Develop alien addition lines involving chromosomes or chromatin, with FHB resistance from diploid wheatgrasses, Lophopyrum elongatum (Host) ┴. L÷ve [= Agropyron elongatum (Host) Beauv.] and Thinopyrum bessarabicum (Savul. & Rayss) ┴. L÷ve (= Agropyron bessarabicum Savul. & Rayss).b.	Initiate new crosses with other potential donors such as Thinopyrum junceiforme (L÷ve & L÷ve) L÷ve, 2n = 4x = 28; J1J1J2J2 genomes) and Thinopyrum nodosum [= Lophopyrum nodosum (Nevski) ┴. L÷ve] that may provide new sources of alien chromosomes with FHB resistance.c.	Characterize the added alien chromosome(s) from the wild relatives that confer FHB resistance to durum wheat. d.	Evaluate both FHB resistance and mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation with the longer-term objective of releasing FHB-resistant germplasm.e.	Assess the genomic relationships between wheat and related species in the intergeneric hybrids.Approach:Alien gene transfer into durum wheat will be carried out by tools of classical and molecular cytogenetics.  The cytogenetic techniques will involve sexual hybridization between durum cultivars and wild grasses,coupled with induction of pairing among chromosomes of parental species by manipulation of the pairing-control mechanism(Ph1).  This approach will facilitate transfer of alien chromatin into the durum genome, which will then be characterized using fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization (fl-GISH) and chromosome-specific markers.  Using this approach, alien addition lines involving diploid wheatgrass (Lophopyrum elongatum and Thinopyrum bessarabicum) chromosomes or chromatin with FHB resistance will be developed.  In addition to using these two diploid wheatgrasses as donors of FHB resistance, we will initiate new crosses with other potential donors such as Thinopyrum junceiforme and Thinopyrum nodosum (= Lophopyrum nodosum) that may provide new sources of alien chromosomes with resistance.  Fertile hybrid derivatives and stable alien addition lines will be screened for FHB resistance using the techniques we have already standardized."

PAUL,MN,55108,UNITED STATES,,,10.001,2008,,,"Objective(s): The overall goal of this research plan is to identify and characterize genes that can be used to improve disease resistance in wheat. Four objectives will address this goal. Objective 1: Use marker-assisted selection to introduce new Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance into hard red spring wheat. Objective 2: Use transcript profiling and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to identify wheat genes involved in resistance to rust pathogens. VIGS will be completed in collaboration with Steve Scofield, ARS West Lafayette, Indiana. Objective 3: Use the model plant Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) to identify and validate genes involved in stem rust resistance in wheat. Objective 4: Coordinate the Uniform Regional Performance Nursery for Spring Wheat Parents. Wheat improvement is a balancing act because it requires the simultaneous selection of multiple diverse traits to develop superior new cultivars. Two of the three diseases that are subjects of investigation here (FHB, leaf rust) presently cause economic losses to the U.S. wheat crop, while the third disease (stem rust) has the potential to do so. By taking a multidisciplinary approach to improving wheat disease resistance as proposed in this research plan, multiple avenues for protecting wheat against these three diseases will become available. Providing strategies, knowledge, and tools for improving wheat disease resistance, as delineated by the first three objectives, will lead to reduced yield losses attributable to FHB and leaf rust, and will ensure that the potential disease threat from stem rust can be addressed proactively. The fourth objective subsequently provides an opportunity for all spring wheat breeders to evaluate the overall performance of advanced germplasm, including assessment of resistance to FHB, leaf rust, and stem rust, in addition to overall agronomic quality.Approach:Wheat is the most widely grown crop in the world and is a major staple crop for humans. Wheat is economically very important to the United States, which ranks third among all countries in wheat production and is the world's largest wheat exporter. Despite its importance as a crop, low prices that are generally paid for wheat grain result in small profit margins for producers. Further, both abiotic and biotic stresses can cause significant fluctuations in U.S. wheat production. Reducing wheat losses associated with the fungal diseases Fusarium head blight, leaf rust, and stem rust will enhance both the stability and profitability of U.S. wheat production. This research project seeks to contribute to the goal of controlling these three diseases by completing integrated genetic, molecular genetic, and genomics research that will further our understanding of genes and underlying molecular processes in wheat that are involved in resistance to each of these diseases. The results of this research will provide both new resources and new knowledge that can be used to increase resistance to each of these three diseases in wheat. This will lead to improved wheat yield and yield stability and will ensure that the U.S. wheat crop is protected against current and future disease threats."

A set of 50,000 SNPs, selected from across the genome, will be identified and genetically mapped in cultivated soybean as well as in a newly created cultivated x wild soybean population.  The same SNPs will be used to characterize 16,795 soybean landraces as well as a set of 96 elite soybean cultivars and 1,116 wild soybean genotypes.  This will allow an assessment of linkage disequilibrium and population structure across the genomes of the landraces, elite cultivars and wild soybeans.  Association Analysis will be assessed as a new approach to detect genes/QTL underlying the important trait of seed protein concentration.  The high resolution genetic maps in both cultivated x cultivated and cultivated x wild soybean populations combined with QTL analysis of traits related to soybean domestication will facilitate the identification of regions in cultivated soybean which, in comparison to wild soybean, have little or no genetic variation as a result of ôselective sweepsö that occurred during soybean domestication.  A universal set of 1536 soybean SNPs with high rates of polymorphism and even distribution across the genome will be developed and used to discover QTL underlying a number of disease resistance and quality traits in soybean.  In addition, DNA marker development in hexaploid wheat will be continued and these markers and other SSR markers previously developed in our laboratory will be used in QTL analysis for a number of important traits in hexaploid wheat."

Strategically evaluate (phenotype) small grains genetic resources for priority biotic and abiotic stress resistance, quality factors, and other priority agronomic traits, and incorporate phenotypic data into the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) and/or other databases.  Make newly-found major genes and adult-plant genes for Ug99 stem rust resistance available to breeders for incorporation into adapted germplasm for the United States.  Characterize the genetic variability in small grain genebank collections via genotyping with leading edge genetic marker technology and geographic information systems.Approach:Acquisition priorities include the wild relatives of Triticum, Hordeum, Avena, and Oryza to fill species and ecogeographic gaps in the crop collections. Geographic regions of special interest are the Caucasus and Central Asia.  These gaps will be primarily addressed by collection expeditions and exchanges with other genebanks.  All acquisitions will follow USDA-APHIS protocols to avoid the introduction of harmful diseases and insects.  Mapping populations and other genetic resources developed in the Barley and Wheat Coordinated Agricultural Projects (CAP) will be stored and distributed as part of National Small Grains Collection (NSGC) genetic stock collections.  Established procedures will be used to maintain and regenerate all NSGC germplasm accessions, with special attention to seed preparation and planting, plant pathogen monitoring, harvest, and laboratory processing.  Seed will be provided to the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation for safety back up.  New information technology will be identified to increase the quality, accessibility, and value of the data collected.   The project will either conduct or coordinate systematic evaluations of important traits.  The small grains Crop Germplasm Committees (CGC) have previously developed lists of descriptors for evaluation and are consulted regularly for evaluation priorities.  Several evaluations, ongoing for a number of years and considered high priority by the CGC, will be continued.  Ug99 stem rust resistance research will focus on identifying new major and adult-plant genes in wheat landraces and making the new sources of resistance available to breeders for transfer to adapted germplasm for all regions of the U.S.  Evaluation of rice germplasm will be coordinated at the USDA-ARS Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center, Stuttgart, Arkansas and data will be returned to Aberdeen for inclusion in GRIN.  SSR markers will be employed to genotype the NSGC core subsets of wheat and barley, totaling 5,500 and 2,577 accessions, respectively. To eliminate variation due to heterogeneity within accessions, single-plant-selections for each core accession will be generated for genotyping.  Resulting data will be analyzed to better understand genetic variation within the collection, including the relationship between variation and geographic origin of accessions.  Country, state/province, locality, and latitude/longitude data for NSGC accessions are maintained in GRIN.  Traits of interest will be mapped and analyzed using GIS software and appropriate statistical techniques. Because stem and stripe rust of wheat and barley are of current concern worldwide, priority will be given to mapping the geographic origin of resistance.  Accession genetic diversity in the core collections, based on molecular marker data will be mapped to better understand its relationship to accession geographic origin, to elucidate relations between geographic patterns of molecular diversity and trait diversity, and to do gap analysis to identify priority areas for future collection.Replacing 5366-21000-022-00D (3/08).FY09 Program Increase $175,000FY10 Program Increase $37,200"

Historically, once such gene complexes were identified and characterized they were manipulated into a hexaploid wheat background for improved production. Once the options for trait improvement genes in the available wheat germplasm were exhausted wheat geneticists turned to other members of the Triticeae tribe (cereals) as desirable genetic resources for trait exploitation. However, to date only a few gene complexes from non-wheat related species and genera have been characterized, manipulated and introduced into wheat. The lack of advancement in this area results from an undesirable linkage drag, resulting in low yields, that is associated with the transference of gene complexes from related species. This laboratory has developed methods for the efficient transferring of value-added gene complexes, without linkage drag, from rye into wheat for wheat improvement. This project will utilize these previously developed technologies of chromosomal centric-break and fusion translocations to transfer the value added traits of disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance from rye and wheat-rye hybrids (triticales) to commercially useful hexaploid wheat cultivars. In particular the project will focus on 1. Identifying novel genetic elements associated with resistance to new strains of stem rust linked to rye chromosome 1R within local and world stock collections of triticales and spring ryes for transfer into hexaploid wheat, and 2. Identifying, characterizing and transferring novel genetic elements, regardless of chromosomal location, for resistance to stem and leaf rusts and tolerance to low pH and saline soils for transfer into hexaploid wheat. Objective 1:  Develop, evaluate, and distribute wheat-rye aneuploid stocks. Objective 2:  Use rye genes and gene complexes to improve stem and leaf rust resistance and abiotic stress tolerance in wheat.Approach:To create and characterize wheat containing 1RS/1BL wheat/rye translocations. The present discovery-driven objective was designed to screen all newly developed wheat/rye translocation stocks, from every rye chromosome arm, for resistance to new races of leaf and stem rust, as well as screen for new levels of tolerance to select abiotic stresses."

Despite their economic importance, little is known about the molecular interactions between Hessian fly and wheat that result in resistance or susceptibility, the molecular mechanism of resistance in wheat, or the effects of these interactions on the genetic structure of fly populations.Approach:Objective 1:  Gene expression in compatible and incompatible wheat-Hessian fly interactions will be assessed by microarray technology and 454FLX sequencing.

We will utilize existing sources and identify new sources of resistance, introgress them into desirable backgrounds, and then release them for use as parents of commercial cultivars. The second objective is to increase our understanding of the molecular basis of parasite virulence, host resistance, and stress tolerance to support strategic development and deployment of genetic resistance. Greater understanding of secreted virulence/avirulence effectors in the Hessian fly and the leaf rust pathogen may lead to better strategies for durability. Greater understanding of the mechanisms of durable rust resistance and heat tolerance may lead to discovery of new genes or alleles with complementary mechanisms and to optimized gene combinations in new cultivars.

Some minor crops such as alfalfa, sesame, and guar appear to be increasing in this region as effective alternatives in a cotton rotation system. Water is the key limiting factor in crop production and dryland production is dependent on the timeliness and total amount of rainfall. Record cotton yields have been recorded over the last three years in part due to favorable environmental conditions (temperature and water), crop genetics, and improved crop protection. A key limiting factor to crop production is pests. At least 12 billion dollars annually are lost due to weeds growing with crops in the United States.

The threat to groundwater and surface waters is well recognized and understood; the threat to air quality is more poorly recognized but no less real. Nitrogen trace gases can significantly affect regional / global climate over long time scales, as can other trace gases such as methane. Agricultural landscapes may play a critical role in global balances, and the inclusion of perennial biofuel crops in these landscapes represent a mitigation option. Our research is showing that crop management can significantly affect nitrous oxide production and methane consumption in Michigan corn-soybean-wheat rotations. Importantly, low-input management strategies do not necessarily affect gas fluxes less than high-input management ? in fact systems in which leguminous cover crops substitute for inorganic fertilizers can have higher nitrous oxide fluxes, and similar methane fluxes. Specific modern management practices in general may, however, have less of a long-term impact than the simple historical effect of original land-use conversion. This means that the transient seasonal fluxes of gases from row-crops may occur on top of a baseline flux that is already significantly elevated following original forest clearing, with elevated levels maintained by high rates of nitrogen cycling in highly productive cropping systems ? regardless of the source of this nitrogen. Because of the importance of these gas fluxes to global climate change, and the potential for changes in environmental policy that could affect future crop management options it seems important to better understand the nature of elevated fluxes in row-crops ? from the standpoints of both long-term legacies related to land use change as well as contemporary management impacts."

J.",,,555456995,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,LINCOLN,NE,68588,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2008,,,"Primarily due to the highly variable climate of semi-arid western Nebraska, dryland crop production risk in this region is high. Winter wheat-fallow systems have been adopted to reduce the risk of crop failure. However, reduced risk is accompanied by reduced profit potential. More intensive dryland systems offer the potential for increased profitability, but may also increase farmer risk - both production and market risk. In addition to the potential positive economics of producing crops more frequently than once every two years, more intense crop rotations offer additional benefits. Precipitation is more efficiently used. Leguminous crops may be used to minimize reliance on synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. The production of greater crop residues will reduce soil organic matter losses and soil erosion. Longer rotations also provide an opportunity for pest control, often without the use of pesticides, that is not available in winter wheat-fallow systems. Longer and more diverse crop rotations allow producers to spread costs, labor, and risk more evenly throughout the crop year. The potential outcomes from these research activities include: a decision support tool for growers to use to help them decide when to use summer fallow and when to plant a fallow-replacement crop, a 20% reduction in the number of acres devoted to summer fallow by 2013, and at least 100,000 acres of dryland devoted to production of bio-energy crops in the Nebraska Panhandle by 2013. The potential impact of this work will include a reduction in the use of summer fallow by reducing the risks of crop failure associated with continuous cropping. Reduced use of summer fallow will increase the profitability of dryland cropping systems and reduce the negative environmental consequences of summer fallow, which include increased soil erosion and degradation of soil quality. An increase in bio-energy crop production will provide dryland growers in western Nebraska the opportunity to participate in this rapidly growing market segment, which may result in increased income and a diversification of market opportunities."

Canola, Brassicaceae family, is a cool season annual crop grown mainly in Europe and Canada (Younts, 1990). In 1985, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration changed its regulations to allow the use of low erucic acid rapeseed oil (canola oil) for human consumption in the United States. The U.S. food industry quickly recognized the nutritional benefits of canola oil and began to market canola oil as a cooking oil and to utilize it in a growing number of processed foods. Rapid and widespread acceptance of canola oil by health-conscious American consumers has dramatically increased the demand for domestically grown canola. To-date, domestic production of canola has not been able to keep pace with this escalating consumer-driven demand. Southeastern farmers are in an excellent position to profit by supplying expanding canola markets in rotation with currently grown crops. Mild winters, adequate winter rainfall, the potential to double-crop and the availability of local oilseed processing facilities make the southeastern US a promising site for canola as a cool season component to a rotation focusing on seed oil production. Research conducted in the southeast indicates that canola can be grown successfully in this region as a fall-planted winter annual. Machinery required and production costs for canola are similar to those for wheat, with profit potential equal or better than that of wheat. In order to develop a sustainable rotational cropping system that targets maximum seed oil production research is required. Cotton and soybeans are not new to Alabama producers. But canola is a new crop in this region. Consequently, research field trials related to appropriate seeding rates, planting dates, and water and nutrient requirements are needed. One of the investigators in the current project has been intimately involved in testing canola varieties in Alabama, and is providing a viable seed variety for this research study. This is fortunate, because at present only a few of the canola varieties tested are available to producers in the southeastern United States. In addition, crop rotations are commonly used to stabilize yield, reduce nematode populations, break life cycles of insects, and reduce pathogen inoculum. Conservation tillage is a best management practice that not only stabilizes yield, but reduces nonpoint source pollution from runoff, maintains organic matter, and conserves energy. Combining irrigation with those practices should increase yield, particularly in years of inadequate rainfall. This proposed study also allows economic comparison of a traditional cotton-cotton rotation to a bioenergy rotation. Agronomic data will be collected in order for producers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management and the potential of alternative crop rotation."

Increasing costs, changing markets, and off-site environmental concerns interact to create a need for better understanding of production efficiency and ecological impacts of irrigated sugar beet systems. The project will provide data that is lacking for these systems, including soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics, nitrogen (N) cycling, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and tradeoffs between economic performance and soil sustainability. This data will provide decision support in the short term and will leverage funding for future, more in-depth research and extension in the mid to long term. This interdisciplinary project would build upon past AES-CGP-funded work by analyzing how rotation systems for pathogen control affect soil quality and productivity under different soil and water conditions. Our primary objectives are to describe ecological and economic sustainability and to make results available to growers. The 16 scenarios include four on-farm crop rotations in place for 10 or more years on clayey and sandy soils and under furrow- and sprinkler-applied irrigation. Each production scenario will be replicated three times and will include an unfertilized pair. The four rotations will be defined by a project advisory team of producers and agricultural advisers. The primary pitfall of this study design is the variability of production practices from farm to farm. We plan to minimize variability through the field selection process and by carefully recording practices within each of the 16 scenarios. The project addresses the first and second priorities of the 2008 RFP by: 1) assessing economic viability and maintenance of the resource base; and 2) evaluating long-term impacts of farming systems on the resource base as on-farm soil quality and off-site contributions to air and water quality. The project addresses the discovery and dissemination focus areas defined in the University of Wyoming College of Agriculture mission. Working closely with a project advisory team of Big Horn Basin producers and ag advisers, along with inclusion of University of Wyoming Cooperative Extension Service (CES) Area Agricultural Educators on the research team, will ensure both the relevance of research questions and the dissemination of results. The instruction mission of the College is also addressed because both graduate students and College faculty with teaching appointments in three departments will participate in the project. Though this proposed work is broad in scope, its coincidence with complementary projects managed by the Project Director will facilitate field and laboratory work and sharing of human resources and equipment.

Wheat with white seed coats will generate flour and flour products that are more desirable without the expense or reduced nutritional content that results from bleaching. The purpose of this study is to understand the mechanism of control of wheat color. If this system of control of seed color is the same as that for photomorphogenesis, we have produced a very valuable tool (white wheat) for the study of combinatorial gene regulation at the level of transcriptional factors and we are also positioned to analyze the cross talk between combinatorial gene regulation resulting in such biological processes as grain dormancy, grain color and resistance to preharvest sprouting."

Much of the increased corn acreage was achieved by producing corn on non-rotated fields (corn-on-corn). With increased corn-on-corn and increased conservation tillage practices, the risk for foliar diseases on corn increases. This increased risk for diseases, combined with higher market prices recently observed for corn, may contribute to the profitable use of foliar fungicides on corn, but more research is needed to determine under what circumstances and disease levels this potential profitability can be achieved. Similar to corn, the circumstances and disease levels under which fungicides can be profitable on soybean and winter wheat in Illinois also needs to be determined. Winter wheat growers in Illinois have access to a Fusarium head blight risk assessment tool, which can help them make fungicide application decisions (De Wolf et al., 2003), but more research is needed to determine the accuracy of this disease forecasting model in Illinois."

M.",,,619003127,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,ATHENS,GA,30602-0001,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2008,,,"Rust is considered to be a major threat to soybean production in the United States. Serious yield losses can occur if P. pachyrhizi, the causal agent of Asian Soybean Rust (ARS) becomes well established in the Continental United States, which is likely since there are no soybean cultivars with broad spectrum durable resistance. The major objective of most breeding programs is to identify genetic resistance to plant diseases. This is especially true of soybean. Significant efforts are being made to determine the location of the gene, or genes, controlling resistance that can assist in the rapid and efficient development of new resistant varieties. The durability and stability of plant disease resistance is also a fundamental issue, as it is an important asset in new cultivars. Considering that durable resistance is a reasonable goal, the specific strategies used to achieve this goal may be improved by a thorough characterization and analysis of the inheritance of resistance. To characterize the inheritance pattern of soybean resistance to P. pachyrhizi, this project proposes to identify genes involved in defense, determine their potential function and better understand the molecular and genetic processes of soybean and P. pachyrhizi interactions that lead to disease resistance (specific and slow-rusting) or susceptibility, with the intent of rationally developing durable broad spectrum disease resistance strategies. To our knowledge, the proposed project will provide the first look at the relationship of the molecular, genetic and morphological events involved in soybean race specific and slow-rusting resistance to P. pachyrhizi. An important part of this work is the elucidation of the genetic regulation involved in specific and slow-rusting resistance to ASR. This lends the opportunity to manipulate the resistance response by possibly up-regulating identified genes that are necessary for resistance in response to rust infection and down-regulating genes that are unnecessary or possibly have negative effects. Probably the most intriguing aspect of this work will be the comparison of inheritance patterns of soybean slow-rusting resistance with those of wheat and maize, where partial resistance has been successful in controlling rust fungal diseases. Questions regarding plant disease resistance that have left breeders, farmers and scientists perplexed include; Why has slow-rusting resistance proven to be more durable than specific resistance and how can this type of resistance be used to develop new durable resistant varieties? To address these questions, it will be necessary to gain a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of resistance that is unstable (specific) and one that remains effective (slow-rusting), providing incite as to the requirements for durable resistance and the mechanism controlling this resistance, whether it be gene-for-gene or other mechanisms. The work outlined below will contribute to a framework for understand the molecular and genetic basis of slow-rusting resistance and designing novel strategies to develop soybean cultivars whose resistance to ASR lasts over time."

More attention should be given to develop economically viable and environmentally-sound sustainable crop production systems. In 2006, Louisiana was among the top ten largest producers of cotton, sugarcane and rice in the United States. With the increasing demand for crop-based biofuel, corn, soybean, wheat and sugarcane acreage are expected to rise. Louisiana's agriculture is diverse, consisting of a wide array of crops growing on different soils. The reduction in productive lands, increased public concern for environmental quality, and economic constraints brought about by expensive and limited nutrient inputs emphasize the need for more effective soil fertility and nutrient management practices. The validity of fertilizer guidelines from multi-year and multi-site response trials can be altered in response to current changes in crop varieties, cultural management practices, and soil testing methodologies. Therefore, the value of soil testing as a tool to understand and manage fertilizer nutrients relies on frequent verification of fertilization guidelines which can be accomplished through field calibration studies. Also, remote sensor-based precise management schemes for N, the most important and the most limiting nutrient in crop production, needs to be developed. This proposed project intends to address critical gaps in soil testing and fertilizer recommendation guidelines for major crops of Louisiana. This would lead to more precise and efficient fertilizer management schemes that will result in optimum agronomic, economic and environmental returns in crop production."

First, by looking at the genetic relatedness of different species of rust fungi, a classification for these fungi will be developed that can also be used to help researchers predict the behavior and identity of unknown disease agents. Secondly, specific genes will be sought and developed as molecular markers that will allow disease-causing fungi to be rapidly identified even in new environments."

The goal of our program is to design winter wheat, oat, and triticale cultivars for specific adaptation areas and management programs in Texas. Focus will be on the Blaklands, southern, and central Texas. Our program will collaborate with a parallel center of excellence at Amarillo and Vernon Texas on breeding and research of winter wheat and triticale. Our main breeding objectives are to increase yield and yield stability, improve biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, and enhance end-use quality. Our program will also work on increasing genetic diversity and improve selection efficiency. Early generation development will be done using traditional crossing techniques in greenhouse environments at College Station and Amarillo. The source of parents included in the crossing block will be: elite adapted lines from the Texas AgriLIFE Research winter wheat breeding programs at College Station and Amarillo, elite adapted lines from other breeding programs in the Great Plains region, and un-adapted breeding lines from other breeding programs in the Great Plains region as well as international centers and institutes. Exotic germplasm will be used to improve genetic diversity especially for traits such as leaf, stem, and stripe rust resistance, forage production, and heat stress tolerance. The modified bulk method will be the major procedure for developing winter wheat, oats, and triticale lines in our program. Cultivar and germplasm registrations will be published in the Journal of Plant Registrations. Research findings, facilitated through graduate training, will be published in refereed journal articles.

FHB epidemics can cause significant yield losses, shriveled kernels, and deposition of vomitoxin (Deoxynivalenol (DON)) in the infected seeds which renders the grain unsuitable for human consumption and feed (McMullen et al., 1997). Wheat and barley losses caused by FHB epidemics in the USA during the 1990s were estimated at close to $3 billion U.S. dollars (Windels, 2000). The development and deployment of resistant germplasm is an environmentally sustainable method for the control of FHB. Several species of the Fusarium genus are known to cause FHB (Wiese, 1987). F. graminearum and F. culmorum are the primary Fusarium species causing DON contamination and reduced grain quality. F. graminearum survives between wheat crops in living or dead host tissues (Zhu and Fan, 1989). Wheat planted after maize often has significantly more head blight than wheat planted after other crops. Therefore, reduced tillage in soil conservation systems increases the amount of inoculum present (Teich and Hamilton, 1985). Wheat production in Idaho ranks 5th in the nation in 2006. Adding FHB resistance to current cultivars is critical and valuable for our growers to maintain sustainable high quality grain production in national and world markets. FHB epidemics occurred in sprinkler-irrigated wheat and barley fields in south central and eastern Idaho in 1982 and 1984, resulting in estimated yield losses as high as 50% (Michuta-Grimm and Foster, 1989). Scab epidemics occurred in sprinkler-irrigated spring wheat and barley fields in Montana in 2006 and 07 and resulted in estimated yield losses over 50% (Luther Talbert, personal communication). With the increase in corn production (for dairy and biofuel), and no-till or conservation tillage in the area, it would be beneficial to have an active FHB resistance program to insure that future cultivars carry some resistance if corn production, especially under no-till, continues to increase in acreage in the south central and south eastern part of the state. Changing production practices and increasing temperatures in the PNW, as predicted by climate models, may increase the risk of FHB. Therefore, incorporation of FHB resistance into existing germplasm may prevent or reduce future losses."

This Hatch project will focus on the seasonal and long-term shifts in nutrient cycling, microbial ecology and carbon sequestration that occur as growers adopt alternative agricultural systems. Four long-term experiments that include an organic vegetable cropping system in Western Washington, an organic small grain system in Eastern Washington, a direct seed experiment cropped to various wheat rotations, and a biofuels experiment.

To help guide important societal choices, we must better understand how ecosystems have been perturbed, and how they may change in the future. We need basic understanding of exchanges of heat, moisture, and trace gases within the planetary boundary layer, and how land management modifies these accordingly. These fluxes are dynamic and responsive to each other, and they combine with land and ocean surface characteristics to influence atmospheric circulation, and large-scale climate patterns. In turn, the Earth's climate system affects vegetation structure, function, and global distribution. To improve understanding of these climate-biosphere feedbacks, the study of environmental change has gradually adopted an integrated approach, in which global systems are often studied in unison using numerical models. This integrated study approach is best exemplified by Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), a new class of ecosystem models. These models combine biogeography, soil biogeochemistry, and soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer components, allowing for vegetation characteristics, the soil environment, and nutrient availability to respond to atmospheric forcing and land management change. DGVMs are currently indispensable for the study of plant distribution, ecosystem structure and function, and climate feedbacks in the context of both global climate change and land use change. To respond to the need for a modeling approach that accounts for both managed and natural ecosystems within a single framework, we have implemented process-based models of agricultural row crops and management choices into an already well-tested DGVM, the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS). A new regional U.S. version of IBIS (Agro-IBIS) simulates corn, soybean, and wheat cropping system dynamics, including complete terrestrial nitrogen cycling. Agro-IBIS accounts for human management (e.g., irrigation, fertilizer application, planting and harvest date, hybrid selection) and the effects of environmental stressors (e.g., water and soil nitrogen limitations) and atmospheric CO2 on crop development and regional carbon, water, and energy exchange with the atmosphere. In this project, we propose an interdisciplinary modeling effort that will analyze the response of carbon, water, and energy cycling to multiple, interacting global change drivers within the Midwestern U.S. Specifically, we will determine the general location, timing, and magnitude of changes in water availability, vegetation distribution, and crop yields brought about by changes in: (1) atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), (2) regional climate (precipitation and temperature), and (3) agricultural land management. We will study the effect that these perturbations have on ecological, biophysical, and biogeochemical processes and the associated changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, both from a historical and prognostic perspective (covering the 1948 to 2100 time period across the Upper Mississippi, Missouri, and Great Lakes basins)."

The Bill will continue the generous support afforded to U.S. producers under previous farm bills. While the provisions for support may not be likely to change significantly, it is certainly the case that current conditions represent an agricultural market environment that has not been experienced before. In particular, record high prices prevail in most program commodity crops. Further, current levels of market volatility represent a sustained period of very high variance in commodity prices. These conditions have largely been demand-driven and largely reflect recent energy policies of the U.S. Row crop nearby futures prices (corn, soybeans, and wheat) are experiencing record high prices levels that are more than double their 25 year history. it is clear that the significant shocks to markets realized over the last couple of years have important implications for U.S. farm policies. In particular, many of the policies and provisions in place currently (e.g. LDP and CCP payments) have trigger levels (e.g., loan rates) well below current (and expected future) price levels, making these policies of limited relevance to producer decisions. Further, existing farm policy models are not calibrated to price levels or the significant price volatility currently being witnessed in the market place. A growing concern of U.S. agricultural policy makers in this new environment is how to cope with the substantial increase in price volatility that is occurring. For example corn and soybean price volatilities were 19.6% and 19.4% in 2002. By 2008, these volatility levels had increased to 30.3% and 31.3%, respectively. Current policy deliberations have called for  safety nets  that take into account not only higher price levels but also these more volatile price levels. One important change to farm policy included in the current versions of the Farm Bill pertains to counter-cyclical revenue protection plans. These programs provide protection against yield and/or price shortfalls."

The Blue Revolution was named after the Green Revolution, which saw major increases in plant yield during the 20th century because of newly bred semi-dwarf varieties of wheat and rice. These varieties nearly doubled agricultural yields in the countries where green revolution varieties and growing techniques were adopted. Annan's challenge is a global one, but it is also particularly important to California, since a major portion of California's water supply is used for agriculture. Although the water-use problem is a complex one and its solution will be multi-faceted, the development of new  water-smart  crops and farming practices are likely to be central parts of the ultimate solution. This has intensified the urgency of research on plant water-stress responses so that the discoveries of basic science can be translated into new crops with better water-use and drought tolerance. Although residential water accounts for approximately 10% of total use (~70% agriculture, 20% industry), almost half of residential water is used for outdoor irrigation. Thus, efforts to develop drought tolerant crops will also benefit non-essential crops (i.e. those not intended for human consumption). The PI's research program has generated a number of strategies for engineering drought tolerance and this proposal explores the application of these technologies to perennial grasses. The project complements ongoing efforts to create drought tolerant crops and addresses an important area of water use critical in urban environments."

Inherent to Twitter is an asymmetrical relationship between friends and followers thereby provides an interesting social network-like structure among the users of Twitter. Twitter messages, called tweets, are restricted to 140 characters and thus are usually very focused. Twitter is becoming the medium of choice for keeping abreast of rapidly breaking news. This project explores the use of Twitter to build a news processing system from Twitter tweets. The result is analogous to a distributed news wire service. The difference is that the identities of the contributors/reporters are not known in advance and there may be many of them. The tweets are not sent according to a schedule. The tweets occur as news is happening and are noisy while usually arriving at a high throughput rate. The goal of this exploratory research project is to find effective methods for making Twitter a useful news gathering mechanism. Challenges addressed in this project include: removing the noise; determining tweet clusters of interest bearing in mind that the methods must be online; and determining the relevant location associated with the tweets. The broad impact of this research is to make it easier to disseminate late breaking news and enhancing the distributed news gathering and reporting process.

In particular it will study models for the stochastic fluctuations of rankings and for assessing the reliability of rankings.  It will develop nonlinear methods for variable selection, and for quantifying the association among variables, in very high-dimensional problems.  And it will take up in detail the problem of defining and accessing, in an empirical way, the notions of probability density and mode for functional data.  Problems involving rankings arise in a very wide variety of contexts.  Examples include the ranking of universities or other institutions on the basis of measures their performance.  However, relatively little is known about the reliability of rankings, which after all are based on empirical evidence which is subject to error.  The research program will study this matter in depth.  Methods for variable selection are required in an increasingly wide range of practical problems, for example the selection of genes in terms of their apparent influence on disease and mortality.  The research program will focus on this problem in relatively complex cases, where the relationship between the variables and health issues is unusually complex.  Functional data, for example where the data are recorded in the form of curves rather than numbers, are encountered in fields as diverse as assessing the protein content of wheat to exploring ways in which the characteristics of climate change over time.  However, the extent to which conventional statistical notions, such the concept of the `most likely data value,' are valid for such data is not well understood.  The research program will remove this obscurity."

Its molecular basis is not understood, except that genetic differences between parents are the likely cause. This work addresses the following hypothesis:  Hybrids suffer regulatory impairment because the parental contribution to regulatory complexes is mismatched in structure or amount. Relaxed regulation results in activation of pathways that cause enhanced growth . To test this hypothesis, RNA abundance, allelic contribution, and chromatin state will be investigated using hybrids of rice. The objectives are to: (i) compare the effect of evolutionary distance on parents and hybrid expression differences and parental expression preference; (ii) correlate expression changes to promoter activity and changes in repressive chromatin state, and (iii) examine the effects of hybridity on regulatory networks to determine if genes associated with growth are targets of hybrid misregulation. This analysis will entail a novel technology called cDNA-RESCAN to distinguish parental expression contributions at an effective cost, and will employ a bioinformatic and computational team for dissection of regulatory hierarchies. By exploring a specific hypothesis of heterosis, this work will provide important information on the overall regulatory effect of hybridity. Because the biological system is rice, the best understood grass genome and globally, the most important food crop, the acquired knowledge is likely to impact both our basic understanding of cellular function and the molecular understanding of pathways that may affect yield in wheat, maize and other critical crops for the US economy. Educational components of this research will involve training of undergraduates from local and from under-represented communities.

The objective of these planning visits is to identify priorities for the utilization and development of genomic tools for the major New World orphaned crops species [e.g., quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus and A. cadatus), tarwi (Lupinus mutabilis), yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus), cañahua (Chenopodium pallidacule), oca (Oxalis tuberosa), and mashwa (Tropaeolum tuberosum)].  Genetic resources, such as DNA sequence-based genetic markers, genetic linkage maps, and gene libraries are essential tools for understanding and improving the genetic basis of agriculturally important traits in crop plants.  The use of DNA markers and gene manipulation (including genetic modification and transgenics) are now commonly used in combination with traditional breeding methods to accelerate and enhance varietal development of the major food staples.  Unfortunately, many regionally important crop species (commonly referred to as orphan crops) lag far behind the major commodity crops (maize, soybean, wheat, rice, etc.) in terms of the development of these advanced genetic tools due to their status as minor crops in the U.S and Europe.  In addition to their regional importance as food and feed crops, these species are also of interest to the broader community of plant scientists due to their remarkable adaptation to severe environments and exceptional nutritional qualities.  The work will be done in collaboration with Jorge Rojas-Beltran of the Fundación PROINPA, Cochabamba, Bolivia; Ivan Maureira Butler of the National Agriculture Research Institute, Carillanca, Chile; Luz Gomez Pando of the National Agricultural University La Molina, Lima, Peru; and Eduardo Peralta of the Instituto Nacional Autónomo de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, Quito, Ecuador.     U.S. scientists will benefit from the interaction with these Latin American colleagues who will provide important lessons in applied research and agricultural practices and needs in developing countries.  From these planning visits, a framework will be developed for future research proposals and a genomics workshop proposal."

Scholars who study these spaces refer to them collectively as  the black counterpublic  -- a space where everyday talk occurs and black identity is defined, negotiated, and often contested.  This doctoral dissertation research project will focus on black religious spaces and the racial identity formation, linkages, and contestations that occur within the spaces of two food programs in two seemingly distinct black religious organizations.  The Nation of Islam owns Muhammad Farms in the rural South Georgia town of Bronwood; its stated purpose is to feed all black people in the United States.  Wheat Street Baptist Church operates a traditional emergency food program that primarily serves homeless people and low-income residents in the Atlanta neighborhood of Auburn Avenue.  This project will expand scholarship on race and racialized public spaces by (1) investigating the racial identity formation that occurs in black religious spaces; (2) recognizing that religious spaces among blacks are not just comprised of black Protestants but also include black nationalist religions; (3) exploring how different black religious groups use community food outreach programs to define black identity in identifiable spaces; and (4) exploring how both differences and commonalities contribute to defining a racialized group of people.  The doctoral candidate will use a multi-method comparative investigation of the two groups' food programs, conducting interviews, participant observation, and archival research to examine how and in what context the programs have developed as well as the manner in which volunteers view the day-to-day actions and overall goals of their work with food.  First-hand experiences alongside other volunteers will help generate understanding of the spatial configuration of the two food programs, and the implications for the groups' development of racial identity and community coherence.  The data collected will be coded and textually analyzed using critical discourse analysis.The results of this study will add to basic understanding about racial identity, how questions of race and religion guide the work of food programs, and how meanings of race and identity evolve and compete across different geographic spaces.  Scholars and leaders in the black community often have described the social activism that exists in many black churches as an  unknown phenomenon  that goes largely unnoticed by white society.  The project is expected to shed new light on but also complicate notions of race, place, and community.  Recognizing and investigating the important discussions and everyday talk that occurs among blacks in these religious spaces is expected to reveal them to be important sites for future geographic inquiry.  In addition to providing new scholarly insights about race, religion and food, the project should broadly impact how black religious organizations are discussed in popular culture and the media, particularly the misconceptions and simplification often assigned to actions occurring in these spaces.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career."

Cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice and barley are most affected by drought during the time of flowering and initiation of grain formation, causing drastic yield losses. The goal of this project is to develop a systems biology view of drought responses in cereals to understand this complex process and improve drought resistance and water use efficiency. Genome-wide comparative transcriptome analysis of drought responses in rice and maize will be integrated into a cereal drought gene interaction network, using ortholog information to predict conserved functional relationships as a basis for cereals. Conserved orthologous regulatory genes between rice and maize involved in drought responses and resistance will be identified comprising transcription factors (TFs), protein kinases and phosphatases, genes in hormone signaling pathways, chromatin binding proteins, protein degradation and small RNA pathways. As proof of principle, a set of these putative conserved rice and maize genes will be tested by genetic analysis of mutants and natural allelic variants, assessing them for altered drought response phenotypes and perturbation in the drought gene interaction network. These analyses will validate and improve the cereal gene interaction network predictions, and provide candidate genes for improvement of drought resistance/tolerance in cereals. With respect to broader impacts, this project will contribute through the generation of information key to the development of stable food production systems worldwide and through the creation of a transdisciplinary educational environment. Scientifically, the project will demonstrate the use of an integrated network approach to understand complex plant responses such as drought response and resistance. Outreach and training activities are integrated within the transdisciplinary plant-lab-bioinformatics project and will be made accessible to high school and underrepresented undergraduate students from institutions across Virginia and North Carolina through established programs at Virginia Tech and other nearby universities. An outreach program developed as part of a NSF-Cyberinfrastructure Training, Education, Advancement, and Mentoring for Our 21st Century Workforce (CI-TEAM) project will provide modules for quantitative data analysis for teachers and students using socio-environmental case studies from research data. An integrated mentor program for postdoctoral researchers will be used to facilitate career development. International research collaborations with the Generation Challenge Program and CGIAR institutes involved in drought research will add capacity building to agricultural systems worldwide.  Plant genotypes and all data developed in the project will be made available through a project website (http://cereal-drought.vbi.vt.edu/) that will allow interactive access to data and networks. Other publicly available genetic stocks used will be distributed by the respective originators with long term public repositories.

Immediately after its formation, a polyploid plant can be identified simply by counting its chromosomes, because it has twice as many as a diploid. However, after millions of years a polyploid may have as low a chromosome number as a diploid through a process called  diploidization.  Genomic studies can detect such cryptic polyploids, and the advent of high-throughput sequencing has made this approach increasingly feasible. Using this new technology, this project will estimate the frequency of polyploidy in the phaseoloid legumes, a group that includes soybean, common bean, cowpea, pigeonpea, and other less familiar crops, by sequencing thousands of transcribed genes from approximately 25 phylogenetically diverse species. Polyploid events will be identified by their characteristic signature, an excess of genes with two copies duplicated at the same time. The project has broad significance for genetics and systematics, given the importance of polyploidy as a genetic phenomenon, and also for agriculture, because polyploidy is so common among crop plants (e.g., soybean, wheat, maize, cotton). The large numbers of genes will be a resource for subsequent studies in this large and important lineage. A talented female postdoctoral associate will receive training in the generation and analysis of next-generation sequencing data."

LOUIS,MO,63132-2918,UNITED STATES,,,47.074,2009,508688.0,,"Intellectual Merit     Plants constantly encounter pathogen attacks, especially from pathogenic fungi.  As part of various defense strategies to protect themselves against fungal attack, plants produce small antifungal proteins known as defensins.  Defensins are produced during the normal growth and development of plants and also in response to fungal attack.  Some of these proteins are potent inhibitors of fungal pathogens.  The PI and his research team have isolated two plant defensins, MsDef1 and MtDef4, from Medicago spp. that inhibit the growth of Fusarium graminearum, a fungal pathogen which causes devastating head blight disease in wheat and barley.  The constitutive expression of these proteins in transgenic plants affords strong protection from fungal attack.  A critical issue that needs to be addressed for effective use of these proteins in transgenic crops is understanding their structure-activity relationships, modes of action and the mechanisms by which fungal resistance to these proteins might emerge.  Preliminary data suggest that MsDef1 and MtDef4 have different modes of antifungal action and act independently on F. graminearum.  The planned research will identify the structural features and active sites that are essential for the unique antifungal activity of these proteins.  In addition, the fungal toxicity pathway utilized by each protein will be elucidated.  Broader ImpactsThe planned research will shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which antifungal plant defensins inhibit the growth of fungi.  This knowledge will enable an effective long-term use of these proteins for biological control of fungal pathogens in transgenic crops.  The research will also help establish the foundation for crop and mammalian safety, thus providing a greater sense  of security about the use of these proteins in transgenic crops.  Moreover, knowledge gained from the planned studies will facilitate future discovery of environmentally safe fungicides.  In addition, this project provides a training opportunity for a postdoc as well as minority undergraduates and high school students.  The PIs will continue to coordinate with and provide research opportunities through existing programs for students at the Danforth Center.  Participants will learn not only protein biochemistry and engineering, but also cutting-edge fungal genomics and proteomics technologies.  To enhance the wider scientific impact, presentations at professional meetings and publications in peer-reviewed journals are planned."

Oxalate oxidase catalyzes the carbon-carbon bond cleavage of oxalate to yield carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide.  Although there is currently no structural information available for oxalate oxidase from C. subvermispora (CsOxOx), sequence data and homology modeling indicate that it is the first manganese-containing bicupin enzyme identified that catalyzes this reaction.  The best characterized oxalate oxidases are from barley and wheat.  These enzymes, also known as germins, contain a single cupin domain and are therefore classified as monocupins.  Interestingly, CsOxOx shares greatest sequence homology with the bicupin microbial oxalate decarboxylases.  The short term goals of this research are to 1) to characterize the manganese-dependence of oxalate oxidase from C. subvermispora and 2) to identify the active site of the enzyme.  This research is expected to contribute to the understanding of how subtle structural changes effect remarkable functional variation in evolutionarily related proteins.  Characterizing the manganese-dependence of CsOxOx is significant in order to place this enzyme in the context of other oxalate degrading enzymes and that of other cupin proteins.  Identifying the active site of CsOxOx is an important problem.  If only one of the manganese centers mediates catalysis, critical questions are raised concerning the function (if any) of the second Mn-binding domain and the extent to which local protein structure in each domain results in differential reactivity.Broader ImpactsThis project is transforming Gainesville State College (a two-year unit of the University System of Georgia) from an institution that provides excellent coursework in the sciences into one that also provides students the opportunity to participate in meaningful and important laboratory research.  Undergraduate students carry out most of this work at Gainesville State College (GSC), but also have the opportunity to work with collaborators at the University of Florida and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL.  Student researchers are expected to communicate their research experiences to broad audiences through diverse media.  Student researchers also are expected to publish their results and report research findings at professional meetings and to the regional educational community.  Funds from this project are used to acquire, operate, and maintain research equipment that is not otherwise available at GSC."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Mary M. Guisinger is  Using plant plastid genomes as the model system to develop bioinformatic tools for characterizing genome evolution.  This research is being conducted at the University of California-Berkeley under the sponsorships of Drs. Chelsea Specht and Rasmus Nielsen. Biology is moving into the post-genomics era.  In the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of genome data pubicly available; however, this has led to a bottleneck in terms of analyses. Over 100 land plant plastid (chloroplast) genomes are currently available on GenBank, and this is largely due to their relatively small size, conserved nature, and the development of inexpensive, high-throughput sequencing methods. Crop plants, especially members of the plant order Poales (including the grasses, i.e. wheat, maize, rice, oats, sorghum, sugarcane, and barley), have received particular attention. Several plant nuclear genomes have been sequenced, including rice, and projects are in progress to sequence six additional grass nuclear genomes. Ongoing genome sequencing projects promise to provide an avalanche of data available for researchers. This project is creating tools to automate the examination of rates and patterns of genome evolution using the Poales as a model system. Plastid genome data provide a densely sampled and phylogenetically resolved framework for developing and testing these new methods. The training objectives include developing computational and programming skills and enhancing the understanding of molecular evolution, plant biology, and bioinformatics. Broader impacts include utilizing an interdisciplinary approach leading to collaboration with researchers in the fields of biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics."

Many of these pathogens can deliver proteins into the cytoplasm of their host cells to disable host immunity; these proteins are called effectors. The mechanism by which these proteins enter host cells is poorly understood. The investigators have shown that oomycete and fungal effector proteins can enter host cells without the aid of any pathogen-encoded machinery, but instead rely on short amino acid sequences in the N-termini called RXLR motifs. The investigators have discovered that the RXLR motifs can bind a class of membrane lipids called phosphoinositides. In this project, the investigators will test whether binding of the effectors to phosphoinositides is actually responsible for transferring the effectors into host cells. They will identify which host phosphoinositides are utilized by the effectors, and they will characterize the mechanism of binding. Finally they will test whether it is possible to block effector entry and so prevent disease. An extremely wide range of the most destructive plant pathogens, including those causing wheat rust, rice blast, grape powdery mildew and potato late blight depend on effectors. Understanding effector entry and determining how to block it would provide an entirely new approach to treating this broad class of diseases. Treatment of animal diseases caused by fungi, oomycetes and some parasites may also be treatable by this approach. This project will train two graduate students and provide summer research opportunities for multi-cultural undergraduate students."

The dwarf cultivars of wheat and rice developed during the Green Revolution in the 60s remarkably increased the grain yields.  Recent studies revealed that these cultivars are modified in their GA production or responses to GA, illustrating the important role of this hormone in regulating plant development and in agriculture.  GA-promoted growth and development is modulated by DELLA proteins, which are major negative regulators (repressors) of GA responses.  Recent work in the PI's laboratory (funded by NSF) has made transforming findings that the GA receptor directly targets DELLA for degradation.  There is also evidence suggesting multiple layers of regulation on the DELLA protein activity.  DELLA is a master growth repressor, which integrates not only the GA signal, but also other hormone signals as well as biotic and abiotic signals (such as light conditions, pathogens, cold and drought stresses).  Although DELLA plays such a pivotal role in regulating plant growth, very little is known about how DELLA activity is regulated.  Preliminary data support that protein modifications play important roles in modulating DELLA function.  Future research in this project will elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. Broader Impacts:DELLA proteins are functionally highly conserved in Arabidopsis and in many crop plants.  For example, the semi-dwarf wheat cultivars, an essential component of the Green Revolution, contain mutations in the Rht loci that encode DELLA proteins.  This study will likely to have a broader impact in improving quality of agricultural crops.  In addition, a postdoctoral fellow and four undergraduate students will gain research experience in this project.  The findings of this study will be incorporated into three undergraduate courses at Duke University.  Students will learn to appreciate how the information gained from studies in a model plant system can be used to improve agriculture practice and benefit society."

Intriguingly, these phytohormones are made not only by the plants in which they serve to regulate growth and development, but by certain plant-associated fungal and bacterial microbes as well. While gibberellin phytohormone biosynthesis has been largely elucidated for higher plants and fungi, which seem to have independently evolved/assembled the corresponding metabolic pathway, the basis for such biosynthesis in bacteria remains enigmatic. Even in higher plants, the origins of gibberellin metabolism remains obscure. Further, there have been recent discoveries demonstrating the existence of novel gibberellin metabolism (particularly catabolism) in higher plants, which have unexplored implications in plant biology. Building on previous NSF-supported studies, this project will both further investigate gibberellin metabolism in higher plants and also define the analogous biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. The bacterial pathway appears to represent yet a third example of a convergent evolutionary solution to the puzzle presented by such complex natural products biosynthesis. These studies will also provide insight into the evolutionary origins of gibberellin metabolism in plants. Thus, the planned wide-ranging studies will provide a comprehensive overview of gibberellin phytohormone metabolism in a phylogenetically diverse group organisms. Gibberellins have played an important role in agriculture, as it was alterations in such phytohormone metabolism that led to high yielding semi-dwarf varieties of rice and wheat, which were a critical component of the  Green Revolution . The biosynthesis of gibberellin phytohormones by plant growth promoting bacteria that are commonly applied to legume crop plants offers additional agricultural significance. Further, the absolute requirement for gibberellin production in higher plants has provided a genetic reservoir of biosynthetic genes, duplication of which has led to a vast super-family (~7,000 known) of related diterpenoid natural products, exhibiting various biological activities and physiological roles (e.g., as defensive antibiotics). Hence, this project, while specifically directed at gibberellin metabolism, will offer insights into a much broader group of natural products.Broader ImpactOn-going broader outreach efforts also will be continued and expanded. Beyond the inclusion of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in research, work will be continued with high school students and those from under-represented groups. In addition, the project includes presentations to junior and senior high school science teachers to provide concrete examples of how basic research underlies and informs technological advancements that improve the human condition. An important example is the relationship of gibberellin to the  Green Revolution  as noted above."

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).The origin of flowering plants represents one of the most significant evolutionary radiations of plants during the last 475 million years.  With over 250,000 extant species, angiosperms are the largest and most diverse group of plants to have evolved.  It has long been assumed that the first flowering plants formed a nutrient-storing and embryo-nourishing tissue called endosperm that is derived from a second fertilization event during the process of double fertilization.  Indeed, many evolutionary biologists have suggested that endosperm represents a key innovation associated with the ecological and evolutionary ?success? and radiation of flowering plants.  Although poorly studied, there is fragmentary evidence that many of the most ancient lineages of angiosperms do not rely upon an endosperm as the primary embryo-nourishing tissue within the seed. It is the explicit goal of the project to study the embryological processes within seeds of ancient extant lineages of flowering plants in order to reconstruct the pattern of embryo-nourishing behavior of the first angiosperms.  The comparative developmental data to be derived from this project have the potential to lead to the discovery of a  missing link  associated with the transition from the ancestors of flowering plants to the earliest angiosperms.  Among the broader impacts of this project, it should be noted that two out of every three calories consumed by humans worldwide are derived from the endosperm of flowering plants (e.g., rice, maize, barley, wheat, coconut).  Thus, examination of seed development in ancient lineages of angiosperms will provide basic biological information that may ultimately be relevant in an applied and agricultural context.  In addition, the questions to be addressed in this project are sufficiently basic to warrant the expectation that the findings will contribute to undergraduate and graduate curriculum development at the national and international levels, as has been the case in the past.  Discoveries from this project can be expected to be widely disseminated to the general public.  During the last grant cycle, research findings were publicized in a number of media outlets including CBS News, USA Today, Natural History Magazine (invited article), New Scientist, Science News, the Telegraph (U.K.), as well as a variety of websites from around the world.  Finally, this project can be expected to contribute to the development of human resources in the sciences and the advancement of members of underrepresented groups in the sciences.  The Friedman lab has consistently included a high proportion of women and members of underrepresented groups, all of who aspire to careers in the life sciences as educators (two recent members of the lab have gone on to teach secondary science in public schools) and/or practicing scientists (the most recent Ph.D. student to graduate is Hispanic).  In essence, while the vast majority of funds associated with this project will go to support the solution of basic and longstanding scientific questions, these funds will also be central to the development of a few of the next generation of biologists and teachers."

In addition, they  separate the darnel from the wheat  with a remarkable selectivity that allows them to detect a chemical signal while being completely insensitive to another molecule almost identical (from an anthropomorphic perspective). By using biochemical, biophysical, molecular biology, and electrophysiological approaches, the project will dissect molecular interactions of moth sex pheromone with an odorant receptor and other olfactory proteins. The goal is to unveil how these olfactory proteins contribute to the extraordinary sense of smell of the insect. Understanding the molecular basis of the inordinate sensitivity and selectivity of the insect olfactory system will open the door for the development of not only strategies for insect pest control, but also biomimetic devices for industrial and homeland security applications.  In addition, these research activities will be a platform for training graduate students as well as for professional development of postdoctoral scholars for academic and/or scientific careers.

The PI requests funds to support attendance of young researchers and participants from minority-serving institutions. The annual ICAR brings together approximately 1,000 participants. Arabidopsis serves an outstanding model system due to the numerous and varied experimental tools in functional genomics that are available. The transfer of knowledge from Arabidopsis to other plant species, and beyond to other organisms including humans, is increasing due to the efforts of the research community and the leveraging of advances and resources. This conference provides an opportunity for the exchange of ideas among the numerous and diverse researchers of the international Arabidopsis community and beyond to the larger plant community. This year's conference will include a number of speakers whose research involves wheat, rice, maize, and barley. The conference will include a broad range of important and current topics: Genome Organization/The RNA World, Development, Cell Biology, Systems Biology, Signaling in Development, Bioenergy, Environmental Responses, Plant Defense, Plant Growth Regulators, Natural Variation, Hot Topics and Novel Tools/Resources. Important components of the conference include the presentation of current research by approximately 90 speakers (both invited and from selected abstracts) and 600 posters as well as several community organized workshops where smaller groups can explore more specific topics in greater detail. Broader Impact A particular strength of the ICAR lies in its ability to enhance the exchange of information at the forefront of Arabidopsis research worldwide, creating new networks and collaborations. The conference program and abstracts will be publicly available on the conference website and permanently archived. The ICAR also has a long and successful history of being inclusive of young scientists as well as women and minorities. Support of this year's proposal will provide full funding for several underrepresented US minorities and/or faculty as well as partial funding of travel expenses for additional young domestic faculty, postdoctoral scholars, or graduate students. A special luncheon to acknowledge recipients of US-sponsored minority funding and to establish an informal networking venue as well as an  Emerging Scientists Luncheon  is planned. Many of the oral presentations at the sessions and workshops will be given by graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty.

In order to develop a complete map and finished sequence of the 3.2 Gb human genome, an independent high-resolution marker scaffold composed of 40,322 unique sequence tagged sites was constructed using ninety whole-genome radiation hybrids (RHs). This RH-based physical map was then used to order sequence information for more than 15,000 contigs to create the complete human genome map. The success of RH mapping in humans has inspired its use in the construction of complete physical maps for the majority of animal genomes prior to complete sequencing. This project will use a simple yet elegant method of developing high-resolution RH physical maps that will be used to anchor existing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contigs and clones for the 4.2 Gb D-genome of hexaploid wheat. This anchoring and alignment will complement a larger effort by the international wheat genomics community to develop a global physical map and whole-genome sequence of this genome. The tools, methods, and knowledge developed in this project can be applied to other crop species and will facilitate the construction of physical maps at a fraction of the cost of current methods. The maps generated will provide easy access to genes of biological and agricultural importance and will enable the development of new strategies to manipulate wheat to better serve the needs of a growing world population. In addition, the information developed in this project will allow for comparative analysis of wheat with rice, maize and other grass genomes to address important biological questions regarding gene organization and chromosome evolution.  Access to the tools, methods, and knowledge developed in this project will be available through the project website (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/RHmapping).  Seed for all lines will be available by contacting project personnel or through the USDA National Small Grains Collection (Aberdeen, ID).  In addition to the training of project students and postdoctoral associates, the project will partner with minority serving institutions including Mississippi Valley State University and the University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez to engage minority undergraduate students with an eight-week summer research training program in molecular genetics and bioinformatics."

Mutant analysis has provided knowledge regarding genes that influence the differentiation and maturation phases of endosperm development, but much less is known about early development and its consequences. Studies in maize and wheat suggest the extent of cell division during early development plays an important role in grain yield, but little is known about its genetic basis. While it is difficult to study early endosperm development in most cereals, this is easier with maize, because the embryo sac can be isolated and the endosperm cultured in vitro. This project seeks to develop a novel method to investigate early development in maize endosperm by microinjecting nucleic acids into 2-3 days after pollination (DAP) embryo sacs. This approach has advantages for transforming endosperm because it does not require the time and labor-intensive procedures associated with current methods of producing transgenic maize plants. There are risks associated with these experiments, but if successful could be transformative for identifying the genetic mechanisms that regulate early endosperm development and the results, which can be accessed at http://ag.arizona.edu/research/larkinslab/index.htm, could have valuable practical applications."

Besides being a major food source, seeds propagate, store, and disperse plants. Seeds are like lifeboats for embryonic plants. It is essential that seeds germinate only under conditions that will allow the seedlings to thrive and the species to survive. Thus seed germination is exquisitely regulated by the balance between two plant hormones, abscisic acid (ABA) and GA. During embryo maturation ABA triggers a condition called seed dormancy which prevents seed germination, even under favorable conditions. Dormancy is relieved by a period of dry storage or afterripening. This requirement for after-ripening assures seed dispersal over time as well as space. GA stimulates seed germination and has been implicated in after ripening. Plants such as Arabidopsis and tomato have an absolute requirement for GA synthesis to germinate. This project uses Arabidopsis to determine how the GA signal is perceived leading to germination. Germination is repressed by DELLA transcription factors. In Arabidopsis, GA stimulates germination by triggering destruction of the DELLA RGL2 protein. This destruction requires the GA receptor GID1 and the F-box protein SLY1. Interestingly, germination can occur in sly1 mutants that produce high levels of DELLA protein when seeds have been after-ripened a long time or when the GID1 receptor is over-produced. This suggests that a new mechanism controls seed germination and implicates the GA receptor. Three mechanisms will be tested: 1) DELLA-repression is bypassed by a parallel pathway; 2) DELLA is inactivated by interaction with the GID1 receptor; and 3) DELLA is inactivated by phosphorylation or ubiquitination. Elucidating these mechanisms will benefit society by providing molecular genetic methods to improve crop seedling establishment, yield, and resistance to preharvest sprouting in cereals like wheat.

EE is thought to be mediated by both IgE and non-IgE mediated food allergy.  The majority of patients with EE (50-80%) are atopic based on the co-existence of EE with atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and/or asthma.  In addition, the vast majority of EE patients have food allergen specific IgE based on immediate hypersensitivity skin tests or measurement of allergen specific IgE in blood.  Approximately 75% of EE subjects had increased total IgE levels.  Approximately two thirds of children with EE have positive immediate hypersensitivity skin tests to at least one food allergen.  The mean number of positive food immediate hypersensitivity skin tests ranges from 3-6 positive tests per subject with EE.  The most common foods reported to be positive in EE by skin immediate hypersensitivity skin test included common food allergens (i.e. peanut, egg, milk, soy, wheat) as well as beans, rye, and beef.  Dietary therapy is considered an effective therapy in children diagnosed with EE.Objective/Hypothesis:  Although studies of the genetics of EE are in their infancy, the importance of genes to the development of EE has been demonstrated in studies showing an important association of EE with a SNP in the eotaxin-3 gene, a chemokine gene important to eosinophil chemotaxis into tissues such as the esophagus.  In this study, we are particularly interested in identifying genes in EE linked to a significant complication of EE namely esophageal stricture formation.  Esophageal stricture formation is a significant complication of EE resulting in food impactions and emergency room visits.  Thus, identifying genes which contribute to esophageal remodeling and esophageal stricture formation may lead to biomarkers to detect patients at risk of this complication, as well as potential novel therapies.Specific Aims:  The focus of the genetic studies in EE, we have proposed has two specific aims: 1)  Does expression of TGF-b and the TGF-b TT genotype promote the development of remodeling in EE? 2)  Does inhibition of AMCase reduce the development of eosinophilic inflammation, OVA food allergen specific IgE, and esophageal remodeling in egg induced EE ?Study Design:  We will characterize SNPs in two candidate genes of esophageal remodeling (TGF-b, acidic chitinase) in patients with EE (n= 200), as well as in controls (n= 200) matched for age, gender, and ethnic background.  Levels of esophageal remodeling and expression of TGF-b and acidic chitinase will be quantitated in esophageal biopsies.  The importance of TGF-b and acidic chitinase to the development of egg-induced remodeling of the esophagus will be studied in a mouse model in which either TGF-b signaling is inhibited or acidic chitinase activity is neutralized.Impact:  This study focuses on increasing our understanding of two genes associated with remodeling and stricture formation in the esophagus in EE.  If these genes contribute to esophageal remodeling and esophageal stricture formation, their identification may lead to biomarkers to detect patients at risk of this complication, as well as potential novel therapies."

Students will gain insight into the  art  and science of breeding cross and self-pollinated plants, and South Dakota State University industry partnerships will provide students with a window to private and public breeding programs. Distance education tools and breeding programs in ND, NE, MN, and MT will enable expansion of this learning environment. Fitness costs are associated with maintaining and implementing resistance gene mechanisms in model species. Costs might be acute when crops are under abiotic stress. Breeders strategize that pyramiding resistance genes will enhance resistance; however, if expression of resistance genes is at the expense of yield, this may be counterproductive. We propose using markers to combine leaf rust genes in sunflower and spring/winter wheat varieties. Using similar genetic wheat genotypes with cloned resistance genes, we will develop similar genetic lines with 0 to 3 leaf rust resistance genes, and compare the yield of these lines in drought and non-stressed environments. Outputs will be sunflower and wheat germplasm with enhanced leaf rust resistance and the outcome will impact breeding strategies for emerging diseases."

We propose to build on our existing programs to train future plant breeders that are able utilize genomic tools, navigate a wealth of data with bioinformatics and synthesize research perspectives from both vegetable and grain breeding as part of their modern skillset. To create this nexus, we have proposed a program that will use student training and curriculum development to bring together fundamental and applied plant breeding research. This project will directly support two graduate students and provide research experiences for sixteen undergraduates. Applied plant resistance breeding programs in fusarium head blight in wheat, Septoria leaf spot in tomato, cyst nematodes in potato, pyramiding Phytophthora blight/virus/bacterial spot in pepper, and northern leaf blight in maize will be used to provide students with summer internships and rotation and thesis projects. The Solanaceae Genome Network and Gramene will offer academic year research projects in genomic databases/bioinformatics. Curriculum will be enhanced by creating new courses and creating learning materials from them. These projects will be advised groups from an institutional education committee, seed producers, growers, processors and private sector plant breeders. Expected Outcomes Sixteen undergraduates will have a better understanding of how the different areas of plant breeding for disease resistance are related. Their experiences will provide informed encouragement to continue their education in Plant Breeding and related fields. Two PhD students will receive state of the art systems training in Plant Breeding for biotic stress resistance. New curricula will be developed and existing courses will be enhanced. Students will advance the progress in the described projects."

Our work and that of others has established that the ability of this fungus to cause disease is primarily dependent on its ability to produce multiple toxins. The production of one or a combination of these toxins distinguishes the different forms (races) of this pathogen. On the host side, different varieties of wheat are differentially sensitive to one or a number of these toxins and consequently susceptible to the races that produce them. Therefore, understanding how these toxins work will help us control this serious disease. Furthermore, understanding how this pathogen causes disease will contribute to an understanding of other plant diseases, especially those that demonstrate similar properties. Our long-term goal is a complete understanding at the molecular level of how this fungus causes disease on wheat and includes the identification/characterization of the genes involved in both the pathogen and the host that contribute to the disease interaction. This proposal which consists of three objectives, will further our understanding of this disease. In the first objective, biochemical and gene-expression analyses of the host will be conducted to further our understanding of how one of the fungal toxins, called  ToxA  alters wheat metabolism to allow the fungus to cause disease. In the second objective, extensive analyses of gene-expression in the fungus will permit the identification of genes used by the fungus to cause disease. In the third objective, biochemical analyses will be conducted to determine the three dimensional structure of another of the toxins produced by this fungus called  ToxB . Structural analyses of ToxB will help us to determine how and where this toxin interacts with wheat. Completion of the proposed studies will contribute to our understanding of this serious disease and ultimately help to control or prevent this and other plant diseases that limit food production worldwide."

The latest threat arose in 1999 when a new highly virulent strain, Ug99 (race TTKSK) was identified in Uganda and has since spread into Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen and recently Iran. Ug99 and its variants threaten most of the barley and wheat grown worldwide. The research proposed herein will initiate the work of identifying and characterizing avirulence genes in stem rust races. Once the avirulence genes and proteins are identified and characterized it will allow better understanding of how stem rust races shift their virulence/avirulence characteristics and provide knowledge for developing genes that confer long-term durable resistance."

It has long been assumed that these fungi deliver proteins, called effectors, across plant cell membranes to block defenses and assume control. However, few such proteins have been identified from fungal pathogens and nothing is known about how effector proteins enter plant cells. The hemibiotrophic fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, causes the globally devastating rice blast disease, as well as increasingly-serious emerging diseases such as wheat blast in South American and gray leaf spot on turfgrasses in the US and Japan. We have previously shown that M. oryzae induces formation of a novel structure, the Biotrophic Interfacial Complex (BIC), when it first enters living rice cells, and that effectors secreted by the fungus accumulate in this structure as the fungus continues to grow in the host cell. We also demonstrated that effectors that accumulate in BICs are translocated into the invaded rice cytoplasm, and subsequently move ahead into adjoining rice cells, presumably to prepare them before fungal invasion. PURPOSE: The goal of this project is to identify the structural features of the pathogen?s effectors and mechanisms that mediate their delivery into living host cells. Effector delivery in the rice blast system first involves secretion from the fungus into BICs and then translocation into host cells across the plant membrane. Our first objective will be to identify the structural features of effector proteins that allow them to specifically accumulate in BICs. Our second objective will be to identify the structural motifs that allow the secreted effectors to cross host membrane and enter the host cytoplasm. To understand the targeting signals and translocation mechanism, we will use confocal fluorescence and electron microscopy of fungal strains and rice lines expressing fluorescent reporter proteins, and we will purify effector protein and interacting proteins from infected rice tissue. We will also investigate the role for previously defined secretion components in the BIC accumulation pattern. We will determine the structure of the BIC and investigate the role BICs play in delivering the disease-promoting proteins inside plant cells. Discovery of specific protein motifs that target secretion or translocation of effector proteins will allow us to use the available fungal genome sequence to identify, for the first time, a complete set of effectors from a fungal plant pathogen. Understanding effector secretion systems used by a fungus to control living plant cells, and identifying effectors that mediate this control will provide new targets for protecting agricultural crops from disease. Additionally, some effectors also contribute to resistance by interacting with cognate resistance genes and triggering the plant?s powerful hypersensitive response to block disease. This research addresses Priority 1 of the AFRI Microbial Biology: Microbial Associations with Plants Program: Elucidation of molecular mechanisms of disease and resistance interactions between microbial plant pathogens and their hosts."

In this interaction, recognition of the toxins leads to susceptibility unlike a typical resistance mechanism where host recognition leads to resistance. We have published or submitted for publication five of these HST - host gene interactions. Additionally, we have accumulated evidence for four more interactions. Each of these nine interactions involves a single proteinaceous toxin that interacts with the host (wheat) leading to disease. We will plan to characterize the newly identified interactions, 2) clone the associated HST encoding genes from the pathogen for further analysis of individual interactions, and 3) do functional analysis and evaluate the mode of action of SnTox3, a recently cloned toxin from Stagonospora nodorum. S. nodorum is a complex necrotrophic pathogen, both at the individual isolate and population level; however, based on our current evidence, the underlying mechanism of disease is based on independent gene-for-gene interactions. Knowledge of the underlying disease mechanism opens the door to a concentrated study of the individual interactions in this system. The expected outputs, as presented, will provide fundamental knowledge of how this type of fungal pathogen (necrotroph) induces disease.

Deep, loess-derived soils effectively store winter moisture and allow the region to produce some of the highest dryland winter wheat yields in the U.S. The predominant crop rotation is winter wheat-summer fallow, though longer rotations with one year of fallow in every three years of cropping, or no fallow at all, are also common. The soils are subject to water and wind erosion during the fallow phase of the cropping cycle, particularly under conventional tillage, which leaves the soil surface bare. Reducing tillage can reduce or eliminate soil erosion, but it also makes seeding more difficult, increases diseases, and impacts weed and nutrient management. STEEP has developed cropping techniques such as direct-seeding, residue management, weed control, and disease and nutrient management, and extension has encouraged adoption of these technologies. The use of conventional tillage has declined by more than 50% in the last twenty years with production shifting to reduced tillage and direct-seeding systems, along with a 75% decrease in erosion and a 50% reduction in sediment in rivers. This is a transition year for STEEP: Pacific Northwest agriculture continues to face many on-going challenges: rising input prices, increasing global competition, changing rural communities, and competing production and environmental goals. The purpose of this request is to launch a comprehensive, long-term research effort to address contemporary issues facing Pacific Northwest agriculture. The program would be sustained by competitive funding. The mission of this program is to improve environmentally sensitive, globally competitive agriculture in the Pacific Northwest. The overall goal is to develop secure, economically viable and environmentally sensitive food, feed, fiber, and feedstock production systems in the PNW. We propose to fund two main projects and hold some funds in reserve for funding a transitional project to be externally reviewed at a later date. Specific objectives of the three projects are 1) measure socioeconomic impact of the STEEP program on Whitman County, WA and Latah County, ID farmers from 1980 to 2010, including changes in conservation practices, income, and stewardship satisfaction, 2) identify key factors relevant to expanding adoption of soil conserving farming systems in the PNW 3) establish or use existing long-term field sites and assess impacts of residue removal by mechanical harvest and burning on economic returns and subsequent crop performance, 4) assess environmental impacts of residue removal by mechanical harvest and burning on sites established in Objective 3, 5) develop field-scale and regional assessments of economic and environmental trade-offs associated with harvesting or burning crop residues, 6) develop a cyberinfrastructure to support a PNW transdisciplinary, long-term agroecosystems research program with goals to optimize carbon management for sustaining and enhancing soil productivity of the region while addressing needs for greater food, fuel, fiber and feed production."

The work outlined in this grant is directed toward a novel solution to this long-standing global problem: the development of perennial wheat varieties which will dramatically curtail wind and water erosion due to constant ground cover. Integration of perennial wheat into diverse cropping systems will also provide numerous other benefits over current models and help address other agricultural issues. The constant ground cover of perennial wheat will provide improved wildlife habitats, disrupt prevalent disease cycles, make more efficient use of water and establish a potent carbon sink. Such a system would also have the potential for integrating straw retrieval and marketing into a small grains cropping system in a more sustainable way than is possible with current practices. Our approach is to develop perennial varieties of wheat using hybrids between wheat and a perennial relative, Thinopyrum. These hybrid lines are tested in model systems in the low rainfall areas of the Pacific Northwest, where the problems of soil erosion and degradation are particularly severe."

Weedy plants are generally well-adapted to the regions they infest, require minimal inputs, have high water-use efficiency, and are largely resistant to diseases and insect pests. The problems they cause are due to their ability to thrive as a result of production practices that favor their establishment in agricultural environments, but this ability to prosper under cultivation suggests that, with a focus shifted to biomass production, some of these plants might be valuable. We propose to investigate the biomass and bioproduct potential of several weedy plants that can be grown in the Northwestern region of the United States. These projects emphasize different aspects of moving a potential biomass product to fuel or product formation, including understanding the genetic, genomic, biochemical, and physiological constraints and possibilities of plants that are essentially undomesticated. The proposal focuses on four plants: poplar, giant reed, prickly lettuce, and a sterile A. cylindrica x wheat hybrid that is speculated to have higher productivity than either parent under low moisture and low nitrogen conditions. Poplar was identified in the USDA-DOE Billion Ton Initiative report as having significant biomass potential for the Pacific Northwest region. The subproject included here has the joint objectives of evaluating the effect of diverting lignin precursors away from lignocellulose formation and of using these precursors to produce aromatic monomers that could be valuable feedstocks for fuel and materials production. Giant reed (Arundo donax) is a fast-growing monocot that has unusually high productivity, particularly for a plant that uses C3-type photosynthesis. We speculate that giant reed may have solved some problem in the biochemistry or physiology of photosynthesis that constrains the growth of other plants. Preliminary results from work carried out in the last year support this notion. Prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola) is an invasive weed that contains a high molecular weight latex rubber. The objective of this subproject is to study the variability in the quantity and composition of the latex, with the idea of understanding whether this level is under genetic control and whether there is a possibility of increasing the maximum amount produced to commercial levels or of identifying the synthases used to produce it. The project involving wheat x Aegilops hybrids will explore whether there is a kind of hybrid vigor between the crop and the weed that will give greater biomass production, especially in low-moisture and high-temperature growing conditions. The hybrids themselves are almost completely sterile, allowing them to direct more energy into vegetative growth, and setting up the possibility for cultivating them under controlled conditions. Photosynthetic characteristics of the hybrid strains will be assessed, along with the level of productivity and the quality of the material produced."

Al toxicity is the primary limitation to crop production on approximately 50% of the world's potentially arable lands, including ~20% of North America as well as in many developing countries, where food security is most tenuous. Rice is a staple crop for half the world's population and is a major U.S. agricultural export. Rice is significantly more Al tolerant than other grasses, including maize, wheat and sorghum, but our understanding of the genetic, molecular and physiological mechanisms of rice Al tolerance is still limited. With higher levels of Al tolerance and abundant genetic and genomic resources, rice is a good model to investigate cereal Al tolerance. The goal of this research is to identify the major genes involved in Al resistance in rice and provide a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms of Al resistance. The activities outlined in this proposal will allow us to: 1) Identify, clone, and characterize the gene(s) underlying a major and novel rice Al tolerance QTL we have recently identified. 2) Develop near isogenic lines (NILs) containing the major Al tolerance QTL for use in breeding and physiological studies. 3) Conduct full-genome association mapping using 500 O. sativa and O. rufipogon genotypes to identify novel chromosomal regions (50-500kb) conferring Al tolerance in rice. 4) Determine and characterize the physiological mechanism(s) underlying rice Al tolerance. The findings from the proposed research on the elucidation of the molecular and physiological basis of the very high Al tolerance expressed in rice, will allow for more efficient breeding of acid soil-tolerant rice varieties and also provide important new molecular and genetic resources for improving acid soil tolerance of cereal crops in general."

The hypothesis for this project is that novel genes and signaling pathways are activated in response to stress, manipulation of these genes and pathways will increase crop yields. The objectives are to: 1) identify naturally occurring genes and signaling and acclimation pathways activated in wheat and soybean seed development in response to a combination of drought, heat and water stress; 2) determine the whole plant adaptability and physiological responses to stress using genomic and basic research techniques; and 3) develop mechanistic-based mathematical equations that predict the impacts of water and temperature stress on soybean and wheat growth and development. Field, growth chamber, and greenhouse studies will be conducted. Genetic control and signaling pathways will be assessed using traditional phenotypic measurements as well as using molecular and genomic techniques for transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome responses. These data will be used to generate mechanistic-based mathematical models that predict the consequences of heat and water stress on yield and grain quality. Correctly matching local conditions with plants having the appropriate level of stress tolerance, can have environmental as well as economic consequences."

We aim to tie together many branches of research into unintended gene flow by developing a model that will predict the risk of outcross in a number of crops that have been previously studied separately. The first objective is to develop a combined model incorporating a mesoscale weather forecasting model, a pollen dispersion model and a risk assessment model that together will be able to predict the risk of outcross in a number of different crops and in a variety of environmental and topographical conditions. This will be done by creating a framework to combine the inputs and outputs of the three models so that they work together to produce an array of products that could be used by growers to assess their risk of contamination. These products will include information regarding pollen dispersion and viability in addition to outcross potential. Our second objective is to validate the model using the studies available to us through previously published research and our own collaborations. There is a wide range of crops and conditions that have been studied and have published or archived results which can be used to validate this new model. For this research, we will compare modeled results with published results for maize, bentgrass, ryegrass and wheat. With an initial framework in place to model multiple crops, adaptation to additional open-pollinated crops of interest will require only the addition of the necessary pollen characteristics such as aerodynamic properties and environmental effects on viability to the model. This research represents a step towards making widespread forecasts of outcross risk a tool for growers to use to assess real-time risk. We plan for this to be a community model that will be available to researchers in the U.S. and elsewhere. To this end, we will use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO, to generate the meteorological data necessary to predict outcross. This is the primary limited-area atmospheric model currently used by the U.S. atmospheric research community, and a branch of WRF is the principal model used operationally by the National Weather Service (NWS) in the United States for day-to-day weather prediction. Therefore the framework would already be in place for assimilation of real-time data into this risk-assessment model. After further development, we envision a predictive tool that will be capable of predicting outcross both on a field scale and on a regional scale."

These common losses severely impact incomes, economies, and government and school revenues. While wheat has numerous adaptations to drought, some decrease yield, such as during hot and dry conditions when low stomatal conductance and impaired energy dissipation leads to premature senescence. Leaf wax can however limit transpirational water loss by reflecting excess light and heat while maintaining a tempered canopy with adequate turgor longer during drought for improved growth, and reproduction. Optimizing its composition is our long term breeding strategy to reduce irrigation and maintain yield under drought. The wax or cuticle is comprised of an outer epicuticle, the cuticle proper, and the wall embedded cuticular layer, each composed of complex of polymeric cutins and long-chain hydrocarbon waxes. The importance of the layers and composition to drought tolerance is poorly understood. Our objective is to define their importance by linking the QTLs that regulate the individual layers and varied composition to yield stability during drought stress in wheat. We will achieve this using: 1. A QTL mapping population derived from an Australian cultivar with three cuticle layers versus a prominent US cultivar with only a single epicuticular layer, 2. In collaboration with CIMMYT, an association mapping panel of 300 drought tolerant wheat cutltivars and adapted landraces will be evaluated by ourselves and colleagues in drought prone Texas, Middle Eastern and African environments."

Pst populations change their virulence amazingly rapidly by mechanisms that are largely unknown. Pst is recalcitrant to classical genetic manipulations because it is an obligate biotroph without a sexual stage; our best chance of understanding its genetic nature and interaction with wheat lie in comparing genomic and transcriptome sequences of different isolates and comparisons to related rust fungi. This project will thus allow a wide community of researchers to use genomic approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of pathogenicity and the biotrophic life-style of rust fungi. The successful completion of this project will primarily impact the scientific community by providing information on the genome and expression of an important fungal plant pathogen. Several groups are prepared to use the genome sequence for work in identifying candidate pathogenesis genes, genetic mapping, and expression analysis. A comparative website for rust fungi will be developed at the Broad Institute to disseminate the information on the genome of P. striiformis, and allow comparison to other genomes, including P. graminis and P. triticina. These resources will be used by a broad community of scientists in the public and private sector interested in basic fungal biology, host-parasite interactions, fungal evolution and the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from rust diseases. Furthermore, this project will provide educational opportunities for students to actively participate in fungal genomics and bio-informatics research and broaden the participation in basic science by underrepresented groups. In addition, this project will provide opportunities for postdoctoral education and training a new generation of scientists.

In the U.S. over last half a century wheat yield has been constantly increasing due to improved agricultural practices and development of new genetically improved cultivars. However, genetic improvement of wheat still falls behind the other crops, such as soybean and corn, mostly because of the lack of support from industry. Public sector researchers are largely responsible for providing new varieties to U.S. farmers. To maintain the steady progress in developing new improved varieties wheat breeding programs need a broad array of genomic tools and resources. A dense set of molecular markers covering the entire wheat genome is a pre-requisite for the high-resolution genetic analysis of agronomically important traits and deployment of efficient breeding strategies in crops. This research grant is aimed at the development of a new generation of molecular markers based on single nucleotide mutations (also called single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) differentiating one wheat variety from another. These markers are extremely effective for low-cost high-throughput analysis of genetic variation in wheat germplasm. Abundance in the genome and the availability of cost- and labor-effective genotyping platforms made SNPs the marker of choice for many crops. However, due to complexity and the size of the wheat genome and the low level of genetic variation in cultivated germplasm, wheat has fallen behind in the availability of SNP marker resources. In this proposal, the new sequencing instruments will be used for SNP discovery in a panel of diverse US wheat cultivars; a set of SNP markers covering the entire wheat genome will be genetically mapped and used for studying the diversity of US cultivars. The long term project goal is to advance wheat research and breeding by developing genetic and genomic tools for efficient analysis of agronomic traits using high-resolution linkage and association mapping and deploying SNP markers in breeding applications. The project will collaborate with the national and international research and breeding programs to minimize the redundancy and maximize the utilization of existing and newly developed SNPs. The project will address the following USDA AFRI program priorities: 1) Advance conventional breeding in Poaceae through the development of SNPs for genome-wide high-throughput ?mapping and identification of important genes, MAS and QTL discovery, association genetic mapping, positional cloning, and comparative genomics?; 2) ?Research to fill knowledge gaps and adopt new genomic technologies that significantly reduce the breeding cycle and cost of phenotypic evaluations for improvements in U.S. wheat production and health.?"

Increase productivity of these two important crops is important to satisfy the continuous increase in worldwide demand for cereals. One of the fastest ways to improve wheat and rice yield is to reduce losses due to pathogens, which claim every year a significant part of the global wheat and rice production. Just in the U.S. an average of 21 million bushels of wheat are being lost per year due to stripe rust and 30 million bushels to leaf rust. The recent appearance of new stem rust races in Africa that are virulent on currently deployed stem rust resistance genes represents a new threat to the wheat crop. The new races are virulent on most of the stem rust resistance genes currently deployed in the different wheat growing areas of the world. While genetic resistance is a cost-effective and environmentally-sound method of disease control in plants, our current ability to generate durable pyramids of resistance genes against rusts in wheat is limited by our poor understanding of the genetic mechanisms and gene interactions involved in the resistance response in wheat. Race-specific seedling resistance genes provide only temporary protection because fungal populations rapidly evolve to overcome this type of resistance. In contrast, race non-specific resistance provides partial (quantitative) and more durable resistance. The recent cloning of the broad resistance gene YR36 provides an entry points to investigate the gene network involved in durable resistance. To accelerate the characterization of the pathways regulating disease resistance in wheat we will use the protein-protein interaction information available from rice. Preliminary results show that some of the protein-protein interactions identified in rice are conserved in wheat. We will generate mutants of wheat genes that interact with YR36 and will test their effect on stripe rust resistance. We will also use these mutants to determine the role of these genes in resistance to other types of wheat rust. For example, mutations in the wheat RAR1 gene will be used in crosses to test if a particular rust resistance gene requires or does not require the presence of RAR1 for a proper function. These mutants will facilitate the classification of resistance genes into different functional classes, which can be combined to provide a more durable resistance. The mutants generated in this study will be publicly available and will provide a long-term genetic resource that can be used in the study of other disease resistance genes. A better knowledge of the gene networks responsible for disease resistance is essential to design intelligent strategies to fight wheat pathogens."

Nitrogen fertilizer not taken up by crops is readily leached into waterways as nitrates and nitrates that enhance algal blooms that, when they decompose, result in hypoxic zones where plant and animal life cannot survive, thus giving rise to `dead zones' in lakes, bays and estuaries. It may also be converted to nitrous oxides that enter the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. The amounts of nitrogen fertilizer applied to wheat average about 75 lb/acre and there are about 60 million acres of wheat in the USA, so there are about 1.5 billion pounds of N fertilizer applied to wheat each year at a cost to farmers of about $375 to 750 million dollars. We anticipate that we can decrease the amount of N required to 50 lb/acre, for a cost savings of $120 to 240 million dollars. In addition, we expect to increase wheat yields by about 6 bushels (average with T. harzianum T22, which already is deployed on about 1 million acres of wheat; the new ones are expected to be better)."

IR-4 priority settings, crop profiles, and Pest Management Strategic Plans are not available for summer fallow. As zero tillage practices become more common, herbicide use will continue to increase. Currently, mechanical tillage is the only practical alternative to chemical fallow. However, tillage decreases residue cover, resulting in increased soil erosion. Strategic grazing of grain stubble and weeds by sheep offers an alternative to traditional stubble and weed management, and no-till biomass reduction for seed bed preparation with the added benefit of not negatively influencing soil nutrient cycling or increasing erosion potential. In addition, sheep grazing summer fallow may significantly reduce use and thus selection pressure for glyphosate resistant weeds by precluding the need to control weeds with glyphosate. Our goal is the profitable incorporation of sheep into grain production systems to reduce pesticide and fossil fuel use in fallow and stubble management. Our objectives are: 1: Compare two cropping systems and three management systems on: Above ground and seed bank weed and volunteer crop community composition, The crop systems are 1) Continuous spring wheat. 2) Three year rotation, spring wheat ? spring planted forage pea/hay barley intercrop? summer fallow in a three year rotation with each component present every year. Within each crop rotation, the management systems are: 1) No-till with sheep grazing to manage summer fallow, crop residues, and to harvest the forage crop; 2) Minimum tillage with herbicides use to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage for seed bed preparation; 3) Conventional Tillage used to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage used for seed bed preparation. 2: Using production and input data, compare profitability and cash flow of our two crop rotations and three management systems. We will publish and communicate to both academic and producer clientele results and potential economic and biological advantages of incorporating sheep grazing stubble and weeds into sustainable grain farming systems. Our preliminary results indicate no differences for grain yield among summer fallow systems. Our interdisciplinary team of scientists anticipates a positive long term biological and economical outcome from the integrated system of weed management by sheep grazing, and significant reduction in herbicide use in the Northern Great Plains. The proposed system encourages profitable cooperation between diverse agricultural enterprises by linking a source of inexpensive feed for sheep producers with a successful pest control method for grain farmers."

The Poaceae inhabit a wide range of environmental niches and possess a number of unique morphological, physiological, and developmental processes of agricultural relevance involving floral/fruit development, drought tolerance, and C4 photosynthesis. Diversification of plant morphology and biological function is apparent between taxonomic groups and lineage specific genes are strong candidates underpinning this diversity. We have identified a set of highly conserved lineage specific genes within the Poaceae, termed Conserved Poaceae Specific Genes (CPSGs). The majority of CPSGs lack a known function and we will augment their annotation by determining their expression pattern across four Poaceae species with genome sequence, rice, sorghum, maize and Brachypodium. We will test the function of a subset of CPSGs using experimental approaches with a standardized set of metrics for floral/seed development and yield. As the CPSGs are restricted to the Poaceae, understanding their function would provide a powerful resource to identify genes that distinguish Poaceae from other plant taxa and have the potential to provide seminal insight into the molecular mechanisms that are critical to the unique morphology, development, and physiological capabilities of the Poaceae, phenotypes important to agriculture."

The goal is to be the premier program in the world for discovery and dissemination of scientific information that decreases production risks and improves profitability of feeder cattle and grain production from dual-purpose winter wheat; thus, strengthening the economies of rural communities in the southern Great Plains. The objectives of the research and education program are to: (1) develop supplementation programs and programs for delivery of new technologies that will decrease production risks of growing cattle on wheat pasture and increase profitability of the enterprise, (2) determine the effect of nutrition and management practices on adipose tissue development and deposition in different adipose tissue depots of feeder cattle and final carcass value, (3) develop and distribute new wheat cultivars which maximize profitability of dual-purpose wheat enterprises, 4) determine the economic consequences of alternative strategies for managing cropland suitable for dual-purpose winter wheat production, and (5) determine the eco-physiological effects of implementing sustainable agricultural practices in an integrated crop-livestock production system. Annual income in Oklahoma could be increased by $85 million by improving the technical efficiency of production of the 0.96 million stocker cattle that are grown to heavier weights on wheat pasture in Oklahoma prior to being finished in feedlots. This research has similar potential impacts on the 5.5 million wheat pasture stocker cattle in the states of Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, and Colorado."

However, the maintenance of wheat in the rotation is very cost-dependent. Hence, cost-effective pest management through IPM will be critical for sustainable wheat production in the North Central region. Foliar fungicides have been critical components of integrated disease management in wheat for many years and are usually recommended in integrated disease management programs to complement other strategies when conditions are favorable for disease development. Over the past few years, however, producers have increasingly resorted to prophylactic use of fungicides, an approach that is contrary to sound IPM principles. Foliar fungicides are increasingly being applied earlier than recommended, and at lower-than-recommended rates and application volumes. These practices, in addition to being harmful to humans and the environment, could lead to the development of fungicide resistance in pathogen populations, reducing the useful life of this valuable component of IPM. Many justifications have been given for resorting to non IPM-based approaches to foliar fungicide use in wheat, including the prospect of substantial yield increases due to enhanced plant performance and plant health, and the control of secondary diseases. However, none of these claims have been substantiated by replicated trials. In addition, Stakeholders and extension educators revealed that producers still struggle with correct wheat growth stage identification, disease diagnosis and quantification, and are uncertain as to value and relevance of existing foliar fungicide application thresholds. These are at the very core of IPM-based fungicide recommendations. Misdiagnosis and inaccurate disease quantification may lead to untimely and unnecessary use of fungicides. Current fungicide timing and thresholds are based on results from past studies conducted with older cultivars with lower yield potential and fungicides with modes of action and pre-harvest intervals that are different from those of currently recommended fungicides. We will conduct field experiments and extension programs to develop and disseminate new and updated wheat disease management guidelines. Emphasis will be placed on identification of foliar diseases and wheat growth stages and determination of economic fungicide decision thresholds. Genetic resistance with be used in combination with fungicides in inoculated (with Stagonospora leaf blight) and non-inoculated plots to generate disease epidemics of different intensities and corresponding grain yield responses. Models will be developed to estimate disease-related yield loss and to predict in-season yields. Parameters from yield loss and yield prediction models will be used in combination with fungicide efficacy data, application cost, and grain price to develop fungicide decision thresholds. Decision charts and an interacted web-based interface will be developed to enhance implementation of these thresholds."

Many of Kentucky's family farms have been highly dependent upon tobacco as a primary source of income. But the number of farms growing tobacco in Kentucky declined 72% from nearly 30,000 in 2002 to 8,112 in 2007. The market value of tobacco sold in Kentucky in 2008 was $382 million, down from $674 million in 2000. Many of Kentucky's farms are small, averaging 164 acres, compared to the U.S. average of 418 acres. There were 85,300 farms in the state in 2008. According to the 2007 census, 67 percent of all Kentucky farms sold less than $10,000 worth of agricultural products. Interest in alternative crops, including horticultural enterprises, has risen dramatically. This interest continues to increase because of the tobacco quota buyout. Horticultural crops offer Kentucky growers potential alternatives. A number of farms have successfully initiated commercial vegetable enterprises. Other farms are seeing the potential success of horticultural crops, but many lack the technical knowledge and management skills for immediate success with these production/marketing systems. Kentucky's grain producers are searching for ways to improve the market value of the crops they grow. Examples of potential specialty grain types include edamame (green vegetable soybean) and soft white winter wheat. An emphasis on bioenergy has increased the need for research on a variety of crops that have potential for energy production, including hulless barley, sweet sorghum, and biomass crops such as switchgrass. Growth in the organic food industry has led to a need for research on organic production of both horticultural and grains crops. This project is designed to develop and deliver Kentucky farmers the knowledge they need to assess new crop opportunities. Eleven horticulture and specialty grains projects will be conducted by researchers at the University of Kentucky as part of this overall New Crop Opportunities, KY, project. The New Crop Opportunities Center will feature a Web site for 24-hour access to information on new crops for Kentucky, including the horticultural and specialty grains crops that are the focus of the Center's research. Center staff will answer questions from Extension agents and farmers, and will distribute new crop information at field days and conferences. The Center will facilitate the packaging of information from its research and other sources for dissemination. The expected outcomes/impacts of this project will be an increase in knowledge among Kentucky farmers and county extension agents about production and marketing systems for a variety of new crops. This increase in knowledge should allow farmers to make informed decisions about which new crops to try, and how to market those crops, based on information available on the Center's research projects, as well as through its crop and marketing profiles. Anticipated benefits include greater profitability for Kentucky's farmers as they successfully transition to a variety of crops that are new to them."

The seventh objective is to continue research on the life cycle of G. pallida to insure adequate production of G. pallida cysts in laboratory and greenhouse to supply the cysts needed for the other objectives of this project. By combining several approaches to control G. pallida, a management plan for G. pallida will be developed that would increase the potential for elimination of G. pallida from Idaho production fields and minimize the economic impact on potato production based agricultural economies of the western United States."

Frequency of insecticide applications to manage sucking bugs (stink bugs and plant bugs) in cotton has increased from 1/ha in 1992 to 3/ha in 2005. To reverse this trend in cotton and other crops, improved control strategies of stink bugs are needed, which require a better understanding of the ecology of the main stink bug species. This work will (1) provide key information on the ecology of the main stink bug pests and their natural enemies in the Southeast, and (2) evaluate a method for substantially reducing insecticide use to manage stink bugs in cotton, a major susceptible crop in the Southeast United States. To determine the qualitative and quantitative changes in populations at the spatial scale of the farmscape, both stink bugs and their natural enemies will be sampled on their main crop hosts (cotton, soybeans, corn, peanuts and wheat) and alternate host plants. A holistic approach to stink bug management is needed, as these insects develop on a sequence of hosts and crops throughout the season. The spatial and temporal dynamics of stink bugs and their natural enemies across the farmscape in both South Carolina and Georgia will be studied (objective 1), which will lead to improved sampling as a function of within field location and surrounding vegetation. GPS coordinates of fields and sampling locations will allow the use of geostatistical methods. A major concept of studying stink bugs at the farmscape scale is to consider simultaneously the source and sink effects of a variety of habitats and crops. The second objective will evaluate in-field border applications of insecticide in cotton to manage stink bugs. We know that stink bugs infest cotton fields from the edge first, and then move towards the interior of the field. Rather than applying insecticides over the entire field, applications will be made only for border populations upon first signs of damage, which may prevent the need to treat the entire field. Stink bug densities and associated injury to cotton bolls will be recorded throughout the season. The pesticide savings would be important from the perspective of reducing active ingredient applications, reduced time to make applications, and finally conserving natural enemies by not treating the entire field. The cost effectiveness of this management strategy will be assessed. This project will address two priority areas defined by the Southern Region Information Exchange Group for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (SERA003-IPM) in 2007: (1) Managing sucking bugs using ecological approaches, (2) Development of decision aids for management of pests for all crops. The objectives of this multistate proposal with an integrated approach fit well with the goal of the National IPM Program as presented in the IPM Road Map:  to improve the economic benefits of adopting IPM practices and to reduce potential risks to human health and the environment caused by the pests themselves or by the use of pest management practices.

However, the maintenance of wheat in the rotation is very cost-dependent. Hence, cost-effective pest management through IPM will be critical for sustainable wheat production in the North Central region. Foliar fungicides have been critical components of integrated disease management in wheat for many years and are usually recommended in integrated disease management programs to complement other strategies when conditions are favorable for disease development. Over the past few years, however, producers have increasingly resorted to prophylactic use of fungicides, an approach that is contrary to sound IPM principles. Foliar fungicides are increasingly being applied earlier than recommended, and at lower-than-recommended rates and application volumes. These practices, in addition to being harmful to humans and the environment, could lead to the development of fungicide resistance in pathogen populations, reducing the useful life of this valuable component of IPM. Many justifications have been given for resorting to non IPM-based approaches to foliar fungicide use in wheat, including the prospect of substantial yield increases due to enhanced plant performance and plant health, and the control of secondary diseases. However, none of these claims have been substantiated by replicated trials. In addition, Stakeholders and extension educators revealed that producers still struggle with correct wheat growth stage identification, disease diagnosis and quantification, and are uncertain as to value and relevance of existing foliar fungicide application thresholds. These are at the very core of IPM-based fungicide recommendations. Misdiagnosis and inaccurate disease quantification may lead to untimely and unnecessary use of fungicides. Current fungicide timing and thresholds are based on results from past studies conducted with older cultivars with lower yield potential and fungicides with modes of action and pre-harvest intervals that are different from those of currently recommended fungicides. We will conduct field experiments and extension programs to develop and disseminate new and updated wheat disease management guidelines. Emphasis will be placed on identification of foliar diseases and wheat growth stages and determination of economic fungicide decision thresholds. Genetic resistance with be used in combination with fungicides in inoculated (with Stagonospora leaf blight) and non-inoculated plots to generate disease epidemics of different intensities and corresponding grain yield responses. Models will be developed to estimate disease-related yield loss and to predict in-season yields. Parameters from yield loss and yield prediction models will be used in combination with fungicide efficacy data, application cost, and grain price to develop fungicide decision thresholds. Decision charts and an interacted web-based interface will be developed to enhance implementation of these thresholds."

ND is number one in US production of 10 crops - durum wheat and hard red spring wheat, barley, oats, flax, all dry edible beans, dry edible peas, lentils, sunflower, and canola - is third in sugar beet, fourth in potato, and ninth in soybean (ND Ag. Statistics No. 77, 2008). The value of all crops ranges from $ 4 to $ 6.5 billion/year (ND Ag. Statistics No. 77, 2008). Pest problems may severely impact yield and quality any given year, threatening the economy of the state and region, and export capacity. Examples: Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley resulted in several billion dollars loss to the state's economy from 1993-2005 (Nganje et. al., 2004; McMullen, 2005); other pests impact crops each year (Sugarbeet Research and Extension Report, http://www.sbreb.org; ND Crop and Pest Report (http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/aginfo/entomology/ndsucpr/index.htm). ND producers use pesticides as one management tool to combat pest outbreaks. For example, in 2004, 45.4% of cropland was sprayed with herbicides, 2.3% with insecticides, and 5.4% with fungicides (Pesticide Use and Pest Management Practices Survey in ND, 2004). This survey also showed that ND producers increased their use of IPM practices, such as use of field scouting and forecasting models, between 2000 and 2004 surveys. ND has a short growing season and a harsh winter climate. Citizens place high value on urban plantings which can survive the winter and which are relatively free of pest problems. A recent electronic questionnaire about urban IPM needs, sent to extension educators in 8 states of the High Plains region, including ND, indicated that almost 40% of their pest questions. This IPM project addresses those critical needs, by coordinating a statewide IPM program, providing collaborative efforts in pest management education across two states for two key crops, wheat and soybean, by demonstrating the value of integrated strategies for controlling a key disease of wheat, Fusarium head blight, by supporting the valuable resource of the NDSU Diagnostic Lab that services agriculture, homeowners, and the ornamental industry, and by increasing the outreach capabilities of the Urban IPM programs."

New fact sheets will be developed to help growers not involved in the demonstrations better manage these insect and disease pests. A new focus on SCN education will be used by seed companies to further their development of SCN resistant varieties for Delaware. It will also result in improved nematode management and reduced crop losses through soil sampling and increased use of crop rotation on up to 30,000 acres of soybeans. New threshold and disease forecasting information will help wheat growers make better insect and disease management decisions resulting in improved crop quality and yield on 20% of the statewide acreage. Clients will improve their knowledge of the emerging/reemerging pests and the integrated pest management methods that are most appropriate to avoid economic losses. (C) Vegetables- Cucurbit programs can result in reduced sprays for insects and diseases; increased worker safety and a two fold reduction in the amount of active ingredients in the environment when using seed treatments compared to at planting insecticide; and improved timing of fungicide applications and prevention of economic losses from downy mildew in pickling cucumbers. Producers will increase the adoption of cover crops (particularly cereal rye) on 30% for no-till pumpkin acreage by improving weed control through use of the shielded sprayer. Although the overall success of the soil health program cannot be easily measured in a one year period, it is expected that 25-50 vegetable growers will adopt these practices on farm as a result of this program initiative. (D) Ornamentals- Nursery and greenhouse professionals will to learn how to use IPM techniques and how they can be tailor-made for their business. Knowledge of pest ID and IPM tactics will help businesses avoid accepting contaminated material resulting in reduced operation costs. (E) Coordination with Conservation Partnerships- State NRCS staff will gain a greater understanding of the complexities and details of the implementation of integrated pest management programs. Newly developed field crop IPM standards will be used by NRCS staff to evaluate pest management plans and their implementation.(F) Consumer/Urban- Homeowners will learn to use natural enemies to control pest, plant native plants to increase biodiversity and learn to tolerate moderate to low levels of insects to conserve biological control agents. Professionals will learn which pesticides have a less severe impact on non-target arthropods and when they should be used instead of broad spectrum pesticides."

The Coeur d'Alene Tribe has an abundance of natural resources such as lakes, streams, timber and farmlands. The Tribe established a Farm Enterprise in 1970, their current operation includes about 6,000 acres and produces wheat, peas, lentils, rapeseed and bluegrass. The local educational system faces many challenges. In 2007-2008, the graduation rate for Native American youth on the Reservation was only 28% (Idaho State Department of Education). The school district has failed to meet Adequate Yearly Progress on state achievement tests for five consecutive years and is now dealing with state sanctions. Tribal leadership is concerned about keeping the youth involved in land-based and environmentally related activities and careers. Among American Indians 25 years and older on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation in 2000, 26 percent had no high school diploma and 6 percent had a bachelor's or college degree. However, the Tribal Department of Education has seen an increase in tribal members enrolling in education, and there are currently 60 tribal members receiving financial support for their pursuit of associates', bachelors' and graduate degrees. Only one of these recipients is pursuing a degree in an environmentally-related field. Anticipated Outcomes by Objective: The overall goal is to increase the quality of life on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation primarily through agriculture and natural resource education and life skills development for youth and adults. 1. Youth will have improved workforce skills that will increase their competitiveness in the job market; youth will choose careers in science, technology and natural resource fields and continue their education beyond high school; Youth will have increased cultural competence. 2. More families will grow their own food; families will have increased income from their land; improved natural resource and environmental stewardship will be demonstrated by community action. 3. Indian people will not lose their land; fractionation of Indian land will be reduced; there will be an increase in the number of individuals who have a will or estate plan. 4. Communities will have improved economic stability as reflected in population demographics, higher employment rates, planning, laws and ordinances that ensure long term community sustainability; communities will have completed a comprehensive plan; increased University outreach activities on the reservation. 5. Community leaders will be more inclusive in decision making process; reduced demand for community services (low income); families will have reduced expenses related to maintaining a home/property; youth and adults will reduce their debt (credit) load; there will be an increase in community collaborations, networking, and partnerships; improved communication among community residents, organizations and agencies."

Situation or Problem The U.S. population has a deficit of dietary Ca, with 55% of men and 78% of women in the United States not meeting the US recommended daily allowance (RDA) for Ca of 1000 mg/d, putting them at risk for developing osteoporosis. One in two women and one in eight men over the age of 50 will have an osteoporosis-related fracture, resulting in more than $10 billion in health care costs annually. Because a low level of Ca in the diet is among the most important controllable causes of osteoporosis, early intervention in diet is crucial to addressing this important health problem. In the US, approximately 70% of dietary Ca is provided by dairy products such as milk and cheese, with only spinach, collards, or turnip greens as  good  sources of Ca. None of these vegetables forms a significant part of the average diet; however, a more popular vegetable such as lettuce provides only < 2% of the RDA for Ca per cup. Changing individual dietary preferences, for example to include different foods rich in Ca, is a slow and expensive process. In contrast, increasing the levels of vital minerals in dietary staples - such as iodine in salt, fluorine in drinking water, vitamin D in milk, and Ca and niacin in wheat flour - has been a rapid, cost-effective means of changing nutrition on a large scale. From this standpoint, vegetables represent an attractive means of providing increased nutrition to the public since their consumption for health purposes is already encouraged through information campaigns by public health organizations and several low-Ca vegetables (e.g., lettuce) are consumed at much higher levels than Ca-rich vegetables, increasing their value for delivery of increased nutrition. Aside from its large-scale production and consumption, lettuce is an attractive dietary option for enhancing consumption of dietary Ca because it is rich in vitamin K, a co-factor for Ca use in the body, and that one out of four women eat lettuce on any given day, showing that this vegetable is readily consumed by a major at-risk group for osteoporosis. B. Purpose This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel method of increasing Ca levels in lettuce, a vegetable that comprises a significant part of the average U.S. diet, by using a combination of genetic engineering and low-cost amendments. This Phase I project will demonstrate that these techniques can increase Ca uptake in lettuce to the point that it qualifies as a  good  dietary source of this mineral under USDA guidelines. Successful completion of the project should lay the foundation for introduction of a new value-added crop that provides better nutrition for consumers and a new source of income for agricultural producers. Given the scope of the U.S. dietary Ca deficit, it is highly likely that enhanced Ca content in popular vegetables such as lettuce could measurably improve the health of significant numbers of Americans. In this regard, Ca-fortified lettuce can be viewed as a dietary option for consumers who seek to elevate their intake of Ca without the need to replace favorite foods or rely on mineral supplements."

However, the recent emergence of new virulent races of the fungus, commonly referred to as  Ug99 , now poses a significant threat to global wheat and barley production. In July of 2008, the multi-state committees on small grain diseases, NCERA-184 and WERA-097, organized a workshop that brought together small grain pathologists from land grant universities, USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Lab, USDA-APHIS, and key stakeholders to coordinate their preparations for Ug99. The participants in the workshop identified critical needs related to surveillance and potential knowledge gaps in disease management information. The top priority identified in the workshop was to develop extension publications that address disease identification, and summarize the best available management information for stem rust. To meet these critical needs, the NCERA-184 and WERA-097 committees propose to enhance the preparedness of the U.S. small grain producers and other stakeholders for the possible incursion of Ug99 races of stem rust by developing and distributing extension publications that provide critical information for identification and management of stem rust."

(Pullman).Approach:Field experiments will assess the production potential of perennial bioenergy and forage crops in lower, middle, and upper slope positions. Biomass will be harvested at each slope position. Soil/air temperature and rainfall will be measured daily. Soil samples will be analyzed for water content and soil organic matter. A water gradient experiment will study the effect of the water-by-N interaction on grain protein and yield of spring wheat. A second experiment will compare economic returns from precision vs. conventional uniform N placement. Precision N placement uses yield and protein values from the water gradient study to compute the total N required for a following crop. Previous yearÆs plots of the water gradient study will be replanted. N fertilizer will be applied to half of plots based on N factors computed from previous protein/yield measurements (precision N placement), and to remaining plots based on single uniform N rate (uniform N placement). Uniform and precision N placement will be compared in terms of uniformity in grain protein. Dollar returns will be determined using a partial budget analysis of market quotes and production costs. Grain yield and N supply will be computed for each plot and averaged to arrive at N use efficiency for each N placement strategy. The bulk tank of a combine will be divided into two bins. An optical sensor will sense grain protein and control a mechanism that diverts grain into a bin for ordinary grain or one for high quality grain. Site-specific measurements of grain protein and yield will be used to determine the dollar value of grain. Partial budget analysis will be conducted to compare the profitability of wheat production with and without grain segregation. The water gradient study will provide a wide range in values for yield, grain protein, plant height, and straw yield. Linear regression will be used to develop straw yield prediction equations that include terms for yield, protein, and plant height. Models will be evaluated by comparing predictions against actual measurements obtained from fields. On-combine measurements of grain yield, protein, and straw yield will be obtained using a yield monitor, optical grain quality sensor, and crop height sensor. Maps of straw yield will be used with current price quotes to estimate the net value of straw. Dollar returns will be contrasted with contract payments that would be received under conservation programs if straw is retained. Amount of carbon to maintain soil organic C at current levels will be estimated using the C sequestration model CQESTR. From this, the amount of straw that may be removed while maintaining soil quality will be assessed. Long-term studies will be examined to assess their value for calibration and corroboration of various simulation models (CQESTR, C-Farm, CropSyst, and RZWQM2). For RZWQM2, relevant soil, weather, and plant growth parameters will be calibrated from available data that have measured values of phenology, biomass, and leaf area at different stages, and yield. Modeling will extend study results for a more diverse set of weather conditions and soil types across the region."

The specific objectives include the development of modular simulators for major U.S. crops, and evaluation of environmental impacts of global climate change, water quality issues, sustainable agriculture, precision farming, etc.  Research areas where knowledge gaps about plant and soil processes limit the accuracy of model predictions.Approach:Develop a suite of process level crop simulation models for wheat, potatoes, corn, rice, peanut, cotton, and soybean; and integrate these with models for weeds, diseases, and insects.  There are many crop models available; however to date there is no comprehensive crop management system developed for major crops grown in the United States.  The selected crops are important to the U.S. economy; in addition they represent a wide range of plant types:  C3 and C4, grain root and fiber, legume, and non-legume.  From such a suite of models it should be possible to assemble modules capable of simulating many other crops with appropriate parameter changes and additional rate equations to fill up the gaps.  The existing models for weeds, diseases, and insects will be further developed and integrated with crop models.  In instances where mechanistic models to describe some processes do not exist, or are inadequate, new models of those processes will be developed.  Where suitable data are not available, we will conduct experiments to generate needed data."

Develop more efficient management practices for conventional tillage systems with respect to agricultural water use for row crops (cotton, corn, and peanut). 2. Develop improved techniques for irrigation scheduling of surface drip irrigation for row crops and vegetables.3. Develop management techniques for new and emerging crops in peanut-base rotations irrigated with surface drip.Approach:Furrow diked, and non-furrow diked treatments will be applied in a strip-split-plot design with irrigation as main plots and furrow diking as sub-plots with a non-irrigated control.  In furrow diked treatments, furrow diking will be conducted after planting, near or before seedling emergence.  The basins and dams formed by the 2-paddle furrow diker are commonly 1.5 m long, 0.30 m wide, and 0.2 m deep.  The ripper shank will be operated at a depth of about 20 cm in every row middle of furrow diked treatments. Furrow dikes will be created in alternate rows, leaving traffic row middles non-diked.  Irrigation timing and amount will be determined using IrrigatorPro.  Soil and plant parameters will be monitored using electronic sensors.  A rainfall simulator will be used to document soil erosion and infiltration from various treatments and soil series.  Meteorological factors will be continuously monitored and recorded using electronic weather stations.  Agronomic and economic factors will be recorded for each crop throughout the season and reported as a whole to determine the feasibility of each system.  Crop yield, quality, and economic factors will be recorded and compared to express the feasibility of these systems.  Agronomic management in field studies will be with current best management practices including transgenic herbicide and insecticide systems.  Surface drip irrigation (SDI) will be used to document irrigation strategies for peanut, cotton, corn, vegetable, wheat and canola that will promote economic yield.  Crop rotations will have four irrigation treatments and three replications in a randomized complete block design.  Individual subplots will be 5.5 m wide by 15 m long.  Irrigation events will occur daily, bi-weekly and weekly. Soil moisture sensors will be used to determine the depth of water to apply at each irrigation event.  Mini-lysimeters will be installed to document drainage below the root zone.  Vegetable crops will be double cropped with peanut and cotton and irrigated with SDI to help increase the economic opportunity to the grower.  At harvest time yield and grade of vegetables will be collected to determine economic feasibility.  Yield will be determined by weighing a mass of vegetables at harvest time.  Individual vegetable grades will be determined using state inspection criteria where grade criteria are available.  Winter wheat and canola will be planted with various nitrogen treatments to document best economic yield.  Crop water use for all crops will be documented using soil sensors, mini-lysimeters, and crop yield.  Crop yield and grade will be determined using normal procedures for cotton, corn, and peanut.  Winter wheat will be tested for protein and falling number to determine economic value.  Canola will be tested for percent oil extraction (on site bio-diesel extraction) to determine its value as a bio-diesel crop.  Water use curves will be determined for each crop using lysimeter and soil sensor data.  Crop coefficients will be calculated from estimated actual potential evapotranspiration collected from lysimeter and weather data, respectively."

Several multi-year field studies will be conducted in numerous locations in the low to intermediate rainfall zones to evaluate seeding date, rate, and methodologies for winter and spring canola in order to improve crop establishment. Data collected include seed-zone water, soil profile water storage, weed populations, crop yield, and oil and meal content.1C.  A multi-year study will be conducted in the high-rainfall zone to compare grain yield and wild oat suppressive ability of facultative wheat planted in late fall with that planted in April/May the following spring. Within each time of planting, wheat will be grown non-treated or treated with recommended or half the recommended rate of a wild oat herbicide. Wild oat population and seed production will be measured prior to grain harvest and crop yield and quality (dockage) will be determined. Consumptive water use will be determined with gravimetric soil profile samples before planting and after harvest.1D. Spring forage triticale will be planted in a naturally infested field of Russian thistle in a 2 to 3-year study. Half the plots will be sprayed with a herbicide to control Russian thistle and the weed will be allowed to grow in the remaining plots. Forage quality of the triticale will be analyzed with and without the weed and the total weed and crop biomass will be weighed. Total systems production costs will be determined and crop water use will be calculated.2A&B. Field experiments will be conducted to evaluate the performance of diversified cropping systems in the low, intermediate, and high rainfall zones. A 3-yr rotation of winter wheat, spring canola, and forage winter triticale will be compared to a rotation of winter wheat, spring barley and spring pea in the high rainfall zone while a 3-yr rotation of winter triticale, spring canola, and fallow will be compared to a rotation of winter wheat, spring barley, and fallow in the intermediate rainfall zone. The bioenergy and forage potential of two perennial species grown along stream channels will be evaluated within all rainfall zones. Biomass, grain yield, and economic and risk analyses will provide insight into overall performance.4B.  Specific themes will be defined that can be flexibly used to derive Agroecological Zones (AEZ) based on criteria that are relevant to the question asked. Three basic steps to design and develop relevant AEZ will be used: 1) Generate raster surfaces of biophysical and socio-economic variables through spatial interpolation of data; 2) Generate a spatial framework of AEZ by combining basic raster themes into more integrated variables; and 3) Characterize spatial units in terms of relevant themes such as zones separating commonly practiced cropping systems. After AEZ development, model calibration, and long-term field studies synthesis, what-if scenarios will be developed and current and future cropping systems will be evaluated. In collaboration with scientists directly involved with specific modeling we will apply calibrated models to long-term data sets to corroborate these models under a wide-range of regional conditions.

I anticipate that research in fructan metabolism will lead to understanding what controls movement of carbon into and out of storage compounds. In Australia nitrogen application recommendations for wheat are made from fructan/nitrogen analysis of leaf tissue. Evaluating whether the relationship of fructan to nitrogen ratios of turf leaf tissues can be used for recommendations of nitrogen fertilizer applications in Indiana is one of the goals of this research. Countries like Egypt are considering opening new ground for agriculture. Whether the parasitic weeds of agriculture are already in present depends on their movement by wind.

Cereals are the major source of food for human nutrition. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is most prominent staple diet for the world's population. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is 2nd in importance as a major carbohydrate source. Their high grain production has only been possible with high N fertilizer inputs. The environmental problems associated with inorganic fertilizer usage could be mitigated if the cereal crops established a more direct and intimate association with beneficial bacteria that promote their growth and increase their grain yield while simultaneously reducing their dependence on chemical N-fertilizer inputs. Although some agricultural biofertilizers (e.g., Rhizobium for legumes, Azospirillum for wheat, and cyanobacteria for rice) are already used in crop production, none till now have satisfactorily replaced the full fertilizer N demand to maximize yield potentials under field conditions. Therefore, discovery and development of more effective biofertilizers that can reduce the dependence on chemical N-fertilizer inputs to maximize cereal crop yields is a high priority area to help achieve the goals of sustainable agriculture worldwide. Our development of new, reliable agricultural biofertilizers addresses the important real-world problem of limited biologically available N in cereal crop production and shows that exploitation of natural beneficial plant-microbe associations is environmentally sound and has high intrinsic probability for success. We will continue basic research to increase knowledge of beneficial plant-microbe interactions of agricultural importance, especially those involving Rhizobium and cereal crops, and utilize this knowledge in real-world, sustainable agroecosystems. The expected outcomes will provide crucial information needed to succeed in implementing environmentally sound, biofertilizer inoculants into sustainable agroecosystems. Major beneficiaries of the applied information are Ag extension agents, low-income farmers in developing and 3rd-world countries who commonly produce cereal crops on marginally fertile soils but cannot afford to utilize chemical fertilizers, and worldwide manufacturers of biofertilizer inoculants in both the general and private sectors."

An example of non-host resistance is the immunity that a pea has for a bean pathogen. My major objective is to totally analyze the basis of this resistance at the gene expression level. This information will probably be required by pathologists and plant breeders to harness this strong form of resistance or to manipulate it in crop plants. We previously have utilized individual components involved with enhancing disease resistance to increase yields and the natural immunity of plants in the field. That is, the fungal component, chitosan, can enhance resistance to the root rotting fungi of wheat and consequently also increase the yield of wheat. Chitosan has been used in other agriculture applications such as weed control and plant protection. Although many laboratories are progressively locating disease resistance genes on the chromosome of crop plants, the mode by which they become active in the environment of the nuclei in which they reside remains speculative. My research is focusing directly on understanding the conformation changes of the chromatin that are involved in regulating these genes."

Raun and Johnson (1999) reported that NUE for cereal production in the world is only 33%. Thus, 67% of the applied fertilizer N is not removed in the grain or straw, and often assumed to be lost to leaching (Jokela and Randall, 1989), denitrification (Olson et al., 1979) and as NH3 volatilized from senescing leaves (Sharpe et al., 1988). A 20% increase in NUE for worldwide cereal production is now estimated to be worth more than $11 billion dollars. Regardless of the cereal crop, phosphorus use efficiencies (PUE) seldom exceed 16% (Sander et al., 1990; Sander et al., 1991). Phosphorus fertilizer use efficiencies averaged 8% when P was broadcast and incorporated and 16% when P was either knifed with anhydrous ammonia or applied with the seed in winter wheat (Sander et al., 1991). Total P taken up in wheat grain ranged from 9 to 13.6 kg ha-1 at yield levels ranging between 2.23 and 3.10 Mg ha-1, with concentrations of 0.42% P (Sander et al., 1991). Eghball and Sander (1989) reported 13.8 to 26.4 kg P ha-1 taken up in corn grain at yield levels between 4.24 and 8.83 Mg ha-1, and a concentration of 0.31% P. Similar results by Raun et al. (1987) showed total P taken up in corn grain ranged from 21.4 to 47.4 kg P ha-1 at yield levels from 8.10 to 14.47 Mg ha-1, or 0.30% P. Because the total amounts of P in grain are relatively small compared to N (1:10), correcting plant deficiencies by foliar application seems plausible. Limited work is available documenting the application of foliar P at early stages of growth in wheat and corn. However, recent work by Benbella and Paulsen (1998) showed that foliar applications after anthesis of 5 to 10 kg KH2PO4 ha-1 (1.1 to 2.2 kg P ha-1) increased wheat grain yields by up to 1 Mg ha-1. They attributed this increase in yield to a slowed senescence, or stay-green. The benefits of foliar applied P in various horticultural crops was recently reviewed by Rickard (2000), with limited coverage of cereal crops. In general P deficient soils require preplant broadcast-incorporated rates of 20 to 40 lb P2O5/ac or (10 to 20 kg P/ha) to correct the deficiency in either wheat or corn. At a P use efficiency of 16%, this addition results in only 1.6 to 3.2 kg P taken up in the grain. Although the literature does not provide information on relative efficiencies (soil applied versus foliar applied P), intuitively one would expect foliar applied P to be much higher. We believe that the small amounts required to correct deficiencies can be easily introduced to the plant by a foliar P application. This approach has been overlooked for decades because it was assumed that the amounts of fertilizer P required by the crop were too great to be satisfied by a single foliar application. That assumption was easily accepted when P fertilizers were first used because soil deficiencies tended to be greater than today and solution fertilizers were uncommon."

Many secondary metabolites, classified as antibiotics, are controlled via complex sensory pathways consistent with the hypothesis that they have multiple roles. This proposal systematically tests specific hypotheses for the roles of phenazines, secondary metabolites produced by Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain 30-84, an effective biocontrol agent against take-all of wheat. Phenazines, with over 100 derivatives, are inhibitory to a range of organisms and are produced by a variety of bacteria. A fundamental question is why different strains produce different phenazines. Phenazine production by strain 30-84 is required for pathogen inhibition and persistence on roots, and is regulated at multiple levels. Recently, we showed that phenazine mutants of strain 30-84 were defective in cell attachment/biofilm development. This defect was rescued by phenazine addition or genetic complementation. Further, we found that different ratios of phenazine derivatives change biofilm architecture. Phenazines also may promote Fe-acquisition through mineral reduction. This proposal will test three hypotheses for roles of different phenazines in the development of biofilms both in vitro and on plant roots: Hypothesis 1: Changing the ratios and structures of PZs affects cell attachment and biofilm architecture. Hypothesis 2: PZs influence biofilm development via multiple mechanisms, e.g. cell surface changes and gene expression patterns. Hypothesis 3: PZs are involved in iron-acquisition that benefits the bacterium and the plant. The results of this work will improve our understanding of the complex roles of secondary metabolites in plant-associated microbial ecology and plant health."

F. graminearum causes head blight of wheat and barley and stalk and ear rot of corn. The severe economic effect of this disease on Midwestern growers is due to the reduced grain yield caused by the fungus, and the presence of the mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol, in contaminated grain. The fungus is spread during the growing season by the forcible ejection of spores (ascospores) from small fungal fruiting bodies (perithecia) on the surface of the crop residues. When the airborne spores land on flowers, they infect and begin to colonize the developing grain. Elimination of the ascospores would result in vast reduction in disease. There are several other fungal diseases of Michigan crops that rely on forcible ascospore discharge to initiate the disease cycle. These include apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), white mold of beans (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), brown rot of peaches (Monilinia fructicola) and purple spot of asparagus (Stemphylium vesicarium), as well as others. The mechanism of forcible discharge is not clear in any fungus, but we have used Fusarium graminearum as a model system to develop an understanding of how small cellular cannons called asci function to fire their spores. We have made progress in this arena and have identified several methods to inhibit discharge in this fungus. We are beginning to explore the common effects of these methods on other fungi that similarly launch their spores. This project will investigate the mechanism of forcible ascospore discharge and how the phenomenon can be inhibited. MAES delineated 5 target areas that are the major research foci for the experiment station. This research directly impact 3 of these areas. Since F. graminearum produces two major mycotoxins, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol, elimination of the disease would result in better food safety and health to the people of Michigan. In addition, the severe economic consequences of the disease through low grain weight and mycotoxin contamination, which impact grain value, would be reduced by this research, enhancing the profitability of the grain. Finally, knowledge of how to control ascospore discharge could be potentially applied to all pathogens which rely on this dispersal mechanism. This information would help to control the spread of invasive pathogens."

Published work has found that North America is dominated by only one of the nine species in the F. graminearum complex and nearly all strains within that species produce the mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol. Several species of F. graminearum co-occur in Nepal and our work with this population is aimed assessing what would happen if additional species migrated to North America. Preliminary analyses of our data suggest that new species that migrate to North America are likely to remain distinct. At this point it is not known if any of the other eight species of F. graminearum is likely to displace the current species found in North America. Our work on the alternate mycotoxin, nivalenol, suggests that nivalenol is unlikely to invade North America since this toxin causes the pathogen to be less virulent. Even if it does invade, it is not likely to cause a major health risk to humans since, on average, nivalenol accumulation is about one-tenth that of related strains that produce deoxynivalenol. American chestnuts were decimated by an epidemic of blight which was introduced into the United States in the early 1900s. Efforts to restore chestnuts to the eastern hardwood forests have concentrated on either breeding blight resistant chestnut or introducing biological control agents that can reduce pathogen virulence. Since breeding trees is a long arduous task, we have concentrated on a hypovirus that reduces pathogen virulence. The hypovirus has spread naturally at several sites in Michigan and our previous work documented that American chestnuts at these sites exhibit full ecological recovery - i.e., they are growing surviving and reproducing the same as healthy trees. Our task has been to develop methodologies to introduce hypoviruses into blighted chestnut populations with the aim of controlling this pathogen. We are using a heavily blighted site in western Wisconsin to investigate the best method of introducing hypovirus onto trees. We have developed a scratch method which can be used to convert existing cankers or induce new cankers on trees. We are also exploring how to deploy hypovirus within chestnut stands. We are currently working with a grid system so hypovirus is in all areas of a stand. The grid is in response to the fact that hypovirus moves at slower rate than the pathogen. We will be initiating a new set of experiments in Michigan aimed at testing whether it is better to protect large understory trees within a forest rather than the large overstory trees. We will begin hypovirus introductions at three sites in Michigan in 2009. We are also investigating whether biological control by hypoviruses is stable through time. To do this we will compare the ability of hypovirus to reduce pathogen virulence for samples collected in 1995 with samples that will be collected in 2010. We will develop new methods for deploying hypovirus that can be used to protect American chestnuts in areas of their range."

Predicting optimum nutrient requirements is crucial to accomplishing this goal. Economic constraints necessitate that both the luxury of over-application and the risk of under-application of nutrients be avoided.

This project will provide information needed to develop recommendation procedures that will help producers adjust their production practices for the situations on their farms. A number of nutrient and soils related concerns need to be addressed in order to keep recommendations up to date with current growing conditions. This project will address four of these. The first issue is the management of nitrogen to minimize nitrate leaching to ground water. Delivery of exact doses of N throughout the season still has technological and economic barriers. The second issue is the need to identify areas of low pH and increase soil pH to levels so that nutrients present will be available for effective use by crops. The third issue is the need to determine if phosphorus recommendation strategies used for 50 years are still relevant to yield levels and technology used today in corn production. The fourth issue is to address the need by organic farmers to have a cropping system that includes more crops than corn and soybeans and how to fertilize them without using commercial fertilizers. A series of experiments will be conducted to answer the specific objectives listed above. The intended impact of the research outlined in this project is to provide the information that allows producers to adopt management practices that more precisely determine the quantity of nutrients needed, minimize the potential for nitrogen to reach groundwater, improve the decision making process for when and where to apply phosphorus and lime, and facilitate the utilization of winter wheat in organic cropping systems."

Monetary losses due to soilborne diseases in the U.S. are estimated to exceed $4 billion per year, and losses due to parasitic nematodes exceed $100 billion per year world wide. The cost of soilborne plant pathogens to society and the environment far exceeds the direct costs to growers and consumers. The use of chemical pesticides to control soilborne pathogens has caused significant changes in air and water quality, altered natural ecosystems resulting in direct and indirect affects on wildlife, and caused human health problems. For example, methyl bromide, a fumigant used to control soilborne diseases, has become notorious in recent years for contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer. Consumers are demanding plentiful low cost but safe food while simultaneously requiring the use of fewer chemical controls. From 2000 to 2005, the number of organic acres in the U.S. increased 128%, to around 4 million acres. Organically-grown crops require non-synthetic methods for management of diseases, and organic growers are seeking scientifically-based disease management methods. The recent spike in food prices due to increased demand and decreased supply further necessitate the development of sustainable methods of disease management. This project directly addresses these problems in a multistate, multidisciplinary approach. The promise, public acceptance and environmental benefits of non-chemical management of root diseases continue to make research on this area both timely and of critical importance to the future of U.S. and world agriculture."

These common losses severely impact incomes, economies, and government revenues. In terms of heat stress, compared to cooler areas, grain yield can be 3 to 4 times lower in the Great Plains where temperatures regularly exceed 30?C during flowering. This results from sterility, early development grain abortion, and an early transition to the dry seed stage. We have found that many current Hard Red Winter Wheat (HRWW) cultivars grown in the Southern Great Plains are heat susceptible in terms of sterility, seed abortion and an early transition to the dry seed stage (Hays et al, 2007a). Based on yearly average temperatures of 28oC during reproductive development, and a 3-4% yield decline for every 1oC above the optimal 15oC, we estimate that wheat in the Southern Great Plains looses approximately 30-50% of their yield due to high temperature stress alone. This equates to $0.791 to 1.319 billion dollars at December 2007 wheat prices for Texas alone and much larger for broader U.S. In contrast, we have identified cultivars and germplasm from Australia, CIMMYT, ICARDA, and Middle East that exhibit heat and drought tolerance or avoidance during these reproductive stages. While wheat has numerous adaptations to drought, some decrease yield, such as during hot and dry conditions when low stomatal conductance and impaired energy dissipation prematurely senesces wheat cultivars. The plant cuticle can however limit transpirational water loss by reflecting excess light and heat while maintaining a tempered canopy with adequate turgor longer during drought for improved growth, reproduction, and metabolic activity. Interestingly, many of the lines identified from Australia, CIIMYT, and the Middle East, have thick cuticular layers compared current Southern Great Plains cultivars. We have focused on optimizing the cuticle composition as our long term breeding strategy to reduce irrigation and maintain yield under high temperatures drought. The cuticle is comprised of an outer epicuticle, the cuticle proper, and the wall embedded cuticular layer, each composed of complex of polymeric cutins and long-chain hydrocarbon waxes. The importance of the layers and varied composition to drought tolerance is however poorly understood. Our primary objective is to define their importance by linking the QTLs that regulate the individual layers and varied composition to yield stability during reproductive drought stress in wheat.

Many factors impact rice profitability. Domestic farm prices for rice are strongly related to world prices and reflect strong competition in a global market. Government payments play a major role in farm revenues and strongly impact the way rice producers manage their farm operations. Rice production costs are also large relative to other field crops like soybeans or corn and are greatly impacted by prices paid for fuel and fertilizer. The high costs of production for rice reduce producer profit margins and make rice producers largely dependent on government payments to achieve profitability. Rice has the largest water requirement of any row crop in eastern Arkansas. Most irrigation water is supplied by wells tapping into the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer, which underlies nearly all of eastern Arkansas. Large water withdrawals are placing strong downward pressure on this groundwater source. Water quality is also likely to impact Arkansas rice production decisions in the near future. Surface soils contain little organic matter and are comprised of silt and clay particles that are readily transported by runoff from tilled fields during heavy rainfall events. Sediment is the primary pollutant identified for most eastern Arkansas waterways, and practices like no-till are commonly recommended as remedial mechanisms. Producers have a wide range of management options to choose from, including using new rice varieties that are higher yielding or earlier maturing; using conservation tillage practices in place of conventional tillage; changing the rotation cropping sequence to include alternative crops like corn, wheat, or sorghum; improving irrigation efficiency with new irrigation technologies or land forming techniques; or investing in tail-water recovery pits and on-farm reservoirs to supplement groundwater with surface water. Arkansas rice producers have little information about the long-term profitability of management practices that preserve critical resources like land and water. The objective of this research project is to evaluate the long-term economic feasibility of alternative management practices to provide producers with viable options and insure the sustainability of rice and other agronomic crops grown in Arkansas. The results of the project should provide Arkansas farmers and farmland owners with relevant economic information for making better farm management decisions when important production resources like land and water are limiting. The results should also help guide research and extension professionals in the development of better crop management recommendations and should help policy makers better understand the impacts that alternative or competing government policies have on farm economic survival."

As an agricultural crop, timber products rank third in value in Oklahoma behind wheat and hay. Eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) is widely distributed in Oklahoma. Current acreage of eastern redcedar in Oklahoma is estimated beyond 9 million acres and it is projected to be 12.6 million acres by 2013. If action is not taken it is predicted that eastern redcedar invasion will cost $447 million by 2013. Use of low-quality eastern redcedar as a raw material in lumber manufacturing is not currently substantial due to its low value and the irregular growth pattern. Many wildlife species that need open range also are adversely affected by this species. Currently the wood from small log of eastern redcedar is used for fence posts and novelty items, while the trees themselves are planted for shelterbelts and windbreaks. This project directly addresses the development of value-added structural panel products from under-utilized eastern redcedar. The importance of this work lies in its potential to expand the use of low quality eastern redcedar in exterior structural composite panel manufacture, which may result in the development of an environmentally sound way to utilize resource in Oklahoma. Strand type of panel products such as waferboard and oriented strand board (OSB) manufactured to be used for exterior structural applications. Therefore, this proposal addresses a major need to use under-utilized invasive species as raw material for strand type of panel manufacture and to test the properties of such panels to determine if they are similar to other panel products made from different species. Low quality eastern redcedar trees will be cut into 6 in long sections to produce strands. Single-layer hand-formed mats with random distribution of strands and three-layer panels with oriented distribution of strands from 100% eastern redcedar, 20%-80% eastern redcedar and pine, 50%-50% eastern redcedar and pine, and 100% pine as control samples will be manufactured in a computer controlled press using exterior resin. Thickness swelling, water absorption, bending properties, and internal bond strength, screw holding samples will be cut from each panel based on the ASTM standard. Since the main target of this proposal is to manufacture panels for exterior uses surface roughness may not seem very important for the panels. However, three-layer panels can be used as substrate for resin impregnated papers for outdoor furniture manufacture if their surfaces are sanded. In this case surface roughness of the panels plays an important role in their service life. Samples from each panels will be overlaid using a melamine resin impregnated paper for roughness measurements. Test results will be compared to existing standard values of different types of strand board made from other species. This information will be used to construct meaningful results of the experimental panel properties."

Crop production represents 28% of KS's agricultural product revenue, and the other 72% is derived primarily from livestock sales. KS produces the most wheat and grain sorghum of all other states, is the fifth leading state for forage production, is tenth for corn production, and eleventh for soybean production (USDA, 2007a). Crop production plays a significant role in KSAEs economy and our national food security. Crop production must remain economically and environmentally sustainable to maintain this important industry. Cropping systems research is required for meeting the increasing demand for agricultural commodities, increasing input costs coupled with historically stagnant commodity prices, and declining rural populations. It is inevitable that large regions of KS and the US will have to transition from full irrigation to limited irrigation or dryland production in the future, yet maintain or increase crop production to meet the ever increasing food, fiber, and bio-fuel demand (KS v. CO, 2001; Schneekloth et al. 1995). In order to maintain the viability of agriculture production, sustainable limited irrigation and dryland cropping systems must be developed. Dryland cropping systems in the semi-arid Great Plains rely on fallow for storing soil moisture for following crop (Anderson et al. 1999). Fallow efficiency has increased from about 19% in 1916 to 33% in 1975 to 40% currently (Greb 1979; Peterson et al. 1996). Fallow efficiency was increased by many factors including improved pest management, particularly effective and timely weed control; increased chemical fallow and no-till production; increasing stubble amount and height; and reduced fallow period length (Peterson et al. 1996; Tanaka and Aase, 1987). Of these factors, reducing the fallow period duration has had the greatest impact on increasing fallow efficiency (Peterson et al. 1996). Fallow efficiency is currently limited in the Great Plains by the amount of residue remaining on the soil after harvest, which averages approximately 3 ton/A for the region (Peterson et al. 1996). Since 2006 the price of many commodities including corn, wheat, and barley increased almost 100% due to a current short world supply and increased bio-fuel production. This has increased the demand for corn and at least in the short term has resulted in a large increase in price. There is a concern that the increase in corn price will result in feed costs that are too high for livestock producers and feedlots to remain economically profitable (Swanson, 2007). If feed costs remain high, forage crops and alternative feed crops will be needed in feedlot rations and cow-calf operations. This is particularly important since 72% of KSAEs agricultural economy is derived from livestock sales (USDA, 2007a). Ultimately finding methods of sustainable dryland crop production that maximize fallow efficiency, meet the demands for food, fiber, and bio-fuel, and support KSAEs livestock industry will help sustain the viability of producers, local rural communities, natural resources, and the viability of the surrounding region."

Carbohydrates, including starch and non-starch polysaccharides, constitute up to 85% of the wheat kernel and have significant impact on the end-product quality. Wheat carbohydrates, such as cell-wall polysaccharides and starch are all important, and the ability to determine the absolute properties, molecular interactions and structure-function relationships of these carbohydrates will be essential in advancing our knowledge of quality. Improved understanding of quality on a molecular basis has potential to improve current processing/utilization technologies and end-product quality, especially in food science applications since structure of these carbohydrates are strongly correlated to their functionality in food systems. HSW includes hard red spring (HRS) wheat and hard white spring (HWS) wheat classes. Nationally and internationally, HRS wheat has a reputation for being one of the premium quality wheat classes, often fetching a higher value for the producers. It is because of its ability to be used as a blending or  improver  wheat for other types of wheat, and for the production of specialty wheat products like multi-grain breads, bagels, pizza crusts, frozen dough, etc. Even though HRS wheat has wide applications in food industry, more research should be thoughtfully pursued to find greater applications of HRS wheat for wider market uses. One area that appears to have potential for significant growth in the near future, both in the U.S. and internationally is in the area of refrigerated dough products. Currently, the HRS wheat is not widely used in this particular wheat product because it seems that HRS wheat is more susceptible to the `dough syruping' problem (defined below). The first objective of this research is to determine the chemical basis for dough syruping. The second objective of the proposal focuses on starch, which is the main carbohydrate of cereal grains and roots. Starch's functional and physicochemical properties have significant impact on the quality of the wheat-based food products. Physicochemical properties of HSW flours (including total starch, starch damage, pasting profile, flour and dough characteristics, and amylose/amylopectin ratio) are significantly related to bread quality. Past research on the role of flour components on the baking properties of flour have mainly focused on the proteins. The uniqueness, physical and chemical properties, and role of wheat starch in the baking system, including bread and tortilla, still require further study. For this part of the proposal, wheat varieties from HRS and HWS wheat classes will be used. The proposed work brings together research on physicochemical and structural properties of polysaccharides along with the resulting end-product quality attributes, in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of these systems with the long term aim of developing high-quality wheat-based food-products with extended shelf-life."

Genetic improvements in corn were worth $828,100,000 in ND for 2007. This project targets to add value to corn by screening for grain quality. $3 billion were invested in corn breeding research at Universities from 1865 to 1996 and that the return on investment due to corn breeding research was an impressive $260 billion. The public sector created the idea of hybrid corn and the most famous cultivar of all times, B73, which contributed billions of dollars to the seed industry. The impact of public corn breeding continues to be very large even though confidentiality in the private breeding sector does not allow the impact to be fully understood. The NDSU corn breeding program is the most northern public breeding program in North America and it has been in existence for 76 years. As a consequence, commercial hybrids have become earlier and ethanol plants have first established in areas (e.g. western ND) where only NDSU research locations are present. The main economic benefit of this project has been and will continue to be the availability of productive and diverse early-maturing lines with high levels of starch under abiotic stresses. The NDSU corn program also leads the first long-term program to increase the genetic diversity of hybrids on farms in the U.S. North Central Region with tropical and temperate adapted corn. Corn acreage has grown 460% in the past 10 years. ND had the third largest growth in corn acreage for the U.S. in 2007. Even though the ethanol industry is expanding corn is still limited in its extension to the west due to environmental challenges, mainly drought. Current ethanol plants can only utilize ND corn hybrids if they are early maturing with above average drought tolerance and grain quality. The NDSU project serves as a good complement to industry efforts since it is one of the few programs breeding actually within the state. The development of new and diverse inbred lines for early-maturing hybrids is a unique opportunity. This project will conduct research that is relevant to the state's needs and will work toward identifying useful corn germplasm. It will also enhance the profitability of corn producers through sustainable corn production, educate producers on hybrid selection, and reduce the environmental risks affecting corn production. In addition, the NDSU project will help develop alternative profitable uses for the value-added market and will increase the opportunities of young scientists by training the next generation of applied plant breeders. The NDSU corn breeding program is one of the few public programs that can still offer a strong emphasis on germplasm improvement, inbred line development, and training of applied plant breeders. Making the right corn hybrid selection is very profitable. The NDSU corn breeding program will conduct state hybrid corn performance trials regionally within ND, a potential value of $289,380,000. Therefore, choosing the best and most adapted early maturing hybrid for a farm will give the most profitable product."

On average, forages are harvested from more than 1.6 million ha annually, with many more directly harvested by grazing animals. South Dakota consistently ranks among the top 10 states for total forage production (South Dakota Agriculture Statistics Service, 2008). The South Dakota Department of Agriculture is attempting to bring new and potentially large dairies into the state, particularly along the I-29 corridor. An adequate forage supply, especially alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), will be critical to the success of this endeavor as high-producing dairy cows require a higher quality diet than beef cattle. Continual alfalfa production research, along with testing of new alfalfa cultivars, will aid alfalfa producers throughout the state and region. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is an important crop for feed, fuel, and conservation (Sanderson et al., 1996). An economic model developed by USDOE, USDA, and the University of Tennessee identified the northern Great Plains as a region where switchgrass grown as an energy crop could be produced for a profit equal to or greater than that of traditional crops on the same land. The model also predicted that switchgrass profitably grown for biomass could feasibly displace non-alfalfa hay and wheat on about 650,000 hectares in the Dakotas (Walsh et al., 1998). Much of the current research on switchgrass for bioenergy focuses on the development of high-yielding cultivars and on management practices that minimize inputs, promote sustainability, and maximize biomass production (Sanderson et al., 1996). A major concern associated with planting solid stands of switchgrass over large continuous areas is the effect this lack of biodiversity might have on long-term productivity and sustainability, however. Therefore, research regarding production, management, and use of other species and mixtures of species for bioenergy is required. General Methods For each of the objectives, various forage crops will be planted in replicated trials for statistical analysis. Management treatments, such as herbicide use or not, harvest timing, and nitrogen fertility will be used depending on the objective and nature of the experiment. Expected Outcomes and Impacts Key outcomes of the proposed research include but are not limited to: 1. Increased understanding of best management of GMO alfalfa. Due to likely cost of this seed, seeding rates may be affected and this research should particularly address this need. 2. Improvement in our knowledge of various grasses for bioenergy. This includes grasses (e.g., prairie cordgrass) that heretofore have received little attention from either a forage or biomass perspective. 3. Increased awareness and understanding of how to manage the landscape utilizing perennial forages that are best adapted to the area in which they are grown. 4. Improved knowledge of use of marginal lands with incorporation of perennial grasses in areas where they are most adapted and row crops are ill adapted."

Stored product losses resulting from insect infestation are extensive and are usually associated with the occurrence of internal feeders such as lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica Fabricious) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) and rice weevils (Sitophilus oryzae Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The reasons why psocids have only recently risen to prominence as serious pests of stored grain in Australia are not fully known. However, it has been suggested that the reduction of residual pesticides to treat grain and structures is a major factor (CSIRO GRL 2003). It's also hypothesized that phosphine and other measures currently used are effective against other insect pests (beetles) but not psocids thereby leaving psocids free from competition and predation (CSIRO GRL 2003). It is also suggested that because psocids are highly mobile insects, they will reinvade fumigated grain before other insects; in the absence of competition and predation, psocid population growth is explosive resulting in spectacular outbreaks (CSIRO GRL 2003). In relation to grain shipments for export, psocid infestation can lead to serious financial penalties. Psocid infestations also lead to significant weight losses in stored grain. They suggest that because psocids erode the surface layers of grains and damage is difficult to see, their status as pests is often underestimated. In ition, infestation of seed grain by psocids can lead to reduced seed germination as a result of psocid preference for grain germ (Kucerova 2002). A major source of concern is the finding that psocid infestations in grain storages, grain processing facilities, and product warehouses could exacerbate other stored-product pest problems (Opit, unpublished data). When psocids are present in large numbers, they taint the food on which they are living, thereby deteriorating the quality of stored commodities (Turner 1994, Kucerova 2002). Psocids also spread spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms and their importance as a health hazard stems from this problem (Kucerova 2002). Psocids are persistent pests in grain storages, grain processing facilities, and product warehouses (Rees and Walker 1990). The reasons they are considered stored-product pests have already been stated. Psocids are highly resistant to entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria; this may be due to cuticular fatty amides that decrease hydrophobicity and static charge, thereby reducing adhesion by microorganisms (Turner 1988, Lord and Howard 2004). The study on diet showed that corn, milo, barley, oats, wheat, and rice are all suitable for rapid multiplication of psocid populations (Opit and Throne 2008b). As already mentioned, little research has been conducted on the biology and ecology of stored-product psocids worldwide and this presents a challenge to the development of effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs to mitigate their economic impact. Without user-friendly sampling protocols that can be recommended by extension personnel and county educators, population-based management programs will not gain widespread acceptance."

At one extreme are tropical-climate cereals such as maize and rice that suffer chilling injury when exposed to 10C for an extended period; while at the other extreme are the temperate-climate cereals such as wheat, barley, and rye that are capable of surviving the temperate-climate winter. This ability to survive the temperate-climate winter is known as winter hardiness. Two key genetic loci are now known to affect winter hardiness, Frost Resistance-1 (FR-1) and FR-2. The FR-1 locus is tightly linked to VRN-1, a gene that determines whether these cereal plants require an extended period of low, nonfreezing temperatures to induce flowering, while FR-2 encompasses a cluster of genes encoding C-Repeat Binding Factor (CBF) proteins, which are DNA binding proteins that activate genetic and biochemical pathways conferring freezing tolerance. A question of fundamental importance in the quest to understand how these cereals survive freezing temperatures is whether FR 1 and VRN 1 are the manifestation of the same gene, or are the affects of two tightly-linked and inseparable genes. Recent studies also indicate that VRN-1/FR-1 is a negative regulator of the CBF genes at FR-2 suggesting that an important aspect of winter hardiness is mediated not only by these two loci but through interactions between them. Multiple lines of evidence also suggest that FR-1 and FR-2 affect drought tolerance, a trait much more difficult to measure, quantify, and breed for than low temperature tolerance. Goals of the work proposed here are (1) to better understand the nature of the interaction between VRN-1/FR-1 and FR-2, (2) to gain greater insight into the regulation of the CBF genes at FR-2 in the absence of the negative affects of VRN-1/FR-1, (3) and to integrate this information with a more complete structural analysis of the FR-2 locus. These studies will contribute fundamental knowledge that will allow for the enhanced productivity of cereal plants through increased tolerances to freezing and drought conditions."

These molecules regulate cellular activities by inhibiting the synthesis or function of longer RNA molecules. This project will identify small RNAs from important crop and model systems, including rice and maize, together representing two of the most important staple foods for the majority of the world's population. Although small RNAs were only found a few years ago to constitute an important regulatory force in animals and plants, several small RNAs have been shown to be associated with plant development and responses to stress. This indicates that small RNAs exist in crop plants such as rice that help plants respond optimally to various environmental and biological stresses. We have developed technologies for identifying and measuring small RNAs at a very large scale. Using this approach, we will identify and measure the changes in the small RNAs that altered in rice in response to different types of environmental or pathogen stress, and understand the mechanisms that regulate the biogenesis or activity of these small RNAs. These small RNAs may regulate other genes during the response to these important stresses. We postulate that some of these small RNAs will be conserved in plant species, and we will test this hypothesis by evaluating several examples from the NPGS using standard techniques. This project has the potential to improve the utility of germplasm in the NPGS with important and novel genetic information about traits of agronomic interest. Because of the similarities among genomes of cereal crops, identification of the genomic locations or genes encoding these small RNAs will also help identify the locations of the homologous genes in other crops such as wheat, and barley."

Therefore, it is essential that the food processing industry have improved tools available to evaluate the composition and properties of foods, in order to provide the consumer with the quality that he/she demands. Also, as more biofuels and other industrial products are produced from agricultural commodities, the need for rapid analytical methods that can help to improve the efficiencies of these processes is great. Three different molecular spectroscopy techniques, mid-infrared, near-infrared and Raman, can be used to fill these needs. These three spectroscopic techniques have the potential to replace existing, time-consuming wet-chemical methods of analysis, and may provide a practical means for some analyses where no successful methods presently exist. Obtaining real-time analytical data will provide information to processors that will allow them to provide better quality food to consumers, and to improve the efficiency of processes used to convert agricultural commodities into fuels and useful industrial products. Specifically, better quality egg products for consumers and more efficient production of fuel ethanol may result from this project. This should ultimately improve the competitiveness of U.S. processors. Successful development of a rapid method for classifying wheat based on its starch type may also improve the efficiency of plant geneticists in identifying wheat with desired traits. The development of practical spectroscopic methods will help to minimize the use of hazardous chemicals, reducing safety concerns and reducing the generation of hazardous laboratory wastes that need disposal. Ultimately, improving the ability of processors to more rapidly and reliably measure product quality should lead to the availability of better quality products for consumers at a reasonable cost."

The effectiveness of cold is a feature common to the three phenomena: breaking to dormancy, releasing of brachyblasty and vernalziation (Chouard 1960). A period of low temperature is required to accelerate ability or competence to flower (a process known as vernalization) for winter wheat but not for spring wheat (Law, 1987). There is also a significant difference between spring wheat and winter wheat cultivars in resistance to pre-harvest sprouting that is mainly due to precocious breakage of seed dormancy (Liu et al.). It is reasonable to speculate that there are genetic associations among dormancy, pre-harvesting and vernalization in wheat. The proposed project will test this hypothesis and unravel genetic basis of seed dormancy in winter wheat."

A review of the scientific literature concluded that consuming at least three servings (equivalent to 3 ounces) of whole grain per day can reduce risk of coronary heart disease and diabetes and can assist with weight maintenance based on strong evidence from numerous scientific studies. Over 3000 new whole grain foods have been introduced into the marketplace over the past several years. Research has been conducted to examine the phytochemical and antioxidant content in fruits and vegetables. Little systematic examination of whole grain foods has been undertaken to more fully understand the potential bioactive compounds contained in whole grain foods. In addi-tion, the American Association of Cereal Chemists International (AACCI) Whole Grains Task Force has been directly involved in suggesting specific research related to the pytochemical content, bioactivity and bioavailability related to whole grain foods. However, there are no methods or simple markers to identify whole grains or whole grain products. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop reliable whole grain markers for the rapidly growing food industry and FDA regulations. Our recent preliminary data indicated that both bran and germ have their unique phytochemical profiles. This led us to develop a hypothesis that each fraction, endosperm, germ and bran, may have their unique phytochemical profiles. The overall goal of this research is to identify unique phytochemical markers of whole grain wheat and whole grain wheat products. The specific objectives are: 1) To develop a unique phytochemical fingerprint to predict percentage of starchy endosperm, germ and bran fractions in whole wheat flour using the phytochemical profiles of total phenolics (free, bound and total), ferulic acids, carotenoids, total antioxidant activity, and cellular antioxidant activity. 2) To discover novel bioactive compounds from each fraction of endosperm, germ and bran.

Mycotoxins can be produced in grain during storage or processing, but are most frequently associated with fungal infection that occur before harvest. Environmental factors that determine fungal infection and mycotoxin production are complex. Generally, a basal level of mycotoxins is present in US grain; however, in some years, environmental conditions lead to localized or widespread outbreaks of mycotoxin contamination. However, there is no organized monitoring system for tracking the incidence and severity of mycotoxin contamination at either the national or regional levels. Although breeding and transgenic technologies have shown promise for reducing the risk of mycotoxin contamination of grain, to date no commercial variety of any major US crop is available with either genetic or transgenic resistance to mycotoxin contamination. The need, as indicated by stakeholders, and likely impacts from completion of the work. For grain and livestock producers, the most important issues are preventing mycotoxin contamination and reducing the effects of mycotoxins on livestock. For grain buyers and food processors, the primary issue is being able to rapidly assess the quality of grain as pertaining to mycotoxins and mycotoxigenic fungi. The worst-case scenario for these stakeholders is to own millions of bushels of corn contaminated with unacceptable levels of aflatoxins and fumonisins, or wheat with excessive concentrations of deoxynivalenol (DON). Rapid methods to detect mycotoxins at the first points of sale (elevators) as well as methods to detect mycotoxigenic fungi in the commodity (e.g. DON-producing Fusarium in barley) would address these concerns. Additionally, these stakeholders need cost-effective methods to detoxify mycotoxins and prevent further deterioration of contaminated grain. The lowering of tolerance limits for mycotoxins in overseas markets has increased the burden for grain buyers and food processors; currently, levels of mycotoxins that are acceptable for some US products are unacceptable in European and Asian markets resulting in non tarrif trade barriers. New methods to monitor and treat contaminated grain would benefit domestic consumers and would allow American commodities to compete more effectively in foreign markets. Finally, workers who are responsible for animal and human health need information about the toxicity, carcinogenicity, modes of action, and biomarkers of exposure and disease for all categories of mycotoxins. This information would be used to train health-care providers to identify exposure and treat related disease, as well as to develop accurate risk assessment recommendations."

Soft red and soft white winter wheats produced in Michigan are used in numerous products such as breakfast cereals, pastries and baked goods, and soup thickeners. An economic study by Peterson and colleagues, 2006, showed the total value of breakfast cereal, breads, bakery, cookies crackers and pasta manufacturing in Michigan was greater than $3.9 billion in 2002. Any improvement in wheat production in MI will have a large beneficial effect on MI economy and natural resources. The MSU Wheat Breeding and Genetics Program employs breeding and research for wheat improvement. The advantage of developing improved genotypes through breeding is that this improvement is packaged in the seed itself, and therefore the new technology is available to the farmer with the purchase of the seed. The Wheat Industry in Michigan has many needs from farm to fork. From producers, to millers, end users and consumers, limiting factors at any one of these stages hinder the wheat industry. Two issues are of great concern to the MI wheat industry are Fusarium head blight (FHB) and Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS). FHB is a fungal disease of wheat that attacks the wheat grain, and DON (deoxynivalenol), a toxin, is produced in the wheat. PHS is germination of the seed before harvest, a phenomenon that quickly destroys wheat quality. The US Food and Drug Administration has set a federal advisory limit of DON according to the end-use of the food product (http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/plantsci/pests/pp1302w.htm). Losses felt by the farmers during epidemic years in MI have had a major impact on farmers' views towards producing wheat. Furthermore, losses to millers, wheat users (such as Kellogg'sr and Postr Cereal companies in MI), and consumers compound the losses at the farm gate. Likewise, regarding PHS, in 2008 some white wheat farmers in the thumb of MI suffered extensive losses due to PHS, as rains during harvest season prevented timely harvest. The activation of the alpha amylase enzyme during germination degrades starches, and therefore dramatically affects the quality of sprouted grain. While MI farmers grow both soft red and soft white winter wheat, the bran of soft white winter wheat is an especially valuable commodity for local industries, as the bran is more palatable and has higher consumer preference. MI is one of the few areas of eastern North America that produce soft white wheat. Although MI still produces a large quantity of soft white wheat, the soft white wheat production in MI has declined. The drop in sales in MI is believed to be from a number of factors, including FHB, PHS, and perceived lower yield by growers. Although companies often offer premiums for white wheat, these premiums cannot always make up for the challenges in production. Improving soft white wheat resistance to FHB and PHS can therefore have a major impact on white wheat production and benefit the Agri-Food industry in MI."

Wheat quality will be analyzed for its milling, dough and end-use product quality. Barley and triticale will be evaluated mainly for their protein content as both as used extensively for feed grains. It is well known that the environment plays a key role in grain quality, so samples will be collected from two or more environments. We will also determine the effect of compositing grain from different environments to learn if the composite sample represents the average of the environments, thus greatly reducing the number of samples needed to be analyzed. This project is expected to support the development of new cultivars, germplasm, and scientific publications. Plant breeding is one of the most accountable sciences and can be readily evaluated by the acceptance of the cultivars released. Currently, 57% of the wheat grown in Nebraska has been released by the current breeding team. In the next five years, we expect this percentage to increase. We further expect to develop cultivars adapted to irrigation and to the southeast part of Nebraska. As for publications, we expect them to be published in internationally recognized, peer-reviewed journals."

On the global scale, wheat is one of two crops that feed the largest number of people. Wheat also provides 20% of the total protein in the human diet. In light of the significance of wheat for the economy of California and this country, it is important that US wheat breeders continue improving wheat yield potential and its stability and the nutritional and technological quality of wheat flour. Wheat wild relatives possess resistance to every wheat disease and exceptional levels of tolerance of frost, heat, drought, and mineral deficiencies and excesses. It is highly desirable to exploit this potential of wild relatives of wheat for the improvement of wheat cultivars. There are two problems that currently limit the practical utilization of this genetic resource. Genetic bases of most of the economically important traits are poorly understood or entirely unknown and the foreign genes cannot be easily incorporated into wheat by the traditional breeding methods. Both these limitations are addressed in this project. Domesticated wheat was crossed with wild wheat and the genetic foundations of differences between domesticated and wild wheat will be determined. A gene was discovered in a wild relative of wheat that holds promise to facilitate the incorporation of foreign genes into wheat by otherwise traditional breeding methods. The development of a wheat line with this gene and molecular markers facilitating its deployment in breeding are targeted in this project."

According to the USDA's Economic Research Service, every dollar of exports creates an additional $1.48 in supporting activities to process, package, finance and ship agricultural products. Thus, $90 billion in agricultural exports generates an additional $133 billion in value-added support. Virginia agriculture is dependent on foreign markets for its output. In 1999, Virginia's agricultural exports reached $400 million. By 2006, exports increased by over 40 percent to $589 million and show no sign of decline. Wheat, poultry, live animals, tobacco and other agricultural products make up the top five exporting categories, with Rockingham, Augusta, Accomack, Page and Shenandoah counties accounting for the largest share by value (40 percent). Expanding existing markets and opening new markets through future trade agreements is clearly a high priority for U.S. agriculture. However, most international trade economists tend to agree that the multilateral process of the World Trade Organization has done very little to improve market access conditions. As a consequence, most, if not all, countries are pursuing bilateral and regional trade agreements. Indeed, we have witnessed an explosion in the number of regional agreements signed and entered into force in the last decade alone. The latest annual report of the WTO's Committee on Regional Trade Agreements shows a total of 183 agreements currently in force. Moreover, the WTO is in the process of reviewing an additional 141 regional trade agreements. Since the creation of the WTO in 1995, the Committee has received an average of 11 notifications per year, almost one per month and every WTO Member except Mongolia is now party to at least one regional or bilateral agreement. The proliferation of regional integration over the last decade as well as the number of RTAs under negotiation poses a number of interesting policy questions for international trade economists. Many agreements signed over the last decade contain numerous commodity specific exemptions concerning sensitive agricultural commodities; long transitional periods of trade liberalization lasting more than a decade; long-standing controversies about the interpretation of WTO provisions against which regional agreements are assessed; and the deplorable fact that tariffs and non-tariff barriers continue to plague agricultural trade.

Our desert clientele see dairy and beef as alternatives that allow them to diversify and maintain profitability. However, hot summers induce alfalfa to suffer a  summer slump  that slows growth and reduces forage quality. The most common annual summer crops to supplement forage demand, sudangrass and maize, produce lower quality forage, require more fertilizer, and often have adverse effects on subsequent rotational crops. Growers have asked that we find potential solutions that would sustain forage production and improve crop diversity and productivity. We will investigate the potential of several legume crops as forage, their fit in current production systems, and intercropping these legumes with maize in Arizona. Alternative legume forage crops, such as lablab (Lablab purpureus), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) will be planted in early summer and regularly harvested to evaluate quality and yield. A bare ground treatment will also be included in the study as a control, and all treatments will be followed by a fall planting of wheat. Pre- and post-plant soil nitrogen will be measured, as well as the nutrient status of the wheat crop. Field experiments at research stations in the 1st and 2nd year will quantify yield and quality of these forage crops and their effects on the following rotational crop. We will work with participating growers to conduct an economic analysis to help choose the best alternatives for farms typical of the region. After legumes with high quality and yield are identified in the environment of Arizona and southern California, on-farm trials will be conducted in the 2nd and 3rd year with participating growers to investigate the potential of the legumes crops alone and intercropping these legumes with maize to improve the quality of grass forages. Research findings will be disseminated to growers and other agricultural professionals by field days, presentations at grower meetings, one to one communications, and extension publications.

Thus, the goal of this project is to identify seed dormancy genes from weedy or wild species and integrate the beneficial alleles into wheat and rice varieties to improve their resistance to PHS. To accomplish this goal, we have collected gene donors of seed dormancy from weedy rice (Oryza sativa) and synthetic hexaploid wheat lines derived from goatgrass (Aegilops tauschii), and also detected some quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with seed dormancy in weedy rice. The objectives of this project are: 1) to fine map and clone QTLs for seed dormancy in rice, 2) to identify genes for seed dormancy/PHS in wheat, and 3) to incorporate seed dormancy genes into commercial varieties to improve their PHS resistance. We will use a map-based strategy to clone the seed dormancy QTL underlying genes from weedy rice and use a QTL analysis strategy to identify the loci associated with resistance to PHS in the synthetic wheat-derived DH (double haploid) populations. As an alternative, the dormancy genes cloned from rice will also be used to probe their wheat homologs, because of the colinearity in gene order and content between rice and other grass species. The gene or QTL alleles enhancing resistance to PHS will be introduced from the weedy/wild relatives into the genetic background of cultivars to develop new germplasm. The new lines will be used as parental materials in our spring and winter wheat breeding programs to develop white grain colored varieties that are resistant to PHS by marker-assisted selection and other techniques. Thus, expected outputs from this project will include the genetic/genomic and molecular information about naturally occurring genes regulating seed dormancy in the rice and wheat crops and new lines and breeding materials with the beneficial exotic alleles imparting resistance to PHS. The knowledge gained from this research will also be valuable to develop new weed management strategies, as seed dormancy promotes persistence of weeds in agro-ecosystems."

These increased demands on production agriculture to supply multiple industries have led to greater attention to production constraints such as disease and other pest management concerns. The research proposed will address integrated disease management for several important cropping systems in the state. Diseases of interest are primarily those with high levels of potential economic impact, such as head scab of wheat, soybean cyst nematode, rusts of cereals and others. Additionally, the research will address the potential threat of emerging and invasive disease agents such as Asian soybean rust, High Plains Virus of wheat, and the corn cyst nematode. The purposes of this research are: to discover mitigation methods for major crop disease threats; to integrate useful and effective methods for disease management; and to develop tools for use in achieving a greater level of sustainable agricultural management in South Dakota. Without this research, it is likely that production limitations imposed by crop diseases will lead to lower production, lower quality and value of production, greater pressure on limited resources for both the animal and biofuels industries, and a reduction of environmental quality due to non-sustainable disease management practices. Field, greenhouse and laboratory experimentation will be directed at developing and refining component methods for disease management in relevant host/pathogen systems. Research will also be conducted to discover effective integrated strategies for South Dakota. It is expected that the research will result in several outcomes/impacts including: research publications and non-technical publications summarizing research results; web-delivered forecast or risk assessment tools for head scab of wheat and soybean rust; web-delivered management information for major crop diseases, with recommendations based on project research; increase in adoption of integrated disease management; reduction in prescriptive uses of fungicides with a trend toward risk-based management/usage; and increased awareness among the state's producers of invasive and emergent pathogens/diseases through the monitoring components of the proposed research."

Small grain cereals (winter and spring wheat and spring barley) account for more than 80% of the acreage annually. Traditional rotation crops are pea and lentil. This has prompted many of the region's growers to investigate alternative crops to avoid the disease build up and other problems associated with monoculture cereal production. Brassicaceae crops such as canola, rapeseed and mustard have shown potential as good rotational crops. The reasons behind high cereal yield following Brassicaceae crops is as yet not fully understood, and are almost certainly a combination of several factors, including; a break from monocot crop production; long tap roots that break up soil compaction; improved water percolation; high plant biomass that improves the soil physical structure and water holding capacity, and reduces erosion; and these crops have glucosinolates, which break down in the soil to produce toxic pesticidal substances . Breeding efforts resulting from this proposal will develop superior Brassica oilseed and mustard cultivars that are highly adapted to a wide range of dryland and irrigated regions of Idaho and other U.S. regions. Availability of these crops will offer growers greater flexibility and alternatives to include in crop rotation, help to reduce crop inputs, improve profitability and sustainability, and make growers more competitive in international markets."

Hessian fly is of economic importance in Idaho, Washington state and Oregon. Due to the existence of virulence against the H3 resistant gene in northern Idaho and eastern Washington Hessian fly populations, utilization of multiple genes for resistance is critical to enhance durability of resistant varieties. It is important to continue the development of resistant varieties that utilize different genes for resistance, so as to provide more options for growers. Furthermore, it is important to regularly monitor the effectiveness of the presently deployed resistant varieties to determine if Hessian fly biotypes capable of attacking the resistant varieties are increasing in proportion in the fly population. The availability of adapted, Hessian fly-resistant varieties will provide Pacific Northwest wheat producers with an option to minimize the potentially increasing economic losses associated with this pest. Potential differences in adult Hessian fly survival and emergence between different tillage systems have not been examined in Idaho, so it is not clear if reduced tillage fields are contributing to greater pest infestations across the landscape. A full understanding of the influence of tillage practices on fly biology will improve our ability to adjust production practices to improve the management of this pest. A combination of laboratory and field experiments will be used. Results of this work will provide growers in the Pacific Northwest with new spring wheat varieties with resistance to Hessian fly. The project will help in the identification of effective markers for the H3 gene for Hessian fly resistance. Additionally, the project will provide information on the effectiveness of currently deployed fly resistance genes. It will also generate information on potential differences in fly survival and emergence under different tillage systems."

The strategy of diffuse pollution abatement is to select and apply conservation practices to these areas based on type of land use activity, physical condition of the watershed, pollutant type and site-specific conditions. Without such knowledge, the TMDL approach may result in improperly assigned expectations to landowners in the watershed, and millions of dollars may be spent without the intended effect on water quality. With a thorough understanding of the physical and socio-economic processes driving successful targeting and adoption of management practices we can develop tools to quantify the reduction in pollutant loading at the watershed outlet. Properly developed tools can be used to prepare for future challenges such as increased urbanization and climate change. This work provides an understanding of the hydrologic response to climate change in the Pacific Northwest including variability by region and elevation. The largest runoff events in the Pacific Northwest are often caused by rain-on-snow processes. An increase in temperature can dramatically alter the probability/risk of rain-on-snow events. Knowing the hydrologic sensitivity of a particular region to climate change will lead to pro-active watershed management which anticipates future problems rather than responds to problems after they have already occurred. Outcomes of this work include specific recommendations for the selection and placement of conservation practices in agricultural and forest settings of the Northwest Wheat and Range Region. Continued monitoring of surface water quantity and quality will provide further evidence of the effectiveness of conservation practices in the Paradise Creek watershed. This evidence will translate in recommendations for similar practices in watersheds of the region. Relationships between turbidity and derived constituents such as total suspended sediment and phosphorus may be compared to those found at other locations. The development of approaches to incorporate climate change into watershed models will provide scenario testing tools that can be used to design future actions to lessen the impacts of changing precipitation and temperature regimes on crop production and water quality in watersheds locally and in general."

The growing demand for tortillas has increased the need for suitable wheat varieties that can consistently produce good quality product. However, there is at present no means to predict tortilla quality (mainly extensibility and flexibility) based on wheat or wheat flour properties. So far, investigations have failed to find a link between protein and starch attributes that typically predict bread quality, and tortilla quality. This presents a constant challenge to manufacturers who have to rely on trial and error, and use of several additives to optimize product quality; which usually results in products of inferior sensory quality as well as increased production costs. Our long term goal is to improve process efficiency, quality, and health attributes of tortillas and other flat breads (pizza crust, pita, etc) by developing rapid and simple methods that can be used by flour millers and food processors to predict product quality based on raw material characteristics. Through this project, we aim to establish how pentosans interact with wheat gluten and starch during tortilla processing, and define how such interactions affect dough rheology and product physical quality attributes. This work will provide a basis for screening methods to evaluate wheat varieties for tortilla processing attributes. This will aid in efficient breeding and genetic selection of wheat lines for tortillas and flat breads market, as well as improve food processing efficiency and product quality."

The most common broadleaf rotation crops in these cereal based cropping systems are grain legumes: dry pea, lentil, and chickpea. Acreage of grain legumes is decreasing and alternatives are needed. In addition, many of the lower rainfall areas (16 inches of annual precipitation or less) of Washington are not suited to grow grain legumes, and do not have acceptable broadleaf crop rotation options. If an acceptable broadleaf rotation crop was available in the lower rainfall areas, it could be incorporated into the cropping system with minimal impact on wheat production. Furthermore, if that broadleaf rotation crop is a biofuel crop, the conundrum of food versus fuel associated with biofuel production from crop plants could be minimized. Camelina is an oilseed crop of interest that meets much of these criteria and has been recently grown on substantial acreage in Montana, and is starting to be produced in Washington and other Pacific Northwest states on a very limited basis. Information about cultural practices and adaptation of camelina in Washington is needed by growers to make decision about utilization of this crop in rotation with wheat. With a good technical knowledge base supporting adoption of camelina, the overall productivity and production of this useful oilseed will support a Washington biofuel industry and crop agricultural in general. This project will produce field based production information about adaptation and cultural practices for camelina. Needed information includes: cultivar performance, fertilization requirements, planting practices, adaptation to different growing environments, and integration of camelina into a wheat cropping system. Project studies will address these information needs, and together with information from other similar areas, should provide the technology to rationally utilize camelina in Washington wheat based crop production systems. Complementary efforts from the private and public sectors to contract camelina acreage providing growers have a place to sell camelina, registration of herbicides, approval of camelina meal for animal feed purposes, and a grower support network should facilitate adoption of camelina as a biofuel rotation crop for wheat based production systems in Washington."

The C4 syndrome enables more effective use of high intensities of sunlight, high rates of carbon fixation, and superior water use efficiency. The ultimate goal of this project and cooperating groups is to identify those genes in maize that specifically encode essential steps leading to expression of C4 photosynthesis. If that were achieved it should be possible to introduce these genes, using existing molecular methods, into crop plants (i.e., wheat, rice, soybean) that possess the less efficient C3 mechanism. The challenge is to identify C4 genes in the complex and changing background of gene expression occurring in the developing leaf. One way is to overlay such patterns of gene expression on corresponding gradients in photosynthetic performance in order to correlate expression patterns with specific processes. Numerous physiological parameters are available that reflect different subprocesses that contribute to overall photosynthetic capacity. Such parameters are not trivial to measure, but require an experienced investigator and proper instrumental capabilities. Few laboratories worldwide can provide the breadth of measurement capabilities described in this proposal."

It impacts the lives of millions of people in many different ways, however. The turfgrass industry has grown into a multibillion dollar business worldwide, that includes $57.9 billion in business in the U.S alone in 2000. According to the last North Carolina Turfgrass survey (1999), the total acreage of tufgrass in the state neared 2.14 million acres. Over $1.22 billion was spent to maintain these areas. Single family dwellings were by far the largest single sector of the industry, with 69% of the turf area and 60% of expenditures. Regarding the types of grasses used, tall fescue accounted for over 40% of the total area of maintained turf. Centipede and Bermuda were the next two most common types with 16% and 11%, respectively. North Carolina is located in the transition zone for cool- and warm-season grasses. While this means that we can grow both types of grasses, no one type of grass does well in all weather conditions. Cool season grasses go dormant during hot, dry months and can turn brown and even die during extremely hot and dry conditions. Warm season grasses are very drought tolerant because of their low water requirement, which makes them ideal during the summer months. However, they go dormant and turn brown during the cool days of fall and winter, and winter kill can often be a problem in the NC region. Applied plant breeding can be used to develop turfgrass cultivars that are better adapted to environmental conditions present in North Carolina. Development of cool-season grasses with increased heat and drought tolerance, and warm-season grasses with improved cold tolerance would contribute significantly to different sectors of the turfgrass industry. Genetics and applied plant breeding can also be used to improve aesthetics, performance, and disease resistance of turfgrass cultivars which, in turn, affect the efficiency of maintenance and production. The long-term goal of the program is to improve the sustainability and economic gain of the overall turfgrass industry in the state through the development of cultivars that require reduced inputs and that are capable of tolerating biotic and environmental stresses while still maintaining good quality and overall performance. Despite the fact that large amounts of genomic information have been generated for other grasses such as rice, maize, and wheat, turfgrass species have lagged far behind. Work is needed to generate such information and utilize it to relate phenotypic traits to DNA nucleotide polymorphism."

However, every plant has some degree of innate tolerance or resistance to such stresses but for a successful crop we need to improve the tolerance levels of these crop plants to keep pace with the future food demands. Our hypothesis is that the stress-tolerant phenotype is a result of differential expression of unique proteins in resistant cultivars as compare to the susceptible ones to protect them during stress periods in plant's life. To develop better crop plants for our future needs, discovery of these unique proteins and understanding of the stress-tolerance mechanisms at molecular level is very important. Insights of the stress tolerance proteins-  the key players inside the cell ; will assist our plant breeders in developing better cultivars for our state needs. We can modify these key molecular players to enhance crop's stress tolerance. Discovery of such proteins that are involved in regulating biotic and abiotic stresses will help plant breeders to improve the crop plants using both conventional breeding and transgenic technologies. At present there is much progress in transformation of plants like arabidopsis, tobacco and rice but crops like wheat and soybean have lagging behind. Wheat and soybeans are still considered recalcitrant plants in terms of their genetic transformation potential. Hence, establishing efficient genetic transformation protocols are very important. As a result my research program involve studying both biotic and abiotic stresses to elucidate the mechanism of crop stress tolerance and improving stress tolerance through application of biotechnological means like genetic transformation. The molecular approach will help in understanding the stress tolerance mechanism and the biotechnology approach will be useful in crop-breeding programs."

To meet human needs by 2050, grain production must increase at an annual rate of 2%. Due to the changing climatic conditions and shrinkage of arable land, wheat production is facing numerous challenges, among which drought, heat and diseases are most significant. Genomics, including marker genotyping, genome mapping, genome sequencing, transcriptome profiling and gene silencing is believed as a general mechanism to identify the genes underlying the complicated traits such as biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. Current wheat genomics resources include a collection of >1,000,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), ~16,500 markers, high density linkage maps and deletion bin maps and the BAC libraries. The physical maps of wheat chromosomes and the D genome of Aegilops tauschii are under construction; single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are under development; and whole genome sequencing is under discussion. Taking the advantages of wheat genomics, I propose to construct exotic genetic libraries for dissection of the complex traits and discovery and cloning of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and to develop mutagenesis populations for mutant development. Shattering was the first trait selected against in wheat domestication, but is still a factor of yield loss during harvest by combine. Cloning of shattering gene Br2 will provide a window to understand the molecular mechanism of shattering and help develop strategies to prevent shattering and avoid the introgression of shattering genes as linkage drags. Epidermal cells are the first to perceive the environmental signals and cuticle serves as the front line of defense against drought, heat, frost, UV, pathogens and insects. A review of current knowledge suggested that intracuticular wax plays an important role in drought tolerance by adjusting the cuticle permeability, and epicuticular wax plays important role in heat tolerance by increasing reflectability of sun light. Epidermis is composed of single layer of cells and no EST was made specifically from grass epidermis. Coupling the epidermal transcriptome profiling and VIGS will provide a high throughput approach to identify the cuticle biosynthetic and regulatory genes and lay a foundation to engineer the wheat cuticle for abiotic stress tolerance. Lignocellulosic biomass is the important resource for renewable biofuels. Lignin and derivatives impede cell wall degradation by interfering with access of hydrolytic enzymes to cellulose polymers. Hollow stem limits the biomass yield in the Triticeae grasses. Reduction of lignin by RNAi and breeding solid stem can significantly improve the biomass quality and yield."

The behavior of these vectors in turn can be affected by the host plant's response to virus infection. This project continues investigations into the effects of virus infections on the principal vectors of two important viruses, Potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) and Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV-PAV), affecting potato and wheat respectively. Prior work has shown that volatile cues from infected plants affect aphid behavior with implications for plant-to-plant movement of the virus. In this project, we will address a long-term goal to develop an understanding of the role of virus-induced changes in plants in the spread of PLRV and BYDV and to apply this understanding to reduce the impact of the diseases they cause. The specific objectives are: 1. Assess behavioral responses of aphids to plants at various stages of the disease progression using three pathosystems as models (PLRV- Potato-GPA; BYDV-Wheat-BCOA). 2. Assess if PLRV infection affects virus titer, VIV production, and the resulting distribution of GPA within the plant. 3. Examine effects of VIV on among plant movement by aphids and spread of virus in both pathosystems. 4. Compare responses of viruliferous and nonviruliferous aphids to virus-infected and non-infected plants. Expected outcomes include a research community better informed about the roles of plant cues in spread of important disease causing viruses in crops. This will direct efforts to improve management of aphid-vectored viruses by manipulating their behavior through various means, including plant breeding. Vector management will remain central in efforts to limit virus impacts on key economic and staple crops in the USA and worldwide. Methods based on sound understanding of the biology of these systems are needed and can result from this project."

The program priority addressed is the molecular mechanisms of communication between symbiotic, nitrogen-fixing bacteria and legume plant hosts. These bacteria, rhizobia, invade the roots of legume plants, induce these plants to form a nodule to house them, and establish a symbiotic interaction. In this symbiosis, the bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that the plant can utilize and the plant provides the bacteria with fixed carbon compounds produced by photosynthesis. This symbiosis is critical for agricultural productivity in crops such as alfalfa, soybean, and pea. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which this symbiosis develops is required for improving the symbiotic interaction and ultimately for transferring the plant symbiotic genes to non-legume crops, such as rice and wheat. We are probing the molecular mechanisms of communication between the bacterial symbiont and its plant hosts by studying mutants of the bacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti, that are unable to produce the important polysaccharide succinoglycan, and as a result are unable to invade host plants. We will focus on the role of exoK, a glycanase that is required for succinoglycan modification and specifically required for invasion of one host (Medicago truncatula) but not another (alfalfa). We will also study M. truncatula mutants to determine how the plant responds to succinoglycan to facilitate invasion.

This is accomplished by selecting parents with desirable characteristics, selectively mating parents, generating families of breeding lines from each mating or cross, and evaluating those progeny for important traits. The most desirable progeny are further evaluated to identify new cultivars or selected as parents to begin the cycle again. For most traits, plant breeders use phenotypic selection (directly measuring the trait(s) of interest) to identify superior individuals. Recently, marker assisted selection (MAS) has been used to increase the efficiency of breeding programs. MAS involves mapping the location of an important gene or genes and using nearby genetic markers (DNA sequence) to track the gene in progeny of breeding populations. This technology can often increase the efficiency and decrease the cost of conducting selection in a plant breeding program. Traditional MAS strategies have proven useful for simply inherited traits, but have generally failed to improve complex traits controlled by many genes. Genomic selection differs from this traditional approach because it uses many genetic markers distributed across the entire genome to predict the performance of a given breeding line. The most valuable asset of genomic selection is that it can dramatically shorten the breeding cycle ? the time from making a cross between two parents to when a progeny of that cross is used as a parent in a new cross. For many programs a breeding cycle will be three to seven years. Using genomic selection this can be shortened to as little as one year. Genomic selection has been investigated through computer simulation, but has not been empirically tested in a plant breeding program. The goal of this project is to measure the effectiveness of genomic selection in a spring barley and winter wheat breeding program."

The expectation is that by conserving diversity we will also preserve valuable ecosystem services such as natural pest suppression, and an increasing number of studies support this view. However, little is known about the consequences of biodiversity loss for the dynamics of vector-borne diseases. Understanding the impacts of declining predator diversity on the transmission of vector-borne diseases is of particular importance because ecosystem services provided by higher trophic levels, such as the suppression of disease vectors by predators, are predicted to be at greater risk from extinction than services provided by organisms at other trophic levels."

Theoretical development will be validated with sophisticated simulation studies and data on actual mapping populations generated by wheat breeding programs at University of Nebraska and International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center. Specific objectives include (1) develop statistical models capable of accommodating multiple QTLs, epistatic effects, and GxE interactions using the adaptive mixed LASSO method; (2) establish a mapping population using accessions in the Nebraska Wheat Breeding Program and carry out association analysis on a variety of traits; (3) develop a software package to facilitate the application of the proposed methods by plant researchers using the R statistical software. The proposed research is significant in that it is among the first to offer an unified framework (the adaptive mixed LASSO) for modeling epistasis and GxE interactions for association mapping in structured plant populations. Since our research is closely integrated with ongoing crop breeding effort, the methodology development is oriented to understanding the genetic regulation of complex traits in target populations and will be readily applicable to crop improvement effort."

As zero tillage practices become more common, herbicide use will continue to increase. Currently, mechanical tillage is the only practical alternative to chemical fallow. However, tillage decreases residue cover, resulting in increased soil erosion. Strategic grazing of grain stubble and weeds by sheep offers an alternative to traditional stubble and weed management, and no-till biomass reduction for seed bed preparation with the added benefit of not negatively influencing soil nutrient cycling or increasing erosion potential. In addition, sheep grazing summer fallow may significantly reduce use and thus selection pressure for glyphosate resistant weeds by precluding the need to control weeds with glyphosate. Our goal is the profitable incorporation of sheep into grain production systems to reduce pesticide and fossil fuel use in fallow and stubble management. Our objectives are: 1: Compare two crop systems and three management systems (in 3 year rotation only) on: a) Grain and forage production b) weed composition, c) Population dynamics of two problematic weed species, d) Nitrogen cycling, e) Abundances and diversity of pest and beneficial insects associated with different crops, bordering crops(annual, perennial, and fallow), and fallow treatments, g) Abundances and activities of pollinators associated with alfalfa and flowering weeds. The crop rotations are 1) Continuous spring wheat - long term project control. 2) Three year rotation, spring wheat - spring planted forage pea/hay barley intercrop- summer fallow in a three year rotation with each component present every year. Within the three year rotation the management systems are: 1) No-till with sheep grazing to manage summer fallow, crop residues, and to harvest the forage crop; 2) Minimum tillage with herbicides use to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage for seed bed preparation; 3) Conventional Tillage used to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage used for seed bed preparation. 2: Using production, input data, and peer reviewed published results to compare profitability and cash flow of our two crop systems and three management systems. 3: Conduct `on campus' field demonstrations and cooperate with local high school to include student field and lab work in sustainable ag in the biological sciences. Publish and communicate results and potential economic and biological advantages of incorporating sheep grazing of stubble and weeds into a sustainable grain farming system. Our interdisciplinary team of scientists anticipates a positive long term biological and economical outcome from the integrated system of weed management by sheep grazing, and significant reduction in herbicide use in the Northern Great Plains. The proposed system encourages profitable cooperation between diverse agricultural enterprises by linking a source of inexpensive feed for sheep producers with a successful pest control method for grain farmers."

The Earth's  deep biosphere  includes a variety of sub-surface habitats on Earth, such as mines, aquifers, and soils on the continents, and the sediments and igneous rock below the ocean floor. It is estimated that nearly half of the total biomass on Earth resides in the deep biosphere. Technological hurdles have limited examination of the sub-surface biosphere sites to relatively few locations and only shallow drilling. These limits have hindered deep biosphere research, skewing data sets towards environmental accessibility, and precluding the development of a more accurate global census. The largest potential subsurface biome is also the least accessible: the sub-seafloor biosphere which is estimated to harbor one third of all biomass on Earth in the two environments of igneous ocean crust and sediments. Today, we know far too little about the organisms of these sub-surface microbial communities or the critical abiotic and biotic processes within this unique biosphere. However, attention to the sub-surface Earth and biology, is increasing, and the technologies available for sampling, monitoring, and experiments has dramatically improved in the last decade. Intellectual Merit:  This Center will provide a framework for a large, multi-disciplinary group of scientists to pursue fundamental questions about life deep in the sub-surface environment of Earth. The fundamental science questions of C-DEBI involve exploration and discovery, uncovering the processes that constrain the sub-surface biosphere below the oceans, and implications to the Earth system. What type of life exists in this deep biosphere, how much, and how is it distributed and dispersed? What are the physical-chemical conditions that promote or limit life? What are the important oxidation-reduction processes and are they unique or important to humankind? How does this biosphere influence global energy and material cycles, particularly the carbon cycle? Finally, can we discern how such life evolved in geological settings beneath the ocean floor, and how this might relate to ideas about the origin of life on our planet? This Center will be led by a world-class team of investigators who bring different disciplinary foundations for the intellectual and technical challenges of the research: Drs. Katrina Edwards (University of Southern California); Andrew Fisher (University California, Santa Cruz), James Cowen (University of Hawai'i, Manoa), Steve D'Hondt (University of Rhode Island), and Jeff Wheat (University of Alaska, Fairbanks). These leaders, with their large group of collaborators in the Center, bring expertise in molecular biology, microbial ecology, hydro-geophysics, microbial biogeochemistry, geology, sediment and hydrothermal geochemistry, modeling, theory, and technology/instrument development.Broader Impacts:  C-DEBI will develop new technologies and conceptual models for studying this realm; to train and educate the interdisciplinary scientists who will define and pursue the future of this science and excite the public; and to interface efficiently with the international ocean drilling enterprise: the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. Coordination and integration of the research an education, the national and international projects, and the development and deployment of observing systems and experimental technology will be a strong focus of the Center. C-DEBI will accelerate interdisciplinary collaboration between PIs, post-docs, graduate and undergraduate students to uncover the nature and importance of the deep biosphere. The Center will train undergraduate and graduate students and provide fellowship support across the institutions. Existing courses and new ones will use C-DEBI science to teach fundamental knowledge about Earth systems and different life forms discovered in the deep biosphere. Public lectures, museum exhibits, and science-at-sea activities will be employed to inform and excite the public about their world. C-DEBI will train teachers and invest significantly in broadening the diversity of those who pursue science and technology careers in our nation. The Center will use the diversity of existing education, outreach and training programs, from K-8 through under-graduate programs, at all partnership institutions to help attract under-represented groups to science, and the Center will directly engage minority serving state universities and community colleges to meet this challenge.  The lead institution is one of the most diverse campuses in the country, and partner institutions variously are well poised with regard to attracting Hispanics, African Americans, Native Hawai'ians and Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans.  The C-DEBI group of scientists has been excellent in supporting gender diversity in graduate programs in the recent past, as do the departmental units in which the lead investigators sit. C-DEBI will specifically target career advancement for women in science, and the recruitment of women into ocean sciences.  The investigators have a good record with regard to attracting Hispanic and Native American students at this level."

The data are used to estimate and test a statistical model of a non-linear relationship between weather and output; the results of that model are predictions about the yield variability of the four major staple crops in all major global production regions. The next step uses existing climate change projections to develop sensible predictions for future specific changes in weather patterns, including changes in the mean/average outcome, changes in the variability of climate, and correlation between the different production regions. The results of the first two steps are then combined to give a prediction of how climate change will change the distribution of agricultural yields. The next step is to consider how past weather shocks have affected supply and demand for these staple crops. This information is used to estimate a structural model of supply and demand for each of the four staple crops. Combining this market model with the predicted changes in the distribution of agricultural yields allows the PIs to make predictions about how future climate change will affect commodity prices. The models will also be used to examine the likely effects of changes in government policy and changes in how farmers and commodity traders store crops from year to year.

This symbiosis leads to the formation of root nodules inside which the rhizobia transform air nitrogen into forms assimilable by the plant.  Every year, in the United States, this symbiosis saves around $4.5 billion in fertilizer costs and prevents ecological and health issues associated with the excessive use of chemical fertilizers.  The rhizobium-legume symbiosis presents a high level of species specificity which means that specific legumes only associate with specific rhizobia.  This specificity mechanism is mostly controlled by the structure of LCO (Lipo-Chito-Oligosaccharide) signals produced by the rhizobia and recognized by their host plants. LCOs also mediate associations with symbiotic fungi which occur in legumes but also in many other non-legume crops such as corn, wheat and cotton. LCOs are now used by farmers as plant growth promoters for legume and non-legume crops. Genetic analysis in plants allowed the identification of LCO receptors and proteins such as HMGR1 (3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase 1) that interact with LCO receptors and are required for the establishment of symbiotic associations.  This project will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms allowing legumes to recognize symbiotic LCOs and of the downstream pathways allowing LCO receptors and HMGR1 to mediate the development of root nodules with rhizobia and associations with symbiotic fungi.  In the short term, understanding these mechanisms can have a direct impact on yield improvement through a more efficient use of LCOs as plant growth promoters.  This knowledge will also help improve the establishment of plant-microbe associations, with especially high impact under suboptimal and stressful field conditions.  In the long term, engineering new symbiotic associations through these mechanisms may help improve the sustainability of our agriculture for food, feed and biofuel production."

This is particularly true for phosphate (P), because P is an essential plant nutrient that often limits plant productivity, and P rock that is used for the production of most P fertilizers is a nonrenewable resource and the current known reserves are likely to be depleted in 50 to 100 years. Conventional breeding programs often select cultivars based on vigor and performance of the above ground plant part under nutrient replete conditions, but the root system, its architecture and the association of the root system with beneficial plant microorganisms has generally been ignored. This has led to the development of cultivars that are not well suited for low input agriculture. Plant microbe interactions, such as the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis can contribute significantly to the nutrient efficiency of crop species and improve overall plant health and performance. Here, we propose to use a different and integrated approach to improve the nutrient efficiency of wheat, one of the most important crop species worldwide. The proposal is to study genotypic differences in P efficiency and mycorrhizal responsiveness to determine which cultivar is able to use its plant?]microbe interactions to their maximum potential.In this collaborative research effort, Dr. Heike Bucking at South Dakota State University and Dr. Samy A. M. Abd El-Azeem at Suez Canal University, Egypt, will identify candidate genes that control the acquisition and utilization efficiency of P and the mycorrhizal responsiveness of wheat in order to develop tools that can be used for marker assisted selection of these agronomically important traits. In addition, the effect of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria on wheat productivity and mycorrhizal colonization will be studied because the capability of these bacteria to mobilize P sources with low bioavailability could synergistically enhance the beneficial effects of AM fungi on P nutrition of the plant. Including the capability of plants to form AM interactions as an important trait into breeding programs takes into consideration that the AM symbiosis has numerous beneficial effects on the abiotic (e.g. nutrient, salinity, drought) and biotic (pathogen) stress resistance of their host plant and represents the natural stage of plants under field conditions. Results of the research will be translated into recommendations for farmers how by low cost measures and agronomic practices the crop productivity can be increased. Two graduate students will be trained by this project (one in the U.S. and one in Egypt), and the international collaborative character of this project will stimulate their development into independent scientists. Regular visits of the collaborating institutions will guarantee a cohesive planning of the experiments and of the output of the project, but will also allow training of the project partners and especially of the graduate students in new technologies. Results of the project will also be integrated into the research efforts of the recently established 2010 drought tolerance biotechnology center at South Dakota State University. Wheat has recently been made to one of the focus crop species of the center and the international collaboration will stimulate further collaborative efforts beyond this project.The award is being funded under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to undertake cooperative research, and by the Africa, Near East, South Asia (ANESA) division of the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE)."

Richard McCombie (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) Co PI: Doreen Ware (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)Key Collaborator: Robert A. Martienssen (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)Genomic sequence data holds the promise of dramatically advancing both the understanding of basic plant science, and of catalyzing practical advances in plant breeding.  While the  complete , contiguous,  base perfect  sequence of a genome is the most useful outcome of a genome project, it is not necessary for most applications.  Furthermore, base perfect sequence is prohibitive in terms of both time and cost for very large genomes or large numbers of moderately sized genomes. However, recent technological advances and soon-to-be broadly available technologies provide an attractive option for plant genomics.  This project seeks to use next generation sequence technologies to identify the vast majority of genes in three closely related progenitor genomes of wheat (AA, AABB, and DD genome containing species) and hexaploid wheat (Chinese spring).  Each genome will be sequenced to about 50x coverage with Illumina sequencers (paired end 100 base reads) and to about 8x-10x coverage using the Pacific Bio-Sciences sequencing technology.  In addition, the project will sequence each genome with long range  strobe  reads on the Pacific Biosciences instrument that will amount to about 2 terabases of raw sequence.  The sequences will be assembled and annotated for maximum use by the broader scientific community.  All raw data, assemblies, and annotations will be released to the public as soon as they are generated and quality checked and prior to any publication that might be pursued. The broader impact of this project is to solve the data availability problem by providing about 2 terabases of raw genome sequence data to the broader cereal research community as well as the assemblies and annotation of the vast majority of genes in a large number of cereal genomes.  It is expected that access to these data will radically accelerate functional genomics in wheat. All data generated in this project can be accessed through the project website, GenBank, and through the iPlant Collaborative (http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/).  In addition, project updates will be coordinated with the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) and made available at (http://www.wheatgenome.org/Projects) and at GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml)."

Gloer of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa. With his collaborators, Patrick F. Dowd and Donald T. Wicklow of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Professor Gloer is isolating new natural organic compounds from fungi. The project will continue this distinctive research program in fungal natural products chemistry. Primary focus will be placed on chemical studies of mycoparasitic/fungicolous fungi, and on fungal endophytes that occur in cereal crop plants. Mycoparasitic/fungicolous fungi attack and colonize other fungi in nature. Invasion by these colonists often involves antibiosis toward the host, and therefore, such colonists may be valuable, underexplored sources of natural antifungal agents. Results from prior NSF support provide strong evidence for the validity of this hypothesis. Efforts during the proposed grant period will focus on completion of the studies of a collection of nearly 800 diverse fungal colonists obtained from varied microclimates found on the island of Hawaii. A second direction follows from the discovery that isolates of widespread corn endophytes produce natural products of various types that show antagonistic activity against other, competing fungi encountered in corn plants, including important disease-causing and mycotoxin-producing species. Studies of the occurrence and significance of these metabolites will continue, and will be expanded to include fungi from other crop plants (rye, wheat, barley, sorghum), and a limited number of prairie grasses, in search of further metabolites that show similar biological effects and potential significance. In both projects, the search for new chemistry is guided by assays for activity against two important fungal species and/or an agriculturally important insect pest. An assay for Hsp90 activity will also be included based on a discovery in the most recent grant period that a common corn endophyte produces a potent inhibitor of Hsp90 function. Many new bioactive natural products have been discovered through these hypothesis-guided studies, and further success is expected because of the relatively unexplored nature of these fungal groups. Antifungal and antiinsectan agents are of potential practical value to society in agriculture and medicine, and can also be valuable as tools to assist in discovery of new modes of action. Findings from this project are also expected to contribute to fundamental scientific knowledge in other disciplines, including fungal ecology, taxonomy, biodiversity, crop/food science, and evolutionary biology."

Early stages of globalization were characterized by the international exchange of final products, whether port for wheat or automobiles for apparel, resulting in a spatial division of labor that was sorted by industry.  In contrast, the current round of globalization is separating production tasks once integrated within firms and industries, shifting them to locations around the world.  To understand the implications of this shift for the U.S. economy, greater understanding is needed about tasks that can be  offshored  and which are likely to remain place-bound.  The objective of this research project is to measure how trade has impacted the task structure of the U.S. economy.  While theoretical models of task trade have recently been developed, empirical exploration has been severely limited by lack of appropriate data.  The investigators will create a unique dataset suited to measuring the impact of task trade by linking detailed U.S. Census microdata that describe trade flows, firms, workers and the tasks in which they are engaged.  These data will enable the researchers to explore three primary questions:  (1) What is the impact of trade on the task structure of the U.S. economy?  (2) How is trade-induced job loss related to the analytic and interpersonal complexity of occupations? (3) How has the subnational geography of tasks shifted in the U.S. economy over the last fifteen years, and how are these shifts related to the regional impacts of trade and the characteristics of local production systems?In today's highly interconnected world, patterns of trade are closely linked to economic performance and the geography of work.  This project will improve scientific knowledge regarding the transformation of the global system of trade from one premised on exchanges of final goods to one focused on the exchange of a rapidly increasing array of intermediate goods and services.  The project will measure the impact of the changing nature of trade on the structure of work in the U.S. economy and the differential effect of that change across U.S. regions.  The results of this project will help to identify the nature of jobs that are robust to trade competition and those footloose activities that are likely to be increasingly located offshore.  The project also will contribute to ongoing debates in fields like education and labor economics regarding the preparation required for 21st century workers in advanced economies."

Oxalate oxidase catalyzes the carbon-carbon bond cleavage of oxalate to yield carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide.  Although there is currently no structural information available for oxalate oxidase from C. subvermispora (CsOxOx), sequence data and homology modeling indicate that it is the first manganese-containing bicupin enzyme identified that catalyzes this reaction.  The best characterized oxalate oxidases are from barley and wheat.  These enzymes, also known as germins, contain a single cupin domain and are therefore classified as monocupins.  Interestingly, CsOxOx shares greatest sequence homology with the bicupin microbial oxalate decarboxylases.  The short term goals of this research are to 1) to characterize the manganese-dependence of oxalate oxidase from C. subvermispora and 2) to identify the active site of the enzyme.  This research is expected to contribute to the understanding of how subtle structural changes effect remarkable functional variation in evolutionarily related proteins.  Characterizing the manganese-dependence of CsOxOx is significant in order to place this enzyme in the context of other oxalate degrading enzymes and that of other cupin proteins.  Identifying the active site of CsOxOx is an important problem.  If only one of the manganese centers mediates catalysis, critical questions are raised concerning the function (if any) of the second Mn-binding domain and the extent to which local protein structure in each domain results in differential reactivity.Broader ImpactsThis project is transforming Gainesville State College (a two-year unit of the University System of Georgia) from an institution that provides excellent coursework in the sciences into one that also provides students the opportunity to participate in meaningful and important laboratory research.  Undergraduate students carry out most of this work at Gainesville State College (GSC), but also have the opportunity to work with collaborators at the University of Florida and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL.  Student researchers are expected to communicate their research experiences to broad audiences through diverse media.  Student researchers also are expected to publish their results and report research findings at professional meetings and to the regional educational community.  Funds from this project are used to acquire, operate, and maintain research equipment that is not otherwise available at GSC."

In particular, the research will combine wheat fiber and lignin with cement concrete. Lignin acts as a water reducer controlling the water-cement ratio and improving strength and durability. Wheat fiber, on the other hand, acts as a micro-cracking barrier controlling the microstructure crack growth under early age and fatigue conditions. More sustainable concrete, which exhibits higher durability and higher resilience against cracking and fatigue, will be produced by using agricultural waste materials combined with bio-fuel co-products. The proportions of cellulose fibers and lignin, which optimize the performance of the sustainable concrete under short term loading will be determined. The research is driven by the ultimate goal to benefit the society. Specifically, the use of inexpensive, renewable and environmentally friendly bio-based materials for improved performance, durability and economy of the transportation infrastructure. One M.S. student along with the PI and Co-PIs will be directly involved in the research. The results of the proposed research will be integrated into education through inclusion of various research findings in undergraduate courses. The proposed research will take place in the state of Kansas, an EPSCoR state, thus broadening the participation of geographically underrepresented regions in scientific research and education."

Gupta (Meerut University, India), and Madhu Meeta Jindal (Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India)Genes influencing plant height have revolutionized agriculture by doubling the wheat and rice production. Under conditions of environmental stress, the most predominantly used wheat semi-dwarf mutants rht1 and rht2 exhibit adverse effects on agronomic traits including coleoptile and first leaf length, root length and biomass, as well as drought tolerance. These adverse effects limit wheat yields under abiotic stress conditions that regularly affect more than 85% of the US and about 50% of the world wheat production area. The main goal of the project is to identify and characterize an alternative dwarfing gene system for wheat and other cereals in order to alleviate adverse effects of the currently used dwarfing genes.  Currently used dwarfing gene systems in wheat reduce plant height by interrupting production or signaling of plant growth hormone gibberellins that are particularly important for plants to deal with stressful conditions.  Previous studies have shown that mutations in the maize brachytic2 (br2) and the sorghum dwarf3 (dw3) genes that encode P-glycoproteins (PGPs) involved in polar transport of auxin, result in a reduction in plant height without any of the adverse phenotypic effects usually associated with the currently used wheat dwarfing mutants.  Based on these observations, this project will test whether the wheat ortholog (TaBr2) of the maize Br2 gene can be used as an alternative dwarfing gene system in wheat.  Specific objectives are to clone TaBr2 and to study its expression and function in wheat using various reverse genetics tools including virus-induced gene silencing and RNAi.  In addition, mutations in TaBr2 will be isolated using phenotypic as well as by TILLING screens in order to identify the ideal dwarfing mutant.  The benefit of the project, especially to farmers with small land holdings, will come from the introgression of value-added genes, including stripe rust resistance genes as well as newly-developed dwarfing gene mutants, into popular varieties of India, Pakistan, and the US.  In addition, the project will provide new insight into the process of auxin signaling and transport in crop plants.  The project will provide highly interdisciplinary and international research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as for research associates/visiting scientists.   The PIs are actively involved in outreach activities including farmers' Field Days, talking to grower groups and organizing lab demonstrations and displays to grower groups and the public at large. The project information and findings will be communicated with the public via these efforts as well as through electronic means.   A project website will be developed that will serve as a  one-stop  location for access to all resources generated in this project.  Links will be provided to this project webpage from each of the investigator's web pages as well.   Expression and sequence data will be immediately submitted to GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), according to the currently accepted community standard (e.g. Bermuda/Ft. Lauderdale agreement). Real-time expression data of selected genes on various wheat lines will be made freely available first via publications and then by hosting on the project webpage and on Gramene (http://www.gramene.org/). Mapping data will be available at GrainGenes database (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml).  All VIGS and RNAi constructs and germplasm generated in this project will be maintained in the PIs' lab and will be available to the public.  Gene introgression lines developed in India and Pakistan will be released as public varieties after going through variety testing programs of the respective countries.

Small-holder farmers in Africa and South America are responsible for more than 95% of cacao production, providing economic benefits to millions of cacao farmers and their dependents, as well as important ecological benefits such as rain-forest preservation. Fungal and oomycete diseases have devastated cacao production in South America and West Africa, dislocating populations of farmers and resulting in destruction of the rain-forest sheltering the cacao trees in favor of large-scale open farmland. This project will test two novel approaches to protecting developing country crops against a broad-spectrum of oomycete and fungal pathogens, using cacao as the initial target. The first involves targeting anti-microbial proteins to pathogen feeding structures called haustoria, using RPW8, an Arabidopsis protein that has a natural affinity for these feeding sites. The second approach involves blocking the entry of virulence proteins (effector proteins) that pathogens secrete into host cells to suppress the plant host's immune system. The most effective strategies will be identified first using fast growing Arabidopsis and tomato plants before being tested in cacao.Broader Impacts: The novel technologies that will be tested in this project are potentially applicable to an extremely broad array of crop diseases important to the developing world. The most destructive diseases of broad acreage staples such as rice and wheat are potentially amenable to this approach, as are many of the most limiting fungal and oomycete diseases of crops of importance to smallholders, such as yams, cassava, groundnuts, pearl millet, finger millet, sorghum, maize, potato, bean and cowpea. The project includes visits from scientists from developing countries, a colloquium in Ecuador, and regular communication with scientists from cacao-producing countries.  Project outcomes as well as access to biological resources that include DNA constructs and germplasm will be disseminated through a project website (accessible via https://www.vbi.vt.edu/faculty/research_groups/brett_tyler) and through publications."

It is estimated that approximately 50% of the world's wheat is grown in developing countries, where it serves as a staple food for a large proportion of subsistence farmers. Rusts are fungal pathogens that cause some of the most damaging diseases of wheat. Leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina), stem rust (caused by P. graminis f. sp. tritici) and stripe rust (caused by P. striiformis f. sp. tritici) are the most widely distributed diseases of wheat. These diseases reduce plant fitness and result in grain yield losses from 5-95%, depending on the rust species and the development stage at which it infects the crop.  Historically, breeding durable resistance to rust diseases relies largely on continually introgressing new resistance genes into adapted varieties, often from wild relatives. This long genetic process is not always completely successful in eliminating unfavorable characteristics brought in by linkage drag. Furthermore, there is genetic evidence that the functions of introgressed resistance genes are often suppressed in the hexaploid wheat genetic background.  However, little is known about the nature of these  suppressors  or the mechanism by which they act.  This project will investigate two suppressors of rust resistance in wheat that preliminary studies have shown, when inactivated, unmask robust resistance to the newly emerged virulent stem rust strain, Ug99, which currently threatens food security in Africa and the Middle East.  The project will deploy a multi-national team to 1) characterize these two suppressors and their mechanism of action(s); 2) transfer this new resistance to wheat breeding programs in both Kenya and China; and, 3) screen project germplasm for resistance against other emerging rust disease threats across this broad region.The work has the potential to unlock an extensive array of cryptic rust resistance genes in the hexaploid wheat genome that are either currently unrecognized or have been poorly utilized. Suppressors of rust resistance have not been characterized in any experimental system, so project results will provide fundamental new information about the nature and mode of action of a previously-unstudied class of negative regulators of plant defense responses.  This research will have direct benefits for agriculture in the developing world by providing new, useful sources of rust resistance, with associated molecular markers. With respect to training and outreach, the project will provide an exchange program to introduce young researchers from Kenya and China to cutting-edge technologies, and to create opportunities for young researchers from the USA and Australia to learn from local knowledge in Kenya and China. The exchange program will train four young scientists who will work in the two labs in Kenya and China to deliver cultivars and to educate smallholder farmers of their nations. In addition, the project will generate three video protocols available on-line to reach a broader audience, including students, biology teachers, and wheat breeders in both developed and developing countries.  All data and biological resources generated by the project will be available to the public.  Gene expression data will be submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).  Mapping and marker data will be submitted to GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml) and germplasm and breeding line information will be available through the website for the USDA-National Institute of Food and Agriculture supported Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat (DRRW) project (http://maswheat.ucdavis.edu/).  Wheat lines used and/or developed by this project will be available through the USDA-ARS National Small Grain Collection (NSGC)."

More information is available about more subjects in ways that are more accessible than ever before. Searches on PubMed or Web of Science routinely return thousands of hits. The easy accessibility of gigantic numbers of publications creates substantial problems for researchers and granting agencies alike: scientists cannot possibly read everything published in their own fields, and policymakers have few clearbases upon which to form judgments of quality. How can reasonable decisions be made about which fields are likely to blossom into transformative research, if the problem of separating wheat from chaff grows exponentially with each passing year? Given the ever-increasing outpouring, it is more important than ever to develop some quantitative means of describing -- and, in turn, predicting -- the growth and development of scientific research. What factors might explain the changes over time of numbers of publications on a given topic, or numbers of researchers working in a given field? What interactions between researchers might account for a scientific community's growth and change? And how might various interventions -- policy initiatives, market forces, or other factors -- alter the dynamics of how scientific fields emerge and develop?Intellectual Merit:  The research develops new measures to model and predict processes of scientific research and innovation. The measures are based on mathematical models that capture various aspects of the research enterprise. These tools are sharpened with application to a suite of examples from the physical and biomedical sciences. These examples permit the investigation of different modes of supporting and steering the course of scientific research in six key areas: the growth and development of research publications on string theory, molecular electronics, and nanotechnology from the physical sciences; and research publications on H1N1 influenza, coronary angioplasty, and interventional cardiology from the biomedical sciences. These cases traverse a wide range of scales, from research topics within well-defined subfields to large, discipline-spanning endeavors.Broader Impact: The dissemination of the results includes scientific publications, workshops with expert researchers, an informal bi-weekly seminar series for scholars across a wide range of disciplines - from history and sociology of science, to business and economics, to library science and computer science.

A subset of plants utilize a more efficient photosynthetic process termed C4 photosynthesis (i.e., C4 plants). In open sunny environments the rate of CO2 fixation, biomass accumulation, and grain yield in C4 plants is nearly twice that of C3 plants. The increased photosynthetic performance of C4 versus C3 plants is due in part to the evolution of an additional set of photosynthetic CO2 fixation enzymes referred to as the C4 pathway. Despite the inherently higher productivity of C4 versus C3 plants, there are only four agronomically important C4 crop species: maize, Sorghum, sugar cane, and switch grass. All other crop species (e.g., rice, soybean, wheat) are C3 plants. Thus an ongoing research goal of plant scientists is to breed or engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop plants for improving yields. Efforts to date have fallen short in part because of the lack of understanding on how the C4 pathway is controlled in leaves for optimizing use of available sunlight. The ultimate aim of this project is to elucidate how such regulation works. A first step in this endeavor, and the goal of this one-year project, is to develop maize plants that are deficient in two interrelated light-responsive C4 pathway enzymes, pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) and the PPDK regulatory protein (RP). It is hypothesized that these enzymes control the rate of the CO2 fixation by the C4 pathway in response to sunlight. Using RNA interference, a genetic engineering method, stable lines of maize plants will be isolated with reduced levels of PPDK or RP enzyme. These plants will be subsequently assessed for photosynthetic performance. From these analyses, an accurate picture of how PPDK and RP confer sunlight-responsive C4 pathway regulation is expected to emerge. This knowledge will be critical for projects now underway that seek to introduce a functional C4 pathway into leaves of C3 crop species.  A major education and training component of the project is the participation of undergraduate Biochemistry/Biotechnology degree students in fulfillment of their senior thesis research requirement."

EE is thought to be mediated by both immunoglobulin (IgE) and non-IgE-mediated food allergy.  The majority of patients with EE (50%-80%) are atopic based on the co-existence of EE with atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and/or asthma.  In addition, approximately two-thirds of EE patients have food allergen-specific IgE based on immediate hypersensitivity skin tests or measurement of allergen specific IgE in blood.  Approximately 75% of EE subjects had increased total IgE levels.  Approximately two-thirds of children with EE have positive immediate hypersensitivity skin tests to at least one food allergen.  The mean number of positive food immediate hypersensitivity skin tests ranges from 3-6 positive tests per subject with EE.  The most common foods reported to be positive in EE by skin immediate hypersensitivity skin test included common food allergens (i.e., peanut, egg, milk, soy, wheat) as well as beans, rye, and beef.  Dietary therapy is considered an effective therapy in children diagnosed with EE.Objective/Hypothesis:  Although studies of the genetics of EE are in their infancy, the importance of genes to the development of EE has been demonstrated in studies showing an important association of EE with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the eotaxin-3 gene, a chemokine gene important to eosinophil chemotaxis into tissues such as the esophagus.  In this proposal, we hypothesize that in EE there is a gene polymorphism (transforming growth factor beta 1, or TGF-b1) environment (IgE food sensitization) interaction that contributes to increased IgE-mediated TGF-b expression in the esophagus and increased esophageal remodeling in a subset of EE subjects.  As esophageal stricture formation is an important complication of remodeling in EE (6%-12% of children; 33% of adults), resulting in food impactions and emergency room visits, identifying genetic polymorphisms in TGF-b in EE may allow the early identification of food sensitized children at risk for the development of this significant complication of EE.Specific Aims:  The focus of the genetic studies in EE we have proposed has two specific aims, namely:  (1) Do food-sensitized EE subjects with the TGF-b TT genotype have increased levels of esophageal expression of TGF-b and pSmad?  (2) Do food-sensitized EE subjects with the TGF-b TT genotype have increased levels of remodeling?Study Design:  We will characterize SNPs in a candidate gene of esophageal remodeling (TGFb) in patients with EE and food sensitization patients with EE and no food sensitization (n=381) matched for age, gender, and ethnic background.  Levels of esophageal remodeling and expression of TGF-b and pSMAD will be quantitated in esophageal biopsies.Impact:  This study focuses on increasing our understanding of a gene (TGF-b) environment (food IgE sensitization) associated with remodeling and stricture formation in the esophagus in EE.  If this gene environment interaction contributes to esophageal remodeling and esophageal stricture formation, their identification may lead to biomarkers to detect patients at risk of this complication, as well as potential novel therapies."

A public health emphasis on prevention, early identification, and multidisciplinary treatment has been associated with a decreased prevalence and improved outcomes in individuals with SB in the US.  Despite the decline in SB births since the implementation of folic acid fortification of cereals and wheat grains in the US, there are still substantial numbers of SB births that occur each year. Although much is known about the management of SB and the multiple co-morbid conditions and complications that occur in affected individuals, there are few systematic, longitudinal studies on population-based cohorts of children or adults. In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the Spina Bifida Association of America hosted a multidisciplinary meeting to review the available research on conditions impacting the lives of individuals with SB and to develop a national research agenda. The purpose of this agenda was to identify research priorities in 16 of the most important co-occurring conditions in SB and advance research efforts to improve the quality of life of those affected, as well as to guide policy makers, educators, clinicians, and caregivers in the development of practice parameters, public policy, and public health activities that address the needs of this population. The hypothesis guiding this research is that population-based surveillance and integrated research programs are effective in determining the prevalence of disorders and establishing data on health outcomes and the types of care for these disorders. Such population-based surveillance for individual disorders is an important first step to understanding the full range of clinical outcomes for affected people. The availability of longitudinal data on these cohorts provides an opportunity to document and assess the natural history of the condition and the effects of various diagnosis and treatment strategies.  The project proposes that Arizona contribute population-based data on 3-5 year old children with SB to achieve the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Generate a population-based dataset that can describe the natural history of SB, co-morbid conditions, and related complications as baseline data in a longitudinal cohort;  Specific Aim 2: Describe the medical and social services received by individuals with SB and their families, including knowledge of prevention, and whether these vary by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. These specific aims will be achieved through completion of the following research objectives: 1. In collaboration with CDC, refine and finalize the protocol for population-based surveillance and long-term follow up of individuals with SB, building on the results of a CDC-funded pilot project currently underway.2. Identify a sample of children affected by SB using state based Birth Defects Surveillance Systems.3. Recruit children and their families for participation in the study.4. Gather data and information using a combination of methods, including interviews, survey, records abstraction, and neuropsychological testing.5. Assess the effectiveness of data collection methods.6. Assess the outcomes of the project."

This approach has been successful for many years and has resulted in the bountiful wheat, oat and barley harvests that feed the world. Traditional breeding, however, is slow and has largely proceeded with little understanding of the actual genes, genetic pathways, and cellular processes that are targeted by artificial selection. Developing new strategies for crop improvement, that employ either traditional crosses or transgenic approaches, will require us to determine the molecular genetic causes of important trait differences. My research strives to understand the genetic basis of drought and heat stress response in grass crops, in particular by asking how common genes affect, for example, both flowering time and drought stress response. In some cases, common genes control different traits, and breeding strategies that seek to optimize one trait (for example, productivity in a dry climate) inadvertently negatively affect a second trait (for example, productivity in a hot environment). My work aims to identify the genetic basis of these correlations, and to develop breeding strategies that allow us to optimize combinations of desirable agricultural traits, particularly in wheat."

This project will develop an integrated material handling/biomass conversion approach for the production of biofuels that is structured to fit within the existing agricultural paradigm. The proposed integrated process can be distributed regionally with only minor modifications to equipment and facilities. Biomass feedstocks investigated include switchgrass, miscanthus, corn stover, and wheat straw. This project will develop a baling system with bales of density suitable for on-farm biomass conversion. The baling system will be a single-pass system for agricultural crop residues and energy crops. Best management practices that maximize biomass production, while minimizing environmental impacts will be developed for biomass energy crops, as well as for vegetative buffers in conventional cropland and as new crops on marginal/abandoned land. The proposed biomass conversion process steps, the pretreatment of the biomass, are scaled to the farm, employing a modified bunker silo as the reactor and taking advantage of the high density feedstock bales to increase production efficiency. After pretreatment, solid substrate cultivation with mobile phase replacement will be performed using a co-culture of a cellulolytic organism and a solventogenic organism. Temperature control within the reactor will be maintained using recycled water heated by gasification of the residual feedstock. The products will be concentrated and separated from the recycled aqueous stream using either modular, stand-alone membrane or adsorption technologies. Thus, the volume of the value-added product shipped to a biorefinery for further upgrading is greatly reduced. Life cycle analysis models will be integrated with geographic information systems (GIS), economic, and environmental models to evaluate a range of management strategies, feedstocks, regional impact, land suitability, and potential fossil fuel displacement. Biomass processing models will be developed to evaluate alternative off-farm processing options and their potential impact on bioenergy production. Economic and environmental analyses will be used to determine the level of incentives required to increase bioenergy production and protect the environment when these goals conflict with maximum farm profitability. We expect the system to allow farmers or cooperatives to produce biofuels and biochemicals s cost competitively with petroleum. These products will be concentrated on-farm so that the product stream will be economical to transport to a refinery to be further upgraded, largely eliminating the high cost of transporting raw biomass. In addition, the biomass will be supplied in a sustainable manner that will not increase soil erosion or net greenhouse gas emissions, yet will still maintain farm profitability."

The objective is to understand the factors leading to the enrichment of natural PCA-producing populations and their role in a large dryland agroecosystem. We hypothesize that rhizosphere community structure and PCA production and activity are strongly influenced by soil moisture. Knowledge of the impact of soil moisture is needed in order to understand the role of PCA and PCA-producing populations in the rhizosphere of field-grown crops. Our specific aims are to determine the impact of water availability on rhizosphere microbial community structure and function; to generate a draft genomic sequence of the reference strain P. fluorescens 2-79; to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the survival of PCA-producing strains under arid conditions; and to determine the role of PCA in the uptake of metal nutrients by wheat. Relationships among microbial community composition and function, water potential, and PCA biosynthesis and activity will be evaluated in field and greenhouse studies using pyrosequencing , reporter strains, metal radioisotopes, and HPLC-mass spectrometry. The proposed studies will lead to sustainable and ecologically friendly ways to exploit indigenous microbial communities to improve the productivity of crops grown in dryland agroecosystems."

Multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional research is proposed to advance this goal. We hypothesize that plant parasitic insects (aphids, white flies, scale insects, and gall midges) are able to parasitize their plant hosts by evading the plant immune system. We have evidence that small ?effector proteins,? secreted by the insects and then transported into plant cells, are responsible for this ability. These effectors make the insects more virulent to the plant and the plants more susceptible to insect attack. Additional evidence indicates that plants carry resistance genes in order to defend themselves from an effector-based insect attack. The resistance genes apparently encode resistance proteins that interact with effectors in a one-to-one manner, and this interaction appears to trigger a resistance response in the plant that kills or severely harms the insect. This resistance requires no pesticide, and is not dependent on the transformation of the plant with foreign DNA. However, it is susceptible to the evolution of modified effector proteins, and this explains why resistance gene based plant protection lasts only a few years. To test our hypothesis, this investigation will meet the following objectives: First, it will identify an effector-encoding gene (AvrHdic) in the gall midge pest species, the Hessian fly, which appears to trigger resistance when it interacts with the protein encoded by the wheat resistance gene Hdic. Second, it will identify a wheat resistance protein (H13) that we suspect triggers resistance when it interacts with the previously identified Hessian fly effector vH13. And third, it will use knowledge of plant pathogen effector structure and Hessian fly biology to identify additional effector-encoding genes in the Hessian fly genome. These goals will permit us to examine the interaction between insect effectors and plant resistance genes for the first time. We anticipate that this knowledge will permit an understanding of how insect effectors modulate plant immunity and development, and enable the development of plant genotypes that are capable of resisting plant parasites with a resistance that can prevent the evolution of more virulent insects."

Among soil microbes, two notable taxa include the fungal genus Fusarium and the bacterial genus Streptomyces. These two genera are intriguing for their potential to act both as plant pathogens, as saprophytes, and as plant beneficials in their capacities to antagonize other plant pathogens. We have little understanding of the potential for plants to selectively alter the abundance of beneficial vs. detrimental members of these genera within the rhizosphere. In addition to the particular plant host, plant community diversity may also have a influence on the selective effects of plant hosts on their soil microbial community. In particular, while high plant diversity is broadly conceived to be beneficial to plant community productivity, and low diversity to enhance the buildup of host-specific plant pathogens, low diversity may also enhance selection for plant beneficials, including pathogen antagonists. This work will explore the effects of plant community diversity on these two target microbial genera, including their diversity and the relative abundance of beneficial and detrimental populations in the rhizosphere of wheat. In addition, this work will characterize relationships between Fusarium and Streptomyces populations co-existing within individual rhizospheres, shedding light on the significance of plant vs. microbial selection in determining rhizosphere community composition and function.

The three phytochrome genes present in grasses (PHYA, PHYB and PHYC) play a central role in the detection of light signals and in monitoring seasonal differences in day-length. We have recently obtained mutants of the wheat PHYC gene using a technique called TILLING and observed significant delays in flowering time under long days. We also observed that the PHYC mutations affected the regulation of other important wheat flowering genes. Our overall goal is to dissect the light signaling network involved in the photoperiodic regulation of flowering in wheat and barley. To achieve this we will generate mutants for the phyA and phyB genes using our wheat TILLING populations and combine them with the available phyC mutants into double and triple mutants. We will also characterize the natural variation of wheat and barley PHYC genes. We will then test the effect of the natural and induced phytochrome mutations on flowering time and on the regulation of other flowering genes, including those involved in vernalization, circadian rhythms, and gibberellic acid biosynthesis and degradation. The analysis of the phytochrome mutants will be complemented with the identification of the proteins that interact with the different phytochromes. Finally, we will duplicate the size of our tetraploid wheat TILLING population to increase the chances of detecting useful mutations in all the wheat genes. We will use this expanded TILLING population to generate a public collection of flowering gene mutants in a common tetraploid wheat background. This proposal will generate basic knowledge about PHYC, which is the least explored of the phytochromes. The PHYC protein interactors responsible for the transduction of the light signals to the photoperiod pathway remain largely unknown. In addition to filling this gap in our basic knowledge, a better understanding of the gene network that integrates light signals is required to precisely manipulate flowering time and optimize wheat and barley adaptation to changing environments. This study will provide barley and wheat breeders well characterized PhyC alleles to design better crosses, to predict the effect of the different alleles in flowering initiation and stem elongation, and to engineer varieties with specific flowering characteristics. A better understanding of the effect of photoperiod on spike development is also important because the number of spikelets per spike is established during this developmental stage. The number of spikelets per spike determines the maximum number of grains per spike, which is an important yield component in wheat. Finally, the expansion of the publicly available tetraploid wheat TILLING population and the generation of a public collection of flowering mutants will be tangible and valuable outcomes of this project."

Preliminary data obtained in our lab provide promising indication of the potential for this approach in peanut. This proposal seeks to (1) demonstrate the effectiveness of post-harvest processing of peanut and wheat with endopeptidases and physicochemical treatment in reducing the concentrations of target allergens, (2) confirm the reduction of allergic potential of treated products in patients through clinical testing, and (3) evaluate the sensory acceptability and quality of treated peanut and wheat products. The most effective processing conditions (as judged by immunoassays) will be used to produce samples for confirmation of reduced allergenicity using basophil activation assays in leukocytes from allergic patients. Processing conditions that lead to minimum histamine release in-vitro will be used to process products for skin prick testing among allergic patients to confirm safety. Subsequently, sensory acceptability and quality of hypoallergenic products will be assessed and used as indicator of their commercial potential."

These plant breeders will need to have the skills to run a field-based classical plant breeding program as well as the knowledge to utilize the new molecular techniques available to increase the efficiency of cultivar development. This project proposes to train such individuals by providing experiential-learning in the field in all aspects of a wheat breeding program and in the laboratory in the use of molecular markers and genetic transformation for wheat improvement. Through this project Master's level plant breeders will be produced with the training and knowledge to have an immediate impact in a private or public plant breeding program insuring the continued development of new cultivars to feed the people of the United States and the world in the future.

We propose to evaluate the relative impact of these systems on soil quality, C sequestration, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Rising costs of fuel, fertilizer, and related inputs, along with declining and unreliable sources of irrigation water, threaten the economic viability of agriculture in this semiarid region. In response to pressures that squeeze profit margins, producers are seeking alternatives that decrease costs, increase yields, or increase value while conserving water. Organic production that incorporates reduced-tillage and crop-forage components may achieve these goals, while at the same time providing important environmental services of sequestering carbon (C) and offsetting GHG emissions. It is known that similar services provide alternative income streams via C markets or incentive payments in other parts of the US, but the magnitude of these services relative to conventional practices is not well documented for the Northern High Plains region. Our approach utilizes established frameworks of on-station research trials in transition from conventional to reduced tillage and organic practices, and on-farm organic and reduced-tillage systems in long-term use by area producers. This three-year project integrates four research components in both transitional (on-station) and long-term (on-farm) settings under irrigated and dryland production. Research components include measurement and modeling of: 1) soil C processes, including sequestration and GHG emissions to quantify performance of organic production relative to conventional and reduced tillage systems; 2) water use efficiency to determine short- to long-term feasibility of both irrigated and non-irrigated production in this moisture-deficient environment; 3) field- and farm scale economics to determine the need, timeframe, and level of possible incentives for transition to sequester C in organic production; and 4) energy input:output and C footprint impacts to determine true environmental impacts or services resulting from the practices. On-station research (transitional impacts) will take place within the framework of a long term study comparing the three approaches established at the University of Wyoming James C. Hageman Sustainable Agriculture Research and Extension Center (SAREC) in 2009. On-farm research (long term impacts) will take place on the farms of producers in Wyoming and Nebraska who are actively collaborating in studies of conventional, reduced-input, and organic approaches to irrigated crop and forage production and dryland winter wheat production. The proposed project builds upon the on-going on-station research and established relationships with farmers. It will benefit from research data currently being collected that are critical to complement the proposed set of measurements to validate biochemical and economic models we are proposing and will strengthen the quality of data inventories we are to build."

The large travel distances increase both cost and time required and the relatively few extension specialists at MSU in the IPM area are primary constraints to IPM implementation. Therefore this proposal addresses this need with Extension IPM Associates and funding for travel and program support. Primary Coordination Program Emphasis will include: IPM Implementation for Agronomic Crops: wheat, barley forage crops (alfalfa), oilseeds (safflower, canola and camelina) and seed legumes ( dry peas, lentils and chickpeas);; IPM Implementation for Specialty crops (seed potatoes, sugarbeets, and dry beans); and IPM Training for Consumer and Urban Environments (consumers, home landscape businesses, public facilities (parks, city forestry) and Master Gardner training). Secondary coordination program emphasis includes: IPM Support for Pest Diagnostic Facilities; IPM education for Pesticide Applicators: IPM Training and Implementation in Schools; and IPM Partnerships in Wide-Area Pest Monitoring and Reporting Systems (weather-based pest prediction, cutworm prediction, NPDN) These programs are built on the expertise of the MT IPM team and state needs in terms of pest problems, technical assistance and IPM education with overall goals driven by the National Road Map for IPM. New emphasis will include: IPM Training and Implementation in Schools, IPM, building a web-based weather-based IPM information system linked to regional assets for Montana and continued expansion of the web-based High Plains IPM Guide cooperatively with IPM specialists in Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Outcomes will be better educated growers, landscape and turf businesses and public building mainatinance personnel.

These markets and the market need for small maneuverable harvesters for research plots and breeder blocks have created a need for an inexpensive, but efficient, camelina harvester. The Seedster has the potential for meeting the demand for a camelina harvester that is inexpensive, variable width, maneuverable, has quick seed unloading and rapid cleanout. In Phase I Native Seedsters, Inc. (NSI) tested the basic Seedster technology which consists of counter-rotating brush and combing drum. The space in-between the brush and comb creates a 'pinch-point' where seed is plucked from the plant inflorescence. The first harvest of camelina with a Seedster resulted in a product that was 50% (by weight) seed, 40% seed capsule halves and 10% stems. In commercial camelina seed production the receiving elevators allows only 4.5% tare. To improve upon the purity of Seedster harvested seed a screening device was designed and tested. This device consisted of semi-cylindrical 9/64  round-hole screen which housed a 9  auger. During the second year of the Phase I project the seed purity was improved from 50% to 97% with the addition of the screening device. Although Phase I met or exceeded 4 of the 5 Performance Goals, the seed recovery efficiency was still not high enough to be competitive. In Phase I, the 40  Test-Bed Seedster capture only 59% of the total seed from stands yielding 1,100 lbs/acre and 70% of the seed in stands yielding 550 lbs/acre. The seed loss was attributed to a) seed shatter upon initial contact with the main brush, b) seed carry over on the combing drum and c) seed that 'stalled out' in the dislodgement chamber and fell back out the pinch-point because of insufficient airflow to carry the seed all the way to the seed hopper. In the Phase I Test-Bed the majority of the airflow for transporting the dislodged seed to the seed hopper was created by the main brush, with supplemental air and direction created by the air assist brush. In Phase I this airflow was insufficient to transport all of the heavy, rounded camelina seed to the seed hopper. In Phase II, a 60  Test-Bed Seedster will be assembled that is capable of configuration and reconfigurations to address these seed losses. The air-assist brush will be replaced with a tangential flow fan, positioned behind the combing drum to direct and propel all dislodged seed from the dislodgement chamber into the collection hopper, eliminating carry-over on the combing drum. The combing drum will be adjusted forward, thus making the distance between the pinch-point and the point of initial contact closer, reducing initial shatter. Various brush bristle densities and various combing drum surfaces (greater static friction) will be tested for maximizing seed dislodgement. An 8/64  round-hole screen will be tested in the screening device to try to improve seed purity to 99%. If the Phase II Performance Goals are met the Seedster will be a viable camelina seed harvest alternative for many farmers and researchers."

We will identify new sources of RWA resistance in exotic wheat germplasm and incorporate it into cultivars adapted to Colorado conditions. To develop longer term strategies to control RWA, we will determine the mechanisms of RWA toxicity against wheat and identify wheat genes involved in the defense response against RWA. We will help improve the breadmaking quality of Colorado wheat by incorporating high-throughput near infrared spectroscopy evaluations, and by identifying molecular markers for quality traits. Efforts to improve drought stress tolerance will be advanced by evaluating germplasm for tolerance under field and greenhouse conditions and identifying molecular markers linked to stress tolerance traits.

The inland PNW is unlike any other agricultural area in the U.S. Seventy-five percent of the annual precipitation falls during the winter in this semi-arid climate where fallow systems dominate. Deep, loess-derived soils store this moisture and allow the region to produce some of the highest dryland winter wheat yields in the U.S. However, the silt-based soils are subject to water and wind erosion during the fallow phase of the cropping cycle, particularly under conventional tillage, which leaves the soil surface bare. STEEP IV research will contribute solutions to societal problems faced by Washington, Idaho and Oregon and the nation's farmers and the public, such as energy and food security, sequestration of greenhouse gasses, and international trade balance. Within the next 3 years, it has projected that at least ~300,000 acres will come back into agricultural production, and up to 1,000,000 acres over the next 5 years. Previous STEEP research has suggested that aggressive tillage practices applied during the transition will quickly deteriorate soil quality and respire soil C reserves. Research is needed to define sustainable transitional practices and management systems, including residue, weed, fertility, and pest management. A range of soil, climatic and social factors will dictate the transitional systems, which might include annual crop production of food, feed or fiber, perennial pasturing or hay production with conservation soil management. Soil organic matter (and associated SOC), has long been identified as the key indicator of agricultural impacts on soil quality and the sustainability of the soil resource base. Studies show that SOC is regulated by biological drivers such as crop rotation and soil decomposition processes and by physical drivers such as tillage and soil erosion all of which are strongly influenced by precipitation and temperature gradients. Interest in SOC has intensified as soil C sequestration has been proposed as a major agriculturally-based strategy for mitigating climate change and well-validated databases are required if growers are to fully participate in C credit trading markets. Also, increased knowledge of C storage rates will enable greater understanding of how changes in SOC influence other soil properties. Finally, national interest in developing Long-Term Agricultural Projects (LTAP), where a network of research and on-farm locations with a strong SOC focus would be established, has sparked a successful USDA funded Proof of Concept proposal by scientists of the three Land Grant institutions (ID, OR, WA) and the USDA-ARS. The SOC research in this STEEP proposal will complement and augment efforts outlined in the LTAP Proof of Concept proposal. We intend to collate existing datasets, apply a common metadata base standard to all data and begin establishing a regionally comprehensive database for the Palouse for the first time as a foundation to mapping and monitoring key long-term soil carbon patterns and dynamics in ID and WA."

They not only presented threats to public health, but also diminished consumer confidence in U.S. food production systems and caused significant economic loss to the involved food companies due to recalls. President Obama's recently formed Food Safety Working Group (FSWG) and two 2009 federal legislation bills on food safety and protection (S. 510 and H.R. 2749) are clear indications of the U.S. government's determination to improve food safety and protect public health. Among those efforts, improving food traceability systems is identified as one of the most critical tasks, since current systems are often inadequate to respond to these outbreaks and are sometimes inaccurate in identifying contamination sources. Current government regulations and guidelines for traceability systems primarily focus on food safety and recalls. Many small and mid-size growers and food processors consider implementation of traceability systems as another burden to their business and have less incentive to actively implement new traceability systems, especially in the specialty crops industries. Unlike commodity crops such as wheat and corn, specialty crops are often unique in their production systems. The specialty crop growers are usually relatively small in scale, tend to be labor-intensive and have less automated production systems. They are more isolated and dispersed over large areas compared to commodity crops. Their production systems vary greatly due to the wide variation in specialty crops, from fruits to vegetables, herbs to hops, and berries to nursery crops. These differences increase the vulnerability of specialty crops and also present greater challenges for effective tracking and tracing The long term goal of this research proposal is to develop and collect the necessary information for future implementation of effective automated traceability systems to improve food safety (recalls), quality and productivity of U.S. specialty crop industries. An automated full-chain traceability system will not only reduce the amount of labor and time in data collection but also improve the accuracy of the data with time stamps and product locations. As a result, it will make the supply chain more visible and create more efficient management systems for inventory, shipping and receiving. A key point of this project is that it will investigate the economic and technical feasibility of how emerging technologies can be applied to improve the effectiveness of automated traceability systems in terms of food quality, productivity and energy efficiencies in addition to food recalls. By doing so, it will provide incentives for the specialty crop industries to implement full-chain traceability systems."

The work outlined in this grant is directed toward a novel solution to this long-standing global problem: the development of perennial wheat varieties that will dramatically curtail wind and water erosion due to constant ground cover by plants and-or plant residue. Integration of perennial wheat into diverse cropping systems will also provide other benefits over current models and help address other agricultural issues including improved wildlife habitat, disruption of prevalent disease cycles, increased water use efficiency, and establishment of a potent carbon sink. Such a system also has potential for integrating straw retrieval and marketing into small grains cropping systems in a more sustainable way than is possible with current practices. Our approach is to develop perennial varieties of wheat using hybrids between wheat and a perennial relative, Thinopyrum. These hybrid lines are tested in model systems in the low rainfall areas of the Pacific Northwest, where the problems of soil erosion and degradation are particularly severe."

The collaborative is focused on the commercialization of biomaterial products through the partnership between KBA, industry (MGP) and research institutions (K State and Pittsburg State universities) to create new products from Lignin in the bio-plastic industry. These new products and new product applications will be commercialized through direct licensing to existing companies and to new small business start-ups that will be formed to take advantage of market opportunities associated with these products. Under the leadership and direction of the KBA this research and commercialization collaborative will support new applied research at two university partners focused on developing materials used in the manufacturing of bio-plastic products from Lignin. Pilot testing and market research will be done by a Kansas-based small business, MGP Ingredients, Inc. KBA will manage the collaborative and provide technical assistance and guidance to existing businesses that want to utilize bio-plastics in existing or new products. The collaborative is a partnership where KBA manages and leads and the collaborative partners are participating as both funding receipts and also contribute in kind with technical staff time and materials. KBA and its partners propose to extract, isolate and develop various products from Distillers Dried Grains and Solubles (DDG), a by-product of ethanol bio-refinery. This well-coordinated research project has the potential of contributing significant economic benefit to MGP Ingredients, Inc. as well as to the bio-energy industries in Kansas and the United States. This research will be devoted to extracting and adding value to lignin that is present in DDS and will be present in a lot higher quantity in the Biomass based bio-refineries. The main objective is to find safe methods to extract lignin from DDGS, modify it to bio-plastic materials such as polyols and polyurethanes and develop applications for such materials. Lignin is the most abundant natural polymer and the most abundant renewable carbon source on earth next to cellulose (including hemi-celluloses). It is estimated that 20 billion tons of lignin is produced biosynthetically around the world. Out of this about 40-50 million tons of poor quality lignin are produced and only 1-2% is used for making specialty products, the rest is used as fuel. Wheat and other grassy plants contain about 12-20% lignin. This very important raw material is readily available at the bio-refineries and can add high economic value to the future ethanol plants. This project will be carried over a three year period and the scientists are confident that they will be able to meet the objective of this project."

First, the high cost of implementing manure management strategies, such as installing and operating anaerobic digesters and therefore the need to optimize return on investment by developing value-added products from the residuals. Second is that biomass (particularly large quantities of agricultural residue like wheat straw, pea vines, and other residuals) has the potential to play a significant role in the future of combustion or co-combustion power plants. However, a drawback is that the overall energy yield of these materials is modest when compared to other potential sources. The project will develop a value-added industrial absorbent product from anaerobically-digested bovine manure fiber. In preliminary studies, fiber treated post-digestion to improve certain properties has shown significant promise as a superior absorbent for petroleum products. We will characterize and optimize these properties for several types of digesters. The optimized fiber absorbent will be delivered to test customers in order to evaluate its efficacy under industrial conditions and to survey customer satisfaction with the product. Following use, the fiber will be picked up from the customers and tested to determine its energy (BTU) content. This information will determine the potential of the product following use to absorb petroleum spills to augment the energy content of agricultural residues, thus making them a more efficient source of renewable energy."

Income is derived from both grain and the increased value that is added as weight gain to growing cattle. This project is a multidisciplinary research and education project involving the Animal Science, Plant and Soil Sciences, and Agricultural Economics Departments. The goal is to be the premier program in the world for discovery and dissemination of scientific information that decreases production risks and improves profitability of feeder cattle and grain production from dual-purpose winter wheat; thus, strengthening the economies of rural communities in the southern Great Plains. The objectives of the research and education program are to: (1) develop supplementation programs and programs for delivery of new technologies that will decrease production risks of growing cattle on wheat pasture and increase profitability of the enterprise, (2) determine the effect of nutrition and management practices on adipose tissue development and deposition in different adipose tissue depots of feeder cattle and final carcass value, (3) develop and distribute new wheat cultivars which maximize profitability of dual-purpose wheat enterprises, 4) determine the economic consequences of alternative strategies for managing cropland suitable for dual-purpose winter wheat production, and (5) determine the ecophysiological effects of grazing intensity on hard red winter wheat in an integrated crop-livestock system. Annual income in Oklahoma could be increased by $82 million by improving the technical efficiency of production of the approximate 1 million stocker cattle that are grown to heavier weights on wheat pasture in Oklahoma prior to being finished in feedlots. In addition, reductions in production risk would most likely result in greater utilization of the 5.8 million acres of wheat for grazing cattle contributing an additional $37 million annually to the state income. Therefore, the potential impact of this ongoing research project could increase annual state income by $176 million. Furthermore, this research has similar potential impacts on the 18 million acres of wheat planted annually and the 5.5 million wheat pasture stocker cattle in the states of Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, and Colorado."

It uses American Association of Cereal Chemistry standard protocols that allow results to be compared across regions and through time. The results are compiled into multi-year datasets to test for improved milling and baking characteristics of new cultivars. The results of collaborative evaluations of milling and baking quality in breeding materials have been used to improve both the understanding and the genetic structure of breeding populations. To improve the selection of cultivars and use of soft wheat we will develop rapid methods to detect improved milling and flour quality in commerce. We will select untempered milling methods in combination with other rapid methods to measure milling and flour quality by measuring milling yield by standard AACC methods and then comparing them to samples milled with reduced tempering to generate prediction models. We also will select NIR or NIR with hyperspectral analysis methods to measure milling and flour quality. Baking method improvement will focus on cake baking methods and alternatives for chlorinated flour. We will develop a cake baking method with zero-trans fat shortening through standard testing of formula modification. Then it will be used to compare the effects of heat treatment, chlorination and GBSS mutation (waxy wheat) on starch pasting and cake baking performance. The optimum treatments will be combined to test the use of waxy wheat flour for replacing chlorinated flour for cake baking. Milling quality may relate to specific anatomical differences linked to genetic markers for quality. We will compare grain from near-isogenic lines for milling and flour quality. Specifically we will contrast cells from maternal tissue, aleurone and sub-aleurone from near-isogenic lines. Finally all this information will be summarized and reviewed through industry panels on a regular basis to refine the soft wheat quality targets and measure eastern U.S. soft wheat breeding materials against those targets for the breeding programs and the milling industry."

However, breeding programs can only choose from available variation. For some important traits useful variation to improve milling and baking quality is not available. A goal is to create useful new variation in genes that have large impacts upon milling and/or baking and noodle quality. Three genes that have major impacts on the amount and quality of flour are the Puroindolines, which influence grain texture and flour yield, Glutenins, which impact the protein quality in the flour and subsequent dough mixing and bread qualities, and Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) which impact Asian noodle color properties. Wheat grain is categorized as soft or hard for marketing purposes. The soft and hard texture classes coincide with dramatic differences in milling and end-use properties. Soft wheats are best suited for cookies, cakes and pastries, while hard wheats are used for bread and bread products. A major gene, Ha, differentiates soft from hard wheats. The major gene is comprised of two closely linked genes Puroindoline a (Pina) Puroindoline b (Pinb). Results have shown that even hard wheats vary in their grain texture, and a softer variant of hard wheat gave increased flour yield and better bread quality. The dough handling and bread making properties of wheat derive from gluten. The gluten proteins are responsible for giving leavened bread its porous, airy texture and chewy brown crust. The majority of the Gluten (about 80%) is comprised of the storage proteins gliadins and glutenin. The glutenin fraction is primarily responsible for the strength, elasticity, and mixing characteristics of flour dough. The glutenins are further classified by their size as low molecular weight (LMW-GS) and high molecular weight (HMW-GS). The HMW-GS have been demonstrated to be most important in determining dough properties and bread quality. There are three genes that code for HMW-GS, one on each of the group 1 chromosomes (Glu-A1, Glu-B1, and Glu-D1). Of the three Glu-1 loci variation at the Glu-D1 locus shows strongest association with dough properties and bread quality. Consumers want a bright, creamy colored noodle that maintains its color with time. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) also plays a major role in the time-dependent darkening of noodles. PPO is the enzyme system that causes fruit to turn brown when left exposed to open air. Low PPO activity in the wheat kernel leads to a more stable noodle color over time. Low PPO activity is considered desirable for efficient milling and for high quality noodles. Breeding programs uses screening tests to categorize genotypes for PPO activity. PPO activity in wheat is in part under genetic control. Two major genes contribute to PPO activity in seeds (Ppo-A1 and Ppo-D1). Breeders are faced with the question of whether the major genes contribute to PPO activity and noodle color more or less equally, and whether selecting for the low allelic variants would have correlated responses on other quality and agronomic traits."

Also, there is relatively little barley breeding activity in the private sector. If the public programs in the Pacific Northwest did not exist, there would be at least a partial vacuum in development and release of new barley cultivars for use by growers and end users. The cultivar development program at WSU utilizes a mix of conventional and molecular breeding procedures and screening methods as appropriate. Genetic engineering or GMO technology is currently not a part of the cultivar development aspects of the program. Breeding focuses on spring barley for improved productivity on farm and improved quality for malting, feed and food uses. Other research is focused on mutation induction and genetic analysis of traits important for cultivar development such as disease resistance, herbicide resistance to overcome plant back restrictions, which eliminate barley from certain rotations with winter wheat, the primary field crop of Washington, as well as end use quality traits such as kernel hardness and kernel and product color, and high soluble fiber."

San Juan Bioenergy built an oilseed crushing plant in Dove Creek and began processing sunflower and safflower seeds in December 2008. Safflower has been grown in southwestern Colorado and particularly in southeastern Utah longer than sunflower has but its acreage rarely exceeds 2,000 hectares. Both safflower and sunflower have root systems that are capable of extracting soil moisture from great depths e.g., 2.0 m for sunflower based on the literature. This is a concern because of the low and erratic precipitation in southwestern Colorado. Long-term average annual precipitation in most of the farming area is 300 to 400 mm, 35 to 40% of which comes in the form of snow. Thus, a primary objective of this project is to determine the agronomic and economic feasibility of sunflower in rotation with more traditional crops such as winter wheat and dry bean. An important question that will be addressed is how often (e.g., every third or fourth year) can sunflower be grown in the same field while maintaining or enhancing the overall cropping system's profitability. Since sunflower is a relatively new crop in southwestern Colorado, we will also develop other best management practices such as optimum planting dates to maximize oil production for example. Most of the sunflower grown in southwestern Colorado is rain-fed, which given current production levels (a little over 1.5 million liters of oil in 2008) will not satisfy the Dove Creek Plant's capacity of 9.45 million liters of oil per year, unless dramatic increases in planted acres or oil yield occur. Consequently, we will experiment with limited but well targeted irrigation water applications as a way to boost oil production. In addition we will continue testing varieties and hybrids of sunflower and safflower for their adaptation and yield potential. Other oilseed crops of interest are canola and camelina. Canola has done well at the Southwestern Colorado Research Center under irrigation while camelina is a promising crop for dryland cropping systems given its short season and low input requirements. The information generated by this project will be shared with growers and recommendations will be made to enhance oilseed production in particular and agricultural sustainability in general, in southwestern Colorado."

Because of this, plant breeders constantly strive to develop new cultivars that build upon the traits in current cultivars, thereby progressing toward this goal. Wheat is the primary food grain consumed directly by humans worldwide, and more land around the globe is devoted to the production of wheat than to any other commercial crop. Multiple market classes of wheat are grown in the U.S. in multiple diverse climatic regions. Due to the complexity of market and environmental conditions, regionally and locally adapted cultivars need to be developed to meet the demands of the wheat market. A modified bulk-pedigree method is used to advance breeding material through the breeding program. Since each breeding environment is diverse, different traits are selected for within each region. Agricultural pests such as insects and pathogens also vary widely between regions, and we constantly strive to identify durable and novel sources of genetic resistance to these pests. Along with stringent field designs and selection criteria, molecular markers also are implemented in the breeding program to ensure essential agronomic traits are incorporated into adapted germplasm. Early generation end-use quality selection is utilized to provide advanced breeding lines with high end-use quality characteristics. Molecular analysis of agronomically important traits is also performed in conjunction with breeding efforts. This strives to identify the genes associated with particular traits of interest. By identifying the genes controlling these traits, breeders are able to track the genes in diverse genetic backgrounds and identify agronomically adapted lines while maintaining certain traits of interest such as disease resistance. This limits the amount of testing needed for many of the traits which are difficult to screen for under field conditions, such as different agricultural pests. The impact of this research involves releasing new winter wheat cultivars adapted to the diverse climatic regions of the state of Washington. Effort is placed on agronomic adaptability, high production capacity, durable disease resistance, and high end-use quality. By doing so, many added benefits are anticipated. Durable disease resistance limits the amount of pesticide applied, which increases profit margins and is environmentally friendly. New cultivars with higher yield capacity increase the sustainability of area farms as well as generate higher revenue for the state of Washington. High end-use quality maintains the market share, if not increases it, of wheat produced in Washington. These impacts are realized as farmers adopt and grow new cultivars released from breeding programs."

Winter wheat is critically important to the agriculture and economy of the region, and as a whole is regularly afflicted by insect pests. In particular, cereal aphids and Hessian flies are key pests around which IPM programs have been centered. Wheat producers have moved towards rotational systems with winter canola which has expanded to over 50,000 acres in Oklahoma. Rotations between winter wheat and winter hardy adapted cultivars of canola will allow for selective management of troublesome grassy and broadleaf weeds, decrease disease pressure common in continuous wheat, and increase water use efficiency which helps to stabilize and/or increase farm profits. However, since the introduction of winter canola into Oklahoma, producers have battled devastating aphid infestations which require management if canola is to be profitably produced. The impact of arthropod natural enemies on insect pests has long been suggested as an important component of IPM in wheat. However, in Oklahoma and much of the Southern Plains, the effects of natural enemies have not been fully quantified. Critical information including spatial and temporal ecology of natural enemies, their nutritional requirements, the important tritrophic relationships among pests, plants, and natural enemies, and how these factors relate to pest population suppression are needed for a truly integrated management approach in wheat and canola systems. The interaction of these factors with current and alternative crop production and management practices, including host-plant resistance and tillage, will help to identify the mechanisms that are required for successful integrated control. By evaluating natural enemies as part of a production ecosystem, and not as independent entities, an understanding of how biological control can be enhanced in IPM programs becomes realistic. Results from the proposed research are required to develop holistic, ecologically based, management programs for insect pests of wheat and canola, and deliver these programs to agricultural producers in the Southern Plains. A series of field and laboratory studies will be conducted to address specific hypotheses regarding the impacts of insect pests in wheat and canola production systems, tritrophic interactions among pests, natural enemies, and host plants, the validity of developed pest management programs, and the ecology of aphidophagous natural enemies in simple and diverse agroecosystems. Findings from these studies in winter wheat and canola systems will be incorporated into the web-based aphid management systems available for producers. Sampling and economic threshold studies in wheat and canola will allow producers to properly identify and manage aphids in a wheat-canola rotation system, and adoption of these approaches will allow producers to reduce insecticide costs up to $20 per acre."

Therefore, developing new methods of disease control is essential to the long-range improvement in and sustainability of U.S. agriculture and food systems.  The long-term goals of this proposal are to elucidate the signal cascade governing disease resistance in monocots and to create novel strategies for disease control in rice and other cereal crops.

In the United States, sweetpotato is an important specialty crop. During 2004-2008, approximately 97,400 acres were planted annually generating $317.8 million in farm-gate revenue. The number of acres produced has remained relatively stable over the last 10 years, with a slight trend upward in the last three. NC produces roughly 40-45% of the U.S. crop. During 2003-2008, an average of 42,500 acres of sweetpotatoes were planted yearly by NC farmers with farm-gate receipts averaging $107.5 million annually making it the most important vegetable crop produced in the state. About 60% of the U.S. crop is marketed fresh and the remainder is processed by various food processors. In terms of total sales, pureed sweetpotatoes are one of the leading vegetable baby food products sold by food processors in the US, but processors are also marketing them as valued-added canned products, and as sweetpotato chips and french fries in addition to other processed and prepared products. In addition to their utility as a food product, there is great potential for the production of value-added, bio-based renewable resources such as biofuels and sugar-based chemicals from the starch in sweetpotato because the crop is easy to grow and produces high yields per unit area with minimal fertilizer inputs.

It not only provides an economically viable alternative to wheat, barley and canola but also helps condition the soil for these other crops through its ability to add nitrogen, its low water use, and its alternate pests, weeds, and diseases. Relatively few public breeding programs service the region. In addition, the recent sequencing of the genome of barrel medic greatly increases the potential for rapid and dramatic improvement in the pea varieties available and our ability to manipulate the crop. The current project will take advantage of the recent developments in our understanding of the legume genome to develop new pea varieties specifically adapted to conditions in Montana and the Northern Great Plains. In addition, it proposes to address certain of the bottlenecks and vulnerable aspects of the pea crop by widening the genetic base of the crop and tagging and identifying several genes critical to our ability to cultivate the crop in the United States. As a species, pea possesses a high genetic diversity, and a wide range of products can be generated by traditional breeding techniques. One novel pea type that will be released as an output of this project is a dry pea that has a high content of slow digesting starch. Such a starch content is particularly suitable for type II diabetics or other individuals who desire to avoid high blood sugar levels. Soup or other products made from such peas is digested gradually, and has a much lower glycemic index than other grains or starchy vegetables. Other genes that will be investigated include several that provide resistance to specific diseases of pea, including powdery mildew, enation virus and fusarium wilt. Each of these diseases is common in pea growing regions, and the loss of their effectiveness would greatly reduce our ability to grow this crop."

For consistent improvement in wheat yield and quality, a continual search for new genes/gene combinations and their introgression into adapted material is required. Also required is an efficient method of transferring and manipulating genes without undesirable carry-over chromatin. About 50% of all higher eukaryotes including important crop plants are polyploids. Unlike in diploids, more than two identical (homologs) or similar (homoeologs) chromosomes are available for meiotic pairing. Regulation of chromosome pairing is the key step in recovering a sexually propagating, diploidized, hence, fertile polyploid species. In the absence of chromosome pairing control, both homologs as well as homoeologs can potentially pair resulting in an irregular pairing and multivalent formation, giving rise to aneuploidy and thus, sterility. In order to recover reproductively stable polyploid a precise chromosome pairing regulatory mechanism is essential. Chromosome pairing regulator genes have been identified in wheat and many other species. Of these the Ph1 of wheat is the most prominent and perhaps the best characterized. This project is focused on cloning and characterizing the Ph1 gene, and manipulating it to develop a targeted method of alien introgression. The project will specifically address the following questions: i) how do the chromosome pairing regulator genes operate to distinguish homologs from homoeologs, ii) during which stage of meiosis these genes are active, iii) how do these genes fit into the current model of chromosome pairing and recombination, iv) are these genes functional only in fertile polyploid species or are they universally present, and v) what is the relationship between the gene with similar genes in other polyploids and with similar function genes such as mismatch repair genes. Currently, we do not have clear answers to any of these questions in any eukaryotic species. In addition to the above-mentioned novel information, cloning and characterization of the Ph1 gene will have a direct application in alien introgressions. The wild relatives of crop plants possess a wealth of genes useful for crop improvement. Ideally, only one or a few gene transfers are desirable from otherwise agronomically undesirable wild relatives. At present one/few gene transfers from wild relatives can be most efficiently accomplished by crossing-over between the chromosomes of cultivated and alien species. Because of the presence of Ph1-like genes, such crossing-over is restricted. As a result, many undesirable traits are also transferred along with the desirable genes. In wheat, mutants can be used to activate homoeologous chromosome pairing. Difficulty in the gene scoring has been one of the bottle-neck steps for such manipulations. The project outcome about the mode of action of the Ph1 gene may suggest novel approaches for such alien gene transfers in crop plants in general."

The wheat industry in this state is small (-1.3 million tonnes out of 59 M produced nationally) but has been able to distinguish itself by having a high quality product as its trademark. The amount and the physico-chemical properties of starch and protein are primary indicators of grain quality as judged by growers, millers and processors. These components dictate the downstream application of grain whether it is for specialty pasta or bread or for non-food use. Starch and proteins are also biopolymers, and there is a growing market for biodegradable, environmentally friendly plant-based materials to acts as substitutes for those derived from petrochemicals. This could help reduce dependency on foreign oil and is in-line with current efforts to 'green' California's and the US economy. Many of the altered starches produced in this work will be tested directly for novel properties, which could allow use for non-food applications. We will also characterize high amylose wheat lines that could also have a significant impact on the health of California's citizens. Amylose physiologically mimics fiber and so bread and pasta made with refined white high-amylose flour will have several of the health benefits of wholegrain bread. Finally we will be identifying potential targets for improving starch for use in wheat TILLING programs to develop wheat lines with superior quality traits. TILLING is a non-transgenic method for gene engineering of plants that promises to be a rapid and efficient pipeline of discoveries made in crop genomics to the marketing of newly bred lines."

Both chronic and currently undermanaged, and emerging plant diseases are a continual threat to New York field crops and can reduce the already narrow profit margin for producers. This project addresses the most critical and timely crop disease management issues and directly supports several extension education initiatives. The project provides basal support for the plant pathology research component of an integrated field crops management program. It offers both fundamental contributions to disease epidemiology and management, and short-term research results on disease management tactics that can be recommended to extension educators, agribusiness, and growers. Methods employed include farm survey; experimental field plot assessment of cultivars, fungicides, biological control agents and cultural practices; controlled environment experiments; molecular genetic evaluation of pathogen populations; and aerobiology methods for studying fungal spore dispersal. Research efforts in the next 3 years will be focused on the biology and management of mycotoxin producing fungi in corn and wheat; viruses and foliar fungal diseases of wheat; brown root rot of forage legumes; disease management with resistant culitvars and clean seed programs in biofuel feedstock grasses; and optimized use of fungicides in the protection of corn, soybean and wheat. Intended outcomes include guidelines for disease management tactics that have been validated under New York conditions. Field crop producers will benefit financially from more efficient production of their crops (less disease-induced losses and savings from unnecessary application of control measures). Animal producers; feed, food, and biofuel processors; farm service providers; rural communities; and all consumers will benefit from the contributions of disease management to sustainable field crops production. Project directions are influenced through contact of the project leader with individual stakeholders as well as with the New York Corn Growers Association, New York State Agribusiness Association, New York Biomass Energy Alliance, New York Small Grain Seed Producers Committee, Northeast Certified Crop Advisors Program, New York Farm Viability Institute, and the Integrated Field Crop, Soil, and Pest Management Program Work Team (project leader is the co-chair). The project leader delivers extension education programs on field crop disease management that are based, in large part, on results from this research project."

Also, population genetics techniques can be used to elucidate the evolution of plant pathogenic fungi in agricultural and natural ecosystems, potentially predicting the emergence of new races and thus the stability of host plant resistance. Within Oklahoma, numerous plant pathogenic fungi cause severe diseases of all the major crops, including alfalfa, cotton, wheat, turfgrass and new bioenergy crops, such as switchgrass. Several of these fungus-host interactions have been developed into model pathosystems and will be investigated using a combination of basic plant pathology and advanced molecular and functional genomics approaches.

The most serious disease of wheat is leaf rust. Although leaf rust resistant cultivars are routinely released to control leaf rust, the new races of the rust rapidly overcome the cultivar resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more durable resistance that is non-race specific and will not be overcome easily, This holy grail of plant pathology is the objective of this proposal. Apparently, wild goatgrass deploys this strategy to protect itself from leaf rust. In this proposal, we will develop methods to identify this type of resistance, transfer it to wheat and develop diagnostic markers for efficient breeding of this type of resistance (called adult plant ressitance=APR) into elite cultivars. In addition, we will evaluate the lines for other foliar diseases of wheat, monitor their transfer to wheat and develop diagnostic markers for efficient breeding. The proposed research will produce new germplasm for breeding of new wheat cultivars with superior and longer lasting resistance to leaf rust and other foliar diseases of wheat for more profitable and sustainable crop production."

Capture and retention of soil water plus supplemental irrigation can maximize limited irrigation resources. This research quantifies the water use and irrigation requirements of corn, winter wheat, grain sorghum and sunflower crops grown with optimum water management using all water conservation techniques available. The outcome is the potential reduction of irrigation requirements for more fully irrigated crops and increasing grain yields for limited irrigated crops. To make reductions in water use, irrigators are considering shifts in cropping patterns that earn better net economic returns. A decision planning tool, the Crop Water Allocator (CWA) finds optimum net returns from combinations of crops, irrigation amounts, and land allocations (crop rotations) that program users choose to examine. The model uses yield-irrigation relationships as a basis to estimate yields for particular rainfall zones. The user can customize the program with localized crop production costs or rely on default values from typical western Kansas farming operations. Determining the relative importance of the factors that influence the outcome of limited-irrigation management decisions can become complex. Commodity prices and government programs can fluctuate and change advantages for one crop relative to another. Water availability, determined by governmental policy or by irrigation system capacity, may also change with time. Precipitation probabilities influence the level of risk the producer is willing to assume. Production costs give competitive advantage or disadvantage to the crops under consideration. Producers with limited water supplies need to make decisions about pre-season irrigation, growing season irrigation start-ups, and end-of-season shut-off. These decisions, which have been called macro-management, potentially can affect irrigation water use to a greater extent than daily irrigation scheduling. Currently producers have little information for limited irrigation management guidance. The Crop Yield Predictor (CYP) integrates crop response, cost input, and economic consequences into decisions for limited irrigation. These macro-management decisions are complex, but the crop simulation process that provided the foundation for CWA can be used directly to aid these decisions. Simulations will be based on possible rainfall probabilities and patterns and user defined irrigation management. Inputs would define the users circumstances. Decisions could be based not only on crop yield results but also on net returns. Escalating energy costs and declining groundwater supplies have accelerated the need for irrigators to practice deficit irrigation management. Irrigators need guidance to select the combination of crops that provide the best economic return with optimum allocations of irrigation to each crop. Feedback sessions will be conducted for selected irrigators, crop consultants, and extension agents to evaluate the CWA and CYP decision aids."

Recent increases in fertilizer prices have drawn attention to the use of manure as a nutrient source. Use of manure nutrients has potential to decrease fertilizer costs while maintaining productivity. Manure from Kansas livestock industries contains nearly 100 million lbs of recoverable nitrogen (N) and 65 million lbs of recoverable P2O5. Although the use of these nutrients could decrease input costs for producers, there are several road-blocks to the efficient use of manure-based nutrients. Not all of the N present in manure is available for crop uptake in the first year of application. The methods for estimating N availability are rough approximations. Furthermore, the nutrient content of manures is highly variable. The nitrogen content can change with feeding regimes, weather, collection methods, and storage methods. Manure application across a field can also be highly variable. All of these factors add to uncertainty in the manure N contribution to growing crops. Producers could supplement manure amended soils with fertilizer N, but determination of the in-season N rate is difficult due to the many factors affecting manure N availability. Plant sensors and optical remote sensors offer promising methods of adjusting in-season N rates. The objectives of this study are to i) calibrate an active remote sensor and chlorophyll meter for in-season adjustment of N recommendations for winter wheat and grain sorghum on soils receiving pre-plant manure applications, ii) evaluate manure-N availability determined according K-State extension publications to field measured data, and iii) determine the expected economic value of manure to grain producers in Kansas."

Continuing expansion of certified organic crop production, which must rely on organic sources for the bulk of nutrient inputs, over the last decade has contributed to this increase. Concurrently, the recent volatility in prices for synthetic fertilizers has led many conventional farmers in New England to look toward alternative nutrient sources. Yet farmers find that managing nutrients from biologically-based sources has inherent challenges, not least of which is a relative scarcity of practical information and tools to guide their nutrient management decisions. Organic producers in Maine and across the U.S. have consistently ranked fertility management as a top research priority (Honeycutt, unpublished; Marshall, 2005; Sooby et al., 2007). In a recent survey, Maine and New Hampshire vegetable growers and agricultural service providers unanimously identified the escalating cost of fertilizer and scarcity of alternative nutrient sources as one of the top soil fertility issues facing farmers in the next 5 to 10 years . There is a need to develop soil fertility strategies that enhance soil quality, provide adequate nutrients for crop production, and avoid nutrient excesses that might compromise the environment. The overall goal of this project is to develop management strategies and tools for biologically-based soil fertility systems that will improve the efficient use of nutrients while enhancing soil quality. Field projects will be conducted to address the following objectives: Objective 1. Evaluate pre-season and post-hoc tests for soil N sufficiency. The Illinois Soil Nitrate Test (ISNT), the Pre-Sidedress Test (PSNT) and the stalk test will be evaluated and compared for their ability to identify fields where no further N applications are needed. Such tools, if reliable, will increase the efficiency of farmers' fertility systems and reduce their production costs. Objective 2. Evaluate soil and fertility management practices to better synchronize nitrogen mineralization with crop demand. The project will evaluate and compare two innovative and contrasting wheat planting systems for their effects on soil nitrogen release, plant nitrogen uptake and grain quality. The planting systems were originally designed to manage weeds in organic cereals using contrasting strategies: (1) increasing plant populations and sowing in a more uniform pattern to enhance crop competition; and (2) sowing in wider rows than usual to permit inter-row cultivation with sweeps. Our hypothesis is that nitrogen availability, plant N uptake, and grain protein will be enhanced in the wide vs. narrow row systems due to timely soil disturbance stimulating soil nitrogen mineralization. Results from field studies investigating this hypothesis will provide information for growers to enhance the quality of the bread wheat they produce."

DON survives processing, can contaminate food, and is poisonous to animals and humans. While vigilant monitoring conducted by the grain trade has seemingly assured food and feed safety, current methods of DON analysis have been called into question by recent reports of bound DON that escapes detection during normal testing. The presence of bound DON or other mycotoxins has a number of interesting implications. While bound toxins may not be detected in raw materials by routine analytical methodology, they may be released under food processing conditions or during digestion. The objectives of this project are to determine the prevalence of bound DON in barley that has been infected with FHB, and to study how interactions between the plant and fungus influence levels of bound DON. Both objectives are needed to determine whether the presence of bound DON in grain presents a significant risk to the consumer."

There has been very little work evaluating the relationship of milk production of the cow with postweaning performance of the calf in different production environments. We hypothesize that the poorer postweaning performance of calves from crossbred cows is partially related to higher levels of milk production during the preweaning phase. Considerable work has been done evaluating rotational grazing systems with growing stockers with the general conclusion that rotational grazing allows higher stocking rates compared to continuous grazing. Less work has been done with cow-calf production using rotational systems. Knowledge of forage quality is critical in the determination of the need for such supplementation. Past methodology for determination of forage quality has been slow and tedious. Recent work has suggested that it is possible to assess forage quality in real-time on the pasture, which allows stocker operators the technology to quickly recognize the need for supplementation. Assessments of grazing animal intake during the growing season can help livestock managers make decisions for adjusting stocking rate, pasture management, and meeting the nutrient requirements of grazing livestock. Because forage intake is related to forage quality, it is reasonable to hypothesize that it may be possible to predict forage intake from forage canopy hyperspectral reflectance. Recent work at the Grazinglands Research Laboratory using canopy spectral reflectance demonstrated the feasibility of prediction of intake in growing lambs and found a coefficient of determination of .92 in the prediction of intake from hyperspectral radiometry using multilinear regression. There is a need to for further research to develop more general prediction equations for intake for incorporation into real-time technology to allow precision supplementation on pasture. Results from this research will add new knowledge to the literature on impact of preweaning maternal environment and its' interaction with breed group and postweaning management on postweaning growth, enabling better matching of preweaning nutrition through milk, breed group, and postweaning management to enhance postweaning productivity. Results will also add new information to the literature on the impacts of preweaning grazing management on postweaning performance of calves managed conventionally (fall and spring wheat, spring feedlot) or under extending grazing prior to feedlot (fall and spring wheat, summer warm-season grazing, fall short-feed). Research on prediction of intake through forage canopy spectral reflectance has potential for development of new technology in estimation of forage intake and application of such technology in precision supplementation of stockers."

The two leading oilseed crops in South Dakota, other than soybeans, are sunflower and flax. South Dakota is currently the second leading producer of both sunflower and flaxseed in the United States, following North Dakota (USDA/NASS, 2009). Oilseeds like sunflower grow well in areas of South Dakota where crop choices are limited by environment. They also work well in rotation with more traditional crops such as corn, soybean, and wheat, helping to break up weed and pest cycles. There are only two public sunflower breeding programs in the United States. One is here at SDSU and the other is a USDA-ARS program at the Northern Crop Science Laboratory in Fargo, ND. This research project will focus on the development and release of improved sunflower genetic material that can be used by the sunflower industry to produce hybrids adapted to South Dakota. Emphasis will be placed on economically important traits such as yield, oil content, oil quality, pest resistance, stress resistance and adaptability to South Dakota growing conditions. Drought is a recurring threat to sunflower production in many areas of the U.S., including the sunflower production areas of South Dakota. One strategy for mitigating the effects of drought stress is improved crop genetics which allow plants to withstand stress and produce a crop. Another objective of this research project is to develop molecular markers associated with drought tolerance in sunflower that can be used to assist with future selection for this trait. Besides improved genetic resources, there is a need for sunflower production research in South Dakota. Producers will benefit from production practices that minimize inputs and produce higher yield and quality for a greater economic return. This project will cooperate with SDSU, CES, NDSU, USDA-ARS, and other regional personnel to conduct research and provide advice to growers on hybrid selection and general production practices for maximizing seed yield, oil content, and crop quality. Several other oilseed crops may be useful in crop rotations in South Dakota. We will evaluate the potential of new or underutilized oilseed crops such as camelina, flax, winter canola, and Crambe for increased South Dakota production and provide resources to growers interested in including them their cropping systems. Expected outcomes from this project include improved genetic resources and increased knowledge of the researchers and public about oilseed crops which may lead to outcomes that include changes in production practices or crop rotations that have the impact of increasing farm productivity and profitability."

South Dakota's unique geographical location allows crops, normally separated by location or cropping season, to be grown simultaneously and creates a continuum of living hosts that favors many plant viruses. Surveys of South Dakota winter wheat concluded that wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) is an endemic virus problem with an average of 47% of all winter wheat fields containing plants infected with WSMV. WSMV-infected winter wheat loses from 5% to over 70% of its yield depending on the cultivar and environmental conditions. Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) has a heavy impact on South Dakota small grains during years with strong flights of BYDV carrying aphids from southern states. BYDV caused reductions of grain yields in infected plants range from 47 to 81% in South Dakota. Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) has been demonstrated to cause yield losses up to 56% in certain lines and to cause greater yield losses when the infection occurs at early dates. New viruses, such as High Plains virus or Triticum mosaic virus, are new threats that will impact the future crops. Clearly, plant viruses impact the economic potential for South Dakota agriculture. Management of plant viruses relies on preventative actions rather than therapeutic treatments, such as pesticides. Thus, this project promotes management of plant viral diseases through monitoring, identification, detection, and interactive studies with agricultural crops, vectors, and alternate hosts to address the environmental and epidemiological roles of plant viruses, resistance evaluation to identify resistant, tolerant, and susceptible plants for management of plant viruses through prevention, and studies to define how viruses interact with the cellular level of their plant hosts. Information developed will be vital to producers/farmers, plant breeders, extension educators and specialists, entomologists, and other researchers. Communication to stakeholders and scientists will be developed through publications, interaction with national disease databases and platforms, and with stakeholder presentations."

Thus, even though producers in North Dakota lead the nation in the production of at least eight crops, they struggle to make a living. The reasons for the low net farm income could include lower yields and higher production costs. However, regardless of the reasons, producers need to discover ways to combat low profit margins per unit of land. Increasing farm size generally is not an option due to high land costs. A viable alternative requiring higher management, but also providing increased income potential, is high-value crop production. These products are typically perishable, of high quality and specific value, and increasingly sold through specialized markets. This production alternative may help diversify farming operations and increase net returns. In addition, numerous communities have developed farmer's markets due to the increase in demand for locally produced food. The United States Department of Agriculture reported that between 1994 and 2006, the number of U.S. farmers' markets more than doubled to over 3,700, and the value of U.S. agricultural products directly sold increased thirty-seven percent from $592 million to $812 million. North Dakota's large diurnal temperature differences during the growing season are ideal for high-quality and high-yielding specialty crops such as vegetables, herbs, and small fruits. Many producers are experimenting with small fruits and vegetables, utilizing limited production information available from nearby states and learning from personal experiences. Sustainable production practices are desperately needed to avoid costly mistakes at a time when financial stability is already a concern. With the introduction of Roundup Ready crops in the 1990's and the explosion in the adoption of glyphosate-resistant crops, the acreage receiving more than one application of glyphosate has increased dramatically nation-wide. Glyphosate label additions allowing pre-harvest applications to several non-glyphosate-resistant crops has further increased the acreage treated with glyphosate. Currently, glyphosate is the largest-selling single crop-protection chemical product in the market. Nontarget injury from glyphosate drift to non-glyphosate-resistant crops has been a concern since the introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops. Most research has shown detrimental effects when drift occurred early in the growing season and that nontarget monocot crops are more sensitive than dicot crops. However, since this chemical is translocated within a plant, there is potential injury to the current season growth as well as tubers used for seed the following year. Potato seed producers as well as commercial producers need to be educated on the potential risks associated with glyphosate applications near a potato field."

We aim to enhance the capacity of farmers to produce high quality organic wheat to meet the increasing demand from local millers, bakers, and ultimately consumers. Over a three year period, we will conduct research that will explore the affects of planting and harvest dates on disease and weed incidence as well as wheat yield and flour quality. In addition, a variety of outreach materials and programs will be developed to transfer new knowledge to producers.

Because of the current corn prices increase, swine producers, especially limited resource farmers, will be hard pressed to manage their swine operations effectively. Therefore, alternative feed ingredients that may be locally available may fill in the need created by the current corn price increase. Small grains such as barley, oats, and wheat can be useful feedstuffs in swine feeding programs. The other advantage of considering these alternative feed ingredients is most of them contain a substantial amount of prebiotic factors that facilitates the establishment and proliferation of some of the desirable bacteria in the large intestine of the animals. This could be good news to swine producers if successful to feed antibiotics-free diets -- an issue that is currently gathering momentum from consumers regarding the use of antibiotics in animal feed."

V.",,,613809599,CORNELL UNIVERSITY INC,ORISKANY,NY,13424-3921,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2010,,,"Onions are one of the most important vegetables grown in New York State. NY-produced onions were valued at $ 47 to $ 55 million in recent years. As with many plants, onions are plagued by plant pathogens and plant pests. Based on years of research and the development of many agrichemicals, many onion diseases and pests are now reasonably well controlled by current technology. However, the management of diseases caused by bacterial pathogens are particularly challenging to growers. In contrast to fungal pathogens and several insect pests, bacteria are particularly difficult to control, in part because of the dearth of effective bactericides and because their epidemiology is so poorly understood. Beginning in 2006, NY growers experienced losses to onions caused by a disease new to NY. The PI was enlisted to work with J. W. Lorbeer to investigate the problem. We found that it was similar to a disease described earlier in Georgia known as Center Rot (CR). The CR pathogen, Pantoea ananatis, was isolated from symptomatic onions grown in NY. Other strains of P. ananatis had been reported to infect or just reside in or on many plants including pineapple, melon, wheat, maize, pine and tomato. We documented the presence of CR and P. ananatis in onions grown in NY in 2007 and 2008. CR is important because affected onions generally pass over grading lines; usually, CR is detected only after bulbs are cut, which is too late for the grower-packer to remove them. Thus, whole shipments of NY onions are at risk for rejection by inspectors and buyers based on the presence of CR. Our work with CR at Cornell has included documenting the presence of the pathogen in onions exhibiting internal decay symptoms, developing reliable pathogenicity tests, completing Koch's Postulates, and finding that the CR pathogen is associated with weeds growing in the immediate vicinity of commercial onion plantings. Several oral and written reports have been made or are scheduled for grower groups and scientists. For this proposal, we plan to utilize the information discovered over the last 3 years in studies to better understand CR as it occurs in NY. Our aim is to facilitate management of the disease. Specifically, we intend to determine characteristics of strains of P. ananatis that are pathogenic to onion, in contrast to those that are not. Then, we will develop improved diagnostic tools that can be used to quickly and definitively identify onion-infecting strains of P. ananatis. These techniques would then be used to determine whether onion thrips, the most common thrips pest of NY onions, are infested with the CR pathogen and whether they can transmit the CR pathogen to onion. (Earlier work in Georgia and South Africa indicated that the bacterial pathogen can be transmitted by tobacco thrips.). We also will investigate the sources of inoculum for CR including possibly bacteria that over-winter in onions and weeds that occur near onion plantings. Finally and importantly, we will evaluate possible control techniques including application of resistance-inducing chemicals and biological materials to reduce the incidence of CR in the lab, greenhouse and field."

Late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, is the most devastating potato disease worldwide. The first shock of devastation caused by P. infestans was the well-known Irish Potato Famine, which led to the death of approximately one million people through starvation and disease, with another million thought to have emigrated as a result of the famine. Control of late blight in the United States relies almost exclusively on fungicide application. During an average epidemic year the fungicide cost to control late blight is about $200-300 per acre. Extensive fungicide applications can also result in a major environmental issue. Potatoes contain many resistance genes (R genes) against late blight. At least 11 race-specific late blight resistance genes, all from a wild potato species Solanum demissum, have been incorporated into numerous potato varieties. However, all of these genes have already been overcome by specific P. infestans strains. Because the race-specific resistance genes have been short-lived in breeding practices, it is of great interest to study the mechanisms of broad-spectrum, or race-non-specific disease resistances against late blight. We have cloned such a race-non-specific late blight resistance gene, named RB, from a Mexican wild potato species Solanum bulbocastanum in 2003. Transgenic potato lines containing the RB gene showed resistance against various P. infestans strains. Most remarkably, the transgenic lines exhibited a high level of resistance in the Toluca Valley in Mexico, which is the most late blight infested region in the world. The proposed research will investigate the molecular mechanisms of the RB-mediated resistance pathway. We are interested why and how the RB-mediated resistance is different from the resistance conferred by the race-specific resistance gene. Using genomics mythologies we have identified a set of 185 genes that are associated with the RB-mediated resistance. Most importantly, we have discovered a novel receptor-like kinase (RLK) gene, which may play a key role in the resistance pathway. We will use several different techniques, including gene expression, gene silencing, and late blight inoculation tests in greenhouse, to study the specific role of this RLK gene. Results from the proposed research will be important to develop strategies for breeding and deploying the RB gene in sustainable ways."

These mycotoxins pose major threats to the health of humans and animals. Spot blotch, caused by Cochliobolus sativus (Ito & Kurib.) Drechs. ex Dastur [anamorph: Bipolaris sorokiniana (Sacc. in Sorok.) Shoem.], are also economically important diseases because it causes significant losses in barley and wheat worldwide. Host resistance is considered as the most effective and economically sound method for controlling plant diseases. However, new sources of FHB resistance in wheat are limited and information about the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity and virulence of the spot blotch pathogen is lacking. In this proposed project, we will screen and identify wheat germplasm and breeding lines with a high level of resistance to FHB, map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the resistance using various mapping populations and develop DNA markers associated with the resistance for use in spring wheat breeding programs. In addition, we will characterize the isolates of F. graminearum collected from the North Central region for possible changes in toxin production and aggressiveness. We also will isolate and characterize the genes in C. sativus conferring virulence to barley and wheat using genomics and functional genomics approaches. The research project proposed will not only facilitate the development of new varieties with better resistance to FHB, but also provide basic information about the biology of the two fungal pathogens (F. graminerum and C. sativus) so that we can develop novel approaches for disease control. Identification of FHB resistance and DNA markers associated with the resistance can help in development of new wheat varieties to reduce the impact of the diseases in North Dakota and the US. The FHB resistance-associated DNA markers identified can facilitate the transfer of the resistance loci into spring wheat varieties. DNA markers can also be used for pyramiding QTLs for FHB resistance from different sources to achieve a higher level of and/or more durable FHB resistance in the wheat breeding program. Pathogen population can change over time to overcome the host resistance and thus monitoring and characterization of the population changes in the pathogen are essential to deploy effective resistance genes. Besides, an understanding of the genetic, biochemical, and molecular interactions of the pathogens with their hosts [barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum)] could ultimately lead to the development of novel strategies for controlling these serious diseases of cereals."

Fundamental viscoelastic measurements can be made on gluten or dough under controlled laboratory conditions. Up until now it has been very difficult to capture the viscoelasticity of gluten or dough with a simple rapid test that can be used in the field as well as the laboratory. This project is focused on development of rapid methods for direct objective determination of the viscoelastic properties of gluten and dough. The viscoelastic properties of gluten can provide the  linkage  between biochemical wheat quality on the one hand and functional and end use properties of dough-based products on the other hand."

Because the assets underlying the futures contracts have physical presence, and contract performance can entail the delivery or receipt of the physical good, futures markets for physical commodities present special challenges to users, regulators and researchers. It is delivery that ties the prices of the physical commodity at the delivery point to the prices traded in the futures markets. For this reason, the operation of the delivery mechanism is crucial to the operation of the futures market. In the last three years, prices in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Corn, Soybean and Wheat futures contracts have demonstrated significantly poorer connection to physical commodity prices. (Irwin, Garcia, Good and Kunda) Likewise, the entire delivery structure of the South African Futures Exchange maize and wheat contracts have been called into question by members of the South African grain industry. (National Agricultural Marketing Council) Integrating futures and cash markets in a single, even modestly tractable, model is inherently quite difficult. To this point, explicit models of futures markets, such as in Hull, have typically assumed well-functioning delivery markets with neither frictions nor constraints. Likewise, explicit models of physical markets have assumed well-functioning and efficient futures markets (Williams and Wright). However, many of the most interesting research questions, such as the effects of speculation, and the lack of cash and futures price convergence, posed by recent futures market behavior cannot be answered without a model that encompasses both cash and futures markets. Such a model is not only useful for exploring the effects of changed delivery locations, such as current proposals to eliminate Ohio as a wheat delivery location, but can also be used to identify conditions under which speculation would or would not impact underlying cash commodity prices."

The simplest and most common definition of irrigation scheduling is the determination of when and how much water to apply. Improvements in irrigation scheduling must be carefully balanced with the primary economic goal of microirrigation which is to improve crop yield and quality. Field testing of soil-based irrigation scheduling techniques will determine sensor location relative to plants and installation requirements for several the types of soil water sensors. Use of these sensors as appropriate irrigation scheduling tools will be evaluated. A web-based irrigation advisory program (http://oiso.bioe.orst.edu/RealTimeIrrigationSchedule/) developed at Oregon State University will be evaluated under Idaho soil and climate conditions for sugar beets, malting barley, winter and spring wheat, silage corn, and alfalfa. Sustainable water use in the United States can be augmented by the use of non-potable waters through microirrigation systems. This requires careful selection of system components and appropriate system management. Use of non-potable water for irrigation has advantages since the water is often rich in nutrients beneficial to crops and use of the non-potable water for irrigation often reduces treatment costs and environmental impacts. Non-potable water use through microirrigation also has disadvantages since some of the water constituents may adversely impact soil quality and plant growth. One by-product of the dairy industry in Southern Idaho is a large quantity of lagoon water resulting from winter precipitation runoff, and wash pen-milking center cleaning. Because this liquid effluent is high in N, P and K, it must be properly managed to avoid nutrient overloading. Removal of sediment-bound P by filtration would allow higher levels of effluent application per acre for more effective irrigation and N source utilization. Outcomes/Impacts: A grower-accessible, real-time measure of crop performance will be an invaluable tool as a check against any proposed microirrigation schedule. A technical session at a a national irrigation meeting will bring together experts representing different approaches to irrigation scheduling and will contribute to a more integrated approach to this field of research and education. Websites dedicated to soil- and plant-based irrigation scheduling approaches and delivery of ET-based information will allow growers to improve crop production and economics while reducing irrigation withdrawals. Concentrated animal agriculture facility operators who use their effluent for irrigation will be able to determine whether microirrigation is a viable option. Selection of microirrigation equipment and components for livestock effluents will be easier for producers. Growers, scientists, and regulators will have increased knowledge about the safe reuse of reclaimed water."

Secondly, research to understand the basis of what constitutes grain quality is necessary to improve these quality factors if we are to maintain/increase our competitive edge in the global marketplace.

Growers treat their seeds with fungicides to protect the emerging seedlings, but these chemicals only provide a short period of protection and will lose their efficacy even faster under conductive environmental conditions, such as high soil moisture, lower soil temperatures, and increased microbial degradation. In comparison, biological control agents (BCAs), mainly bacterial and fungal organisms with the ability to produce antibiotic-like compounds and compete for nutrients and space with the pathogens, can survive for a long time by colonizing the root. Depending on the degree of colonization, this can protect the plant throughout the whole growing season. This project is aimed to identify suitable BCA and fungicide combinations for the control of certain soil-borne diseases under conditions prevalent in southern Idaho. Laboratory and greenhouse experiments, conducted under conditions mimicking environmental conditions during the spring, will screen existing BCAs for their ability to colonize and protect sugar beet roots against individual fungal pathogens and for their compatibility with existing and new fungicides. Finally, suitable combinations of BCAs and fungicides will be tested in fields with a known history of crop losses caused by soil-borne pathogens. The gained data will help to improve the protection of not only emerging sugar beets, but also other crops such as beans, wheat, etc. The utilization of BCAs in combination with chemical seed treatments or as standalone treatments has the potential to reduce pesticide utilization and therefore reduce health risks and environmental contamination."

Bt resistance frequency in SCB will be estimated with novel screening methods to validate if the frequency is sufficiently low to meet the requirements for the IRM strategy. Susceptibility of Bt-susceptible and -resistant SCB to novel Bt proteins will be determined to identify new Bt toxins that can overcome the known Bt resistance. This study will provide information necessary to support and improve the Bt-corn IRM and ensure the long-term success of Bt corn in the mid-southern region. A new pest, Moodna bisinuella, was recently discovered in Louisiana corn fields. It could represent a potential threat to corn and grain sorghum in the state. In this project, growth, development, and reproduction of M. bisinuella will be studied in the laboratory. In addition, crop damage and yield losses caused by this pest will be determined in the field. Results from these studies will generate essential information needed for managing this invasive pest. In recent years, significant SCB damage on sorghum was reported in Louisiana. Effective insecticides are not available for controlling sorghum insect pests in the state. In this project, occurrence and damage of SCB on different sorghum varieties will be evaluated to identify tolerant varieties for managing SCB. The widespread adoption of reduced tillage practices has increased the probability and severity of soil and seeding insect problems of corn and sorghum in Louisiana. In this study, novel chemical insecticides will be evaluated in south Louisiana to develop effective chemical control strategies for managing soil and insect pests in early plant stages of corn and grain sorghum in this area. Recently, Hessian fly seriously damaged wheat in some areas in Louisiana. Little research has been conducted in Louisiana on management strategies. In addition, the species and occurrence of aphids on wheat in Louisiana have not been fully investigated. In this study, resistance of common wheat varieties and several chemical control technologies will be evaluated in field trials. Data generated from this study will be used to develop effective strategies for managing Hessian fly and aphids for Louisiana wheat growers to support sustainable wheat production systems."

The prices of corn, wheat, and milk set all-time high records in 2008. Ag input costs became increasingly volatile with the per ton price of nitrogen increasing by approximately 300% between 2000 & 2008-09. Because of increased price volatility in ag commodities and manufactured input costs including seed, fertilizer and chemicals, farmers find marketing decisions now have unprecedented impact on bottom-line profit. U.S.  dollar signs  than was typical during the 80's & 90's. Concomitantly, cash flow management has increasingly become a high priority in agriculture. Greater price volatility in commodity and manufactured input prices has increased the incentives for producers to do a (more) careful analysis of both farmer costs of production and alternative marketing options. Ag land costs represent another large financial hurdle for producers, whether land is purchased or leased. The  biofuels boom  of recent years, led by the introduction of corn-based ethanol as a motor fuel, spurred aggressive bidding for ag land. The inclusion of demand factors related to development pressures in highly populated areas of PA can increase the purchase price of 160 acres, several fold higher, than one million dollars. To better contend with the current high-risk setting for agriculture, producers are focusing more intensely on management issues that directly relate to their farm financial situation. The rapid pace of technological advance in agriculture, the potential to grow higher yields with improved seed genetics, the unprecedented increase in land rents and land purchase prices, and the increasing options made available to farmers to market crop and livestock commodities with Futures and Options instruments, combine to create an agricultural industry that is entering previously uncharted financial territory. The proposed research will focus on evaluation of farmer strategies to fix priority production problems on on-going farms and ranches. Production agriculture has increasingly evolved from intense efforts to obtain maximum yields per cow/acre, to viewing production and finances as two-fold priorities in the farm management process. The research will achieve several useful outcomes. At an initial research stage a survey of identified farm problems related to production and finance will be developed that will provide insight into critical areas of farm decision-making. Following a catalog of high priority problems identified by producers in the course of their educational program, an analysis of the associated producer-identified solutions will also be developed. The clustering of high priority problems and respective solutions will enrich statistical analysis to better understand the determinants of production and finance problems in agriculture. A critical outcome will be the quantification of the profit and yield impacts brought about by implementation of problem solving strategies on participant farms."

Majority of the wheat grown in the state is planted to NDSU released cultivars. Improved cultivars are required to ensure the economic viability of wheat production in the region. New cultivars must have superior end-use quality to gain acceptance. This project is aimed at developing durum and bread wheat germplasm better adapted to North Dakota growing environment, with higher productivity, better milling characteristics and tolerant to prevalent diseases. In this project we will use classical genetic techniques as well as modern molecular biology methods to dissect traits of interest and transfer those traits into ND adapted germplasm. We have also begun dissection of cellular processes that impact energy production and overall plant productivity. This research is critical for improvement of plant productivity beyond current levels. Additionally, we have devised a new method, radiation hybrid (RH) mapping. RH mapping uses experimental hybrids carrying radiation-induced chromosome breaks to identify the precise physical location of marker genes - something that has been difficult in wheat. Knowing the physical locations of marker genes is important to allow the anchoring of wheat DNA sequence information to exact physical chromosome locations. The ultimate aim is to provide breeding projects with the necessary germplasm to develop cultivars needed to meet the demand of North Dakota growers."

In 2008 and 2009 Ohio ranked number one in soft red winter wheat (SRWW) production in the US. Improved cultivars are the foundation for any profitable cropping system and the success of the Ohio wheat industry. Yield potential is the primary factor wheat growers use in selecting cultivars due to the overriding impact of yield on profits. Thus the quality and disease resistance of high-yield cultivars determines much of the fate of the Ohio crop and growers will compromise those traits for maximum yield. While new disease resistance and unique quality attributes add value to a crop, cultivars with these traits will not be accepted by growers unless the cultivars also have competitive yield that allow for profits. Thus yield improvement is an essential component to improving all traits. The yield potential of a cultivar has to be protected from pests whose presence reduce yield. The Ohio wheat crop faces many fungal pathogens due the humid environment with host resistance being the primary mechanism of control for most of these pests. Ths breeding and genetics studies for improved host resistance is a major opbjective The milling and baking quality of wheat is also very important to the Ohio milling and baking industry. The midwest milling and baking industry is seeking high flour yield, strong and weak gluten soft wheats, hard wheats, and soft white wheats. Research is needed to produce cultivars that meet these needs. This Hatch project will conduct research on yield, disease resistance with an emphasis on FHB, improving quality with an emphasis on value-added wheats, and uses of millfeed in the bio-economy. The program will produce both applied (new cultivars, new processes) and basic outcomes such as gene discovery, genetic analysis, and improved breeding methodologies."

THE EVOLUTION OF WRKY TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN THE PLANT KINGDOM WRKY transcription factors are one of the largest and most important families of plant transcription factors. They are of ancient origin but are completely absent from yeast and animal lineages. In higher plants, the majority of these members are key regulators of important stress responses such as the responses to drought, wounding and pathogens. Lower plants contain less WRKY genes and certain subgroups are missing. I aim to discover the roles of WRKY transcription factors in mosses and algae, as well as higher plants and thereby shed new light on the function of this important family of transcription factors across the entire plant kingdom. 2. PLANT PROMOTERS FOR USE IN BASIC RESEARCH AND PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY For many strategies aimed at improving crop plants using transgenes, the stumbling block is not what gene or genes to express but rather how to express it. The right gene will not improve crop performance if it is not expressed in the right way. Being able to express genes in the desired way requires a collection of different promoter regions that can be used to turn a gene on and off when and where expression of the gene is required. Large collections of suitable promoters that direct gene expression in the desired way (for example drought, cold or pathogen inducible) are lacking and this project looks to provide useful promoters for both plant biotechnology and basic plant research. 3. BRACHYPODIUM DISTACHYON AS A MODEL SYSTEM TO STUDY COLD AND DROUGHT-INDUCED GENES IN GRASSES Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) is poised to become to monocot crops what Arabidopsis is to dicots - the model system for gene discovery. The JGI describes it as the new model plant for temperate grasses and herbaceous energy crops. This project aims to isolate genes that regulate drought and cold responses in Brachypodium. These genes will then be used to dissect the processes of drought tolerance and cold hardiness. The ultimate goal of the project is to use Brachpodium as a model system for wheat as this should bypass the technical problems associated with wheat and lead to new strategies for wheat improvement. 4. WRKY TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS AS TOOLS TO IMPROVE DROUGHT RESPONSES Drought is the major culprit behind crop losses worldwide, with billion dollar losses in the USA. WRKY transcription factors are key regulators of many plant stress responses but until recently, there was little evidence linking WRKYs with drought responses. We now know that many WRKY genes are induced by drought. We have identified this as a major gap in our knowledge and an opportunity to increase drought tolerance. Our hypothesis is that WRKYs are regulators of water stress responses and that similar genes regulate these responses in different plant species. Our goal is to identify WRKY genes that regulate drought responses in rice and soybean and develop a tool to identify similar genes in other crop plants. The project will not only increase our knowledge of drought responses in crop plants but also lead to new approaches aimed at reducing crop losses in the USA."

Thus, increasing Fe, Zn and protein concentrations in edible parts of plants could benefit the nutritional status of millions of people. One approach to improving nutritional quality is to increase partitioning of mineral elements to the grain during grain development and filling. In wheat, this stage of plant development coincides with the senescence of vegetative tissues. Leaf senescence is the final stage of leaf development. As leaves yellow, there is a shift in metabolism and gene expression. A number of genes have decreased expression during senescence, while others are more highly or only expressed during leaf senescence, and are known as senescence associated genes. A substantial percentage of the protein in wheat grain is supplied by amino acids remobilized from vegetative tissue during leaf senescence, and remobilization of these and other nutrients must depend on expression of senescence associated genes. Learning how to manipulate expression of the genes that are responsible for remobilizing minerals to grains could result in nutritionally enhanced foods. Transcription factor proteins regulate the expression of genes. A family of transcription factors called NAM have been shown to influence timing of leaf senescence and wheat grain Fe, Zn, and protein concentration. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the role of the NAM genes in regulation of leaf senescence and remobilization or translocation of nutrients to seeds. Manipulation of NAM proteins or NAM gene expression will be employed to understand how this gene regulates the timing of senescence, and the effect on genes and processes that are necessary to move minerals into edible portions of plants. This information could be used in breeding programs to select for the best naturally occurring NAM alleles, or to engineer crops with improved nutritional or agronomic characteristics. Because leaf senescence can be initiated prematurely by plant stresses such as heat stress, drought, and nutrient deficiency, manipulation of the timing of leaf senescence could allow development of crops with improved drought stress or potentially higher yielding varieties. Increasing remobilization of minerals from above-ground vegetative tissues could be beneficial for biofuels applications that rely on combustion of plant material.

There is increasing concern about adequate irrigation as we potentially enter another year with short water supplies. Simultaneously, there have been substantial changes in the U.S. grain industries. There is an increasing demand for hard white wheat in the domestic and international markets for bread and noodle products, and for specialty high beta-glucan barley varieties. These crops seem even more sensitive to disease and drought stress than their traditional counterparts. Continued effort is required to develop locally adapted wheat and barley varieties and agronomic practices that maximize productivity and profitability. Idaho?s climate provides an excellent environment to consistently produce high quality grain. Almost 73% of Idaho?s barley received a USDA/FGIS grade of #1 in 2008 (Olson, 2008). Most grain produced in the rainfed environments of the Intermountain West suffers little from foliar pathogens that impact quality. The absence of toxin-producing pathogens in our more arid environments makes wheat and barley an excellent choice for toxin-sensitive applications, including animal feed, malt, food, and nutraceuticals. The development of new overseas markets for high beta-glucan food barley and for malt barley will expand the market options for our growers in rural Idaho. Another opportunity is offered by aquaculture with interest in grain-based fish meal. Because current varieties do not meet preferred characteristics, production will not fulfill all the needs of these new markets. We must continue to improve small grain varieties for the rainfed environments of the West that reliably produce high quality feed for cattle, swine and fish, and provide the grain needed for growing food and malt markets. A recognized barrier to grain production under dryland conditions is the water and nutrient-robbing fungi that infect stressed root and crown tissue. Currently, breeders do not routinely screen for resistance to the dryland root rot complex, other than indirectly in variety performance trials located throughout the area. Development of a semi-permanent screening nursery at Aberdeen allows testing of varieties carrying resistance to dryland root rot fungi. In this nursery, heavily inoculated plots are dedicated to screening advanced breeder lines and testing new transgenic lines for resistance to fungal root-rotting organisms. This should advance lines for dryland areas where grains are subject to dry-land foot rot infection, as well as provide a basic understanding of the effectiveness of transgenic and novel genes in grain to resist infection and disease expression."

H.",,,555456995,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,LINCOLN,NE,68588,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2010,,,"The overall objective are the proposed projects are to improve profitability and efficiency of beef cattle production from the cow/calf phase to the finishing phase through use of alternative feeds, co-products of other industries, and management strategies. Cow/calf producers in the Great Plains region utilize native range to grow and maintain their cow herds most of the year. While some do have access to crop residues or standing hay from deferred grazing, dry cows typically must be fed hay 3 to 6 months until green grass becomes available. Hay is often times expensive; and during drought years can be in short supply. Alternative feed sources are important to the economic viability of the region. Wheat straw on irrigated fields and on dryland fields during years of abundant rainfall exceeds the amount needed for adding organic matter and erosion control to the cropland. Typically the excess straw is baled for bedding or made available to livestock as a source of roughage. However, the nutrient quality and digestibility are poor. However, as the ethanol industry continues to increase so does the availability of distillers grains, a nutrient dense, highly palatable co-product, typically cheaper than corn and protein supplements. Combined with the poor quality wheat straw, it could possibly be a viable alternative to expensive harvested forages. Beet-pulp is a co-product of the sugar beet industry and is readily available in western Nebraska. More research is needed on the possibility of using this co-product more extensively in beef cattle diets. Alternative crops such as field peas add nitrogen to the soil and may be used as supplemental sources of feed for the cattle industry cheaper than traditional feedstuffs. Determining forage intake of grazing animals is critically important to sustaining the quality and usefulness of native range. Better estimates of the forage needs of grazing pairs will allow researchers to better define animal grazing units for our forage resources, reducing the risk of overgrazing. Regardless of whether the segment in question is cow/calf or feedlot, if input costs can be reduced while performance is maintained, then the economic viability of the operation is enhanced, and sustainability is more achievable. Changes in management practices and estimated cost savings will be determined through surveys and program evaluations."

Among them, hemipterans are responsible for transmitting 55% of vectored viruses. Often, the vector insect is also a plant pest causing yield damage. In many cases, the only strategy available to control the spread of the disease is the avoidance of vector populations by the use of insecticides. This strategy poses problems such as the risk of development of resistance in insect populations, the pollution generated by pesticides and the cost associated with their use. Novel economically and environmentally friendly control strategies are possible but their development needs a deep understanding of the biology of the vector and the relationship between the plant pathogen and its vector. To develop these strategies the vector components involved in pathogen transmission, the effect of the pathogen on the vector fitness and biology or the route used by the pathogen through the vector need to be known. The development of these new strategies will result in the reduction of the use of pesticides with consequences on the environment, on farmers' economy and farmers' quality of life. These new strategies will contribute in the long term to the control of the spread of plant diseases; however, in the meantime adapted approaches to control the vector populations can be developed. We propose to aid in the development of these new adapted control strategies in vector insects causing damages to crops. Specifically, we will concentrate our initial efforts studying potato psyllids (Bactericera cockerelli) and greenbugs (Schizaphis graminum). The potato psyllid is responsible for the transmission of the causative agent of Zebra Chip, a disease affecting solanaceous. Plants infected with the causative agent of Zebra Chip show reduced yield and/or unmarketable potatoes. Questions as basic as the pathway of the pathogen within the vector body remain unanswered. In the mean time, this disease is costing millions of dollars annually. Similarly, the greenbug aphid is a severe cereal pest damaging crops worldwide. The annual cost this pest generates in crop losses and chemical control is estimated to be $250 million for wheat farmers and $125 million for sorghum farmers. Greenbugs are responsible for the transmission of several viruses, among them members of the Luteoviridae family causing Barley yellow disease. Arthropod-resistant plant cultivars exist but new aphid biotypes capable of overcoming plant resistance threatens their use. The research on the transmission of luteovirids by aphids has advanced rapidly these last years however, the involvement of any aphid proteins in virus transmission has not been identified yet. Today, genomic databases for different hemipterans exist or are being created. The use of these databases will prove essential tools for the development of new control strategies and improved diagnostic abilities. We propose to use genomic tools to identify competence factors in the two previously described systems: potato psyllid- Candidatus liberibacter and greenbug- luteovirids."

The production of grains is strictly dependent upon successful production and union of the haploid pollen and egg. A disruption in the pollen development, pollen germination, pollen tube growth and fertilization can significantly affect seed yield of crops. Recent genetic and molecular studies in higher plants have led to identification of genes affecting the various steps of pollen development. Our knowledge about the mechanisms underlying pollen development and germination control is incomplete, particularly at the biochemical levels. We have recently identified several mutants defective in various steps in pollen development in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These mutants contain defective genes encoding a receptor-like protein kinase, a novel Rhomboid-like protease and various callose synthases. We plan to take advantage of these available genetic materials and molecular probes to investigate how the process of pollen development and pollen germination is regulated at the molecular level. We will take the classic forward genetic approach to isolate new mutants defective in pollen germination control. We will conduct a systematic investigation on physiological factors that may trigger premature pollen germination in closed flowers. We will take biochemistry and molecular biology approach to purify a potent inhibitor of pollen germination from the anther tissue of flowers. A better understanding of pollen germination control and pollen viability would potentially help develop new crop varieties with improved yield and agronomic performance."

This can be achieved by developing varieties that have long coleoptiles/hypocotyls as seedlings while maintaining normal growth characteristics as adults. Our previous and ongoing molecular-genetic studies using Arabidopsis demonstrate that a specific gene family contributes to seed size and seedling emergence. The continued studies outlined in this project will lead to a significant change in our knowledge of how these genes regulate seedling and adult size.

Many of the activities carried out by soil microbial communities benefit agricultural productivity and sustainability. It may be possible to enhance the beneficial services provided by soil microorganisms through appropriate changes to root exudation by crop plants. However, the relative importance of exudate components in shaping soil microbial communities is unknown. This limitation will be addressed through comparative studies of root exudation and selection among soil microorganisms by different wheat cultivars. Repetitive planting will exert strong selection on soil microbial populations. The presence and abundance of particular root exudate compounds will be correlated with changes in soil microbial community structure and function (pathogen suppression and phosphate solubilization). Cultivar-specific effects will be explored across soil types and microbial communities. Fine manipulations to root exudate composition will test the effects of particular compounds on soil microbial communities. This work will begin to provide a foundation of knowledge about plant characteristics that are important to promoting beneficial microbial activities in soil. This information could be incorporated into crop variety development through plant breeding or genetic engineering. Reducing agricultural inputs and maximizing productivity are key to maintaining a competitive agricultural system and to ensuring the success of biofuels. The proposed work aims to reduce industrial inputs through greater reliance on microbial functioning to achieve consistently high crop yields.

Nitrous oxide has a global warming potential that is 298 times that of carbon dioxide over 100 years. Atmospheric nitrous oxide concentrations have been increasing at a rate of 0.26% per year for the past several decades, primarily due to the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Fertilizer nitrogen is also lost through soluble nitrate leaching that contaminates water systems. Reductions in the application of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers could have significant negative consequences for a growing world population given the crucial role that these fertilizers have played in cereal yield increases since WWII. Increasing nitrogen use efficiency through precision management of agricultural nitrogen in space and time will therefore play a central role in the reduction of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions. Spatially uniform nitrogen applications result in excessive nitrogen supplies for some field locations (nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions) and too little for other areas (less than economically optimum yields). Precision nitrogen management requires a greater understanding of the variability within fields and over time of factors supporting nitrogen management decisions such as water dynamics, yield, and nitrogen availability, utilization, movement and losses. The goals of this project are to (1) Develop an improved model that captures the variability over space and time of nitrous oxide emissions and related processes for complex agricultural fields under different management regimes; and (2) construct a field-scale, site-specific, decision-support tool for climate change mitigation by linking soil and crop sensor data to hydrology, cropping systems, and economic models. The Palouse wheat-based cropping region in Eastern Washington will serve as an ideal study area for this project, with mean annual precipitation ranging from 200 to 750 mm over just two counties (Whitman and Latah), substantial soil variability and hilly terrain. Intensive sampling, experimentation and monitoring will be focused on the Cook Agronomy Farm, a conservation precision farming research facility. We will also install sensors and make additional on-farm measurements at 8 additional farms spanning the Palouse. There are two major areas of innovation for this project. First, we will employ a range of innovative sensors, including: (a) infrared sensors that will continuously measure nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions in the field; (b) distributed wireless soil moisture and temperature sensor arrays; (c) a near-infrared soil probe to rapidly map soils within fields; and (d) field- and airborne-sensors to map crop growth and nitrogen uptake. Secondly, we will integrate models that represent (1) soil-plant-atmosphere interactions; (2) farm enterprise economics; and (3) watershed hydrology."

The volatile and upward trend in U.S. natural gas prices beginning in 2000 through the present day has had a negative impact on the Nation's farmers. Increases in ammonia prices have been felt equally by farmers nationwide, and as a result, this has reduced net returns of 22% in corn production and 32% in wheat production. Furthermore, increasing capital costs for ammonia production has resulted in farmers paying an additional $8 billion for fertilizer. To address these issues, Lynntech Inc., has pioneered a highly scalable electrochemical ammonia generation process that operates at much higher efficiencies and lower temperatures and pressures than the Haber Bosch Process. This electrochemical system offers farming communities the opportunity to install and run an ammonia plant customized to suit their ammonia production needs.

We recently found two specialized immune cells residing within the intestine that may regulate the sensitivity to food allergens. These are {alpha beta}-T cells bearing CD8{alpha alpha} and a specific population of {gamma delta}-T cells. In order to understand how the mucosal immunity in gut determines whether food allergy develops or not, we propose to build novel animal models of food allergy, and examine the role of specific immune cell populations in the development of food allergic responses. We will first develop a novel model of food allergy based on exposure to egg albumin and gluten, a wheat protein, which may enhance access of food allergens to the immune system. Through this novel model, we will further test the hypothesis that specific immune cell populations mentioned above regulate the development of food allergy. The rationale for this proposal is that once we know the mechanism by which food allergens develop, we can use this information to eventually develop strategies to interfere with the process. If successful, our work will provide an innovative and realistic model of food allergy development, which will allow us to develop effective strategies to treat and prevent the food allergy responses."

Examples of the impact of climate change are numerous and include: increasing CO2 concentration reduces the ability of wheat to assimilate nitrates, higher temperatures result in changes in geographic distribution of pathogens, and altered precipitation patterns increase the likelihood of short-term crop failures and long-term production declines. These constraints, compounded by increasing demand for food, and increasing costs for fertilizer, water and other inputs, require a national breeding strategy that capitalizes on innovations in plant breeding. This project brings together the barley and wheat communities to mitigate the impact of climate change on barley and wheat production. Wheat and barley public breeding programs face similar challenges and use similar technologies. A Triticeae CAP will strengthen the integration of these research, breeding and education communities and avoid unnecessary duplications. The Triticeae CAP will evaluate a broad group of barley and wheat germplasm for disease resistance, water and nitrogen use efficiency, and yield. This germplasm will include the National Small Grains Core Collections for barley and wheat and specialized mapping, association mapping, and nested association mapping populations. The same germplasm will be characterized with thousands of molecular markers to identify the gene variants controlling the different traits. Molecular markers will then be used to accelerate the deployment of the best gene variants into commercial barley and wheat varieties. Improvements in disease resistance and water and nitrogen use efficiency will help mitigate the impact of environmental changes associated with climate change on barley and wheat productivity. An expanded centralized marker and trait database coupled with extensive analysis tools will empower breeders to efficiently identify beneficial alleles and effectively exploit large volumes of data in applied plant breeding. This integrated research project will provide a problem-based learning environment to train a new generation of plant breeders and attract new students to agricultural sciences. A nationally-coordinated plant breeding education network will be used to share expertise in different plant breeding areas in the training of 29 PhDs in plant breeding. Educational programs featuring problem-based learning, collaborations with Minority Serving Institutions and social networking technology will be developed to expand the human capital needed to train and sustain the next generation of plant breeders and to attract new students to agricultural sciences."

The proposed activities directly support the goals stated in the IPM roadmap by promoting sustainable and safe IPM practices to stakeholders such as county-based Extension agents, growers, independent consultants, as well as various school-group associations. Specific activities include the coordination of numerous training programs at the local, regional and national level. Publications and on-line resources will be developed to support these efforts. Applied research will address critical pest management issues occurring in Tennessee and regionally. Research and pest monitoring activities are intended to improve the decision-making of IPM practitioners by providing recent and relevant information about pest occurrence and control strategies. The primary, expected outcome of the proposed activities is the increased knowledge and adoption of IPM in field crops and schools. Assessment tools are proposed to evaluate impact such as changes in client behaviors and to determine the value of our programs to end-users. Funding is requested for three years."

The plan will emphasize microbiologically based approaches to overcome technical constraints that impede industrial applications. Our target is to use corn stover as a model lignocellulosic feedstock for ethanol, butanol, and xylitol production. This research will focus on screening for yeast (Saccharomyces) strains that can tolerate the fermentation inhibitors typically formed during certain pretreatments of lignocellulosic biomass and developing a recombinant S. cerevisiae strain that can efficiently ferment both glucose and xylose derived from lignocellulosic feedstocks. We will develop a microbial pretreatment at the laboratory scale and a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process for production of ethanol from a microbially pretreated feedstock using the recombinant S. cerevisiae strain developed in this project plan. We will identify and characterize the fermentation stimulating/enhancing chemicals present in dilute acid hydrolyzate of wheat straw and develop an integrated SSF with product recovery (SSFR) using ionic liquid or vacuum for efficient production of butanol which is very toxic to the fermentative bacterium. Finally, we will develop batch and fed-batch fermentation processes for production of xylitol from the hemicellulosic hydrolyzates of corn stover and a cell-free enzymatic method with cofactor regeneration for its production.

The initial development of a lidar-based approach to measure plume dynamics from animal facilities will be evaluated to produce a remote-sensing approach that will be used to guide sampling methods that use point-based samplers. These data will be collected over a range of facilities and throughout the day to capture the range of atmospheric stability conditions. Air sampling methods for volatile organic compounds will be accomplished with a range of methods from sorbent tubes and canisters. These will also be coupled with methods to measure the volatile organic compounds attached to particulates. These observations will be collected in different livestock facilities. Greenhouse gas emissions will be quantified using soil chambers for a range of soil management and nitrogen management studies to quantify the emissions throughout a year. Measures of water, nitrogen, carbon accumulation, and light use efficiency will use an integrated approach that blends micrometeorological with physiological measurements. These experiments will be conducted using field-scale environments and will integrate all efficiency factors into a combined assessment. The energy balance approach used in these studies blends the fast response of CO2 and H2O vapor signals with sonic anemometers, net radiation components, soil heat flux, and surface temperature along with remote sensing to obtain growth characteristics of the crop. Studies will be conducted in the rhizotron to assess the impact of rapidly induced temperature changes on crop physiological responses under a range of soil water conditions. Accomplishing these three objectives will result in the development of agricultural practices and mitigation strategies that reduce environmental impact, while maintaining or increasing productivity. Mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions will balance agricultural production efficiency and increased carbon capture and nitrogen use efficiency. Climate change and its impact on cropping systems raise additional concerns regarding resilience of current production practices and plant adaption to those changes. Methods are needed to quantify plant-climate interaction to link field observations with simulation models for corn, soybean, wheat, and native prairie systems. Developing a long-term program to quantify plant response to climate anomalies will also establish a database for developing more resilient crop production systems. This research will enhance scientific knowledge and provide information for producers and policymakers to maintain the viability of agricultural systems."

Identify specific biochemical components in wheat that are associated with end-use baking quality traits. More specifically, to develop rapid methods to characterize proteins, which are initially important for predicting end-use quality; to determine the variation in free asparagine content in wheat, which is an important precursor for the formation of carcinogenic acrylamide during bread baking and toasting; and to identify the efficacy and impact of sulfur fertilization on end-use baking quality of hard spring wheat. Optimize methodologies for the extraction and analysis of soluble oat fiber components; determine environmental variation in the quantity and quality of ?-glucan as characterized in the first objective in newly developed high ?-glucan cultivars and other oat cultivars; and determine relationships between oil concentration and ?-glucan concentration in segregating crosses for these traits, as to how each affects groat breakage during dehulling.Approach:   Approximately 4000 hard spring and 1000 durum wheat experimental lines will be submitted by Federal, State, and private breeders, and special interest groups on an annual basis and evaluated for end-use quality. Wheat will be obtained from different generations of development in specific breeding programs, which will include early-generation, preliminary, and advanced lines and include commercial cultivars as controls. Measureable end-use quality traits include test weight, size, seed weight, sprout damage, physical evidence of disease, and protein and ash content; milling performance as a function of flour and semolina yield; flour and semolina color, protein, and ash content; dough strength properties; bread baking quality; and pasta processing quality. The Fargo Genotyping Laboratory will identify quantitative trait loci regions associated with end-use quality, primarily kernel and dough strength traits on selected hard spring wheat samples. Research will be conducted on the rapid characterization of protein extracts from wheat and flour by testing two different protein extraction methods. Variation in free asparagine content in wheat lines will be measured. The efficacy and impact of sulfur fertilization on end-use baking quality of hard spring wheat, specifically protein composition and amino acid profiles, will be determined as a function of dough strength characteristics. To develop optimized methodologies for the extraction of beta-glucan from oats, samples of oats will be obtained from replicated plots grown in diverse environments over several years. The newly developed methods for the analysis of soluble fiber quality will be used to determine how environment might affect the quality and concentration of beta-glucan, especially in newly developed high beta-glucan cultivars. Beta-glucan effects on milling quality of oats will also be tested. Because beta-glucan is in the cell walls of oats, it is thought to provide a strengthening effect, which reduces groat breakage during dehulling. However, high oil in oats also seems to prevent groat breakage, and currently breeders have been unable to separate the traits of high oil and high beta-glucan in oats. A collaborating genetics program has developed populations of recombinant inbred lines from oat crosses designed to be segregating for high oil and high beta-glucan. We will evaluate the phenotypes of these lines and test their behavior during dehulling to determine the relative roles of oil and beta-glucan in preventing groat breakage during oat milling."

(1b) Develop hyperspectral image analysis algorithms for identification of wheat kernels damaged by heat, frost, black point, and insects, as defined by official inspection criteria. (1c) Develop hyperspectral image analysis algorithms for the prediction of flour yield and break flour yield in soft red winter wheat. (2) Develop optical and mechanical methods and instrumentation for grain quality measurement that are applicable at points of sale, such as elevators, terminals, and mills. (2a) Develop rapid and objective optical methods for prediction of starch quality indicators in wheat, such as the ratio of amylose-to-amylopectin, and the identification of wheat into three states of waxiness: waxy, partial waxy, and wild type. (2b) Improve existing procedures or develop replacement procedures that serve as indicators of the level of alpha-amylase activity in harvested wheat.Approach:   Fusarium-inoculated hard red spring and hard red winter wheat samples will be imaged using an in-house near-IR hyperspectral system. Image analysis will be a multistep process. First, for each kernel a mask will be created from one of images whose wavelength creates a strong contrast between kernel and background. The mask will be applied to the images at all other wavelengths in order to remove the background. Principal component analysis (PCA) loadings from images of damaged and normal regions will be examined to identify the wavelengths at local minima and maxima, which inherently possess the greatest contrast between Fusarium damage and healthy endosperm. Hyperspectral image analysis will also be used to examine three wheat milling properties: milling yield (% straight grade flour) defined as the percent by mass of all flour fractions recovered through a 94-mesh screen; solvent retention capacity in 50% (w/w) sucrose solution, a measure of the water affinity of the macro-polymers (starch, arabinoxylans, gluten, and gliadins); and solvent retention capacity in 5% (w/w) lactic acid, an indicator of gluten strength. Near-IR spectroscopy will explored as a method for measuring the degree of waxiness in hexaploid wheat. Wild type, partial waxy (waxy null alleles in one or two genomes), and waxy samples (null alleles in all genomes), drawn from breeders' advanced lines of hexaploid wheat, will be used. Gel electrophoresis will be used to identify the waxy protein (granule bound starch synthase, GBSS) in each sample. Lastly, a near-IR procedure for wheat gluten quality will be developed in conjunction with a rheological procedure. The wheat samples consist of approximately 50 lines grown in field replicated (3x) plots over three consecutive seasons. Half of these lines are transgenic, in which the gene construct modifies the length of the central repeat region within the high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunits. Different levels of gene expression, hence, level of glutenin protein, are represented as a function of the transgenic ancestor. Thus, this set will contain a much wider range in the ratio of glutenin-to-gliadin than naturally encountered. Flour from these samples will be evaluated for glutenin and gliadin contents by SE-HPLC another ARS laboratory. At Beltsville, the flour will be scanned in the NIR and FT-mid-IR regions. Rheological properties, such as the recovery response for a gluten specimen subjected to a controlled regiment of compressive force and hold time, will be measured at a third laboratory. Spectral calibrations for glutenin and gliadin concentrations, as well as calibrations for the rheological parameters (percent recovery and recovery time constant), will be developed using partial least squares regression. Additionally, classification algorithms (PLS discriminant analysis and SVM) algorithms will be developed that will identify the genetically modified lines based on their spectral response."

Objective 2d combines key factors from Objectives 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c through the impact of grain hardness, proteins, and phenolic compounds on mold resistance. Not only do these components play a role in mold resistance, but damage to sorghum grain by mold alters hardness (thus milling and flour quality, Objective 1), biochemical properties of sorghum (thus functionality, Objective 2a, b, and c). Objective 3 aims to better understand the process of grain development in sorghum which provides supporting information for the primary Objectives 1 and 2. Objective 4 is also a supportive objective geared towards providing ?tools÷ to assist in achieving Objectives 1-3.

Manipulate swine dietary ingredients to improve nutrient utilization and reduce nutrient excretion and the emission of gasses into the environment. 2. Quantify and modify swine gastrointestinal microflora to improve nutrient utilization and reduce the emission of gasses into the environment. 3. Quantify the impact of swine dietary regimens on nutrient metabolism and immune function of the gastrointestinal tract and the whole animal in order to assess the potential tradeoffs between environmental concerns and production. 4. Exploit genetically-mediated mechanisms involved in Salmonella colonization of the swine gastrointestinal tract to reduce subsequent shedding into manure.Approach:   The impact of dietary ingredients on nutrient utilization in the pig and subsequent nutrient excretion and emission of gasses into the environment will be assessed through altering the source and level of dietary protein and carbohydrate. The protein level will be adjusted relative to the level of soybean meal and amino acid supplementation utilized in diet formulation, while the protein source factor will be accomplished by replacing soybean meal with either canola meal, corn gluten meal, or poultry meal. The source and level of complex carbohydrate will be accomplished by utilizing barley, beet pulp, distillers dried grains with solubles, soybean hulls, and wheat bran as a partial replacement of soybean meal. Nutrient retention, excretion, and gas emissions will be accomplished using animal metabolism trials and the employment of a manure storage system currently in place at the lab. Microbial ecology of the large intestine (via fresh feces) and manure, as affected by the source and level of protein and carbohydrate, will be assessed by classical and molecular methods currently employed at the Unit, using the same pigs and diets as described above. The impact of dietary regimens on nutrient metabolism and immune function will be accomplished by utilizing similarly formulated diets as above, but on a separate group of pigs, with assessment of systemic and intestinal immune system function using techniques currently being utilized within the Unit. Lastly, reduction of Salmonella colonization of the swine gastrointestinal tract for subsequent reduction of shedding into the environment will be accomplished by administration of a chemical compound to disrupt pathogen sensing, vaccination using an attenuated S. Typhimurium strain, and manipulation of crude protein levels in the diet (as described above)."

Since the majority of fresh water is used to grow food, the changing climate will challenge our food supply as drought events become more frequent and intense. Therefore, it is critical to develop a new generation of crops that can sustain productivity with reduced fresh water input. This project fills a significant gap in our understanding on how unfavorable environment perturbs seed development and ultimately affects plant productivity. Because seeds from cereals (such as rice, maize, and wheat) are the primary source of calories, and rice is an established model for cereals, this work will focus on how drought stress adversely affects early seed development in rice resulting in reduced seed size. Taking a molecular and biochemical approach, the project team will identify rice genes that are critical for normal seed development, but whose expression is altered by drought stress. This work will elucidate how seed, arguably the most economically important plant organ as food source, senses and adapts to a changing environment. This project will be important for developing future crops that are needed for mitigating and adapting to changing climate. The project will broaden participation in STEM workforce by training persons with disabilities.

Co-combustion of biomass in existing coal-fired power plants is an attractive option to increase the share of renewable fuels in the energy market. Designing equipment for these blends requires knowledge of pyrolysis and combustion characteristics to maximize energy output, reduce emissions and optimize fuel ratios. The objectives of this research are to: obtain thermal evolution profiles (kinetics and devolatilized compounds) of region-specific coal-biomass blends and probe the effect of heating rate, particle size, and coal to biomass blend ratios on pyrolysis and combustion behavior. A systematic study on locally available second generation feedstocks (agricultural wastes - woods, wheat and corn stalks, and local manufacturing wastes - cocoa shells, barley, hops, fruit pits) blended with coal used by regional power plants will provide knowledge for the incorporation of locally-sourced organic refuse into power generation, and a broader understanding of optimizing such blends for energy generation. The proposed work aims to bridge the gap between fossil fuel dependency and a green energy future while expanding opportunities for students from underrepresented groups to ensure our future engineering workforce is as diverse as the population it serves.Intellectual Merit: Given infrastructure already in place for coal, the most likely avenue in the immediate future for biomass utilization is as a blended feedstock in coal-fired power plants. Coal-biomass blending has the potential to limit the overall cost of fuel for a power plant, assuming the costs to process the biomass (transportation, drying, milling, etc.) are lower than the coal while lowering the carbon footprint of energy production. This proposal explores the thermodynamics and kinetics behind coal-biomass blend combustion to maximize process efficiency, while simultaneously monitoring devolatilized compounds to ensure the co-combustion of biomass and coal represents an improvement in the emissions profile. The knowledge garnered from this work is immediately applicable to state air resource permitting agencies, and directly addresses the EPA's debate over the next three years on how to regulate biomass emissions. The proposed work also provides fundamental data on the behavior of U.S.-specific biomass-coal blends to assist in the transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources; the design of an effective thermochemical conversion unit requires knowledge of the chemical composition, thermal behavior, and reactivity of the fuel in question.Broader Impacts: Altering our workforce to more accurately mirror the composition of our society is a gradual process, requiring strong mentors and role models. If we are broadly inclusive -seeking out contributions from all perspectives - we can solve issues surrounding energy and the environment for future generations. The potential benefits of the proposed project to society are twofold: first, by investigating the blending of biomass with coal we can potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining current energy production. Second, by actively seeking students (graduate and undergraduate) from traditionally underrepresented groups, we better leverage our human capital to facilitate a diverse, competitive and globally engaged workforce. As many UNH students choose to remain in New England after graduation, a project that specifically addresses local energy needs prepares them to understand regional issues when competing on the job market. To engage the public and industry, the students and PI will present findings from this research at academic conferences and in peer-reviewed publications, and in technical reports to assist in policy-making and industrial energy production schemes. As part of her Broadening Participation Plan, the PI proposes to implement a seminar series called  Engaging Your Future  to the science and engineering community at UNH to work with students on overcoming challenges they face as underrepresented groups, building a resume, and identifying career opportunities. As a woman with a disability, the PI is in a unique position to mentor students from traditionally underrepresented groups through building a research agenda with direct applicability today?s challenges in energy and the environment."

New sources and systems of free and coerced labor took the place of slavery, and small animal-powered plantations gave way to huge, technically sophisticated factories. The dramatic political, social, economic, and environmental changes brought by industrialization and centralization have been extensively studied. Yet the most remarkable change of all was perhaps the most subtle, a transformation of the very idea of sugar itself and what it meant for sugar to be pure. Until the end of the nineteenth century,  sugar  denoted a natural substance, something that could only be valued through the knowledge and skill of experienced individuals using all their senses and their judgment. But during the last decades of the 19th century and first decades of the 20th, this kind of evaluation of sugar's quality was superseded in commerce and production by a new concept of value, the chemical determination of its sucrose content. This dissertation explores the effect of this change in the meaning and nature of sugar and purity on the global production, labor, and trade in sugar; and how the sugar economy itself shaped those new ideas of value. Intellectual MeritThe project focuses on two particular economic and intellectual relationships: first between the United States and Cuba, the source of half of US-consumed sugar; and second between Cuba and Glasgow, which provided the heavy equipment and expertise for modern sugar factories in Cuba and around the world. By analyzing published books and journals, factory production records, correspondences, and especially legal and trade disputes, in Cuban, British, and American archives, this project will demonstrate how this shift from sensory to scientific knowledge reshaped the nature of trade, production, and the organization of work in the world of sugar. The project will reconsider commodities and processes of commodification in history. Unlike the mechanical commodification of cotton, wheat, and other well-studied examples, sugar became a globally tradable item through the standardizing power of science. This research will clarify how natural products become globally exchangeable goods, and how that process affects the people and places touched by exchanges. It will use the history of science, especially science and empire, to understand the history of global trade; conversely, it will use the history of commodities and trade to help understand how science is contested and stabilized across vast distances.Potential Broader impactsThis dissertation project will be of interest to scholars of business, economics, and trade as well as to historians of science. In addition to publishing a scholarly book and articles based on the dissertation and delivering presentations at professional scholarly meetings, the Co-PI intends to publish two articles aimed at nonspecialist audiences. These articles would use the sugar example to emphasize challenges facing all modern commodity exchanges, such as determining when dispersed producers, traders, and consumers should trust what they are buying and selling when such trusts depend on scientific measurements made on the far side of the planet."

The project emphasizes two emerging technologies RNA interference--(RNAi) and nano-structured materials--to function in concert as an antiviral effector molecule and delivery system, respectively.  Infectious diseases caused by viral pathogens account for substantial mortality in farmed Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and result in devastating financial losses.  The aim of this project is to rapidly develop highly specific RNAi-based antiviral molecules to protect individual shrimp from emerging viral infections.  These antiviral molecules will be combined with a nanoparticle substrate so that the antiviral can be delivered orally to individual shrimp during the rearing process.   The goals and predicted outcomes of this project will result in a platform system that can be rapidly adapted to respond to ever-evolving and emerging infectious disease issues in shrimp farming.  Therefore, the project has strong potential for sustained innovation and to transform disease control for this industry. The broader impacts of this project, beyond those for the partners, are economic benefits to the U.S., including the following:  1) Stable or even lower consumer prices for a high protein seafood product supplied from an industry that would dramatically increase its supply, if vaccines were available; 2) benefit to U.S. companies that export wheat and soybeans-- the two main ingredients in shrimp feeds--along with U.S. feed companies that export high tech microencapsultated larval feeds to shrimp hatcheries worldwide; 2) producers of breeding stocks of shrimp, 3) sustainable and predictable harvests for domestic shrimp producers, and 4) positioning the U.S. as the leader in the aquaculture biotechnologies needed for shrimp/fish farmers to supply future increases in demand for seafood that the capture fisheries cannot meet. Broader impacts will also be witnessed through training junior scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels in a manner that will advance their capacity to practice science in an environment of entrepreneurialism--balancing bench work and scientific advancement with the demands and timelines of business.  Trainees will benefit from academics and professional development mentoring at the lead institution and from regular interactions and time with the employees and leadership at the associated knowledge-enhancement partner companies.  Partners at the inception of the project are all part of the Knowledge Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of Iowa State University (Department of Entomology) and two small businesses: Harrisvaccines (HV) (Ames, IA) and Liquidia Technologies (LT) (Research Triangle Park, NC)."

Pawlowski (Cornell University)CoPIs: Changbin Chen (University of Minnesota), Shahryar Kianian (North Dakota State University), Jarek Pillardy (Cornell University) and Ernest Retzel (National Center for Genome Resources) The goal of this project is to generate the first comprehensive, high-density map of recombination in maize. Recombination is the main source of genetic variation in higher eukaryotes; it facilitates adaptation, purges deleterious mutations from genomes and populations, and is a major determinant of genome architecture. In addition, recombination is utilized as an unparalleled instrument of plant breeding. However, despite its importance, little is known about factors that affect the distribution of recombination events in plants and other higher eukaryotes. To understand where recombination takes place in the maize genome, the project will (1)  map the distribution of meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination using a novel chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing approach; (2) map at very high-resolution crossover (CO) and some non-crossover (NCO) recombination products for maize chromosome 9; (3) examine CO rates at several selected locations outside chromosome 9; and (4) relate maps of DSB and CO distribution will be related to local genome features, including the presence of expressed genes, chromatin modification patterns, repetitive DNA elements, and specific DNA sequence motifs.  Elucidating the DSB and CO distribution patterns, and identifying factors that affect them, will have tremendous implications for the understanding how the genome is shaped by recombination as well as have practical importance for plant breeding.Meiotic recombination generates the variation on which breeders apply selection. This research will provide breeders with information on linkage drag when introducing traits from unimproved genetic backgrounds, on how many plants are required to find segregants with desirable gene combinations, and how to develop more efficient breeding methods with smaller populations and faster breeding cycles. About one-fifth of maize genes are located in regions of highly reduced recombination rates. Developing ways to increase recombination in these regions will allow utilizing higher numbers of allele combinations in maize breeding programs, leading to more efficient breeding. This understanding will be transferable to other crop plants with similar patterns of recombination (e.g. wheat). A number of activities to enhance training of students and young scientists are an inherent part of this project, including summer internship programs targeting minority-serving and small liberal art colleges and universities. Results of this project will be available on the project website (www.rec_hotspots.org) and deposited into public repositories, including GenBank, GEO, MaizeGDB, and the NCGR database."

The enzyme RuBisCO is critical for the fixation of carbon dioxide into sugars in all plants, but its low efficiency makes it a major bottleneck in photosynthesis. To compensate for RuBisCO's low efficiency, plants with a photosynthetic process known as  C-3  (such as rice and wheat) devote a large fraction of their resources to producing the RuBisCO protein, which constitutes up to 50% of the total protein in their leaves. Unlike C3 plants, many algae have developed a means to drastically reduce the amounts of RuBisCO protein needed for efficient photosynthesis, by using a biophysical carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM). The CCM increases the carbon dioxide concentration within a subcellular compartment called the pyrenoid where RuBisCO is located, thus enhancing carbon dioxide assimilation with less RuBisCO protein.The ambitious goal of this program is to transfer the CCM from the green alga Chlamydomonas to the model C3 plant Arabidopsis, thus improving rates of carbon dioxide assimilation. The program will use a cutting-edge genome-wide screen to discover novel components of the algal CCM, including pyrenoid components. The physiological functions, localizations and physical interactions of known and newly-discovered components will be characterized by molecular and cell biological approaches, including electron microscopy and mass spectrometry. A modified RuBisCO will be developed and inserted into Arabidopsis to enable formation of a pyrenoid-like organelle. Known components and, progressively, key newly-discovered components, will be transferred to Arabidopsis and their impact on photosynthesis will be assessed. The process will be guided and supported by the development of advanced computational models.This transformative program represents a leap forward towards improving the photosynthetic efficiency of C3 crop plants, by introduction of a biophysical CCM from green algae. Additionally, the research will provide a much clearer molecular definition of the algal CCM, which is a fundamentally important yet poorly understood biological process. The research will provide undergraduate students opportunities to learn from a broad base of biological research."

A multidisciplinary approach will be implemented through collaboration of four research groups, each contributing complementary expertise: carboxysome genetics and assembly (Berkeley), chloroplast and nuclear transformation (Cornell), photosynthetic systems modelling (Illinois) and physiological and biochemical characterization of the whole plant (Rothamsted, Cornell and Illinois).   The project will allow postdoctoral and undergraduate trainees to gain experience in an international collaborative project (All). Research resources for comparing plant and bacterial genes will be developed for use in undergraduate education (Berkeley)."

A public health emphasis on prevention, early identification, and multidisciplinary treatment has been associated with a decreased prevalence and improved outcomes in individuals with SB in the US.  Despite the decline in SB births since the implementation of folic acid fortification of cereals and wheat grains in the US, there are still substantial numbers of SB births that occur each year. Although much is known about the management of SB and the multiple co-morbid conditions and complications that occur in affected individuals, there are few systematic, longitudinal studies on population-based cohorts of children or adults. In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the Spina Bifida Association of America hosted a multidisciplinary meeting to review the available research on conditions impacting the lives of individuals with SB and to develop a national research agenda. The purpose of this agenda was to identify research priorities in 16 of the most important co-occurring conditions in SB and advance research efforts to improve the quality of life of those affected, as well as to guide policy makers, educators, clinicians, and caregivers in the development of practice parameters, public policy, and public health activities that address the needs of this population. The hypothesis guiding this research is that population-based surveillance and integrated research programs are effective in determining the prevalence of disorders and establishing data on health outcomes and the types of care for these disorders. Such population-based surveillance for individual disorders is an important first step to understanding the full range of clinical outcomes for affected people. The availability of longitudinal data on these cohorts provides an opportunity to document and assess the natural history of the condition and the effects of various diagnosis and treatment strategies.  The project proposes that Arizona contribute population-based data on 3-5 year old children with SB to achieve the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Generate a population-based dataset that can describe the natural history of SB, co-morbid conditions, and related complications as baseline data in a longitudinal cohort;  Specific Aim 2: Describe the medical and social services received by individuals with SB and their families, including knowledge of prevention, and whether these vary by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. These specific aims will be achieved through completion of the following research objectives: 1. In collaboration with CDC, refine and finalize the protocol for population-based surveillance and long-term follow up of individuals with SB, building on the results of a CDC-funded pilot project currently underway.2. Identify a sample of children affected by SB using state based Birth Defects Surveillance Systems.3. Recruit children and their families for participation in the study.4. Gather data and information using a combination of methods, including interviews, survey, records abstraction, and neuropsychological testing.5. Assess the effectiveness of data collection methods.6. Assess the outcomes of the project."

Experimental site, located at the North Appalachian Experimental Watershed (NAEW), Coshocton-Ohio, and Muskingum River Watershed in Ohio. The NAEW site has ~15 small watersheds under different land management including cultivated (moldboard plow, chisel plow, disk with beef cattle manure, no-till with beef cattle manure, no-till without beef cattle manure), pasture and forest land. Cultivated watersheds, ~1 ha in size, are managed under continuous corn (Zea mays L.), corn-soybean (Glycine max L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rye (Secale cereal L.), and red clover (Trifolium pretense). Watersheds under pasture are sown to orchard grass (Dactyylis glomerata L.). Forested watershed predominantly includes white oak (Quercus alba L.) and red oak (Quercus rubra L).

Such sprouted grains seriously compromise the quality of products made from the flour produced from them, even when mixed with non-sprouted grains, resulting in large economic losses each year. The problem is pervasive and recurrent throughout those regions growing cereals brought about as a response to wet harvest conditions. The occurrence of PHS is one of the major abiotic constraints influencing the production of high quality grain, particularly white wheats. Almost 20 years ago, the economic losses due to PHS were estimated to influence the producer's revenue by an average of -4% (U.S.A), -5% (Canada and the European Union each), and -6% (Australia) per year and these losses have not been mitigated. Additionally, these loss estimates do not reflect the impact PHS has locally because the problem of PHS is widely variable year-to-year depending on the occurrence of weather conditions and can devastate production in a locale. Although there are many morphological, physiological, and environmental factors influencing PHS, a primary cause is poor seed dormancy. The long-term goal of this collaboration is to reduce/eliminate PHS through cellular reprogramming to enhance seed dormancy in cereals."

The alluvial soils commonly found in this region are highly productive, but are prone to waterlogging on a yearly basis due to their complex soil textures and physical characteristics. In a high rainfall year, yield losses in Arkansas alone can reach as high as 20 bushels per acre, with monetary losses of $50-60 million. There are two primary factors that inhibit plant growth when soils remain saturated for extended periods of time; 1) Low ATP production resulting from a decrease in root respiration and, 2) Increase in trace element availability resulting in elemental toxicity. While genetic variation for tolerance to these two abiotic factors has been reported in wheat, our understanding of the genetic control of these tolerance mechanisms in a waterlogged environment is not well defined. Our objective is to define the waterlogging tolerance mechanisms expressed in U.S. winter wheat and to identify the associated quantitative trait loci (QTL). We will achieve this by: 1) Using inductively coupled plasma analysis to identify potential elemental toxicities and tolerances present in target waterlogged environments and, 2) Correlating root characteristics and above ground physiological traits to improved yield and biomass under waterlogging and, 3) Linking these tolerance mechanisms to associated QTL using two mapping populations derived from soft winter wheat cultivars."

This proposal is aimed at elucidating the interactions between the first characterized Ug99 resistance gene (referred to as Sr35, studied by project participants) and proteins secreted by the Ug99 pathogen (effectors) to manipulate wheat defense systems. We will use new technologies for sequencing Pgt races virulent and avirulent to Sr35, and for studying regulation of host and pathogen gene expression during infection of wheat host. We will use this information to identify candidate Pgt effectors recognized by Sr35 resistance gene and their targets within plant cells. The characterized Sr35 gene will be used as an entry point to unravel molecular interactions between Pgt and wheat using protein-protein interaction assays and wheat mutants. The long-term objective of this project is to elucidate molecular processes defining the outcome of rust-wheat interaction and creation of genetic and genomic tools for developing better strategies to control this disease.

They can also poison food supplies by contributing to mycotoxin contamination. Genetic resistance is the preferred solution because of its low cost and ease of deployment but often resistance is futile. The short generation time and large populations of pathogens and pests enable them to evolve new races that overcome resistance. They similarly overcome pesticides. Many biotic threats to US crops are controlled solely by quarantine. Clearly there is a need to understand crop immune systems sufficiently so that stable, artificial immunity can be generated and deployed. In plants the natural sensors that detect infection produce weak signals but these are amplified to an effective level by a poorly understood mechanism. Our project is focused on understanding how the signals are amplified. The amplification mechanism is based on the creation and detection of specific plant peptides. We will study both creation and detection and we will validate our findings by attempting to generate stable, artificial immunity in maize to fungal infection. Validated findings should be broadly applicable to the other grass crops including wheat, rice, sugarcane, barley, oats, switchgrass, and Miscanthus."

This project will identify effectors that are common to all three rusts and find ones that are essential to them to cause disease. We will express portions of these fungal genes in wheat plants to determine if we can engineer resistance, as our preliminary results suggest. We will also use these effectors as targets to identify rust resistance genes in wild wheat relatives."

Moreover, the methods and techniques developed in this work can be applied to other small grain and specialty crops. This work will involve conducting advanced on-farm research and development that emphasizes observation of, experimentation with, and innovation for organic farms, including animal and crop production and marketing and socioeconomic issues. These issues will include identification of factors reducing yields, efficiency, productivity, economic returns on organic farms and the economic and socioeconomic contributions of organic farming to producers, processors and local communities. For both plant and animal-based organic products, we will develop, improve and evaluate allowable post-harvest handling, processing and food safety practices to reduce toxins and microbial contamination, while increasing shelf-life, quality and other economically important characteristics. Also, this project will strengthen organic seed systems, including seed and transplant production and protection, and plant breeding and selection for organic production. Goals of organic seed systems can include, but are not limited to: disease and pest resistance, stress tolerance, quality and yield improvement, and genetic mechanisms to prevent inadvertent introduction of GMO traits through cross-pollination. Our on-farm research and farm, processing, and marketing case studies will add value a) through production techniques that achieve and maintain high grain quality and b) through processing and identification of high-value varieties/landraces that are well adapted to organic management. An innovative aspect of our work is developing the information necessary to implement breeding for flavor. Another innovative aspect of our work is development of scale-appropriate production and processing options. This work is particularly appropriate for the Northeast region given the large numbers of organic vegetable farmers who are seeking to rotate out of vegetable crops without losing income. Finally, a third innovative component of the project is the collaboration among researchers and farmers in North Dakota, New York, and Pennsylvania. The collaboration will be mutually beneficial. North Dakota organic growers can provide Northeast growers with potentially highly valuable landraces of emmer and heritage spring wheats. In return, the research in the Northeast on developing cost-effective methods of dehulling and processing can be adapted for use with North Dakota organic farmers, who have been constrained in their marketing of food grains by lack of such capacity (S. Zwinger, pers.com). It is also important to note that it is not uncommon for varieties that perform well in either North Dakota or New York to perform well in the other state. In fact, North Dakota and New York have co-released both a spring wheat and a spring oat variety in past years. Consequently, the alliance with NDSU and NPSAS in this project is a natural one that will benefit both regions."

The lesser grain borer (LGB) is a devastating, long-lived pest of stored wheat, corn and other cereal grains in the US and other parts of the world. Adults and larvae are voracious feeders causing damaged kernels, insect fragments in milled products, powdery residues (frass), a characteristic pungent odor, price discounts, and possible rejection of commodity. The LGB can penetrate many types of packaging material including seed sacks in addition to sound grain. Grain production, storage, and processing are important industries. More than 12 billion bushels of corn and wheat are grown in the US each year with a value exceeding $25 billion. Additionally, over a billion bushels of barley, oats, rice, rye, and sorghum are grown each year with a value over $3 billion. It has been estimated that 5-10% of stored grain in developed countries and 35% of stored grain in developing countries is lost to insect damage. Because of the extensive reach of this insect, there is also very broad societal benefit in achieving widespread use of effective sensors for detecting the insects early. Estimates of the cost of grain loss due to insect, mold, and mycotoxin damage to the 15 billion bushels of grain stored in the US each year have ranged from $500 million to more than $1 billion. Domestic flour millers have a low tolerance for live insects: their presence signs of insect feeding can result in grain rejection. Rejection produces additional fumigation and transportation expenses, as much as 10-20% of the grain value. The foundation of a successful integrated pest management (IPM) program is an effective monitoring system. SDC declares that it can provide that foundation with its sensor device. SDC has two objectives in this proposal: 1) Modify the preliminary prototype device for LGB detection, using basic and applied knowledge, and compare its performance and efficacy with current methods in a field test and 2) Demonstrate uniqueness and the concentration levels of marker pheromones associated with infestations of the LGB. SDC's hypothesis is that specific organic volatiles can be good markers to differentiate insects infesting stored crops from other harmless emanations, e.g. gases associated with normal crop odor, or other MVOCs. Marker biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from this insect, the aggregation pheromones dominicalene 1 and dominicalene 2, are found in sufficient concentrations in the headspace in enclosures containing these insects to permit detection with SDC's highly sensitive and selective sensor device. SDC is confident that this work will result in a complete sensor device that can be used effectively to detect BVOCs from lesser grain borers, relate those BVOCs to LGB infestation size, and provide the information needed by farmers and elevator operators to take action to prevent infestation growth in our food and feed supply."

More than 440,000 jobs in the US are directly associated with the cotton industry, generating revenues in excess of $120 billion. Crop losses caused by stink bug damage in cotton have been estimated at $60 million in  bad  years. Stink bugs infested 6.5 million acres of cotton in 2006 and destroyed 151,347 bales across the United States. Damage was particularly severe in the southeastern US, with losses of 51,607 bales, 25,000 bales, and 20,488 bales in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, respectively. Due to insecticide resistance issues and limited information on basic stink bug biology, growers currently have few treatment options except blanketing entire fields with insecticides. It is imperative that pest managers develop a better understanding of stink bug biology and develop alternative management strategies to mitigate these pests. Here, we plan to conduct research that seeks to improve our understanding of basic stink bug biology and ecology, while evaluating a novel insecticide application strategy that could reduce insecticide applications by nearly fifty percent. Specifically, we plan to investigate weekly changes in stink bug population density and reproductive status within a farmscape, and determine whether stink bug populations and damage in cotton can be managed by spraying alternating strips, as opposed to the entire field. All proposed objectives will be completed by the end of the project. The experiments will be conducted in grower-owned farmscapes (wheat, corn, cotton, peanuts, and soybeans) replicated in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. We expect that new knowledge of regionally important stink bug hosts and reproductive status will be presented at state production conferences, regional scientific conferences, and in peer-reviewed journal articles. Results of the strip treatment approach will be disseminated through our statewide Extension linkages."

The research will investigate the roles of gluten composition and polymer structure in effects of temperature during grain development on flour quality. The research also will determine the roles of specific non-gluten proteins in effects of temperature during grain development on flour quality. This objective addresses a major concern of millers and bakers and explores two hypotheses: 1) changes in glutenin polymer amount, size, structure and composition as a result of high temperatures during grain development are responsible for decreases in flour quality and 2) non-gluten proteins that increase in the grain under high temperature conditions are involved in quality or allergenicity.The second objective of the research is to identify and characterize wheat proteins responsible for human intolerances and allergies that affect nearly 2% of the U.S. population and to develop methods to detect allergenic proteins in downstream products. This objective will determine whether mass spectrometry (MS) can be used to identify potential wheat allergens in flour and detect these proteins in food ingredients and products.Approach:To address the first objective, MS methods coupled with improved methods for protease digestion will be developed so that closely related gluten proteins can be distinguished. Size-exclusion (SE) chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) will be used to separate glutenin polymers into size classes for determination of subunit composition and key linkages between high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) and low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS). Gluten proteins that act as chain terminators in polymer structure will be identified and their roles in polymer structure and size will be evaluated. Polymer composition and size will be measured during grain development under different temperature regimens. The effect of different temperature regimens on accumulation profiles of a specific set of non-gluten proteins and their transcripts during grain development also will be characterized using 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Since many of these proteins may be involved in stabilizing gas bubbles in dough, experiments will be performed to test whether the levels of these proteins increase in dough liquor prepared from flour from grain grown under high temperatures. Tissue localization studies will be performed and the roles that specific proteins play in flour quality and allergenicity will be investigated using transgenic plants in which the corresponding genes are suppressed.To address the second objective, the allergenic potential of non-gluten proteins that increase under high temperature conditions will be tested using sera from patients with defined wheat allergies. MS will be used to determine mass profiles of protein fractions from wheat flour. These profiles will be examined for signatures of specific allergenic proteins. Methods will be extended to samples from baked products such as bread. Replacing 5325-43000-026-OOD (June/2010)."

We have recently cloned the major sorghum Al tolerance gene, AltSB, and found it is a novel solute transporter. The function of AltSB will be studied using a multifaceted approach including the effect of increased/decreased AltSB expression on the physiology of Al tolerance, association analysis correlating sequence and phenotypic variation of multiple AltSB alleles, and analysis of AltSB transporter properties when expressed in heterologous systems. 2) Maize represents a  plant species where Al tolerance is a complex, quantitative trait.

The average acreage planted to winter wheat and oats in North Carolina is approximately 550,000 acres with a production value of around $130m. Wheat is the most important small grain in the state. Triticale occupies a negligible acreage at present but its potential as a hog and poultry feed warrants research in cultivar development. Three public institutions and two private companies have wheat cultivar development efforts in the southeastern United States, in addition to NCSU. Private efforts in winter wheat mirrors a trend seen in corn and soybeans where investment is being concentrated in the Mississippi delta and Corn Belt states. Many southeastern seed retailers are licensing public developed wheat and oat cultivars on an exclusive basis. To better meet these needs, small grains programs at state universities in NC, SC, GA, FL, and LA formed a cooperative effort (SUNGRAINS) to coordinate cultivar development research and share in royalties. Even before these recent developments, it was widely acknowledged that both public and private cooperation was needed to provide for the needs of the commercial small grain grower and end user. The basic research on breeding methodologies and genetics conducted by the public sector can be exploited by public and private breeders to develop superior cultivars more efficiently or to develop value-added grain types for new market opportunities. The average life of a wheat variety in North Carolina is five seasons. The demise of a typical cultivar results from changes in virulence patterns of the powdery mildew and /or leaf rust fungi. There is a continuous need to provide wheat breeders with new sources of resistance to these pathogens. Four additional pathogens, Fusarium head blight (FHB), stripe rust, Stagonospora blotch (SNB), and stem rust have threatened, or caused serious economic impact, to wheat production during the past five years. It is estimated that over one half of all US wheat cultivars are susceptible to the new Ug99 race of stem rust and a major global initiative is in place to incorporate resistance into wheat cultivar development programs. We can provide new and potentially more stable resistances to these fungi by 1) continuing to introgress new alleles from wild wheat relatives, 2) pyramiding these novel genes with resistance genes currently in the wheat gene pool using molecular markers, and, 3) conduct comprehensive greenhouse and field evaluations annually on advanced generation lines for all six pathogens. A major constraint in winter oat production is winterkilling due to extreme temperatures. We can improve winterhardiness in oat by building on recent work whereby we determined the genetics and associated molecular markers for winter survival component traits."

Tolerance of abiotic and biotic stresses from seedling emergence through delivery of the final product can avoid losses of billions of dollar annually in the US. Crop plant germplasm generally contains genetic diversity that remains a rich resource for further gains in plant performance in relation to this suite of environmental stresses. Genetic determinants of tolerance and resistance traits can be located genetically and followed in plant breeding schemes using nearby molecular markers. Each marked trait determinant also provides an opportunity to develop a mechanistic understanding of the underlying genes and proteins by applying molecular cloning methods to identify the gene. Global studies of gene expression patterns and cellular-level studies further refine a mechanistic understanding of how the trait operates, and ultimately lead to perfect genetic markers of the trait. This project provides molecular markers for a range of environmental stress tolerance and resistance traits in crop plants including mainly cowpea, barley and citrus, and to a lesser extent wheat, rice, cassava and banana/plantain. This project integrates molecular markers into plant breeding programs in California, nationally throughout the US, and worldwide. This project also encompasses detailed mechanistic studies of specific stress-related genes and proteins. Mechanistic studies of some of the most promising proteins are being conducted through biochemical and physicochemical analyses.

Before we can take steps to eliminate these bitter tasting compounds, we must know what they are and how to measure them. Such knowledge will lead to new strategies for preventing, controlling or removing bitterness in whole wheat products. Elimination strategies include identifying suitable storage and processing parameters, screening of raw materials to avoid and/or remove bitter compounds, identifying optimum growing conditions, and guiding wheat breeding programs in the development of varieties without bitter taste.Obesity levels are increasing among children, particularly among those of lower socioeconomic status levels. One factor contributing to this trend may be the abundance of highly palatable, calorie dense foods. One approach to preventing obesity among children is to implement healthier eating in school cafeterias. This project focuses on how to get children to happily eat more healthy items (e.g. whole grain foods, vegetables, etc.) in a cafeteria or day care setting. Swallowing disorders, also known as  dysphagia , are associated with increased mortality and morbidity, including malnutrition, dehydration, and reductions in quality of life. An estimated 18 million adults require care for dysphagia.

The Washington State University (WSU) spring wheat breeding program is focused on improving production options, profitability and sustainability of wheat production for all four classes of spring wheat. The economic benefit of growing wheat varieties developed by the WSU spring wheat program is evidenced by their significant acreage. In total, ~50% of the 2009 and 2010 Washington spring wheat acres were planted to WSU spring wheat varieties. A single  perfect  wheat variety will never exist. Washington and Pacific Northwest production environments vary considerably across relatively small geographic distances, while four market classes of spring wheat are produced with variable end-use quality characteristics. Changing production systems, disease and insect pest problems, market preferences/end-uses, and variable weather patterns all demand a long-term integrated effort to respond to and improve yield potential/protection and grain quality. Yield limiting biotic (including stripe rust, root diseases, and insect pests) and abiotic (including heat, drought, poor fertility, herbicide carryover) stresses reduce wheat production across the state. Our aim is to provide genetic solutions to these production limitations in the form of new, high-yielding, pest-resistant, high-quality varieties. Variety development and germplasm enhancement are accomplished by conventional plant breeding breeding activities, including cross-pollination, followed by selection of superior lines and yield testing at multiple locations throughout the state. New higher-yielding wheats with pest resistance and superior end-use quality will be released to Pacific Northwest wheat growers and increase spring wheat profitability and sustainability, while decreasing the use of pesticides."

The transfer of these genes into cultivated commercial cultivars will increase the long-term sustainability of cereal production without the need for costly fungicides or the threat of pathogen produced toxins in the grain."

It is well-established that a considerable fraction of  mobile  plant nutrients is retrieved from senescing tissues, and re-distributed within the plant to surviving structures such as seeds in annul crops. This process has important consequences for parameters such as yield (late leaf senescence or  stay-green  is associated with extended assimilation of carbon dioxide and higher yield), plant nitrogen use efficiency (efficient retrieval of nitrogen from senescing leaves to seeds lowers the plant's overall nitrogen needs) and grain protein content (nitrogen contained in seed proteins is largely derived from its remobilization from leaves). A better understanding of these processes in major crops is therefore a prerequisite for continued crop improvement. Using barley as a model organism, this project strives to identify some of the molecular and cellular details controlling and regulating cereal leaf senescence. As most leaf nitrogen which can be remobilized to developing kernels is present in proteins, an additional goal is the characterization of leaf proteases, enzymes which are instrumental to prepare nitrogen for its transport from leaves to kernels. To achieve these goals, we will utilize a combination of standard and advanced biochemical and molecular tools, which are capable to characterize both the overall senescence process and specific roles for some of its molecular components. Gained knowledge will be disseminated through publication in high-impact scientific journals, but will also be shared with MSU's breeding programs, as appropriate to develop new high-yielding barley and wheat varieties with high nitrogen use efficiency."

Five major grain crops are grown on approximately 2.26 million ha each year in Arkansas with an estimated annual value of $2.84 billion. With the exception of soybean, yields of these crops in Arkansas are very close to, or exceed, average national yields (Table 1). Although crop yields for Arkansas are generally close to the national average, these yields for soybean, corn, grain sorghum, and wheat are approximately one-half of their yield under optimum conditions. In the absence of biotic limitations (such as pathogens), there are four essential resources required for crop growth and yield: (1) an adequate water and (2) nutrient supply, (3) solar radiation to drive photosynthetic processes, and (4) adequate time during a growing season (frost-free for warm-season crops) for plant development. The primary limitation for yield of soybean, corn, and grain sorghum is adequate and timely water availability. The most obvious method of increasing yield under water-limited conditions is to irrigate, and, indeed irrigation is an important aspect of Arkansas' crop production systems. For soybean, 75% of the crop is irrigated and yield due to irrigation usually ranges 30 to 50% over the nonirrigated crop. Although statistical data are not available for corn and grain sorghum crops in Arkansas, similar yield responses to irrigation would be expected. Despite obvious yield benefits, irrigation may be limited by initial costs of investment, pumping facilities, aquifer depth, quality of water, and competition of irrigation water by other crops. Therefore, there is a need to develop management systems and genetic resources that can efficiently utilize irrigation and rainfall resources for crop production. Genetic variability for all of the five major grain crops listed in Table 1 are great. Our current breeding, management, and Extension programs at the University of Arkansas are focused on using genetic resources that fit well within current management systems. Extending the germplasm pool that we use in Arkansas may be accomplished in two ways. First, high-yielding cultivars (or hybrids) may be available from other regions that can be used effectively in Arkansas for increasing utilization of specific resources. For example, using short-season crops from the northern U.S. may enable farmers in the Midsouthern U.S. to avoid late-season drought. Secondly, specific traits may be available in germplasm collections that when combined with adapted, high-yielding cultivars (or hybrids) would provide increased efficiency in resource utilization."

However, compared to corn, soybean, and wheat, the average national yield of dry bean is low (1700 lbs/acre). Abiotic and biotic stresses can severely limit both dry and snap (vegetable form) bean production. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases are the main production constraints. In the same way, some production regions are severely affected by drought, heat, soil mineral deficiencies, and short growing seasons, among other problems. Many of these diseases are seed-borne, or are caused by pathogenetically variable and sometimes emergent pathogens, and for whom chemical control can be expensive, is not practical, or in the case of plant viruses, requires resistance genes (traditional or engineered) to reduce damage. This project involves inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaborative researchers developing alternative recombination and selection methods and identification, and the use of molecular markers in bean and pathogen genomes. New Phaseolous markers will make possible efficient introgression and pyramiding of favorable alleles and QTL into improved bean cultivars for a diverse cropping system. The efficient development of such germplasm and cultivars having multiple-disease resistance and abiotic stresses, requires a team of researchers with expertise and facilities and that share responsibilities as well as the exchange of segregating populations and breeding lines that complement screening and selection in contrasting field environments, combined with expertise in plant pathogen identification, culturing, manipulation and genetic/genomic studies to pinpoint pathogenicity genes (gene for gene and other resistance mechanisms), laboratories, and greenhouses regionally and nationally."

Soybean has numerous nutritional and industrial uses due to its unique seed chemical composition. With its high protein content (40%) and moderately high oil (20%), the soybean seed is the world's main source of vegetable protein and oil. It accounts for 55% of all oilseeds produced. Unfortunately soybean suffers from both biotic and abiotic stresses, and on an annual basis it suffers yield losses worth over 2 billion dollars just from biotic stresses. Therefore, improvement of soybean for disease resistance is a major priority to protect yield, growers' income and country's export and gross national product. Abiotic stress resulting in from iron deficiency chlorosis is a major problem in Iowa and much of the upper Midwest soybean producing states. In addition to improving soybean for resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses, we will investigate the basis of insect attractants of flowers for improving cross pollination between male sterile and fertile lines for producing hybrid seeds. The project uses current molecular tools in understanding the genetic components involved in the expression of resistance or tolerance of soybean against the biotic and abiotic stresses. We will apply the new knowledge to be gained from these molecular studies and conventional breeding strategies in improving soybean for resistance/tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Similarly, we will apply a genetic-molecular approach in order to decipher the genetic mechanism of pollen attraction for improving soybean for enhanced cross pollination; and thereby, higher yield from heterosis."

Worldwide it is an important cereal crop grown for food, feed, and ethanol production. In the United States, total sorghum production ranks only behind maize, soybean, and wheat. Sorghum is well adapted to grow in harsher environments where other crops fail to thrive. Sorghum is also tolerant to many abiotic stresses that plague other cereals including heat, flooding, and drought. These traits have driven the interest in utilizing sorghum as a dedicated energy crop in the US. However, as a warm season cereal, sorghum is susceptible to colder temperatures. At present, a major limiting factor in sorghum production is low air and soil temperatures. Sorghum germinates optimally at soil temperatures of 21 degree C or greater. In the Midwest, low soil and air temperatures in the early spring greatly reduces germination, emergence, and early seedling growth. Making tolerance to cold and freezing two highly desirable traits for increased US sorghum production. Cold and freeze tolerance allows for early season planting and stand establishment allowing for multiple harvests. To date limited there is limited information on QTLs for cold and freeze tolerance a major QTL for early seedling cold tolerance hasn't been identified. Cold tolerance has been identified in several landraces from temperate regions of China. These landraces however carry many unfavorable agronomic traits along with the cold tolerance. So it is necessary to formulate a strategy to dissect and transmit the cold tolerance trait from these landraces into elite agronomic lines. The objectives of the study is to identify markers associated with various traits for early season cold and freeze tolerance and identify new germplasm sources of cold and freeze tolerance. These objectives will be studied through the cross between Tx430 (cold and freeze susceptible) and CT19 (cold and freeze tolerant) recombinant inbred lines. Phenotyping of the population will be conducted in optimized conditions of 25 degree C and Cold temperature of 10 degree c where germination percentages will be scored at seven days at optimal conditions and 14 days at cold conditions.

One aspect of this will be to find ways to Intensify cropping systems in low rainfall regions to reduce the extent that summer fallow is used in rotations. Reductions in summer fallow, especially when tillage is used to control weeds and create a dust mulch, causes extensive soil loss and is not sustainable. One approach to achieving this will be the development of wheat cultivars that perform more consistently in annually cropped systems in the low to intermediate rainfall regions. Another approach will be to identify or create cultivars of potential rotation crops, like Camelina, with low water requirements. Other approaches to increasing sustainability of inland PNW agriculture will be to reduce input costs to cereal production. Fungicides are an input cost that could potentially be avoided by breeding resistant cereal cultivars. Collectively, the Puccinia rusts constitute the most persistent and damaging diseases of the cereals. Their costs include not only fungicide applications when required, but the constant breeding that must be done to make resistant cultivars available in spite of the constantly changing pathogen populations. We will examine alternative approaches, like RNAi mediated resistance, in attempts to develop genetic resistance that will not be easily overcome by the pathogen. Root rot/bare patch disease, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, is another disease we will focus our efforts on to identify resistance and incorporate it into modern cultivars adapted to the PNW."

This is directly related to the high proportion of the American population that is overweight or obese continues to increase. Reducing the incidence of diabetes in the American population will be a difficult undertaking that will require a multifactorial approach. Clearly, diet will be one factor that will require changing if there is to be a significant impact on diabetes incidence. However, it remains unclear what changes in diet will lead to a reduced incidence. Based on population studies, greater consumption of whole grains have been associated with a lower incidence of diabetes. However, the few experimental studies of the effect of whole grains on factors related to diabetes incidence, such as insulin resistance, have used mixtures of whole grains. There is essentially no information on how individual whole grains may influence the risk of developing diabetes. The first study to be undertaken will examine the effect of different whole grains on the development of diabetes in a well-accepted animal model of type 2 diabetes, the GK rat. Whole wheat, barley, corn, and oat flours will be fed to GK rats for 5 months, a time sufficient to monitor the development of diabetes. These whole grains were chosen because they vary in their content of both viscous dietary fiber and antioxidant capacity. Sources of viscous fiber have been shown to improve glucose control in both normal and diabetic humans. Further, diabetes is well known to be accompanied by an increase in oxidative stress. Thus, by choosing whole grains that vary in viscosity and antioxidant capacity, it may be possible to identify which of these characteristics of the whole grain is important in reducing diabetes incidence. Wheat bran, a component of whole wheat, has generally been found to have little or no influence on glucose control or improvement of lipid metabolism. However, it is possible that processing methods may be able to alter the bran structure in ways that it would be more biologically active. Since bran is an inexpensive food ingredient and has a positive association with consumers, we will investigate how novel processing methods of wheat bran influence its ability to improve glucose control and lipid metabolism, using an animal model of metabolic disease, the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat. Individuals with metabolic disease often progress to type 2 diabetes. These rats developed poor glucose control, elevated cholesterol, and obesity. If feeding processed bran improves these parameters, this would suggest that adding this processed bran to foods may aid in slowing the development of metabolic disease, and therefore reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes."

The purpose of this research project is to increase crop species diversity on the Iowa farming landscape. This will be achieved by developing longer crop rotations that include summer and winter annual species as well as perennial species. Oilseed crops such as canola and cereal grains such as wheat exhibiting summer and winter annual life cycles as well as perennial legumes such as red clover could possibly fit into an Iowa crop rotation providing growers with alternative options. Additionally, the inclusion of summer and winter annual crop species in rotations increases the potential of economically viable double-cropping scenarios. The inclusion of species with different life cycles such as these can also serve to improve cropping systems by increasing the amount of ground cover throughout the year and help disturb life cycles of problematic weed species. Incorporating multiple species into a crop rotation may also improve yields of other crops such as corn and improve a farmer's economic stability."

Since 2000, winter wheat production in Wisconsin has increased by 250% and the value of production has increased 8-fold, providing an excellent source of income for Wisconsin producers (Source: USDA-NASS). In addition to income from grain, winter wheat also provides straw for use on the dairy and an excellent rotational crop for corn, soybean, and alfalfa production. We estimate that, when conditions for planting in the fall are most favorable, winter wheat acreage could reach approximately 500K acres, indicating there is still room for expansion. A key limiting factor for winter wheat production in Wisconsin is yield loss due to diseases. In both 2008 and 2009, winter wheat production was affected by Fusarium head blight (Fusarium graminearum), both in the field, and post-harvest when growers were docked at elevators for having levels of deoxynivalenol (DON), a mycotoxin, above the FDA mandated threshold level of 2 ppm.

This is significant for three reasons. First, the future effects of land use and climate change on ecosystem goods and services in the Midwest will be dominated by the response of soybean, maize and wheat agriculture. Second, the impacts of land use and climate change on the ecosystem function of the soybean-maize-wheat growing area will significantly contribute to the overall feedback of the U.S. biosphere on the atmosphere. Third, the Midwest provides a model setting in which to evaluate the impact of environmental change on both natural and agricultural ecosystems at the regional scale, with direct relevance to national and global issues. Because the Midwest U.S. is such a productive region, it has been proposed as a region for growing biomass for the production of bioenergy. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires annual production by 2022 of 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels, and demand could be higher with further climate change legislation in the coming years. Current legislation lacks detail on where biomass sources can best be produced, and there exists little understanding of the environmental impacts of large-scale land cover change for bioenergy production. My research advances understanding of how land use and global climate change combine to affect ecosystem functioning in the Midwest U.S. I use global vegetation models (DGVMs) to test the integrated effects of multiple global factors in combination with (1) year-to-year climate variability over multi-decadal timescales and (2) spatial variation in climate and soil properties at the regional scale. My research group is currently quantifying the potential effect of grasses grown for cellulosic ethanol on the Midwest U.S. hydrologic cycle. To evaluate the effects at a regional scale, we are using a model that we have developed to represent the growth of miscanthus and switchgrass: two perennial grasses proposed for use as bioenergy crops. Because we run the model over the entire U.S. Midwest and Great Plains, we are able to predict how regional variations in climate and soil will impact the productivity of these bioenergy crops. We hope to inform policymakers and stakeholders in identifying the most suitable and sustainable locations for large-scale production. We are also evaluating how future climate change might affect regional energy, carbon, and water budgets of U.S. agroecosystems by developing a vegetation model that will simulate the response of crops to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and surface-level ozone. We hope to not only predict potential changes in yield with climate change at a regional scale, but also to predict effects on water usage."

Reliance on fungicides as the primary means for control of BLB is non-sustainable and costly to growers, consumers, and the environment. The use of BLB resistant or tolerant onions would be an economically and environmentally sound component of a balanced IPM strategy to control BLB while substantially reduce use of and reliance on fungicides in onion production. SECOND Due to the biennial nature of onion, progress at transferring new traits, and creating new onion lines, can require 12 or more years. This greatly delays the exploitation of novel traits in the onion germplasm collection. The creation and use of doubled haploid lines, created from haploid cells in developing flowers, could reduce the time of line development to less than 3 years, speeding the introduction of new traits to usable onion lines and germplasm. THIRD Since each onion seed produces one onion plant, and each onion plant produces one bulb, seed production levels and onion seed availability are critical concerns, determining potential onion production. Loss of seed in onion seed is difficult to control, since the seed heads shatter easily, and the onion scapes are tall and often lodge, a tendency increased by the spread of iris yellow spot virus. Seed production of monocot grains, such as wheat and rice, were very significantly increased, resulting in the Green Revolution, by the use of dwarf genes to prevent lodging even with increased fertilizer use. The use of a dwarfed scape character in onion female lines could similarly increase attainable seed production levels, to eliminate the occurrence of seed supplies of desired onions varieties being insufficient to meet onion grower demands."

However, compared to corn, soybean, and wheat, the average national seed yield of dry bean is low (~1700 lbs/acre). In addition, several abiotic and biotic stresses can severely limit both dry and snap (vegetable form) bean production. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases are among the main production constraints, whereas drought, heat, soil mineral deficiencies, and short growing seasons, reduce productivity in many production areas. In order to remain competitive with other crops produced in the U.S., these production constraints need to be addressed. In spite of these limitations, beans are one of the most nutritious and healthiest foods, being the only item included into two different food groups in the USDA food pyramid. In addition to human health, beans promote soil and environmental health through biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen which allows beans to be produced with less N-fertilizer than other crops. Several diseases can be present simultaneously and reduce dry and snap bean yield and quality within and across different production regions. Yield losses can range from 10 to 90%, depending on the diseases involved and severity. Many of these pathogens are highly variable and new races or strains can appear in different regions. A recent example is the new rust races reported in Michigan and North Dakota. Many of these diseases are seed-borne, are caused by genetically variable pathogens, and cannot be economically controlled with chemicals (e.g., common bacterial blight). Fungicides increase production costs and can result in environmental and human health hazards if improperly used. This interdisciplinary, multi-state, collaborative W-1150 project proposal comprises several complementary sub-projects. Key collaboration among participants in these sub-projects is designed to achieve our overall goals and objectives of developing high yielding cultivars with enhanced culinary and nutritional qualities and resistance to major abiotic and biotic stresses. These cultivars will help reduce production costs and pesticide use, increase yield and competitiveness of the U.S. bean growers, and sustain production for domestic consumption and export. Researchers participating in each sub-project have complementary expertise and represent two or more institutions. This research scheme has been very successful as evidenced by the Excellence in Multistate Research Award given to the W1150 multistate project by the Western Association of Agricultural Experiment Station Directors (WAAESD) in 2009. For simplicity, these projects are grouped into the following priorities: (1) biotic stresses, (2) abiotic stresses and production/sustainability, (3) nutritional and health related benefits in the human diet, and (4) characterization/utilization of exotic germplasm."

Cornell has the only active small grains breeding program, public or private, located in the northeastern U.S. and our research contributes directly to multiple goals of Cornell Cooperative Extension. Small grains production requires minimal inputs, is environmentally friendly, adaptable to organic production and outputs contribute directly to the economic and nutritional well-being of rural communities. Since 1907, this research project has produced more than 70 small grains cultivars. An effective plant breeding research program contributes to enhancing the productivity of small grains varieties and to meeting the changing needs that are specific to northeast agriculture. Improved small grains cultivars are required for farmers, businesses, processors, and food companies to remain competitive. Improved oat and barley cultivars are critical to the NY dairy industry and NY wheat is marketed as a cash crop for processing into grocery products. Small grains production is also important to crop rotation systems, distribution of labor, and soil and water conservation. Variety development is a long-term activity that requires sustained effort over many years. Farmers depend almost entirely on our public, state-wide variety testing programs for unbiased information about varieties of wheat, oats, and barley. Season-long requirements for seed production and evaluation over multiple years and locations are required to assess adaptation and performance. The NY small grains markets are constantly changing. Consumers&#39; increased preference for healthy food products has increased demand for foods that not only taste good but also help to prevent heart disease and cancer. Specialty markets for spelt, triticale, organically grown cereals, and hard wheat have skyrocketed in recent years and new markets are likely. Locally produced farm products can result in substantial savings to the industry and to New York and help maintain local economic vitality. Without this project, there would be no mechanism for developing or testing small grains varieties in this region. New York farmers would have to depend on varieties and recommendations from other regions that do not accurately reflect New York growing conditions. Disease resistant varieties reduce the use of pesticides and cost to the producer. Winter grains prevent erosion of barren soils and redistribute labor requirements. Crop rotations with vegetables and other field crops reduce incidence of disease and insects resulting in higher yields and the use of fewer pesticides. Consumers are the ultimate beneficiaries of the outputs of this project because the results of this project are healthier, cheaper food products that are produced locally. A healthy farm economy depends on locally adapted, competitive varieties of all crops that in turn contribute to the New York state economy. Outputs link to field crops extension activities around the state. Information from this project is presented annually at field days, agent training schools and seed conferences."

They were widely used in wheat in North America for reduced lodging, high harvest index, and yield. There are other benefits that may be realized from the use of dwarf crop plants including reduction in the amounts of required pesticides and fertilizers, better water use efficiency, higher planting densities and reduced labor costs. In view of the current trends of both an increasing global population and decreasing area of arable land, increasing agricultural productivity is a mounting challenge. Dwarfing crop plants will continue to be an important component of our agricultural production systems. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms that control plant growth processes such as cell division and cell elongation will likely aid in the development of new plant varieties with reduced stature and new methods for reducing plant growth. Such new plant varieties and methods may provide both farmers and horticulturists with environmentally benign alternatives to the use of synthetic growth-retarding chemicals. We anticipate from this project to learn more about the molecular mechanisms of cell and plant size control in important crops such as maize and other monocots. Results from the project will be published in scientific journals and made available through data presentation at national and international scientific conferences."

This is a continual updated process as crop varieties and other crop production techniques change over time. In recent years, nitrogen use has become more efficient (higher yields with the same level of nitrogen). South Dakota State University has not updated it's corn and wheat nitrogen recommendations since 1993.. In addition, reports of sulfur deficiencies , especially for corn, has been increasing in the past ten years, not only in South Dakota but in other Midwestern states as well. Possible reasons for increased observed sulfur deficiencies include: 1) less sulfur in the atmosphere and rainfall from hydrocarbon energy plants. 2) Higher yields have been removing more sulfur from soil sources (both organic and inorganic sources). 3) Less overall tillage has decreased net organic matter mineralization and produced less plant available sulfur. Current sulfur experiments have not been conducted in central South Dakota where most of the no-tillage cropping systems have occurred and higher incidences of sulfur deficiency reported. Therefore, both sulfur and nitrogen recommendation evaluations are warranted for South Dakota corn and wheat producers. Standard methods to evaluate and interpret soil and plant tests will be used to determine any recommendation revisions. The evaluation will include data summaries of recent regional studies, correlation and calibration of newly developed and existing soil and plant tests and interpreting the data to produce environmentally and economically sensitive nitrogen rates for corn and wheat and economical recommendations for sulfur on corn. Expected outcomes include revised nutrient recommendations for corn and wheat. The expected impact will be plant nutrient recommendations that will give the producer greater economic returns and will have a smaller environmental impact."

Strategic benefits are to make North Dakota State University a recognized leader in research on wheat resistance to insect pests. The benefit for North Dakota is protection of wheat against the Hessian fly and fundamental knowledge about how resistance genes can be used to protect crops against insect pests. The Hessian fly is a limiting factor for wheat production in many parts of the world, including the United States, Africa, the Mediterranean, Asia, and Europe. Economic damage occurs when 5-8% of wheat seedlings are infested and when 13-20% of stems are infested. In the United States, outbreaks are sporadic rather than a regular, but almost every year there is an outbreak somewhere in the United States. The Hessian fly is present throughout North Dakota, but there are no economic data on the impact of these populations. However, to the north in Manitoba, wheat growers are becoming increasingly worried about the Hessian fly and research to support breeding for resistance is underway. In Manitoba, it is estimated that yield loss from broken stems, and the low quality seeds associated with broken stems, can be as high as 10-20%. North Dakota Hessian fly populations will benefit from the increasing popularity of no-till and winter wheat, as well as warming conditions in the autumn and spring. Since host plant resistance is the only effective control method, basic research on wheat-Hessian fly interactions is needed to make host plant resistance durable over the long term."

However, compared to corn, soybean, and wheat, the average national seed yield of dry bean is low (1700 lbs/acre). This may suggest that some market classes suffer from a narrow genetic base, or show some degree of inbreeding depression. In addition, several abiotic and biotic stresses can severely limit both dry and snap (vegetable form) bean production. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases are among the main production constraints (Beaver and Osorno, 2009, Schwartz et al., 2005), whereas drought, heat, soil mineral deficiencies, and short growing seasons, reduce productivity in many production areas. In order to remain competitive with other crops produced in the U.S., these production constraints need to be addressed. Several diseases can be present simultaneously and reduce dry and snap bean yield and quality within and across different production regions. Yield losses can range from 10 to 90%, depending on the diseases involved and severity. For example, in the Western U.S., Beet curly top virus (BCTV), Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), Fusarium root rot (caused by Fusarium solani f.sp. phaseoli) and wilt (caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. phaseoli), and white mold (caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), can simultaneously attack susceptible cultivars. Similarly, in Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, anthracnose (caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum), bacterial brown spot [caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Psp)], BCMV, common bacterial blight [caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli (Xcp) and X. campestris pv. phaseoli var. fuscans (Xcpf), Syn. with X. axonopodis], halo blight (caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola), root rots (caused by a fungal complex in most cases), rust (caused by Uromyces appendiculatus), and white mold can occur together and cause severe yield losses. The root rot pathogens cause serious problems in snap beans across all production regions. In addition, snap beans are vulnerable to regional epidemics of virus diseases including Beet Curly Top Virus (BCTV) in the intermountain west, and a new virus complex in the Great Lakes states which includes Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) in the southeast, and Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV), among others. Many of these pathogens are highly variable in many cases and new races or strains can appear in different regions. A recent example is the new rust races reported in Michigan and North Dakota (Markell et al., 2009, Wright et al., 2008). Furthermore, the introduction of soybean rust into the southeastern U.S. has serious potential implications for dry and snap bean as they are susceptible to the soybean rust pathogens, Phakopsora pachyrhizi and P. meibomiae. Many of these diseases are seed-borne, are caused by pathogenetically variable organisms, and cannot be economically controlled with chemicals."

Corn yields increased 8 fold and wheat yields tripled in the U.S. during the past century. Several studies have examined the contribution of plant breeding to this phenomenal increase in productivity, and, for both corn (2) and wheat (3), 50% or more of the increase in productivity has been attributed to genetic improvement of these crops. If we used 1920's era technology for today's corn production, the United States would need to plant over 120 million hectares of corn to meet the current annual demand for this grain. This would exceed the combined land area currently planted to corn, soybean, wheat, and cotton in the U.S. The United States has the most productive agriculture on the planet, due primarily to the collaborative efforts of our research, education, and outreach system.

Research is needed to investigate new crop species, crop varieties, and production methods, in order to help producers succeed in streamlining field operations and diversifying crop rotations. Camelina is an emerging crop in Montana, but nutrient requirements and stand establishment are constraints to production. Field experiments will be conducted to investigate the effect of N and S fertility on camelina, as well as the effect of seeding rate on camelina productivity. This will allow for the development of fertilizer and seeding rate guidelines for camelina. Canola is another attractive oilseed crop to producers in Montana; however lack of adequate agronomic information about the crop is a perceived barrier among area farmers. In field trials conducted across Montana, the response of canola to N and S fertilizer will be examined and optimal fertilizer rates will be determined. Additional field experiments will be conducted to assess how seeding date and K fertilizer will affect winter survival in winter canola stands. This will result in the identification of optimal seeding dates and K fertilizer rates for winter canola survival in northwestern Montana. The continuous wheat and wheat-fallow systems common in Montana can be modified to incorporate relatively new and high-yielding crops such as canola, as well as N-fixing legume crops such as pea or lentil. Local producers are encouraged to include these crops in a rotation, but the benefits of doing so have not been explored in many years in northwestern Montana. Field trials will be conducted with the objective of quantifying the N benefit of legume crops, and will provide information about how canola and legume crops best fit into their wheat-based crop rotations. Spring forage barley intercropped with winter forage wheat is a cereal hay combination that remains untested in Montana, but potential benefits include increased hay yield and quality, reduced fall tillage, reduced weeds, and more efficient field operations. Nitrogen management in forage systems is important due to the increased N demand, and because N dynamics influence the nutritional value of the feed. Of current interest to producers are slow-release N fertilizers, which are designed to increase N uptake efficiency. The evaluation of slow-release fertilizer in monocrop and intercropped spring barley/winter wheat forage systems will be evaluated. Research results from all projects will be disseminated to producers and extension personnel at community meetings and through extension publications. Contributions to the scientific community will be made through conference presentations and the publication of scholarly papers."

Mycotoxins in grains processed for biofuels become concentrated in the solid byproduct known as distillers grain (DG), an important source of supplemental income for biofuel producers, and mycotoxin contamination is a major concern. For grain buyers and food processors, the primary need is a reliable method for rapid assessment of grain quality pertaining to mycotoxins and mycotoxigenic fungi. The worst-case scenario for these stakeholders is to own millions of bushels of corn contaminated with unacceptable levels of aflatoxins and fumonisins, or of wheat with excessive concentrations of deoxynivalenol (DON). Additionally, these stakeholders need cost-effective methods to predict, monitor, and minimize mycotoxin production in the field, and to detoxify mycotoxins and prevent further deterioration in contaminated grain. The lowering of tolerance limits for mycotoxins in overseas markets has increased the burden for grain buyers and food processors; currently, levels of mycotoxins that are acceptable for some US products are unacceptable in European and Asian markets, resulting in non-tariff trade barriers. Finally, workers who are responsible for animal and human health need information about the toxicity, carcinogenicity, modes of action, and biomarkers of exposure and disease for all categories of mycotoxins. To address these needs, the objectives of this project are to 1) Develop data for use in risk assessment of mycotoxins in human and animal health, 2) Establish integrated strategies to manage and to reduce mycotoxin contamination in cereal grains and distillers grains, and 3) Define the regulation of mycotoxin biosynthesis and the molecular relationships among mycotoxigenic fungi. Methods to be used include evaluating structure activity relationships (SAR) and investigating cell, tissue and whole animal responses at the biochemical, physiological and structural levels, creating molecular techniques to develop methods to monitor mycotoxigenic fungi and test new and old technologies designed to destroy mycotoxins monitor and predict their production in the field, and functional genomics. The outcomes derived from the work outlined in this proposal will contribute towards the overall goals of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). Results will have a major impact on government decision-making by providing a better understanding of how various environmental and food processing components affect mycotoxin biosynthesis, advance detection technologies that can be used by public agencies, and by private diagnostic labs to provide mycotoxin analysis services to food industries, and create new basic knowledge that can be incorporated into new management strategies to help grain growers minimize mycotoxin contamination."

However, the global economy and our daily life are dependent on the consumption of fuels. In order to maintain a sustainable local, regional, and global development, many countries including the United States are exploring renewable energy sources to meet their fuel and energy demands. Biofuel is a promising renewable energy source because it is sustainable and environmentally-friendly. Currently the most commonly used biofuels include biogas, bioethanol, and biodiesel. Biogas is normally produced from organic waste materials such as animal manure and organic municipal and industrial wastes. Bioethanol is produced mainly from sugarcane and corn. However, biofuel is taking only around 3% share of the energy consumption in the US. To substantially replace fossil fuel with biofuel, we need to tremendously increase our biofuel production capacity. Currently, bioethanol produced from corn is a major biofuel on the US market. However, significantly increasing corn ethanol production is not practical because of its competition for limited crop land against food and feed production. Biogas and lignocellulosic ethanol are promising biofuels to meet the tremendously increasing demand on the market and by regulations. In this project, biogas production from animal manure and agricultural residues (corn stover and wheat straw) or switchgrass will be investigated for feasibility and enhance yield, conversion of lignocellulosic materials such as corn stover, wheat straw, and switchgrass will also be studied in this project. Biogas (a mixture of approximately 70% methane and 30% carbon dioxide) is usually produced through anaerobic digestion of organic waste materials. The technology has been widely used in Europe and Asia for biofuel production. However, it has very limited applications in the US. In this country we have a tremendous amount of animal, crop, and wood wastes that can be converted into biogas or bioethanol. It is critical to develop low-cost and high-efficiency technologies for the conversions. In addition, value-added products from animal wastewater treatment will be developed to recover the nutrients from the wastewater. In our previous and ongoing studies, we have found that duckweed can be used for efficient nutrient recovery from swine wastewater. The focus in this project will be on the development of value-added products from the duckweed. Potential duckweed products include organic fertilizer, animal, poultry, and fish feed, and biofuel."

Our work focuses on understanding how and why the fungus infects these grains, how it survives through the winter and how it reinfects in the spring. We use studies of gene expression and genetic manipulation to determine what factors are important to the fungal life cycle. Knowing what structures are used to survive year to year and to produce inoculum allows us to develop novel methods to reduce the impact of the disease cycle."

K.",,,555456995,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,LINCOLN,NE,68588,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2011,,,"Semi-arid climate of western Central Great Plains of the USA (western Nebraska and Kansas; eastern Colorado and Wyoming; and south-western South Dakota) is one of the most challenging environments for profitable crop production in the USA because of short growing season, dry climate, limited precipitation, high elevation, and occasionally severe hail. Majority of cropland is dryland and winter wheat is the major crop in this area. Diversifying crops in the farm can enhance the economic viability of producers and provide new market alternatives. Therefore, alternative crops that are suitable for dryland and limited irrigation production are important for sustainable farming in the region. Proso millet is the best alternative crop in the region due to its less water requirement and well adaptability. However, proso acreage is limited due to its primary use as birdseed and extreme price volatility in the market. Alternative use of proso millet (e.g. fuel, food) would increase its value and acreage. Because of narrow germplasm base of proso millet cultivars, genetic improvement of existing varieties and development of new proso millet variety with novel traits for new use will be critical. Camelina is an old oilseed crop newly introduced to the semiarid west of the United States and it is a promising spring-sown rotation crop in the region due to its excellent seedling frost tolerance and short-duration. A number of unique traits (e.g. low input crop, improved drought tolerance and water use efficiency, high oils ~35% content, limited culinary uses etc.) make camelina as a high-potential oilseed crops for biodiesel feedstock compared to other oilseed crops. There is limited research on developing improved camelina varieties well adapted to the western Nebraska. Annual forages are well adapted to the semiarid Northern Great Plains environments. Replacing summer fallow with annual forages may be an effective cropping system for improving soil quality and increasing economic returns. Annual legume with forage potential is desirable because it can be used as forage as well as to improve soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation but currently no such annual legume is available that is well adapted in the region. Outcomes/Impacts: It is anticipated that several new cultivars will be released from this program with improved adaptation and value for regional producers. Progress related to growth in alternative crop production in the region will be monitored by Nebraska Department of Agriculture Statistics. An ethanol-based market of proso millet has the potential to enhance the regional economy, to minimize its market volatility, and to increase wheat yield. Production of large acreage of oil-seed in the region will encourage development of local bio-diesel plant. All these efforts will help making agriculture in northern High Plains sustainable, which indirectly will sustain rural economy in Nebraska."

With the increased awareness of the importance of whole grains in the diet, food companies have become increasingly interested in adding more whole grain foods to their product lines. This project will focus on: 1) developing wheat varieties with a) improved properties for use in whole grain bread production and b) superior quality for processing into value added products with health benefits; and 2) improving the stability of whole wheat flour against storage related rancidity. METHODS. 1a: Whole Grain Bread Production. Endogenous lipase and lipoxygenase activities and exogenous xylanase activity will be quantified on different wheat varieties. Bread will be made according to approved methods except that xylanase will be added to the dough at the level recommended by the manufacturer. Correlations between enzyme activities and bread quality parameters (loaf volume, hardness, crumb uniformity) will be determined. Varieties that exhibit optimum lipase or lipoxygenase activities or susceptibility to xylanase hydrolysis will be selected. Crosses will be made between these lines and well adapted lines using traditional wheat breeding techniques. The progeny of these crosses will be evaluated as above. 1b: Value Added Products from Wheat. Wheat varieties that contain insoluble arabinoxylan with high susceptibility toward xylanase hydrolysis will be selected from the results in 1a. The bran will be incubated with xylanase to produce soluble oligosaccharides with health benefits. A response surface design will be used to optimize substrate concentration, enzyme concentration, time, temperature, and pH. 2: Improved Stability of Whole Wheat Flour. Wheat will be milled and then salts used in baking (e.g., ferric sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, calcium propionate, sodium chloride) will be dissolved and applied evenly over the feed fraction. Samples will be stored for 181 d and free fatty acids and conjugated dienes will be measured during storage. The results will be compared to untreated whole wheat flour prepared in a similar manner. ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES AND EVALUATION. Major outcomes from this research will be: 1a) identification of new quality parameters for wheat related to whole grain baking quality and the eventual release of wheat lines that are tailored for whole grain bread production; 1b) elucidation of parameters to increase yield of feruloylated AXOS from wheat bran for possible commercial production of these healthy prebiotics; and 2) whole wheat flour with a longer shelf life than currently realized in the industry. These outcomes will be communicated to wheat producers and available to the public online. Objective 1a has potential for release of new crop varieties. Objectives 1b and 2 have potential for the production of new intellectual property in the form of production process for the production of feruloylated AXOS or a stabilized whole wheat flour. After protection of intellectual property, if necessary, research results will be published in refereed journals and presented at national scientific meetings."

The fungus Fusarium graminearum is incapable of spreading in wheat without the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON); strains that lack DON are effectively harmless. Resistant varieties of wheat do not respond to DON - or F. graminearum - but may be susceptible to other pathogens, or lack optimal qualities for food, flour, etc. The exact plant genes responsible for DON response or resistance are not known. This research addresses the dialog between fungus and plant during the early stages of infection: what signal from the plant turns on DON production What genes in the plant respond to DON to let the fungus infect or, in resistant plants, to keep it from spreading By examining gene expression at the time of initial infection and the 72 hours afterwards, in wheat varieties that differ only in Fusarium resistance, we can identify the wheat genes that respond directly to the fungal toxin. These individual genes can then be evaluated one by one for their role in disease development, and may be used in very specific, targeted breeding programs to introduce one or a few disease-resistance genes into plants possessing other desirable characteristics. Whole-genome microarrays, a technique showing the expression of every gene in a genome for a given gene or set of conditions, will be used to identify wheat genes of interest. It is necessary to use a whole-genome technique, as it is not known what wheat genes are involved. The presence of the fungus, and toxin gene expression, will be monitored by qRT-PCR, a technique that allows quantification of the expression of individual genes where they are known. Toxin production will be confirmed by the use of a commercial kit for DON detection and quantification."

In recent years, and particularly during the U.S. financial crisis, the convergence between futures and cash prices has been of concern to decision makers in the grain industry. The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), for instance, submitted its views to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2008, stating their concerns about  effective performance of futures exchanges as mechanisms for price discovery and risk management.  The AFBF's concerns were extreme price volatility, expanding and volatile cash/futures basis relationships, and the difficulty hedgers have of meeting margin calls (margins are the deposits farmers must keep with brokers to offset adverse futures market price movements). The AFBF expressed its belief in the importance of the functions of futures markets but requested more disclosure and transparency around the composition of traders in the markets and their impact on the price discovery and risk management function of futures markets. These concerns bring forth research questions of interest to the grain industry in Louisiana. Numerous questions arise, and some that are of immediate local interest are: is the convergence of cash and futures prices reliable Are basis forecasts reliable How useful are basis forecasts in setting local cash prices What is the dynamic interaction between speculative activity and price volatility Local grain elevators provide sellers of grain crops (producers) bids for various crops such as wheat, corn, soybeans and grain sorghum. Conditional on historical bid-offers, what are the chances that a producer will be offered a better bid This project proposes econometric and statistical models to provide a quantitative answer to such questions. This information would be beneficial to the local grain industry in understanding price discovery in futures and their usefulness in setting local prices for their grain crops."

Since it is fall-seed and is typically produced on no-till acres in drier portions of the region, winter wheat in crop rotations helps conserve soil, moisture, and waterfowl nesting habitat. Interest in the development and release of new winter wheat cultivars remains high, particularly because new cultivars are necessary for sustaining production and for expanding winter wheat production in the state and region. The winter wheat breeding program at South Dakota State University is geographically uniquely positioned to continue developing the necessary cultivar adaptation and pathogen/pest resistance for the state and region. Since winter wheat production in the state is at the interface of the southern and northern US winter wheat production region, South Dakota producers can slow the establishment and progression of pathogen/pest epidemics if the cultivars they grow express sufficient resistance. Outcomes are expected to be 1)the development and release of winter wheat cultivars and germplasm adapted to the state and region, enabling expansion of the production area and, 2)development and release of winter wheat cultivars and germplasm resistant to emerging state and regional pathogens/pests. Public-private partnerships in wheat breeding are being formed to augment traditional public winter wheat cultivar development programs and to assure the training and education of next generation plant breeding students. Outcomes are expected to be 1)more graduate students interested in plant breeding careers and understanding the scientific basis of the discipline and, 2)the graduation of students prepared to efficiently function in a career as either a public or private plant breeder."

Zero N fertilizer plots will be used to determine if any of the soil N liberated by the analytical methods correlates with the plant's total N accumulation and grain yield. The N fertilizer rates will range from low to high in six incremental steps. Measurement parameters will include grain yield, grain quality, dry matter production, total nutrient uptake and lodging. Objective B: Greenhouse Studies: A series of greenhouse studies will be implemented to determine the optimum height and growth stage for sensing cereal crops in the Delta region of the Midsouth. Comparison of NDVI values with plant TN uptake as well as other indicators of crop nutrient status, such as chlorophyll meters, will be conducted to determine the ability of these technologies to correlate with crop response.

There is high potential to provide multiple benefits including: more income for local farmers resulting in preservation and enhancement of the rural economy and environment, lower cost fuel ethanol in the region, co-production of barley distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS), a protein rich product with potential uses in food and feed industries, and increased production of high-valued biomass. Growing need for domestic energy independence, banning of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and policy in the Renewable Fuels Standard has led to a major expansion of domestic fuel ethanol production. Barley is a $6 million industry in Virginia and ranks 11th among agricultural crops (VASS, 2008). Value of the barley industry stands to grow tremendously as a viable barley-to-ethanol industry develops that will purchase over $70 million of barley in the region. Wheat and barley are also valuable to Virginia farmers because of their ability to grow on soils with less water holding capacity than that needed for corn; and they are winter annuals that grow during the fall, winter, and spring months, when evaporation is lowest. Research that will enable farmers to produce these grains more economically and to garner more value for grain is, therefore, important to Virginia."

Little work has been done on the fate of this chemical with respect to soil and plant uptake, which may occur after swine manures are applied as fertilizer. A greenhouse experiment will be used to quantify the uptake of ractopamine in wheat and alfalfa, which are both foods fed to livestock.

Reclamationists and weed control agents in Wyoming need guidelines for using C-rich amendments available from farmlands and forest management practices near energy extraction sites. Forest and habitat managers also need information on whether they can promote use of woody waste materials for reclamation.

This prompted the agricultural industry to look for alternative agronomically feasible and sustainable cropping systems. Diverse no-till continuous cropping systems were adopted by growers in the region. However, shortage of soil moisture continues to be a major limiting factor in continuous, no-till cropping systems. Winter wheat in continuous cropping systems with no fallow phase yields lower than winter wheat in the conventional fallow. Alternative crops in continuous cropping systems have not performed consistently over the years due to adverse soil moisture conditions. The relatively low crop yields along with high input costs render the cropping systems unprofitable forcing producers to look at other tools to manage no-till cropping systems. Cover crops offer a wide range of benefits including reduction in dependency on nitrogen fertilizers, prevention of wind and water erosion, weed suppression, improving water retention, and increasing soil carbon. Cover crops have not been tested for their effectiveness as substitute for conventional fallow in the drier environment of western South Dakota. Legumes fix nitrogen and introducing legume crops in cereal-based rotations may offer an opportunity to reduce fertilizer costs for growers. Research results from wheat-legume crops rotational studies show that effects of legume crops on the subsequent wheat crop vary depending on the crop, location and year. Oilseed crops in South Dakota have traditionally been used as vegetable and industrial oils, spices, and bird feed. Non-food oilseed crops targeted for the semi-arid and arid agro-ecozones of South Dakota have the potential to transform the economy of the region. Biofuel feedstock crops grown in rotation with cereal crops have potential to increase sustainability and reduce weed and disease problems. Availability of locally grown feedstocks will help to expand the oilseed based biofuel industry in South Dakota. There has been limited research done in the drier regions of South Dakota to evaluate alternative oilseed crops. Integrating annual forage crops into the predominantly wheat cropping systems using no-till technology would shorten the fallow phase in the cropping system, improve water use efficiency, and increase forage production in the region. This project will evaluate alternative cropping systems that include cover crops, legume pulse crops, oilseeds and annual forages for their effect on soil quality, soil water storage and long term productivity. We hypothesize that use of cover crops, annual legumes or short season annual forages in the rotation will improve soil moisture and soil quality, and lower demand for inorganic nitrogen fertilizers and ultimately enhance sustainability of the cropping system. Other anticipated impacts include reduction of land under fallow and diverse cropping resulting in reduction in disease and insect pests&#39; carryover from year to year resulting in reduction in pesticide usage."

Typically it is available in late fall, winter, and early spring, when other forage sources are low in quality and quantity. Both stocker cattle and mature animals can effectively utilize wheat pastures. Typically, stocker cattle have daily gains of 0.7 to 0.9 kg. Livestock producers use wheat pastures because it is generally a high-quality forage and costs of gain on wheat pasture are often lower than those of a conventional backgrounding program. Wheat producers use wheat as pasture because it may be the most profitable use of wheat. Even though crude protein content of wheat pasture is high. A big proportion of crude protein in wheat pasture is highly soluble and a large amount of nitrogen may be lost in the rumen before reaching the small intestine. The quantity and quality of protein reaching the small intestine is influenced by ruminally undergraduate intake protein and microbial protein synthesized in the rumen. Approaches to improve the productivity of cattle grazing wheat pasture might include technology that improves the amount of protein reaching the small intestine for absorption by increasing the amount of ruminally undergradable intake protein and/or the synthesis of microbial protein in the rumen."

In addition, other Poaceae species including Miscanthus and switchgrass are being considered for biofuel feedstock production due to their lignocellulosic biomass production. Major increases in the yield, quality, and disease/pest resistance of maize, wheat, and rice have occurred in the last 50 years due to conventional breeding, improved agricultural management practices, and transgenic technologies. However, to meet growing worldwide food and potentially biomass needs, production needs to be further increased. One approach to improve breeding practices is through accelerated or targeted breeding approaches such as marker assisted selection which relies on molecular markers to facilitate selection of improved lines in a breeding program. With the advent of genomics, including next generation sequencing technologies and bioinformatics, genome sequences and molecular markers can be generated in not only a high throughput but also in a cost effective manner. Providing data and research tools to plant breeders and biologists that enable genomic-based plant breeding will be essential to improved agriculture in the 21st century."

Examples of unmodified polysaccharides are starch of corn, wheat, gum arabica, gum tragcanth and gum guar. Modified products may be carboxymethylated polysaccharides or polysaccharides hydrolyzed by acids, alkalis or enzymes. In addition to being renewable and sustainable, agriculturally sourced bio-based polysaccharides and modified products obtained from them have the potential and properties to satisfy all requirements for good polymeric textile printing thickening agents. Because they are also widely available, they are economical as well. By 2015, worldwide production of printed textiles is projected to be more than 30 billion square meters. Traditional textile printing methods such as direct printing, resist printing and discharge printing account for more than 90% of the global market for printed textiles. Therefore, the potential market and hence economic impact of agricultural products as polymeric bio-based thickening agents is immense. The proposed project will study agriculture products for their potential to be used as natural polymeric thickeners in textile printing applications. For the two year duration of this project, focus will be aimed towards polysaccharide sources that are abundant in Colorado and the western region of the country. These include wheat, corn, sorghum and proso millet. Additionally, literature survey indicated little or no research on sorghum and proso millet as potential sources for bio-based polymers in textile processing and therefore particular attention will be directed towards these agriculture products. Nationally, Colorado ranks 1st in production of the proso millet crop. The most common market for proso millet is bird seed and animal feed. Finding alternative additional markets for such agriculture products will be potentially more profitable than current uses such as animal feed and bird seed."

Abiotic stresses are drought and heat. Biotic stresses include both diseases and insects. In the high plains, Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV), and greenbug, in addition to drought, are major problems (USDA-NASS, 2010). In the south of Texas, wheat rusts, powdery mildew, and heat are major factors that limit yield. At times, Russian wheat aphid (RWA) and Hessian fly can be severe problems throughout the state. Because of these biotic and abiotic stresses, variety improvement and yield enhancement in Texas is extremely challenging. Because pathogens evolve with host resistance genes, single major resistance genes, may only be effective for a few years. Therefore, slow rusting resistance genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) for adult plant resistance to several diseases have been identified and incorporated together with single genes (Singh et al. 1993). Biotypes of insects keep changing too. Greenbug biotypes changed from A to E, I, and K (Weng et al. 2010) and RWA changed from 1 to 2 (Haley et al. 2004). New Hessian fly biotypes have defeated resistant sources in eastern soft red winter wheat regions (Cambron et al. 2010). This situation pushes researchers to keep searching for new sources of resistance and new genes in currently available sources of wheat or its relatives. Compared to disease and insect resistances, drought and heat tolerance are more complicated. The measurements of physiological traits under drought and heat conditions are not always reliable due to unstable environments and the limited accuracy of equipment. Scientists have worked hard to identify traits or parameters that are highly correlated with drought and heat tolerance and use them as a measurement of tolerance to abiotic stress. In recent years, progress in wheat genetic and genomic research has been accelerated due to improved techniques and readily available information. In addition to abundant expressed sequence tag (EST) sequence, DNA array technology (DArT) markers, and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, high throughput single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers have been designed and are currently being used (Chao et al. 2010). As most available SSR markers are not very diagnostic for specific genes, SNP markers offer promising results, with increased efficiency and accuracy. With improved understanding of the wheat genome and new molecular techniques, the process of developing superior germplasm lines and adapted cultivars can be sped up. This project will deploy both precision phenotyping and molecular techniques to characterize mechanisms of abiotic and biotic stresses. Molecular lab, growth chamber, greenhouse, filed experiments will be conducted to identify and validate diagnostic markers linked to target genes/QTL controlling important traits. Germplasm lines containing multiple favorable traits including high yield and god end-sue quality will be developed."

Though agricultural commodities contribute significantly to the state economic wellbeing, it has become apparent that it is not sufficient to focus solely on production aspects alone. The ability to increase the value of raw agricultural commodities represents a key component for continued economic growth and development. In fact, value-added processing of agricultural commodities by the food industry accounts for approximately half of realized profits across the entire food distribution system. Thus, a greater proportion of the total market revenue is retained within the state by processing raw agricultural commodities into value-added products. The long-term sustainability of production agriculture and, to a significant degree, the state economy are linked to maximizing profitability from the state's agricultural commodities through value-addition to enhance competitiveness in both domestic and global markets. The proposed work will contribute both fundamental and applied research needed to support production of value-added products from wheat and potato commodities. For potatoes, research efforts will focus on technology that fosters development of potato-based products that could potentially lower incidence of chronic disease (i.e., type II diabetes, heart disease, etc.) and promote digestive health. In regard to wheat, the proposed research seeks to elucidate key factors necessary for creation of modified wheat starch products (i.e., functional biopolymers) with enhanced and/or novel functionalities for use in food and industrial applications. This approach is intended to provide new opportunities for wheat and potato products, and if successful, could allow US growers and processing industries to continue to expand and diversify into market areas that are presently inaccessible."

Shorter rotations open opportunities for a bevy of pest issues. Since peanut and soybean are both legumes and have similar disease problems, it is not recommended to include them in the same rotation. When comparing the acreage of the four most relevant summer agronomic crops in GA, the combined peanut + soybean acreage must stay at a certain fraction of the combined cotton + corn acreage in order for three or four year rotations between legumes to be sustainable. Therefore, alternative cropping systems for peanut must be investigated to alleviate such pressure and be able to maintain maximized yields and profits with minimized pest incidence and costs. Wheat acreage can also affect availability of peanut acreage. A double crop of wheat followed by peanut may be possible, but this puts peanut planting beyond the recommended planting window, which interferes with other crop planting activities, and creates a risk of peanuts not reaching full maturity when cool fall temperatures set in. Research is needed to determine how to distribute available acreage with proper rotations. The availability of research-based scientific decision support tools in peanut agronomics is lacking. To maximize yields and profits and minimize losses to pest outbreaks and input costs, growers need fast answers to questions. County agents and extension specialists need data to defend or alter current recommendations to be relevant with current cultivars available, which is what this project is designed to provide, centered on four primary objectives: I. Peanut cultivar response to agronomic practices. II. Managing cover crops for improved timing and sustainability. III. Fertility and nutrition issues for peanuts and preceding or succeeding crops. IV. Long-term rotational systems for effective and efficient land utilization. The most important factors in reducing input costs are agronomic management strategies, which are often the easiest strategies to implement. In peanut production, highly influential effects on yield and pest incidence include cultivar selection, tillage management, row pattern, seeding rate, cover crop selection and management, and soil conditions/plant nutrition. However, new cultivars are released each year with varying growth habits, pod and seed size, hull thickness, fertility requirements, and vegetation characteristics, which cause different responses to various combinations of these factors. Therefore, it is imperative to test new cultivars upon release to determine those that have greatest potential for seed increase and those less likely to improve on what is commercially available. So, experiments will be conducted to maximize peanut production with minimized inputs to improve farmers' profitability based on the variables listed above."

In cereal grains, the mature seeds are mostly composed of endosperm that is biologically and economically important. In all angiosperms, endosperm provides nutrients and signals to the embryo during seed development and germination. The economic significance of cereal endosperm is its high composition of carbohydrates and proteins, which is an important source of food, feed, and industrial raw materials. Approximately 50% of human calories are derived from cereal endosperm, either directly or indirectly through animal feed. Furthermore, cereal endosperm is used as a raw material for numerous industrial products, including ethanol. Maize is the most important staple food with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one fifth of the calories consumed by large proportion of world's human population. Maize has a long history to be used as an excellent model system for genetics which studies the DNA variation in genes and the regulatory sequences leading to changes of gene expression. Compared to genetic variation, epigenetic modification is another layer of regulatory mechanism that controls gene expression through the chemical modification of chromatin states, such as DNA methylation or histone modifications, without altering the DNA sequences. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the maize endosperm development, and identify the important genes regulating the developmental process. Therefore, the genome-wide identification of the important genes controlling maize seed development will fundamentally advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and will benefit the improvement of grain yield and nutritional quality. In this proposal, we will use a modern biotechnology called Next-Generation high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate the activity of all the 50,000 genes in maize and identify the genes carrying important regulatory chemical modification during the development of maize seed. By analyzing the highly integrated biological data produced in this project, we will develop a series of computational models and algorithms to identify a set of important genes called  transcription factors  that regulate the biological processes of seed development. All these genes and the tools will be implemented as a database, so that the agricultural biologists and the interested researchers can access the data, and select the genes for the bio-engineering experiments. The genes playing similar roles will be also identified in wheat, rice, barley, and other important crops using computational methods and a variety of bioinformatics software. The important genes and knowledge obtained from the proposed experiments can potentially be applied to other cereals and has the promise of guiding further efforts to enhance endosperm content and quality in crop plants."

The efficiency in resource use lies not only in meeting the requirements but also in maintaining quality such that current as well as future generations will benefit. Irrigated agriculture is one of the major consumers of water in the nation and there are increasing concerns about the water quality impairment of rivers, streams, lakes and aquifers due to agricultural activities. In much of the western United States where groundwater is used for irrigation, the imbalance between aquifer recharge and depletion calls for the development of improved methods of irrigation scheduling and water conservation. Furthermore, climate and land use changes have substantial impact on water resources management. The increasing demand for biofuels over the last decade has induced major changes in land use across the nation. In addition to changes in land use, more acres of row crops such as corn, sorghum, barley, wheat and sugarcane are dedicated for bioenergy production. Some of these row crops require more irrigation and fertilizers than conventionally grown crops and this land use change has direct implications on water resources availability and water quality. To ensure a sustainable bioenergy industry, the environmental, hydrologic and economic impacts of land use changes will be investigated and measures for mitigation of negative impacts will be evaluated. Modeling and field experimentation are complementary to each other, and if used together, they can lead to better understanding of the ecological and hydrologic processes that occur in agricultural watersheds. Hydrologic and water quality models together with reliably measured/estimated input parameters will be used to better understand the watershed processes and suggest strategies that conserve water resources and improve groundwater quality."

In 2007, North Carolina growers spent over 228 million dollars for pesticides. Similarly, North Carolina growers spent over 376 million dollars for soil amendments such as fertilizer and lime. Any management practice that increases the ability of a crop to compete with weeds will likely result in economic gains for North Carolina growers. Effective weed management programs integrate all components of the production system. Understanding how soil fertility influences weed management will benefit farmers trying to manage weeds and result in greater economic returns. The impacts of soil nutrient availability on crop growth and yield are important considerations in any cropping system. The recent increase in fertilizer use combined with restricted supply has resulted in a large increase in price for fertilizer inputs. Understanding nitrogen utilization by weeds in cropping systems will quantify the losses due to weeds and provide solutions which will enhance soil amendment utilization by the crop. The land base for perennial biomass energy crops will likely be similar to the Conservation Reserve Program. North Carolina has 127,835 acres of CRP land. At a value of $50 per ton, the economic potential for switchgrass production in North Carolina is $53.7 million annually (127,835 acres x 8.4 tons per acre x $50/ton). Currently, successful establishment of species is hampered by limited regional data pertaining to the best planting date, tillage and seeding practices. Weed competition and weed management in the establishment of bioenergy crops in North Carolina is important to the future of this industry. Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth is wide-spread across the Coastal Plain and is showing up alarmingly fast in the Piedmont. Growers who currently do not have Palmer amaranth are encouraged to prevent it from becoming established. Learning to recognize the weed and remove any escapes before a seed head is produced is critical as a single female Palmer amaranth can produce a half million seed. If the seed were uniformly distributed, that is equivalent to more than 10 seed per square foot over an entire acre. Similarly, Italian ryegrass is one of the most troublesome weeds in winter wheat in North Carolina. Italian ryegrass competes with wheat for nutrients and sunlight, reduces wheat tillering, causes lodging, interferes with harvest, and contaminates harvested grain. Yields can be reduced with as few as 10 Italian ryegrass plants per m2, and dense populations are frequently encountered which can result in yield reductions of 50% or greater when left uncontrolled. As important as competition and yield loss is in season, so is the impact Italian ryegrass can have on wheat grain price after harvest.due to dockage. Italian ryegrass is common throughout North Carolina, with few chemical control options available to growers. As new cases of resistance occur and instances of cross resistance develop, it is important to document the occurrence and frequency to aid in management and to reduce spread to areas where resistance has not occurred."

Weed competition with crops reduces yields by using irrigation water and other resources such as nitrogen and light. Competition occurs in perennial tree (e.g., pecans and lemons), shrub (e.g., guayule), vine and annual crops planted in rows (e.g., cotton and corn), and in annual and perennial broadcast planted crops (e.g., alfalfa, lesquerella, wheat and barley). In western rangeland, riparian areas and wild lands, invasive species change fire ecology, displace native species and reduce the productivity of managed landscapes. Buffelgrass invasion of the Sonoran Desert and potential conversion to savanna grassland, Russian knapweed invasion of cropland and pastures leading to abandonment and invasion of riparian habitats by saltcedar are examples of invasive species impacts in Arizona. This project will use standard field and greenhouse small plot research methods to investigate both old and new herbicide technologies for efficacy on target weedy and invasive species under local environmental conditions and determine the herbicide tolerance of crops and other plant species in non-crop landscapes where appropriate. The objectives for the next several years are: 1) evaluate weed management programs for cotton, 2) evaluate and demonstrate preemergence herbicide efficacy in pecans and assess their usefulness for reducing the risk of selecting for herbicide resistant weeds, 3) determine the tolerance of lesquerella to pre- and post-emergence herbicides and the efficacy of these herbicides for weed management in lequerella, 4) measure the dose-response of buffelgrass to postemergence herbicides, and 5) evaluate herbicides, application timing and methods for control invasive species such as Russian knapweed and saltcedar. Information dissemination to regional farmers, crop consultants, land managers and other interested stakeholders will include presentations at Cooperative Extension and scientific meetings (e.g., WSSA and WSWS), publication of Extension Bulletins describing practices and recommendations for weed management tested as part of this research project, and publication of results in peer-review journals. Arizona crop producers and land managers (e.g., National Forest Service, National Park Service, BLM and NRCS) benefit from research that develops new management strategies because weed and invasive species populations constantly change in respond to changes in land use patterns, cultural practices and global climate change. Crop producers, ranchers and rural areas benefit from increased economic efficiency and economically competitive, safe and stable food and fiber production benefits our population as a whole since we need and use these commodities. Improved management strategies for invasive species will help wild-land managers protect and maintain the biological diversity, ecosystem services and esthetic value of our wild lands"

Over the last several years, five key barriers to expanding winter canola acres in the Southern Plains have been identified through constant communication between the OKANOLA project and producers. The barriers that have been identified include insect management, disease management, no-till canola management, rotational systems, and extension resources. With industry supplying winter hardy, high yielding cultivars for the region we can focus on these barriers in an effort to increase acres.

Expansion of the OKANOLA program will take the research results to the producers in order to quickly and efficiently overcome the barriers listed, resulting in expanded acres in the Southern Plains. Without the strong extension component the research fall on deaf ears and no expansion of acres is realized. The foundation of a strong program is in place to expand winter canola acres in the Southern Plains."

Objective 3: Develop commercially viable biobased polymers and polymer blends with improved functionality. Objective 4: Develop technologies to enable the commercial production of non-fuel commodity bioproducts from agricultural and biorefinery feedstocks and byproducts.Approach:   Novel commercially viable composite materials will be developed from agricultural fibers and binders. Fiber composites with superior strength and flexibility will be made by uniformly distributing agricultural fibers in matrices using and array of dispersants. Matrix materials will include biopolymers and inorganic binders. Fiber reinforced composites will also be made using micro and nanofibers made from biopolymers.

Composite materials that function as control-release devices will be developed both for controlling important agricultural pests and for providing plant nutrition and protection. The devices will utilize biodegradable, natural polymers and beneficial soil microbes. In addition to composite materials, micro and nanofibers and/or nanoparticles will be made from biopolymers using a solution blow spinning technology recently developed. Biopolymer solutions will be used to make an array of micro and nanofibers with active agents that provide functionality for applications for medical products and personal hygiene items. Nanoparticles from starch and/or cellulose will be produced by chemical and mechanical means. The materials will be used to make nanocomposites with improved strength and modulus. Low molecular weight polyesters will be made based on di and triols/diacids that can plasticize polylactic acid (PLA) or polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). PLA and PHA polymers containing the plasticizers will be tested for strength and stability by recording mechanical properties. Green pathways for making styrene and terephthalic acid will be explored along with other WRRC cooperators. The Bioproducts Group?s main focus in this collaborative effort will be to assist in characterizing the mechanical and physical properties of the biopolymers and partnering with industry to facilitate scale-up. Non-fuel commodity bioproducts from crop residues, fish waste and wheat gluten will be made. Cellulose fiber will be extracted from crop residues and processed into bioproducts including agricultural mulches and tessellated fiber board.

Nanofibers from fish gelatin or blends of fish gelatin and other polymers will be made by electrospinning. Processing parameters will be optimized and fiber properties will be characterized using microscopy and analytical methods. Antibiotics will be incorporated into the fibers and films. The antimicrobial effectiveness of fibers will be compared to films as to their effectiveness against different bacteria using an overlay inhibition technique.

Develop adaptive management practices and document their benefits to optimize yield and enhance ecosystem services for CGPR dryland agricultural systems most vulnerable to adverse changes in climate. 2.Extend the applicability of adaptive management practices across the CGPR using the development and evaluation of site-specific technologies and process modeling for field scales. 3.Develop and evaluate practices for remediation/restoration of degraded soils in the CGPR.Approach:   There are 27 million acres of cultivated dryland in the Central Great Plains region (CGPR). The primary limitation for cropping in the CGPR is a variable drought dominated climate. Despite system improvements toward more intensive cropping, 58% of the region?s dryland is still winter wheat-summer fallow (WF). Unfortunately, WF is not economically /environmentally sustainable. Our objective is to develop sustainable dryland systems for the CGPR. A central research theme is adapting the region?s cropping systems to the ever-changing semi-arid climate. The unit works to achieve that objective using a long-term ?core experiment,÷ the Alternative Crop Rotation (ACR) study. This field study compares 23 rotations for their economic, agronomic, and drought-mitigating effects and their effects on soil quality. In support of the core experiment, several satellite experiments evaluate the agronomic and economic potential of alternative crop species; quantify crop water use; evaluate changes in soil quality; develop management for remediating degraded soils; and evaluate nutrient use efficiency in these systems. The combined efforts of the ?core÷ and ?satellite÷ experiments will result in sustainable, climate-adaptive cropping systems for the region and will provide a quantitative knowledge of production limitations of the CGPR to climate change. Introducing biological and market diversity with broadleaf bio-diesel/oilseeds will reduce pest pressures inherent to the current grass-dominated rotations. Economic savings from improved cropping systems, reductions in agri-chemical use, and reductions in soil loss resulting from this research are estimated at $6-$35 per acre annually. Assuming 25% adoption of this technology will result in annual regional savings of $40 -$236 million."

Develop cost-effective systems and sensors for rapid and nondestructive measurement of moisture content and density of cereal grains, oilseeds and nuts that can be used in static and dynamic situations (on line and in process applications). 2. Develop a portable system for moisture measurements of shelled and unshelled peanuts that can be used in the field and at peanut grading stations. 3. Improve peanut grading processes by developing a rapid system for nondestructive determination of peanut kernel moisture from measurements on pre-cleaned samples and samples consisting of a mixture of pods and foreign materials. 4. Develop methods for monitoring water migration in almonds and other nuts and its effect on their quality by dielectric and spectroscopic methods.Approach:   Developing a cost-effective microwave system for rapid moisture measurement will require analysis of existing dielectric properties data to determine the optimum frequency and measurement parameters. From these results, microwave components will be specified, assembled into a low-cost rapid prototype, compared to a network analyzer, then calibrated and validated for moisture content of wheat, corn, soybeans, almonds, oats, sorghum, and barley. For peanuts, dielectric properties from 2 to 18 GHz on Runner, Spanish, Valencia, and Virginia will first be collected on shelled and unshelled peanuts. As with the other grains above, these data will then be analyzed to determine the optimum dielectric properties parameters and associated algorithms for a density- and variety-independent measure of peanut moisture content, and a prototype low-cost rapid peanut moisture measurement system will be developed. From these measurements and system development for peanut moisture content of shelled and unshelled peanuts, further development of a system to measure the moisture content of peanut kernels without shelling will be developed. Additional dielectric properties of both the unshelled and shelled kernels will be collected as needed, along with the moisture content of both the shells and the kernels. From these data, moisture algorithms will be developed. Additional dielectric properties measurements on unshelled peanuts with and without foreign material will also be collected for development of moisture models that are also independent of foreign material (trash). Models will be developed for both pod and kernel moisture contents. Besides kernel moisture content, meat content and percentage of foreign material are also important grading parameters. Attempts to correlate the dielectric properties data with these parameters will also be made. For almonds, since no dielectric properties data exists, fundamental dielectric properties measurements of almonds of varying varieties, growing locations in California, and moisture contents will be collected with a network analyzer. Correlations between moisture content and dielectric properties data will be developed. To investigate the dynamics of water migration in the almond kernels, known amounts of water will be sprayed on almond kernels of known moisture content, mixed, and then sealed in a Styrofoam box. The sealed box will then be placed between two horn-lens antennas for free-space measurement of the dielectric properties between 2 and 18 GHz at room temperature. Changes in the dielectric properties will be recorded over time as water moves from the almond surface to water in equilibrium inside the kernels. The next stage will be the use of these dielectric spectroscopic methods to monitor water migration inside the almonds under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature. In this instance, the water will permeate the almonds from the atmosphere for varying relative humidities from 20 to 80% in a controlled environmental chamber. Additionally, measurements will be repeated over varying temperatures from 0 to 50 oC in 5 oC increments."

Test whether parasitoids introduced against insect pests have evolved to parasitize endemic species and whether parasitoids resident prior to introductions have evolved to parasitize exotic pests. 1.3 ?

Biological control introductions against soybean aphid. 3.2 ? Biological control introductions against Russian wheat aphid. 3.3 ? Biological control introductions against cherry vinegar fly.Approach:   Safe and effective biological control depends on using narrowly host-specific agents, and host specificity depends on internal physiological state and previous experience, as well as ecological factors. Furthermore, the likelihood that a host-specific insect will evolve to attack a novel host species depends on the genetic architecture of host use. We will determine the behavioral and genetic bases for host shifts in the herbivores in the genus HELIOTHIS and aphid parasitoids in the genus APHELINUS using laboratory experiments on host use behavior and quantitative genetics/genomics analyses of inter and intraspecific crosses to map and identify genetic architecture. We will also test whether introduced aphid parasitoids have evolved to parasitize endemic species and whether aphid parasitoids resident prior to introductions have evolved to parasitize invasive pests. To do this, we compare host ranges parasitoids before and after introduction in laboratory experiments. Cryptic species are closely related species that differ little in the morphology, but differ critically in traits like host specificity, and studies on host range have often confounded cryptic species. Using modern methods of molecular phylogenetics, morphometrics, and behavioral biology, we develop robust phylogenies and identification keys for species complexes of aphid parasitoids important in biocontrol. We will use the knowledge and methods from the above research to screen specificity of candidates proposed for biocontrol introductions against soybean aphid, Russian wheat aphid, and other invasive pests. We will introduce the most promising candidates and evaluate their impact on target and non-target species with field exclosures, surveys, and analyses of population dynamics."

Most of our work concentrates on measuring properties of single kernels so that they can be segregated or the distribution of properties in a sample can be ascertained, versus measuring the average quality of a bulk sample. In general, the project will include the development of instruments to improve rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) measurement of grain quality at receiving stations, the development of non-destructive and rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) single-kernel sorting systems to improve post-harvest grain quality and similar systems to help grain breeders rapidly select specific traits for improved lines, and improve grain-storage and handling systems. Specific objectives are: 1. Develop sensors and methods to rapidly and accurately quantify attributes such as protein composition, starch composition, end-use quality, toxins, and micronutrients. 1.A. Develop or apply spectroscopic technologies that offer significant improvements over current technologies used to measure traits of single kernels and other biological materials. 1.B. Adapt a previously developed conductance mill for detection of live-insect infestations in wheat in other grains such as corn, rice, barley, and oats, and to dry beans, such as pinto and navy beans. 1.C. Develop procedures for rapid estimation of insect fragments in milled flour from minimally processed whole wheat. 2.Develop rapid single-kernel sorting systems to accurately remove defects such as fungal or insect-damaged grain and to isolate beneficial traits such as white wheat. 2.A. Develop high-speed, low-cost, image-based sorting systems for a variety of grains and legumes. 2.B. Develop Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) -based, single-seed sorting systems for large grains and legumes. 2.C.

Develop instrumentation, sensors, and systems to improve monitoring, and management of grain storage. 3.A. Develop traceability and identity-preservation techniques for grain handling. 3.B. Develop new stored-grain packing factors for the common grains in trade with known confidence intervals for a complete range of field conditions. 3.C. Investigate insect-pest densities and commingling of insects in grain that causes the spread of an infestation from bucket elevator boots. 3.D. Develop monitoring systems for grain-storage quality management. 3.E. Develop improved, environmentally-friendly insect-pest control methods for stored grain. While the objectives of this project include pre-harvest (seeds) and post-harvest handling of grain, the work is interconnected in that the overall goal is to improve the quality of grain produced in the United States. Instruments developed to assess grain quality will be used to study how grain quality might change during storage and handling. An instrument previously developed by this group to detect insect-infested grain will be used to study the spread of insect infestations and the storability of grain based on insect population levels.Approach:   U.S. farmers grow over 15 billion bushels of corn, wheat, soybeans, and other grains annually to supply the nation and world with food, animal feed, and biofuels. A significant amount of this grain may be stored for a year or more before it is used or processed. Our goal is to improve U.S. grain quality and international competitiveness through the application of engineering principles, specifically to the areas of rapid (inspection results from at least 60 individual kernels per minute) quality measurement and in maintaining quality during storage. Much of our research concentrates on measuring the distribution of quality within samples, and on detecting traits that are present at very low levels. We propose to develop instruments to rapidly (up to 500 kernels/s) measure quality traits for inspection at the first point of grain delivery, for breeders in selecting traits for new lines, and for processors prior to grain buying or processing. We also propose to develop chemical-free technology to control insects and maintain quality during handing and storage. This research will lead to higher profits for the agriculture sector, higher-quality foods reaching consumers, and more food available for a growing world population."

Develop processing methods that disrupt food matrices or cell barriers in order to increase accessibility to cellular contents and increase the bioavailability of phytonutrients from fractions of fruit and vegetable based byproducts including pomace of olives, grapes, and pomegranates, as well as grain byproducts from Obj. 1.1 that contain complex mixtures of phenolic compounds that may help to prevent obesity related diseases and add value. Sub-Objective 2.1. Evaluate processes such as enzymatic treatment (cellulase, esterase, phytase), sonication, ethanol extraction, and high pressure to increase bioavailability of phytochemicals and fiber, and to improve consistency of composition and bioavailability of samples for in vivo studies. Subobjective 2.2. Test samples identified as bioactive in 1.2 as well as those further processed in 2.1 for their bioavailability. Also characterize phytochemical composition of bioavailable fractions by HPLC. Objective 3. Evaluate a variety of viscous and gelling soluble dietary fibers to produce breads and other cereal products that are high in fiber and micronutrients. Sub-Objective 3.1. Breads and other baked products will be developed from non-gluten whole grains and bran such as corn, rice, oat, barley, rye, quinoa, amaranth in order to increase the diversity of whole grain products available to consumers. Viscous soluble dietary fibers are necessary to replace gluten, but also reduce postprandial glycemic response and plasma cholesterol. Sub-Objective 3.2. Preliminary studies indicate difference in hepatic nutrient metabolism between wheat and barley flours was not accounted for by soluble fiber content. We propose to evaluate a variety of cereal grains and seeds for bioactivity by analyzing expression of hepatic genes representative of metabolism of sterols, bile acids, and fat, and indicators of inflammation.Approach:   Food processing technologies will be applied to release the high concentration of polyphenolic components from the matrices of the skin and bran byproducts of juice, wine, oil and flour production. Polyphenolics will be extracted from these processed matrices by systematic application of food grade solvents into broad classes and a fiber fraction. Mice and hamster models of obesity related diseases will be used to determine the potential of the polyphenolic or fiber fractions to reduce or prevent the characteristics of metabolic diseases. Mechanisms will be investigated through gene expression pathway analysis. Of particular interest is the ability of polyphenolics or fiber to reduce the absorption of lipopolysaccharides that trigger adipose inflammatory responses. Viscous soluble fibers will be used to develop breads from nontraditional whole grains and seeds to determine if they have potential to reduce metabolic syndrome in animal models."

Subobjective 2b: Examine the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of grassland management practices, such as fire and livestock grazing, to sustainably manage grasshopper populations. Objective 3:Identify ecological factors underlying variability in populations of key crop insect pests and their natural enemies, and identify factors and/or management approaches that augment natural enemies and maximize control of key insect pests. Subobjective 3a: Quantify the effects of semi-natural habitat (grasslands) on grass feeding herbivore-parasitoid food web dynamics and pest pressure in small grains. Subobjective 3b: Determine the effects of landscape structure on the diversity and abundance of natural enemy communities associated with alfalfa pests and how this ultimately influences key interaction-based ecosystem services (i.e. biological control of pests by parasitoids, predators and pathogens). Objective 4:Define biological factors and mechanisms that regulate locomotion, reproduction, and immunity to enhance grasshopper and Mormon cricket management. Subobjective 4a: Identify intake target of Mormon crickets in last nymphal instar and first 8 days of adult life, during which reproductive and immune systems are maturing, and determine if dietary deficiencies alter the efficacy of fungal control. Subobjective 4b: Determine if dietary deficiencies exhibited by migratory Mormon crickets in the field alter their ability to escalate their immune responses. Objective 5:Develop commercializable microbial control agents and methods for their use in managing pest insects such as grasshoppers and Mormon crickets. Objective 6:Assess the suitability and potential effectiveness of classical biocontrol agents against wheat stem sawfly.Approach:   Insects are key constraints in crops and rangelands. Rangeland is a fundamental resource for the beef industry, with grasshoppers frequently affecting food security on all inhabited continents. Wheat and alfalfa rank as the third and fourth most important crops grown in the U.S. ARS stakeholders have identified grasshoppers and Mormon crickets in rangeland, and wheat stem sawfly and alfalfa weevil in cropping systems as high priority pests. Current control strategies for these pests are inadequate, costly and result in unacceptable environmental impacts. Pest management in the modern era has generally focused on suppressive tactics, primarily via chemical means. However, the increasing reliance on agrochemical inputs in modern agriculture has led to public concerns over safety and environmental impacts. Ecologically based pest management approaches attempt to address these concerns by moving beyond the chemical paradigm, to develop safer and more sustainable control. This project focuses on generating the biological and ecological knowledge necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of developing ecologically-based and economically practical management strategies that maintain pest populations at sub-economic levels via biological and cultural means. A sound understanding of insect pest ecology will form the basis for predicting when an insect will be a pest, understanding pest impacts, and determining whether prevention or intervention will be necessary and/or effective. Long-term sustainable solutions to pest problems will only be achieved by restructuring and managing agricultural and rangeland systems in innovative and novel ways that maximize built-in preventive strengths or negatively affect pest population dynamics. In situations where preventive strategies are overcome or consistently ineffective, developing novel biological intervention tools becomes paramount to provide critically needed alternatives to pesticide-based control. In order to increase predictability of grasshopper and Mormon cricket outbreaks and assess their ecological impacts, we will investigate responses to changing climate conditions, and evaluate the effects of grasshoppers on competition between exotic and native rangeland plants. We will also develop novel, preventive strategies that either work against pest fitness in rangeland or render cropping systems less vulnerable to pest problems via the augmentation of natural enemies. Finally, we will develop innovative ways to intervene and control pests when preventive barriers are overcome, including investigations of Mormon cricket and grasshopper susceptibility to pathogens to enhance the efficacy of these natural enemies, and to identify new biocontrol agents to expand the biological arsenal to disrupt growth of wheat stem sawfly, grasshopper, and Mormon cricket populations. This research will fundamentally expand the knowledge base necessary to develop effective, ecologically-based pest management solutions, promoting food security while decreasing energy inputs and environmental impacts."

FHB is a world-wide threat to grain producers and consumers, due to the loss in yield and to the presence of trichothecenes and other mycotoxins in the grain. As the worldÆs population continues to increase, the need to reduce mycotoxins in grain will increase. Development of methods to reduce mycotoxin contamination in grain will be enhanced through elucidation of the molecular genetic mechanisms that control mycotoxin production in F. graminearum and related fusaria, that control plant-fungal interactions, and that detoxify or otherwise modify mycotoxins. The objectives and proposed research are as follows: Objective 1: Identify and characterize mycotoxin detoxification genes as a mechanism to reduce/eliminate the toxins in grain-based food and feed; Objective 2: Determine the genetic bases and ecological significance of variation in types of trichothecene mycotoxins produced by Fusarium; Objective 3: Identify and characterize plant genes that affect biosynthesis of trichothecenes and other mycotoxins produced by Fusarium.  Approach: With a growing world population, access to safe food for all consumers, both domestic and international, will continue to be a global priority. In recent years, the world has experienced an increase in mycotoxin contamination of grains due to climatic and agronomic changes that encourage fungal growth during cultivation. One approach to reduce mycotoxin contamination of food and feed is to prevent preharvest infection of crop plants by mycotoxin-producing fungi. An alternative approach is to modify mycotoxins present in crops in order to render them nontoxic and safe for consumption by humans and animals. Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the most important diseases of wheat and other cereal grains worldwide. It reduces yield and quality and results in contamination of grain with trichothecene mycotoxins. The disease is caused by Fusarium graminearum as well as other trichothecene-producing species of Fusarium. The primary goal of the proposed research is to reduce levels of trichothecenes and other mycotoxins through studies that reveal how plants, the fungus Fusarium, and mycotoxins interact during infection. We expect to identify novel genes that modify, detoxify, or otherwise confer resistance to mycotoxins and to study the physiological and molecular role of mycotoxin production on the ability of Fusarium to infect wheat and other crops. We also will examine the genetic bases and ecological significance of variation in types of mycotoxins produced by Fusarium. Knowledge from these studies will contribute to development of strategies to control FHB, thereby protecting our food supply from mycotoxins. This technology will ultimately benefit other scientists, small grain breeders, stakeholders in the food and feed industry, and regulatory agencies such as the Center for Disease Control, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Federal Grain Inspection Service, and Food Safety Inspection Service."

Objective 2: Characterize the potential transfer of soil lead, arsenic, and other trace elements by vegetable crops grown on element enriched urban and orchard soils and develop methods to prevent this transfer. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 3: Characterize genetic resources and inheritance of grain Cd to reduce cadmium in durum wheat, flax and soybean. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 4: Evaluate information about the risk from Cd in foods to support public decisions for foods of both plant and animal origin. (C1; PS 1.F). The ultimate goals of this Project Plan are to improve the science about risk of heavy metals in soils and crops in order to obtain improved regulatory limits for Cd in crops under Codex, and the information needed to provide improved advice about the risk of Pb in urban garden soils and crops. Essentially all human Cd disease from soil Cd has resulted from paddy rice grown on fields contaminated by mining or smelter emissions. Garden vegetables and other grains have not been found to induce Cd disease in highly exposed populations who grow crops on highly Cd+Zn contaminated soils. Some Europeans want to set crop Cd limits based on ôattainableö levels rather than on the basis of potential risk to consumers. Such non-risk based standards will harm U.S. growers of durum wheat, sunflower kernels, flax, soybean, and some other crops. If crops must contain lower levels of Cd to win importation by other nations, both soil treatments, selection of soil series which produce lower Cd crops, and improved cultivars which accumulate lower amounts of Cd will contribute to growers needs. Providing a clear technical basis for the bioavailability of Cd in different crops appears to be the central issue which could change the demand for lower limits for crop Cd, and protect growers from unnecessary costs to produce lower Cd crops which may have no benefit. Only animal feeding tests can provide valid information about the bioavailability of crop Cd to animals, and the concentrations fed must represent levels in foods rather than toxic levels fed in most previous research. Because Zn is usually greatly increased in crops (except rice) when Cd is increased, the presence of Zn may substantially reduce the bioavailability of crop Cd, alleviating presumed risk of crop Cd. Because commercial carrots were found with higher than normal Pb concentrations when grown on historic orchard soils, U.S.-FDA requested that ARS examine the basis for carrot Pb accumulation and to learn if agricultural amendments can reduce carrot Pb when they are grown on high Pb soils. Certain root crops have xylem elements growing through the edible storage root, so if Pb is trapped within the xylem during normal growth of the crop, it will be in the edible root. But such Pb might have much lower bioavailability than the Pb-acetate used to establish diet Pb risk; 2-10% of food Pb is absorbed, while 60-80% of soluble Pb in water is absorbed by human volunteers.  Approach: Characterize the influence of zinc and iron concentrations in edible crop tissues and crop species on the bioavailability of crop cadmium to animals.  Zinc incorporated in lettuce reduces weanling rat absorption of lettuce Cd.  Using controlled chelator-buffered nutrient solutions (similar to Kukier and Chaney, 2002), Romaine lettuce will be grown to contain basal and sub-phytotoxic concentrations of foliar Zn (25 and 450 mg kg-1 DW), and the Codex Cd limit (4 mg Cd kg-1 DW); the high Zn represents maximum Zn levels normally present if lettuce is grown in acidic soils with geogenic Cd+Zn contamination at the beginning of yield reduction due to Zn phytotoxicity. Fe concentration in lettuce is tightly controlled genetically, but lettuce can supply higher bioavailable Fe than the marginal AIN diet, and thus plant Fe can reduce Cd bioavailability. The lettuce will be fed to weanling rats following the protocol of Reeves and Chaney (2004) in which American Institute of Nutrition (AIN) purified diets with marginal or adequate Fe-Zn-Ca were fed. The basal and high Zn lettuce will be mixed with both the marginal and adequate diets and fed for 28 days without radioisotope labeling used previously. At autopsy, the liver, kidney and duodenum will be removed for analysis. Tissues and blood will be tested to establish Fe status of the test animals. The tissues will be digested in HNO3, and Cd, Zn and Fe levels measured by ICP-Atomic Emission Spectrometry or ICP-Mass Spectrometry. Eight replicate rats will be fed each diet to accommodate the natural variation in such feeding tests (Reeves and Chaney, 2001).   If the lettuce experiment shows a strong effect of crop Zn on crop Cd bioavailability, other crops may be studied using a similar approach (durum wheat; soybean)."

Approach: A.  Eight Maryland soils were chosen that varied in pH, texture, organic C, and land use. After collection soils were sieved and maintained at field moisture levels at 4 ?C. Soil water potential curves were determined. Soils were incubated in Mason jars under controlled conditions to systematically vary soil moisture, soil temperature, soil pH, soil texture, and amendments with organic amendments. Soil samples are analyzed for microbial community structure by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. B. Using the same soils as in (A), a variety of crop and weed seeds will be planted in each soil in pots, using 1 plant species per pot in a full factorial of plant species x soil with 6 replicates. Crop plant species will include cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), while weed species will include smooth pigweed (Amaranthus hybridus), and giant foxtail (Setaria faberi). Soil and rhizosphere samples will be analyzed by TRFLP, PLFA, and pyrosequencing. C. We have a collection of 20 air-dried soils, collected in Maryland, that vary in pH, soil texture, and land use. Cucumber seeds will be planted in each soil and seedlings grown to select soils that will support cucumber growth with minimal disease. A subset of 8 soils will be chosen that maximize variation in pH and texture.  Cucumber seeds will be planted in pots filled with these soils with and without prior seed inoculation with the biocontrol agent Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5.  Colony forming units (CFU) of an antibiotic (rifampicin) resistant mutant of Pf5 will be determined by dilution-plating onto selective media containing rifampicin.  As the cucumber plants grow rhizosphere soil samples (six replicates per treatment) will be taken and used directly to determine the population density  of Pf-5 and frozen at -20 ?C for analysis of rhizosphere community structure by TRFLP, PLFA, and pyrosequencing.  D. We are collaborating with ARS scientists in a variety of locations, including Beltsville, MD; Watkinsville, Georgia; Brookings, South Dakota; Morris, MN; Prosser, WA; and Urbana, IL.  They are using rye and/or vetch cover crops as part of their management systems. Bulk soil samples (0-15 cm depth) from three to four replicate plots, with treatments including rye, vetch, and bare soil, are being sent to us twice annually ( spring and fall) and being stored at -20 ?C. Soil microbial community structure will be analyzed by TRFLP for Eubacteria, Archaea, and fungi, while soil enzyme assays will be used to measure community function."

Approach: Biochemical analyses will be used to distinguish between labile and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter to improve the knowledge base regarding the effects of residue management on short-term soil processes (nutrient cycling, soil structure, and crust formation) and long-term carbon sequestration. This basic knowledge will then be applied to current production problems associated with providing sustainable supplies of bioenergy feedstock and enhancing grain yields to help meet ever-increasing food and feed demands. Utilizing corn, soybean, and small grain (i.e. rice, rye, and wheat) cropping systems, soil management practices to increase corn growth and grain yield will be evaluated in multiple field experiments. Various single-pass corn stover harvest and crop management strategies, cover crops, crop rotations, and tillage intensity will provide the crop production systems within which soil quality will be measured and the chemical nature and cycling of soil organic matter fractions will be quantified using seasonal analyses of amino acids, amino sugars, carbohydrates, phenols, and fatty acids. Effects of soil aeration on the decomposition of crop residues and the subsequent quality of soil organic matter, efficiency of nitrogen (N) cycling, and crop grain yield will be quantified in these experiments. The soil biochemical measurements coupled with soil physical process measurements will be used to augment the knowledge base related to soil quality assessment at plot scales for potential extension to field scale assessments. Project results will quantify the effects of crop residue management on soil physical and biochemical properties contributing to economic yields and long-term sustainability of major cereal cropping systems, leading to improved soil management practices."

The traits conferring these C4 advantages are (1) cooperation of two distinct photosynthetic cell types (mesophyll and bundle sheath) for carbon fixation and photosynthesis, (2) enhanced movement of metabolites between cooperating cells, and (3) high density of leaf venation. These C4 traits are produced from genetic resources already present in less-efficient C3 plants, but regulated in more efficient patterns. Although C4 plants have evolved at least 50 times independently in various taxonomic groups, the molecular basis of the more efficient C4 regulatory system is insufficiently understood to extend its advantages to other crops and biofuel feedstocks. A systems-level analysis of RNAs, proteins, metabolites, anatomy and physiology of corresponding developmental stages of maize (C4) and rice (C3) leaves has identified many of the molecular resources that produce the C4 traits.  It has also revealed that additional corresponding data about small regulatory RNAs, epigenetic differences among cell types, protein modifications and several other  data channels  are needed to understand the production and regulation of these traits. In addition, more sophisticated computational approaches are needed to integrate the many  channels  of RNA, protein, anatomical and small molecule information that produce complex traits. This project will (1) obtain the missing data channels for C4 leaf developmental stages  (2) utilize novel computational approaches for the integration of data channels and the modeling of regulatory networks that can be tested experimentally, and (3) test the regulatory basis for several C4 biochemical cellular traits by genetic and transgenic manipulation. This analysis will identify the regulatory points that are potential targets for the introduction of C4 traits in C3 species.  Beyond producing a practical and profound understanding of C4 photosynthesis, the computational tools and systems resources developed by this project can be applied to other studies of plant development, biochemistry, physiology and productivity.The impact of this project will be broadened through the novel BrachyBio! Outreach Program (http://bti.cornell.edu/brachybio), which introduces high school students to authentic plant genetics research, while providing the plant research community with a web-accessible collection of indexed mutant stocks of Brachypodium distachyon (C3) and Setaria viridis (C4).

Xylan is a major hemicellulose constituent in cell walls from grasses and trees.  Although xylan is the third most abundant polymer on earth, its biosynthesis has proven to be more challenging to elucidate than expected. This project seeks to overcome this lack of understanding and is built upon our recent discovery that xylan synthesis in wheat involves a multi-enzyme complex (called xylan synthase complex, XSC). The objective of this project is to use a multi-faceted approach that combines proteomics, cell biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, and reverse genetics to (i) identify and determine the function of the proteins that are part of this XSC, and (ii) elucidate the mechanism of assembly of these proteins into a functional complex. Outcomes from this work will lead to a basic understanding of hemicellulose biosynthesis in wheat as it relates to plant growth and seed development, and may also provide ways for engineering plants with improved cell wall properties to meet the needs of the food, wood, and biofuel industries. Finally, this project will provide valuable research and training opportunities for students and a postdoctoral fellow. There are several stand-alone components of the project that are likely to yield results in the time frame of an undergraduate project, and would include routine analyses used in a research laboratory. All students will be trained in cell, developmental, molecular, and computational biology. Ohio University is located in southeast Ohio, a predominantly rural area with the highest poverty rate in the state of Ohio. Its undergraduate population comes from the surrounding Appalachian region of Ohio and West Virginia.

Some hybrids, like mules, are sterile, because the parents have different chromosome numbers.  In plants, some sterile hybrids can become fertile when their chromosome number is doubled, a process called polyploidy. Many important crop plants, such as alfalfa, cotton, potato, and wheat are recent polyploids while others, such as maize, soybean, and cabbage, retain the vestiges of ancient polyploid events.  This project will investigate how polyploidy can give rise to novel traits, such as the resistance to insects, in the order Brassicales (broccoli, mustards, capers, papaya, and relatives).  The investigators of this project have developed new phylogenomics methods that allow one to understand the evolutionary history of how species are related while simultaneously determining whether or not they are polyploid.At a time when rapid global changes are placing unprecedented pressure on plants in agricultural and natural landscapes, it is imperative that scientists think beyond a single discipline. Phylogenomics has emerged as an interdisciplinary approach in the biological sciences; however, there are few opportunities to learn the genomic and bioinformatics tools becoming required in biology.

The host scientist is Dr. Mitsunori Seo.The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to advance knowledge about the hormonal control of wheat seed dormancy and germination by measuring hormones Abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), and jasmonic acid (JA) levels in seeds that are either dormant or subjected to dormancy-breaking treatments.  It is essential to advance knowledge about the hormonal control of seed dormancy directly in wheat where problems with preharvest sprouting of seed on the mother plant due to insufficient dormancy under cold or moist conditions cause economic losses for farmers.  Identification and localization of the hormone signal for dormancy release could transform current knowledge leading to new breeding strategies for preharvest sprouting tolerance.  Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of Japan; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally awareness of the U.S. scientific workforce."

Robin Buell (Michigan State University) Co-PIs: Yuehua Cui and David Douches (Michigan State University), Jiming Jiang (University of Wisconsin-Madison), and Richard Veilleux (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University)Potato is the third most important food crop in the world following rice and wheat and is cultivated for its tuber, a below-ground storage organ. Potato is distinct from many other major crops in that it is asexually propagated, has four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid), and all cultivars are highly heterozygous. As a consequence, potato has a greater probability of retaining deleterious gene mutations than sexually propagated diploids such as rice, maize, and soybean. These three characteristics make genetic improvement of potato slow and unpredictable due to a lack of understanding of the interaction of genetic elements in a complex background. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge regarding the molecular nature of heterozygosity and allelic composition in the potato genome and how these correlate with phenotype. The objectives of this project are to understand the contribution of genes/alleles, transcripts, copy number variation and epigenomic features to a complex of phenotypic traits associated with fitness in potato. Data to be generated from this project will include characterization of the genome, transcriptome and epigenome from multiple potato populations with differential degrees of chromosome number and heterozygosity and statistical analyses to identify genes and alleles associated with a set of phenotypes associated with vigor. These data will also facilitate modeling genomic features into phenotype. Many of the genetic and genomic questions associated with potato cannot be readily addressed by using diploid model plants. Project efforts to probe the genetic complexities of potato will serve as a model genomics system for other vegetatively propagated, highly heterozygous crops with similarly intractable breeding systems, including alfalfa, banana, cassava, grape, strawberry, sugarcane, sweet potato, yam and scores of minor horticultural crops, thereby improving the understanding of the genetic machinery underlying phenotypic diversity. Through outreach activities in this project, the public will gain knowledge of plant biology, specifically in the uses of potato and its unique biology, through a suite of activities with the Michigan State University Children's and Horticulture Garden involving all age groups. Through engagement of high school and under-represented groups, this project will provide opportunities for students to see science as a viable career opportunity and increase the representation of women in computer-related science/technology disciplines. The techniques and approaches used in this project will provide a rich training environment for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in relevant and emerging disciplines of bioinformatics, genomics, and epigenomics.  The data to be generated in this project through publication and deposition in public databases will provide the first high-resolution map of genome variation and its association with gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and phenotypic traits in potato.  Sequence data will be made public through the project website (to be accessible via http://buell-lab.plantbiology.msu.edu/), the SOL Genomics Network (http://solgenomics.net/) and through the NCBI Sequence Read Archive and the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus for permanent archiving.

Eric Schaller (Dartmouth College) and Ann Loraine (University of North Carolina - Charlotte)Cytokinins are plant hormones that regulate many traits of agricultural importance, including the control of grain size and yield. In this project, genomic approaches will be used to uncover how cytokinin regulates growth and development in rice, using this plant species as a model to understand the regulation of grain size and yield in all cereals. Computational approaches will be used to interrogate and integrate the datasets generated by these studies. It is expected that these studies will illuminate the role of cytokinins in panicle development, and will provide specific information on how cytokinins regulate grain development in an agriculturally important crop. Because of conservation of gene sequence among cereals, information obtained from the study of rice may be applied to other agriculturally important species such as maize, wheat, barley, rye, and sorghum. This project will enhance the infrastructure of research and education by providing training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers. A computation workshop will broaden the ability of the research community to use genomics resources. In addition, through partnerships with local groups including the Montshire Museum of Science (http://montshire.org/), programs aimed at fostering science education in grades K-12 will be created and maintained.

In particular, the two groups of bacteria within the species Xanthomonas oryzae are the causal agents of bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak diseases of rice. The bacteria cause disease, in part, modulating host gene expression utilizing a remarkable repertoire of transcription activation-like (TAL) effectors. TAL effectors are proteins synthesized in bacteria and transferred to plant cells during the infection process. The host transcriptional responses to TAL effector attack are complex, and unraveling of the transcriptional  shock  due to the large repertoire of TAL effectors injected into the host cells behooves a more detailed understanding of host gene response to individual TAL effectors. At the same time, other disease complexes that involve large repertoires of TAL effectors in the respective pathogen, and additional disease complexes will be profiled. This project will characterize the host gene expression responses to infection by Xanthomonas pathogens of rice, wheat, cotton, soybeans, and alfalfa using high through-put nucleic acid sequencing technologies. The role played by select host genes whose expression is found to be highly up-regulated in response to specific TAL effectors will be analyzed using advanced gene targeting technologies. TAL effectors function by binding to sequences in the host genome that direct the expression of individual genes, which are known as promoters. The project will also develop refined bioinformatic tools derived from shared features of promoters that are targeted by specific TAL effectors. This information will improve our insight into the vulnerabilities of plants to transcriptional shock and greatly further our ability to predict TAL effector target sites in a genome and to effectively design custom TAL effectors for targeted gene manipulation. This project will elucidate the processes in rice susceptibility and resistance to bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak, and establish important, broadly relevant concepts of plant-pathogen interactions and TAL effector biotechnology. The results will provide insight into strategies for achieving durable and broad resistance against disease, which, in itself, can have wide-reaching impacts on the environment and quality of life. The research will enhance the educational environments at ISU, KSU, Cornell, and IU and strengthen international collaborative research. Research activities will be integrated with education and outreach by mentoring graduate student and postdocs, providing internships for under-represented undergraduate students, and providing research experiences to high school students and teachers. Workshops will be conducted that will be open to interested national and international students and researchers in the field. The public will have access to the data at various public databases including the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database at NCBI.

The proposed I/UCRC will build upon the already existing Wheat Genetics Resource Center (WGRC) at Kansas State University.Managing bread wheat genetic diversity within domesticated varieties and wild wheat species, as well as workforce training, are critical success factors for the wheat research enterprise. Both will be major functions of the proposed I/UCRC. Adding value to wheat genetic resources will also be a major function of the proposed center. Another focus of the center will be mobilization of genetic diversity to improve crop performance. Finally, a key focus of the center will be the development of new methods for the rapid deployment of useful genetic diversity. Technical innovations will allow rapid transfer of useful traits to elite germplasmthrough genotyping by sequencing, marker assisted breeding and doubled haploid and other innovations by center scientists.The primary research impact of the proposed activity could be, potentially, the characterization (genotypic and phenotypic) of thousands of wild wheat relatives and alien introgression lines, a resource of immense value to the broader wheat improvement community (public and private). The value of this work will be even greater with the proposed I/UCRC investing effort in reducing the segments of alien introgressions carrying genes of interest to wheat improvement programs. WGRC's impressive track record of training and mentorship will be expanded upon in the new I/UCRC by providing additional training and educational activities including industry mentorship and internships, undergraduate research and potential dual degree programs in the plant sciences and various K-State departments."

Understanding how it can adapt to infest new products is economically important and addresses general questions about adaptation and diversification.  In initial dissertation work, the Co-PI found that flour beetles adapt to soy flour within eleven generations and hybridization between beetle populations increases adaptation. While increased adaptation in hybrids can be caused by recombination of parental genomes (the standard explanation), increased performance might also be caused by recombination of symbiotic bacteria from parental populations. This proposition will be tested by comparing symbiotic bacteria of soy-adapted and wheat-adapted beetles. Bacteria will be identified by high-throughput DNA technology. Antibiotics will be used to remove symbiotic bacteria to determine whether bacteria are responsible for differences in performance.This project will produce data relevant to agriculture, conservation, and education. Results will be invaluable to policy makers in the growing organic agriculture industry when making decisions about storage of imported food products when fumigation is not an option. Similarly, results will be of service to conservation organizations interested in preventing invasions by exotic species or facilitating reintroduction of endangered species to altered environments. The PI and Co-PI mentor undergraduate students by involving them in data collection and analysis, and this funding will support development of a beetle module in the VolsTeach program at the University of Tennessee."

They develop analytical and computational methods for continuous-time nonzero sum games that arise in models of oligopolies where a small number of large players compete.  Numerical solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system of PDEs is challenging due to a degeneracy that develops because one player may not participate.  The goal is to produce and analyze regularization or smoothing schemes that will be useful for many models in mathematical economics involving differential games with heterogeneous players.  They also investigate the feedback mechanism from speculative commodities trading to understand market instabilities, and study volatility-related products through multiscale asymptotic analysis.     Energy markets are undergoing fundamental changes as production shifts from oil to natural gas towards renewable sources.  The investigator analyzes these markets as oligopolies where the production costs and supplies are very different between different fuels or technologies.  For example, an oil producer has relatively low costs but exhaustible reserves, while a producer from solar technology has high costs and essentially inexhaustible supply.  He also studies how commodities markets have become more  financialized  over the past decade.  This is due to an influx of speculative traders.  The price movements of goods such as oil or wheat, which prior to the last decade were mainly governed by supply and demand of users of the commodity, are now much more similar to the more random movements of stock prices.  Finally, the investigator looks at modern derivatives contracts such as volatility derivatives and leveraged exchange traded funds, in order to assess and quantify their risks, particularly in light of the recent financial crisis."

DePeters, Emanuel Epstein, and  William D. Rains (University of California-Davis), and Dennis Falaschi (Panoche Water District, Firebaugh, CA) Salinity limits agriculture in many semiarid areas of the world. In Pakistan, the partner country of this project, two million hectares (ha) of the total 21 million ha of land are salinized and are either unsuitable or only marginally suitable for agriculture. Salinized land can be reclaimed with appropriate agronomic practices and engineering interventions and/or by growing salt-tolerant crops. Unfortunately, improvement of salinity tolerance of major crops has been disappointingly slow because of their inherent salt sensitivity. This project takes a reverse strategy by improving agronomic attributes of plants naturally able to tolerate salinity. Perennial tall wheatgrasses and their close relatives have exceptional salt tolerance and some produce a large quantity of forage in saline environments. A unique asset of tall wheatgrasses is that they can be hybridized with wheat, producing plant materials that are often exceptionally salt tolerant. While the chromosomes of wheat and wheatgrasses do not recombine naturally, recombination between chromosomes of these species can be induced through the use of genetic stocks containing mutations in the homoeologous pairing gene Ph1. The goal of this project is to evaluate the possibility of developing novel salt-tolerant germplasm with recombined genomes derived from hybridization between wheatgrass and wheat using the Su1-Ph1 (Suppressor of Ph1) system. Amphiploids developed from these crosses will be characterized by cytogenetic and genetic approaches as well as for mineral content, nutritional quality, and agronomic traits. Field evaluations will be conducted in California and in Pakistan.  For genetic analysis, wheatgrass genomes will be sequenced and genetic markers specific for wheatgrass germplasm will be developed. This project will have an impact reaching far beyond developing technology and materials for agriculture on saline soils in Pakistan. Basic knowledge about genetic manipulation of recombination between wheat and alien chromosomes with the objective of producing novel plant forms with recombined genomes will be generated and disseminated. This knowledge can be deployed in hybridization of wheat with species other than wheatgrasses in order to produce novel cereals with improved tolerance of drought, heat, cold, or waterlogging or with novel attributes, such as perennial growth habit. The salt-tolerant materials developed in this project will facilitate future discovery of genes controlling high salt tolerance in wheatgrasses and their deployment in biotechnology of wheat and other crops in addition to the immediate use of this germplasm in breeding programs in Pakistan and other countries with saline soils. Wheatgrass genome sequences and the wheatgrass genetic markers will be deposited at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)and on the project website with links in GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml) and Gramene (http://www.gramene.org), respectively.

Cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice and barley are most affected by drought during the time of flowering and initiation of grain formation, causing drastic yield losses. The goal of this project is to develop a systems biology view of drought responses in cereals to understand this complex process and improve drought resistance and water use efficiency. Genome-wide comparative transcriptome analysis of drought responses in rice and maize will be integrated into a cereal drought gene interaction network, using ortholog information to predict conserved functional relationships as a basis for cereals. Conserved orthologous regulatory genes between rice and maize involved in drought responses and resistance will be identified comprising transcription factors (TFs), protein kinases and phosphatases, genes in hormone signaling pathways, chromatin binding proteins, protein degradation and small RNA pathways. As proof of principle, a set of these putative conserved rice and maize genes will be tested by genetic analysis of mutants and natural allelic variants, assessing them for altered drought response phenotypes and perturbation in the drought gene interaction network. These analyses will validate and improve the cereal gene interaction network predictions, and provide candidate genes for improvement of drought resistance/tolerance in cereals. With respect to broader impacts, this project will contribute through the generation of information key to the development of stable food production systems worldwide and through the creation of a transdisciplinary educational environment. Scientifically, the project will demonstrate the use of an integrated network approach to understand complex plant responses such as drought response and resistance. Outreach and training activities are integrated within the transdisciplinary plant-lab-bioinformatics project and will be made accessible to high school and underrepresented undergraduate students from institutions across Virginia and North Carolina through established programs at Virginia Tech and other nearby universities. An outreach program developed as part of a NSF-Cyberinfrastructure Training, Education, Advancement, and Mentoring for Our 21st Century Workforce (CI-TEAM) project will provide modules for quantitative data analysis for teachers and students using socio-environmental case studies from research data. An integrated mentor program for postdoctoral researchers will be used to facilitate career development. International research collaborations with the Generation Challenge Program and CGIAR institutes involved in drought research will add capacity building to agricultural systems worldwide.  Plant genotypes and all data developed in the project will be made available through a project website (http://cereal-drought.vbi.vt.edu/) that will allow interactive access to data and networks. Other publicly available genetic stocks used will be distributed by the respective originators with long term public repositories.

BYDV contains an unusual RNA structure, a translational enhancer (BTE),  in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA that interacts with a 5' UTR stem loop.  This long-range interaction promotes efficient translation of the viral mRNA by a mechanism that is not yet fully understood.  The project will employ the 3' UTR of BYDV as a model system to elucidate mechanisms of long-range RNA interactions involving 3'UTR elements. The overall goal of the project is to identify the molecular interactions that enable viral mRNA to compete efficiently with the much higher concentrations of cellular RNA for access to ribosomes and translation factors. The three critical steps in the assembly of viral protein synthesis initiation complexes will be investigated: 1) The binding of eIFs (eukaryotic initiation factors) to the viral 3'-BTE; 2) the interaction of ribosomes with viral 3'-BTE and 5'-UTR sequences; and 3) the interaction between viral 3'-BTE and 5'-UTR regions. A library of BYDV mRNAs with varying translational efficiency will be used to determine the correlation between eIF binding and translation, the binding affinity of ribosomes for viral RNA sequences, and the role of the interaction between 3' and 5'-UTRs  in each of these steps. The project will employ a range of biochemical and biophysical techniques to achieve these aims, including ribosome 'toeprint' analysis, direct fluorescence assays, and RNA binding assays analyzed by mass spectroscopic analysis.Broader Impacts:  The significance of the research and the range of experimental approaches employed will provide excellent training opportunities for students, ranging from the high school to the graduate school level, in both biochemical assays and quantitative biophysical measurements. Students at each level will receive appropriate training in molecular biology techniques including expression of cloned proteins, translational assays, and other important biochemical techniques.  Fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry used in this project will provide quantitative and biophysical training for more advanced students. Hunter College recruits and enrolls significant numbers of minority students under-represented in the sciences, and  also sponsors a summer research program for them. Students will be recruited from this program to participate in the research.  Thus, the project will contribute to training a diverse workforce in science and technology. High school teachers will carry out research in the lab during the summers, using quantitative fluorescence measurements to determine equilibrium and thermodynamic properties and enhance their content knowledge of applications of thermodynamics to biological systems. The Principal Investigator will work with faculty from the Borough of Manhattan Community College (an Hispanic serving institution) to increase research opportunities for their faculty and students, providing access to state-of-the-art equipment and research guidance when appropriate. By participating in the research project, high school teachers and community college faculty will increase their knowledge of current research techniques and their abilities to convey to their students the excitement of science."

Some bacteria have specialized structures (called carboxysomes) that increase their efficiency of photosynthesis, and if carboxysomes can be introduced into crop plants such as rice, wheat and soybeans it is anticipated that this would improve their growth and yield. The smaller the number of proteins that are needed to reconstitute functional carboxysomes, the easier it will be to succeed. The goal of this project is to combine the roles of two carboxysome proteins into one; in other words, one protein will play two essential roles by combining structural and enzymatic functions.  It is proposed to develop two types of bi-functional carboxysome proteins:  one that will help deliver carbon dioxide to the interior of the carboxysome, where it will be available to RUBISCO, a key enzyme of photosynthesis; the second will detoxify a molecule (2-phosphoglycolate) that is formed as an unwanted by-product of chemical reactions that compete with photosynthesis.Broader Impacts: This project will provide interdisciplinary training in biochemistry, protein chemistry and synthetic biology to a postdoctoral fellow and to undergraduate students. In addition it will explore innovative approaches to the engineering of structures such as the carboxysome and has the potential to improve crop yields for both food and biofuel."

At the same time, arable land, clean water and phosphate fertilizers are increasingly limited resources. At the same time, the productivity gains of the Green Revolution are leveling off; the costs of using fossil fuels to transport fertilizer and food around the world are becoming prohibitive; and climate change will affect crop range and productivity in ways that are not yet predictable. To meet this new challenge, inexpensive and sustainable approaches will be necessary not only to improve food production of major commodity crops like wheat and rice, but also local crops and vegetables, especially in areas of massive global population expansion. The field of plant-microbe interactions has entered an era of particular promise and has the potential to provide innovative and highly adaptable approaches to increase plant productivity. Beneficial plant-Microbe interactions are known to improve plant resilience to many kinds of stresses, including disease, drought, salinity, nutrient limitation, and extreme temperature. Advances in the fundamental understanding of the natural relationships between plants and the microbial world can be put to immediate use to ensure sustainable food production worldwide. The time is especially ripe for an in-depth examination of the current state of the art in the study of microbe-plant interactions because scientific, technological, and computational advances of the last decade have opened avenues to address the complexity and dynamics of these interactions. The proposed colloquium is devoted specifically to develop novel integrated mechanisms that can lead to meaningful measures to enhance crop productivity and food security for the future. Broader impact The connection between greater fundamental understanding of plant-microbe interactions and the practical solution of enhanced crop productivity is compelling. Historically, the field has been hampered by the complexity and intractability of the biological system. The colloquium will bring together a diverse group of experts in the field who can identify the needs and challenges and develop a road map for rapid scientific progress and strategies to exploit the beneficial plant-microbe interactions, while curtailing those that are detrimental. Raising awareness of the potential of this field is likely to inspire young scientists to choose careers in basic science knowing that their contributions have positive impact on a number of societal grand challenges. Discussions at the colloquium will be captured in a report that will be freely available to the public. Also, a proposal has already been submitted for a session featuring colloquium participants at the 2013 AAAS meeting in Boston. The American Academy of Microbiology is committed to identifying opportunities like the AAAS meeting to disseminate the results of its colloquia to audiences beyond those of the participants and sponsors."

The model system being studied is the barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDVs) in California grasslands. B/CYDVs are a group of viruses spread by aphids that infect hundreds cultivated and wild grasses, such as wheat and barley, causing significant damage. The consequences of pathogen diversity include decreased yields and poor grain quality. Mathematical modeling will help researchers understand the causes and consequences of pathogen diversity.The fellowship training will enhance the postdoctoral fellow's mathematical skills and lab skills such as molecular techniques for identifying viruses. B/CYDVs are important not only as a model system for studying disease in wildlife, but also as a crop pest, so results of this fellowship may inform agricultural practices. The postdoctoral fellow will involve undergraduates in research, deliver department seminars, give guest lectures in Population Ecology and Disease Ecology and participate in public outreach via programs at the UC Hopland Research and Extension Center."

Camelina has recently shown great potential as a commercial biofuel feedstock because of its superior jet fuel and biodiesel performances. However, making these fuels from camelina is currently not economically viable, partly because: a) camelina production is not sufficiently efficient per unit resource used; b) camelina oil processing generates about 65% solid meal co-product that is currently under-utilized; and c) effective technology is not available to produce high value co-products from camelina bioenergy varieties. The team will 1) enhance camelina production by optimizing cropping systems within wheat-based crop rotations; 2) develop new technologies for intermediate chemicals and bioproducts by utilizing camelina meals and oils; 3) conduct life cycle analysis of camelina feedstock from agronomic production through to bioenergy and processed bioproducts; 4) conduct on-farm demonstration and technology outreach to encourage improved camelina production in Montana and Wyoming; and 5) commercialize bioproducts derived from camelina meals and oils.

One hundred thirty thousand acres of winter canola was planted in Oklahoma alone during the 2011-2012 growing season. This rapid increase in Oklahoma is a direct result of an intense effort, the OKANOLA project, to introduce winter canola as a profitable alternative crop in the continuous winter wheat systems of Western Oklahoma. Over the last several years, five key barriers to expanding winter canola acres in the Southern Plains have been identified through constant communication between the OKANOLA project and producers. The barriers that have been identified include insect management, disease management, no-till canola management, systems management, and extension resources. With industry supplying winter hardy, high yielding cultivars for the region we can focus on these barriers in an effort to increase acres. Specific research objectives address the needs to determine the best managament practices for each barrier. This proposal is fully integrated between research, extension, and industry. Expansion of the OKANOLA program will take the research results to the producers in order to quickly and efficiently overcome the barriers listed, resulting in expanded acres in the Southern Plains. Without the strong extension component the research fall on deaf ears and no expansion of acres is realized. The foundation of a strong program is in place to expand winter canola acres in the Southern Plains."

One of the most important viruses in cereal crops is called Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV). There are no chemical (acaracide) options for control of the vector, the wheat curl mite (WCM). In some locations in the country there are resistant varieties for WSMV and WCM, but resistance inevitably breaks down due to genetic changes in the pathogen and vector. Also, the current resistance available is sensitive to heat and varieties with resistance genes have lower yields. In addition, varieties resistant to WSMV are not resistant to other WCM-transmitted viruses High Plains virus and Triticum mosaic virus. Co-infection by two or more viruses results in more severe disease and larger crop losses. Cropping practices in many areas favor the perpetuation of wheat viruses because of the green bridge, which is an overlap of green plant material (crops, grassy weeds) between the harvesting of one crop and the planting of the next. In southern states, growers plant winter wheat early in the fall to graze cattle, and then produce a seed crop from this same field, so the green bridge is maintained year round. We will be testing biological and inorganic pesticides for control of WCM, including fungicides which may have secondary effects on mite populations. We will also be testing which green bridge hosts put the crop at the most risk, how management practices including nitrogen application and planting date influence disease, and how plant maturity and geographic origin of the grass influences the potential disease. All of this information will feed into models, publications, and extension education to modify grower practices and reduce the amount of virus disease in the crop. Since wheat viruses are a community disease, which means the practices of one farmer can influence the whole community, changing farmer behaviors is critical to the success of this project."

Numerous studies support that an increased intake of dietary fiber plays a protective role against obesity and some other chronic diseases. The reduced risk of obesity is of high importance since obesity is a risk factor for certain cancers. Although the healthy reputation of dietary fiber continues to grow, national data consistently shows that both children and adults consume less than one-half of the recommended daily intakes of dietary fiber. In reality, it is difficult for an individual consuming a typical Western diet to obtain an adequate quantity of fiber. Substantial dietary changes are thereby needed to meet the required needs, and one approach is to consume foods that are supplemented with high levels of fiber rich ingredients. However, formulating dietary fiber enriched foods still presents challenges since native fiber ingredients adversely affect color, texture, flavor and taste of the supplemented foods. This problem could be addressed by modifying physicochemical properties of fiber ingredients because their behavior in food processing and interaction with food matrices is relevant to these properties. In this project, wheat and corn brans, very important sources of dietary fiber and antioxidants in industrialized countries, will be modified using the microfluidization process in which aqueous streams containing bran particles will be driven through a microchannel at an extremely high speed. Upon completion of the project, a protocol for processing wheat and corn brans using microfluidization will be established for optimal process efficiency. Mathematical models that correlate the brans' physicochemical and nutritional properties with microfluidization processing parameters will be developed to optimize these properties. Corn cereals enriched with the modified brans will also be produced. These findings will allow us to further develop bran-enriched foods such as cereals and bakery products with good sensory properties. This should promote the intakes of dietary fiber in the United States and thus help prevent chronic diseases, especially obesity."

Today, wheat remains among the most cultivated crops and provides a substantial portion of calories, protein and dietary fiber for the human population. Breeding new wheat varieties is an ongoing project: it is aimed to improve wheat quality and grain yield as well as to address current environmental challenges, such as shortage of water and emergence of pathogens. One major resource that is needed for both wheat breeders and scientists is availability of well-defined collection of wheat gene variants (alleles). Current advances in DNA sequencing allow us to fully decode genetic information in organisms on a population level. Therefore, we established this project to fully sequence most of the wheat genes in an existing population of induced mutations in durum wheat. We plan to sequence 1,000 individual wheat lines and identify allelic variation in each wheat gene. The resulting allele database will be available to the public in open access on the web and the corresponding seeds of wheat lines will be available from the Dubcovsky lab upon request. Proposed characterization of these lines will not only provide tools to researchers to analyze the function of different wheat genes, but will also generate a huge increase in genetic diversity that will help breeders address current agricultural challenges."

A platform has been developed to identify critical agronomic traits derived from different D genome sources that have been transferred to cultivated wheat. The D genomes of seven different Aegilops tauschii accessions have been transferred to wheat in a genetic mapping population with a nested family structure. This unique population will be evaluated for traits critical for wheat production in stress-prone environments including high yield capacity, high-temperature tolerance, and rust resistance. In this population we will identify the specific regions from the Ae. tauschii genome that are contributing to superior agronomic performance in wheat. Valuable wheat breeding material with improved rust resistance and yield capacity will be produced. The data generated in this project will facilitate the incorporation of superior D-genome alleles into wheat breeding programs. The methods employed in this project will provide a foundation for the mapping of other important traits in this population to further characterize genetic variation from the wild wheat relative, Ae. tauschii. The genetic populations developed can be evaluated for tolerance to future environmental stresses including water use efficiency, salinity tolerance, heavy metal tolerance, emerging fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens, as well as quality, end use and nutritional improvements."

Fundamental research is therefore needed to develop sustainable tactics for adapting to increasing weather- and insect-related crop stress. This project explores the potential of increased crop genotypic, or within-species, diversity to manage plant stress and ensure future crop productivity. We aim to increase within-species diversity by planting mixtures of crop varieties. Ecological evidence from natural and agricultural systems, including our preliminary data, strongly suggests that genotypically diverse cultivar mixtures hold great potential to diminish the influence of climate change by improving plant productivity, insect pest management, and ecosystem resilience. In both the greenhouse and the field, this work will compare the response of variety mixtures of wheat exposed to the stress of drought and plant-feeding insects, in this case aphids, to that of plantings of one variety (monocultures). In addition, we will compare the response of herbivorous and predatory insects to mixtures and monocultures faced with these stressors. We believe that our research will reveal that crop genotypic diversity can provide stress-management and production benefits to grain producers, including protecting and stabilizing yield when crops are confronted with simultaneous stressors. This project will also enhance our understanding of the role interactions between varieties can play in managing plant stress and will help identify mechanisms by which genotypic diversity exerts its influence. Our approach will improve the stress resistance of agroecosystems faced with a changing climate, reducing future reliance on water and pesticide inputs and increasing agricultural sustainability."

Roughly four-fifths of the harvested potato crop is sold for fresh or processed consumption. Processed potatoes comprise 58 percent of total US potato utilization; from the average of 129 pounds consumed per capita per year, 55 pounds are frozen potatoes, 43 pounds fresh potatoes, 17 pounds are potato chips, and 14 pounds are dehydrated products. Potato production in the US is being challenged by the introduction of this devastating new disease. Zebra Chip produces a characteristic striped pattern of necrosis in affected potato tubers, which appear as burned striations when they are fried as chips. Zebra Chip results in a severe reduction in the productivity of a field, reduced storage life, and rejection of the crop by the processing industry.The results and information acquired from this project will be dispersed to key personnel in the potato industry including growers, universities, government agencies and end-users. The majority of US potato growers farm less than 100 acres, yielding less than $200,000 in yearly farm income. Successful completion of this project will provide potato growers with a valuable tool for managing potato psyllid to reduce the risk of spreading ZC.

Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV) is a recently emerged virus in the same geographic region and likely poses the same risks as WSMV. Wheat varieties with temperature-dependent genetic resistance to WSMV recently have become available. One wheat variety, Mace, is resistant to both WSMV and TriMV but the mechanism(s) of virus resistance is unknown. Knowledge of resistance mechanisms can suggest techniques for rapidly screening wheat lines for WSMV and TriMV resistance. New screening methods will be essential to track the Wsm1 resistance gene in wheat lines that have lost closely linked PCR markers. In addition, other sources of resistance to WSMV and TriMV to augment natural resistance and mitigate against the evolution of resistance-breaking strains of these viruses is desirable. Virtually nothing is known about the molecular biology of TriMV and the roles of viral proteins in replication, vector transmission, and virus-plant host interactions. Improved understanding of the genetic basis of these basic viral functions will facilitate efforts to ameliorate the effects of viral infection in wheat and other cereal crops. The objectives here are designed to fill these knowledge gaps with WSMV and TriMV resistance, TriMV molecular biology and vector transmission. In addition, we will develop transgenic wheat with resistance likely to be effective against a broad spectrum of WSMV and TriMV strains."

The management tactics being investigated include the effect of 1) rearing strategies (particularly temperature regimes) on bees, 2) local flowering-plant diversity on pollinators and natural enemies, 3) grazing management and crop rotation on pest and beneficial insects, and 4) the use of artificial nesting materials on populations and activities of beneficial pollinators and predators. The insects that form the focus of the research include alfalfa leafcutting bees (an exotic species that is the most important commercially-used pollinator of seed alfalfa in western North America), native solitary and social bees and wasps that have important roles as pollinators and predators in natural and agricultural ecosystems, and communities of beneficial and pest insects in alfalfa, spring wheat, and barley. Laboratory methods used in the study include the relatively unique use of a laboratory temperature gradient to study the thermal biology of insects and the use of an ether-extraction technique to estimate body fat content in bees (body fat is being used as a measure of adult condition in bees). The field sampling techniques to be used represented a broad set of well-tested methods (e.g., sweep netting, pan traps, baited traps, and trap nests) chosen for their appropriateness to the insect groups being studied. The results will provide information relevant to 1) improved rearing tactics for alfalfa leafcutting bees (for use by alfalfa seed growers and commercial bee managers), 2) conservation strategies for native species of solitary bees and wasps (of interest to land manager and growers), and 3) the use of sheep grazing and traditional fallowing as a weed and insect management tactics in alfalfa, spring wheat, and barley (our goal is to reduce reliance on pesticide and fossil fuel use in grain farming operations by incorporating sheep into dryland farming systems to control weeds"

Agronomic yield is controlled by many factors with the rate and duration of carbon fixation in leaves a primary factor. End product quality is impacted by genes that influence seed development and determine seed composition and suitability for various end product applications. Total agronomic yield in cereals is a function of the amount of carbon fixed in leaves and ultimately stored and harvested in seeds. Starch comprises approximately 70% of the dry weight of cereal seeds and therefore an increased understanding starch biosynthesis could prove useful in improving cereal yield and end product quality. Our previous experiments demonstrated that increasing starch biosynthetic levels in seeds increases total yield under non-resource limiting conditions but not under normal field conditions. More recent studies have suggested that increases in source supply also limit plant productivity. Our first objective then will be to test whether starch biosynthesis limits the rate of carbon fixation in leaves. To that end, we will attempt to increase the rate of starch biosynthesis in leaves of cereals and measure the yield response under non-resource limiting conditions. Our second objective is focused on the role of starch in seed end product quality. Starch in cereals typically consists of 25% amylose and 75% amylopectin. While both amylose and amylopectin consist of glucose chains, the chains of glucose in amylose are relatively straight while those in amylopectin are highly branched. The glucose residues in amylose are also complexed with lipid with the end result being that amylose is less easily digested. Decreased ease of digestion equates to a lower glycemic response or a  low net carb  effect in high amylose wheat based foods. Aside from health effects, high amylose wheat flour would prove useful in improving the end product quality of noodles and pasta. High amylose noodles and pasta would be firmer and more resistant to degradation during cooking. The experiments we propose here would be focused upon the development of high amylose durum wheat which would have the advantages of having enhanced health attributes, firmness, and consumer acceptance. Also influential in their effects upon wheat end product quality are storage proteins such as the wheat puroindolines. The puroindoline genes control whether wheat is soft or hard textured and impact nearly all milling and baking quality traits. Our past research focused on determining to what degree the puroindoline genes control grain hardness and how they interact to modify grain texture. In the current proposal, one of our accomplishments was the creation of a large number of new puroindoline alleles. Our goal here will be test the effect of a subset of the new alleles upon wheat milling and baking quality. The new alleles may prove useful in improving the milling and baking properties of new wheat cultivars."

Although commodity prices have risen substantially in recent years, input costs have also climbed and profitability has not improved. Growers need to have more crop options, particularly genotypes of alternative, vegetable, or specialty crops, in order to optimize profitability. Possible alternatives include the vegetable crops that have a higher per acre return. Another alternative is to refine the production of dual-purpose crops so that growers can make in-season decisions that optimize profitability. Although research comparing performance of varieties among the major crops such as soybean, corn, and wheat are prevalent, there are much fewer data that compare vegetable varieties for yield and quality in the Southern Great Plains. Potential vegetable crops for the southern Great Plains include seed legumes, specialty oilseed grains, root-type crops, and leafy greens. Because fertilizer nitrogen applications are costly and have environmental consequences, seed legumes, such as pigeonpea and edamame (vegetable soybean for the fresh market), offer an obvious solution. Secondly, winter grain alternatives for winter wheat in the southern Great Plains are also needed and safflower has recently shown promise but most the data are from elsewhere. Root-type crops offer a third alternative, especially for the winter season. The fourth cropping category with promise in the Southern Great Plains is leafy greens. For edamame, a mechanical one-row harvester was introduced to improve pod harvest in the early 1990s and later, a stationary pod stripper was introduced used to eliminate pod removal by hand for situations where a mechanical harvester is unavailable. To address the dearth of yield and quality data for vegetables in the Southern Great Plains, we plan to conduct research with seed legumes, winter oilseeds, root-type crops, and leafy greens. Growth variables, insect data, water use, yield, quality, and storage longevity will be determined. Taken together, this wide set of alternatives and accompanying physiological data will lead assist in variety and management select and will ultimately prove valuable for this region's vegetable producers."

As a result, improved cool-season perennial grassland ecosystems based on traditional cultivars are short-lived and require frequent reestablishment, increasing costs of winter forage for cattle. In the recent years, summer-dormant cool-season grasses have been a subject of intensive research and applications in other parts of the world, where changing climatic conditions affect persistence of traditional cool-season forage grasses. Mechanisms associated with survival of prolonged and severe summer drought suggest that in semi-arid environments of the Southern Great Plains, grasslands with summer-dormant cool-season grasses might be more persistent and sustainable than grasslands based on traditional, summer-active cultivars.Results of current research indicate that by 1 December (starting date for grazing wheat in the Texas Rolling Plains), 2-yr-old stands of `Flecha' MaxQ and `Prosper' summer-dormant tall fescue can produce about five times more forage dry matter than wheat planted traditionally in this region in September. It is estimated that 45 to 60 d of additional grazing and gain during early winter in the Southern Great Plains may bring additional income of $62 to $75 ha-1. Basic aspects of the research program will be conducted in small-scale plots (field) and greenhouse experiments to address breeding of summer-dormant cool-season grasses, mechanisms of summer dormancy and drought stress tolerance, plant persistence, and forage quality issues. The goal of these studies will be to provide support for interpretation of applied experiments. Applied aspects of this research program will be conducted under controlled defoliation or grazing conditions. Expected Outputs: 1) Release of cultivars of summer-dormant cool-season grasses with improved forage production and persistence. 2) Introduction of summer-dormant cool-season grasses to grazing systems in the Southern Great Plains. 3) Understanding the mechanism of summer dormancy in grasses. 4) Release of bloat-safe forage wheat cultivars."

This research is linked to food safety and therefore has direct relevance to the mission of the AgBioResearch. While about 175 different types of foods have been documented to trigger an allergic reaction in sensitized subjects, 90% of food allergies are due to 8 major food types: Chicken egg, cow's milk, soybean, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, fish and shellfish. Notably, as reviewed recently, improved methods for predicting allergenicity of food proteins are critically needed. A promising approach is to test if a dietary protein might induce allergic reactions in a validated food allergy mouse model. However, a validated mouse model of food allergy is not available at present to evaluate allergenicity of novel foods. Consequently, development and validation of mouse models for assessment of allergenic potential of novel foods was identified as a critical need by experts. During the past 9 years, with the generous support of funding from the US EPA (two major grants), and the MAES/ABR we have made significant contribution to advancing this area of research. The objectives 1 and 2 of the proposed research, further advances this critical area of research. Besides direct application for assessment of allergenic potential of food, an animal model would have several other critical applications. First, a food allergy model should help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of allergic responses to food-derived proteins that are poorly understood at present. Second, development of effective therapeutic and preventive methods is also critically dependent on the availability of an in vivo disease model. Third, the role of environmental toxicants/dietary factors in induction/exacerbation/prevention of food allergy can be investigated using this model. Finally, this model can also be used to evaluate the impact of food processing on food allergenicity, focus of objective 3 of this proposal. In recognition of these outstanding needs and potential applications, our goal (next 5 years) is to further characterize and validate the mouse model for assessment of allergenic potential of novel foods such as genetically engineered foods and processed foods."

Weeds cost growers $30 million and $16 million annually in cotton and wheat, respectively. Italian ryegrass is the most troublesome weed in wheat in NC. It is very competitive with wheat, causes lodging, interferes with harvesting, and contaminates harvested grain. Dense populations of this weed are common, and wheat yield reductions of 50% or greater are common in uncontrolled populations. Presence of ryegrass seed also can lead to a substantial price dockage. Diclofop, an ACCase inhibitor, was widely used by wheat growers to effectively control Italian ryegrass for many years. Excessive reliance on diclofop led to selection of resistant biotypes. Mesosulfuron, an ALS inhibitor, has been widely used to control ryegrass since 2005. It was initially very effective, but growers are reporting control failures, and resistance is suspected. The problems are primarily in areas where diclofop resistance is known to occur, hence raising the possibility of multiple resistance. Research is needed to confirm resistance, determine if cross resistance to other ALS inhibitors occurs, and to determine if multiple resistance to ALS and ACCase inhibitors is present. Work is also needed to determine the distribution of resistance in the state. Additionally, growers need alternative management strategies for this problem weeds. The proposed research is expected to lead to effective management options for resistant ryegrass. Glyphosate resistance is also suspected in Italian ryegrass in parts of NC. This has the potential to become a very serious problem, as the weed is commonly found in the predominant no-till region of the state. Effective burndown before planting is necessary to avoid competition and yield reduction. Research is need to confirm resistance and to determine if these biotypes are resistant to other modes of action; this information will help direct educational programs. Research is needed to develop alternative burndown programs that are compatible with local farming practices. The proposed research should lead to effective alternatives for ryegrass burndwon in no-till, thus allowing growers to continue no-till planting. Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth was first found in NC in 2005. The resistant biotype is now widespread across the Coastal Plain and is suspected to be present in the Piedmont region. With essentially all the cotton being Roundup Ready, this weed has caused major problems for growers. Growers are spending an additional $30 to $50 per acre for herbicides, and many growers are also hand-weeding at an average cost $30 per acre. Inspite of this, the weed is still causing significant yield losses. Research must be ocntinued to refine management strategies using current technology to better control the weed and reduce losses. New technology, both herbicides and herbicide-resistant cotton, is being developed. Research is needed to determine how best to use the new technology so that educational programs can be developed that advise growers on how to use the new technology in a sustainable and cost-effective manner."

Data collected by the author (Shaik, S 2007a) from historical census of agriculture and the National Agricultural Statistical Services reveals that the number of farms in North Dakota has declined from 74,400 in 1910 to 30,300 in 2006. The corresponding acreage amount of farms in North Dakota increased from 28,427 thousand acres to 39,400 thousand acres leading to an increase in farm size from 382 acres to 1,300 acres. A century ago, North Dakota was overwhelmingly a wheat state; today the leading crops are oil crops. According to North Dakota Agricultural Statistical Service publication, the state ranks first in the production of barley, durum wheat, spring wheat, all dry edible beans, pinto beans, navy beans, sunflower, canola, flaxseed, oats, dry edible peas. It ranks second in all wheat, lentils and honey, third in sugar beets and rye; fourth in potatoes, and tenth in soybeans. The farm receipts increased from 0.257 billion nominal dollars in 1924 to 3.98 billion nominal dollars in 2006. During the same time period, the crop and livestock receipts increased from 0.197 and 0.60 billion nominal dollars to 3.089 and 0.897 billion nominal dollars respectively. These changes in North Dakota due to technological improvements, farm programs, farm crop insurance programs and public investments will be quantified for the fourteen (including the 2008 farm bill) major farm bills since 1933. The project will collect, construct and analyze original farm-level, county-level, state-level, and regional-level data utilizing statistical econometric, mathematical programming and/or simulation data to provide conclusions of the stated objectives. This project will also develop a ND agriculture sector database for the future researchers and the state."

J.",,0.0,803882299,NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY,WAHPETON,ND,58076-0001,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2012,,,"Justification: 1. Iron deficiency chlorosis is the most significant soil-related constraint to soybean production on poorly-drained soils of North Dakota. Soybeans often grow poorly on soils with CaCO3 in the topsoil, due to the inability of the plants to acquire iron from the soil, and related problems associated with inefficient transport of iron within the plant. It has been estimated that this disorder causes soybean yield losses valued $120,000,000 per year in the North Central USA. The anticipated practical outcome of this objective is the identification of cultural practices that help farmers reduce the severity of chlorosis on their fields. 2. Nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies are the most common nutrient deficiencies affecting wheat in North Dakota. We have observed significant variation in the phosphorus requirements of different wheat varieties. We believe that we have developed accurate greenhouse screening procedures for this trait. Even small savings would add up. North Dakota farmers apply an average of 35-40 lb/A of P2O5 equivalent to wheat, according to USDA statistics. If this value could be reduced by even 10 lb P2O5/A per year, the savings to North Dakota farmers would be significant. More importantly, if more phosphorus-efficient varieties were developed, the variation of yield due to inherent phosphorus variability across a field would be reduced. Also, with less phosphorus being applied, less phosphorus would be reach surface waters, providing an environmental benefit. 3. West of the Red River Valley, problems associated with poorly-drained soils, such as iron deficiency chlorosis, are much less common. Drought stress is the most common soil-related constraint to soybean production. A whole-season evapotranspiration of about 18 inches is possible with a vigorous, well-watered soybean crop. However, the supply of water, growing season precipitation plus stored soil water at the beginning of the growing season, usually falls short of that amount on well-drained soils. One cultural practice that has not been evaluated in this region is the use of antitranspirants, compounds that induce the plant to use less water. Reducing water use earlier in the season, in order to preserve stored soil water for later in the season, could help with the production of soybeans in central North Dakota. The use of antitranspirants has not been widely studied in the USA, but has been shown to increase yield of other crops in other countries under water-limiting conditions. A comprehensive screening of established antitranspirants in the greenhouse would be an inexpensive first step in the evaluation of this technology. It is likely that cultural practices for the mitigation of the effects of drought will be of intense interest in the next 10 years. The major biotech seed companies (Monsanto, Pioneer, etc.) are beginning to promise huge gains in drought resistance in corn, and this will likely lead to a broader interest in all aspects of this topic."

Optical molecular methods using a spectrometer enable measurement of quality of early generation wheat breeding lines.

Similarly, newly developed high-tech spectroscopic methods assist in optimizing production of flour in milling and in the industrial processing of mixed feed and food products. Analysis by microspectroscopic means is nonintrusive and carried out in situ within individual botanical parts of individual kernels. By identifying the secondary protein structure of a particular cultivar, a great deal can be revealed about its quality for end use. Assisting the current KAES wheat breeding program involves assessing the genetic expression produced as target traits are genetically introduced. The use of these microtechniques enables early generation quality measurement. As a result, the selection process may possibly be shortened, thereby increasing the efficiency of the typical, long multi-crop year breeding process."

Contracts covered 39% of the value of U.S. agricultural production in 2008, compared with 41% in 2005, 28% in 1991 and only 11% in 1969 (MacDonald and Korb, 2011). The inter-year decline in the use of contracts after 2005 is largely attributable to the change in the composition of agricultural production as prices and revenues for commodities less reliant on contracts rose sharply. Understanding and explaining the existence of great variety of contractual forms poses an enormous challenge for an applied economist. Why are some workers paid piece rates based on output while others are paid salaries for their input Why are all broiler chickens produced under production contracts between integrators and independent farmers and there are virtually no contracts in wheat Why are most of the chicken contracts short-term, whereas hog production contracts tend to be longer term All these questions straddle two research areas shared by labor (personnel) economics and industrial organization that are tightly related: incentives and hiring. A firm should choose its hiring policy (contracts) corresponding to the incentive structure it has in place and should select an incentives structure in line with people it strives to hire (contract with). The objective of this research program is to study the contract design problem as it appears in agriculture and food sectors, to develop methods that would allow the identification and estimation of econometric models, and to test predictions aimed at assessing the empirical reliability of these models. The expected outputs from the project are a number of academic journal articles, technical bulletins, chapters in books, extension publications and up to 4 Ph.D. dissertations."

Due to the harsh winters, spring wheat is primarily grown in North Dakota while comparatively little winter wheat is planted. However, winter wheat cultivation can be used to spread the farm workload since it is planted and harvested during periods with less competing field activities, while its earlier development in the spring results in higher yields than is obtained with spring wheat. Winter-hardiness is the most important adaptation trait in winter wheat. Its winter survival can be improved by planting in crop residue which traps snow, thus providing insulation from very low temperatures. In addition, minimum tillage reduces input costs, lessens wind and water erosion and provides a wild life refuge; however, it also improves the survival and spread of soil-borne pathogens and those that over-winter in crop residues. Agriculture is the largest industry in North Dakota with about 27.5 million acres devoted to crop production. The state contributes about 15% of the wheat (all types combined) produced in the US. During 2009 and 2010 winter wheat grown in North Dakota averaged 432,000 harvested acres per year that produced an annual average of 21.88 million bushels. For 2010 the value of production amounted to $98.56 million. Locally adapted cultivars are essential for sustaining output and it is furthermore possible to continue to improve winter-hardiness and adaptation, yield potential, seed protein content, milling and baking quality of new varieties through selection. Losses to wheat diseases and pests may also be reduced through breeding which is a highly effective and cost-saving alternative to chemicals. The project aims to assemble a winter wheat population from scratch that can be used indefinitely for breeding new disease resistant, winter-hardy cultivars of winter wheat with specific adaptation to North Dakota. Such a genetic resource can be added onto continually to potentially yield the increasingly more sophisticated cultivars that will be demanded by climate change and a rapidly growing global population. This genetic resource will be developed by making use of modern plant breeding methodologies and therefore clearly also constitutes a very valuable platform for graduate training."

The phenomenal increase in atopic diseases, such as asthma and respiratory disorders in children, in recent years necessitates doubling our efforts on food protein-related allergy prevention strategies in infants. Cow&#39;s milk protein allergy alone affects about 2.5% of children under the age of three. A significant number of infants who are allergic to cow&#39;s milk protein also concomitantly develop soy protein allergy. The allergic reactions manifest in the form of skin irritation, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. In severe cases, it leads to life threatening anaphylactic reactions. The allergenicity of milk, egg, wheat, and soy proteins in children is attributed mainly to the IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Using physical, chemical, and biochemical modifications, it is possible to eliminate the immune-reactive epitopes of milk proteins and develop food products that are suitable for feeding children with severe milk protein allergy. In this respect, while thermal denaturation could decrease and/or eliminate the allergenicity of conformational epitopes of protein allergens, it alone cannot eliminate the allergy caused by sequence-specific linear epitopes. Systematic studies are needed on physical, chemical, and enzymatic modification, and/or combination thereof of food proteins to produce novel protein products with non-native structures, branched-chain structures, and sequence-disrupted epitopes, so that they contain no or reduced allergic properties but possess the molecular characteristics necessary for imparting sensory and functional properties in food matrices. In the proposed research, milk proteins will be first hydrolyzed using novel proteases and the protein hydrolysate will be subsequently polymerized using transglutaminase to produce epitope-disrupted branched neo-polypeptides with potentially low allergenicity."

In addition, decades of research and marketing development at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the School of Pharmacy of the University of Mississippi, and at the Mississippi State University have laid a firm ground for agricultural production of many medicinal plants in the state. The Ole Miss National Center for Natural Products Research has established a repertoire of medicinal plants that grow well in Mississippi, including Echinacea barley grass, wheat grass, boneset, catnip, skullcap, feverfew, Joe Pye weed, lemon grass and passion flower (Dr. Aruna Weerasooriya, personal communication). The center has also helped to establish a grower's cooperative to receive and market the herbs, and provides quality assessment and certification to growers. The Mississippi state university has also established many medicinal plant crops such as American mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum), from which the effective ingredient of two cytostatic drugs (etoposide and teniposide), Podophyllotoxin, is derived. It is thus imperative for Alcorn State University, as an 1890 land-grant university serving limited-resource farmers in Mississippi, to initiate pertinent research on medicinal plants in collaboration with the two larger Mississippi universities to help limited-resource farmers to grow medicinal plants as alternative cash crops. After consultation with the National Center for Natural Products Research, the Center for Biotechnology & Genomics at Alcorn State University propose to initiate horticulture and biotechnology research on the Danshen plant (Salvia miltiorrhiza), and waterleaf (Tilinum fruticosum) aiming at promoting their cultivation as alternative cash crops for limited resource farmers in Mississippi. The proposed research is aiming at establishing an agro-technological package for optimal and cost-effective crop production of Danshen by local limited-resource farmers. This is expected to be completed in two stages of a four-year period for two crops (Note: this proposal is focused on research at the first stage). This package should enable regular farmers to be able to initiate a S. miltiorrhiza crop with some assistance from an extension agent. The proposed research is also aimed at establishing a Danshen hairy root culture within the first year. Further optimization of culture conditions and various elicitors for maximal production of bioactive phytochemicals will follow in the next two years towards establishing a bioreactor culture."

New predictive methods need to be developed for food functional quality traits in view of limited sample sizes available from breeding programs. Large numbers of samples need to be evaluated for screening in the selection process. A quality evaluation program therefore has to be multi pronged. The establishment of a Crop Quality lab (CQL)in South Dakota State University equiped with modern equipment provides further opportunities for development of products and ingredients that reduce the risk of disease (obesity, heart diseseae, colon cancer, etc). Behavior modification in diet and nutrition is made easier by the availability of ingredients that enhance the acceptability and taste of new products.

Stealthy ingredients that are not perceived by the consumer ensure product acceptability. Expected Outcomes: Data produced by the CQL will be easily understood and used in decision-making by breeders, producers, and potential users of our wheat products. New predictive methods will be developed to reduce the samples sizes needed as well as to provide meaningful information to the breeders for informed decision-making.

In addition to causing loss of the grain head, infection with FHB leaves contaminating mycotoxins which are harmful to human and animal health. Screens of wheat and barley accessions and wild relatives have revealed very few natural sources of disease resistance to FHB. The lack of natural FHB resistance in breeding populations creates an opportunity to engineer resistance through the expression of transgenes. A major problems is that functional assay of genes in wheat and barley is time consuming and expensive. We have developed an assay system using a model plant species that allows the properties of genes to be quickly and inexpensively tested. This approach has helped define a number of genes whose over-expression or knockout can enhance resistance to FHB. Genes that perform well in the model system are selected for introduction into wheat and barley using existing methods of crop transformation. These plants can then be assayed for improved FHB resistance in the field. Mycotoxin contamination of crops causes harm to humans and animals. Although the cellular targets of some of the mycotoxins are known, it is clear that these toxins can affect a number of different cellular activities. By examining the effects of these toxins in genetically tractable animal model systems, we are able to define which processes the toxin interferes with. Moreover, this approach can be used to set up screens for natural and synthetic compounds that protect against the effects of FHB-related mycotoxins. This approach should be useful for devising novel strategies to protect livestock and humans from the harmful effects of FHB-derived mycotoxins"

Interestingly, the orthologs of this gene control vernalization/cold-induced flowering in wheat and barley, which are long-day, cool-season grasses. This exciting discovery facilitates the search for functional diversity at Ma1 and interacting loci across diverse sorghum germplasm.

These yield increases are due to a combination of both improved cultural practices as well as genetic improvement. Studies have estimated that improved wheat varieties are responsible for 28 to 55% of yield increases. Wheat pathogens are also under genetic control and as acreage of a resistant variety increases, selection for a virulent race of a pathogen will occur to attack the resistant variety. Therefore, a continuous breeding and testing program is necessary to identify superior, resistant cultivars. The absence of aggressive breeding programs would not only slow the yield progress provided by new varieties but would also result in additional yield losses as current varieties become more susceptible to diseases and pests. In addition, environmental stresses can have a large impact on wheat yields and end-use quality. In Arkansas, these stresses include vegetative and reproductive stage waterlogging and cold temperatures. The University of Arkansas' wheat breeding program has historically stressed variety development through the use of adapted crosses to maximize efficiency while continuing to broaden the genetic base of the program to guard against genetic vulnerability and limited genetic improvement. Similar to other regional breeding programs, there is a strong focus on breeding for improved and durable disease resistance which results in high yielding, adapted varieties and germplasm for crosses. Prevalent diseases in Arkansas include stripe rust, leaf rust, Fusarium head blight, and leaf spot/blotch. In the breeding program, a multi-environmental approach is used so that breeding material is grown under high disease pressure on a yearly basis and resistant material can be selected. This approach also allows for selection of lines adapted to different soil types and for tolerance to environmental factors such as waterlogging and extreme cold. Increasing the yield potential of wheat is vital and the development of new tools for plant breeders to use for genetic improvement can aid in this process. Physiological based breeding tools are currently garnering attention as a way to make substantial gains in yield through introgression of novel alleles that may not be incorporated via phenotypic selection alone and these tools are becoming established for abiotic stresses such as drought and heat. Examples include the use of canopy temperature (CT) measurements as a diagnostic marker for plant water status and the use of carbon isotope discrimination to identify drought tolerant cultivars. The use of spectral reflectance measurements, such as the normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) or water indices, to assess plant nitrogen status, plant biomass or predict yield is another example of the utility of these tools. The development of physiological tools to assess plant stress under Arkansas growing conditions and soil types will aid in the development of superior cultivars."

The small grain-soybean double-cropping system includes planting winter barley or wheat in October through November, harvesting that crop in June, and planting soybean immediately following small grain harvest. Full-season soybean yields more than soybean double-cropped after wheat, but double-cropped small grain-soybean systems as a whole were more profitable than full-season soybean in Kansas and Virginia. In addition to greater profitability, double-cropping systems provide additional environmental benefits by providing winter cover that reduces offsite soil and nutrient movement and by utilizing nutrients that were unused by the previous summer crop, which could otherwise leach into groundwater. Finally, double cropping soybean after small grain production allows for more total grain production in a time when global demand is increasing.Although benefits of double-cropping are clear, it is necessary to continue annual yield improvement with this system. Several issues put double-cropped soybean at a disadvantage over full-season systems. Global warming or stresses resulting from increasing temperatures may put double-cropped soybean at a disadvantage, as most of this crop's early-season growth will occur during the warmest times of the season. Pest management practices for double-cropped soybean may need re-evaluation since this crop will mature later in the year when incidence of insect pests and disease is greater. Breeders may have unknowingly selected for traits (related or unrelated to environmental changes) that favor full-season production systems. If so, such physiological traits must be identified and better understood. Finally, new ideas to increase crop growth rate in the vegetative stages and extend the seed filling period (recognized as a problem in double-cropping systems) are needed to ensure adequate leaf area development and light capture. In 2011, Mid-Atlantic (PA, DE, MD, VA, NC, SC) producers planted over 780,000 hectares of small grain, most of which will be double-cropped with soybean and valued at over $700 million. Yearly increases in soybean yield must be maintained if double-cropping systems are to remain productive and profitable. To maintain a yield trend similar to the national average, a 30 kg ha-1 yield increase per year for double-cropped soybean is needed. There is a need to evaluate methods to increase early growth and yield of double-cropped soybean. The underlying physiological mechanisms restricting yield improvement, the vegetative response to N and inoculation, and the potential yield response to foliar fungicides of double-cropped soybean need investigation."

Management practices that promote soil conservation, for example, may be profitable in one climatic zone but may not be successful in another. To better understand how climate interacts with management, we will study the impact of conventional and conservation management practices on two related indicators of soil quality- earthworms and soil organic matter (SOM) across a climatic gradient that defines the wheat producing region of the Inland Pacific Northwest (IPNW). Sites with paired conservation and conventional management practices (till and no-till, for example) will be located in each recognized climatic zone across the region. Soil samples will be collected at the same time that earthworms are sampled. General soil characterization will be carried out in the laboratory and earthworms will be counted, weighed and identified to species and/or functional groups. Earthworm density and diversity will be related to both climate and management. Limitations to earthworm activity will be determined by analyzing data collected from across the region. Soil samples will be analyzed to determine trends in SOM that may be related to climate, management and, potentially, earthworm activity. A similar, but scaled back approach will be taken to understanding SOM dynamics in differently managed rangeland systems within the state of Idaho. Overall this project will produce data that can be used to develop climatic-zone appropriate management practices that promote SOM storage and long-term soil quality."

Of particular concern is the Potyviridae family, which causes 30% of the most damaging crop viral diseases and responsible to up to 60-100% of crop losses in the US and worldwide. This family encompasses one of the major threats in potato production and seed potato certification, here in Wisconsin, Potato virus Y, with its new emerging tuber necrotic strains, which make it difficult for growers to identify in the field and can results in seed downgrading or rejection. The aim of this proposal is to harness tools in biology and in bioinformatic to study potyviral infection to understand of mechanism of viral pathogen resistance and contribute in safe and effective control of viral pathogens. Recessive resistance genes have been reported as another efficient barrier against plant viral infection and open door for exploitation in plant breeding. While the precise role of the reported recessive genes against potyviral infections has yet to be determined, these host factors have been implicated in translation and as a requirement for successful viral infection of a large variety of agronomically important crops like tomato, pepper, lettuce, pea, wheat and recently potato. The objective of this research project delves into the mechanistic details of RNA viral elements in translation and in the larger context of viral replication and plant virus resistance. Untranslated regions of many RNA virus genomes are known to harbor important functional elements, acting at the RNA primary sequence or secondary or tertiary structure. Such elements may be involved in various aspects of the viral lifecycle. This research proposal address questions  basic to the problems of agriculture in its broadest aspects  and aims to contribute to our knowledge of plant disease resistance genes in agronomical crops by investigating the basic molecular mechanism of viral translation and replication and their requirement for those translation factors. The research from this project will not only be beneficial for other researchers working on viral translation regulation, but it is key and first ground step to study plant virus resistance and resistance durability if exploited in plant breeding."

Long term studies in the Arkansas Valley averaged 22% grain yield loss to this pest. In spite of its long history of developing resistance to miticides, chemical control remains the only viable management tactic. Yield loss data will be used to refine Banks grass mite management guidelines to reflect changes in corn hybrid characteristics and availability of water for agricultural use. The brown wheat mite has been recognized as a pest of wheat in Colorado and surrounding states since the mid 1950s. Little is known about its effects on wheat yield and quality. This uncertainty makes treatment decisions difficult and financially risky. Wheat producers are of the opinion that brown wheat mite has become a more consistent problem over the past few years. The ability to mass rear brown wheat mite would allow controlled infestations and subsequent determination of a yield loss function for this pest in winter wheat. The wheat stem sawfly, long considered a severe pest of wheat in Montana, North Dakota and the Prairie Provinces, was found infesting wheat along Highway 14 in Weld County in 2010 and 2011. It is unknown how far into Colorado the problem will spread. While wheat stem sawfly is found throughout Colorado, infestations in winter wheat currently are limited to a small area in northern Weld County. Abundance and distribution data in winter wheat over the next few years will be used to help set priorities for responding to this problem in the wheat breeding and entomology programs."

Therefore, tolerance to limited soil moisture is an important goal of CSU's wheat breeding program. Efforts to improve genetic tolerance to these stresses are limited by variability of field and weather conditions, lack of knowledge of the genes or chromosome regions controlling stress tolerance, and lack of information on the relationships among various physiological/biochemical indicators of stress and grain yield. Better end-use quality is another high priority goal for Colorado wheat varieties to maintain competitiveness in a global marketplace that places increasing importance on quality. Through a variety of approaches this project is attempting to develop germplasm and information that will assist CSU's wheat breeding program develop more drought tolerant cultivars. White mold and Fusarium wilt of common bean are serious disease problems in the High Plains region of Colorado and neighboring states, with annual yield losses reaching 30% in some areas. Exploitation of genetic resistance is considered the most feasible control method. Molecular markers closely linked with disease resistance will speed the development of resistant bean cultivars. Canola and related species are potential biofuel crops in Colorado.

Estimates of savings to U.S. soybean growers that have resulted from activities associated with the soybean rust component of the PIPE vary greatly (e.g., Roberts et al 2006, Dorrance et al. 2007) and include a conservative calculation of approximately $200 million per year (Giesler and Hershman 2007). In anticipation of the possible incursion of new wheat stem rust races (Ug99) into North America and recent concern over the regional spread of southern corn rust, the IAMS has been expanded to forecast the aerial transport of these diseases in North America (Russo and Isard 2011, USDA 2011). Information on aphid transmission of soybean dwarf virus and adaptation to soybean crops will be useful in determining the risk of SbDV populations moving from widespread indigenous clover hosts into soybean crops on an epidemic scale. This information will be useful for disease risk analysis and development of epidemiological models of virus spread. Integration of host defense response in plants together with the use of environmentally friendly compounds represents the most sustainable method for controlling plant diseases rather than relying totally on fungicides. Information about the host defense response in perennial ryegrass would be useful in developing an integrated disease management strategy using novel compounds as well as compounds that are already known to elicit immune response in other plants. The epidemiological study of gray leaf spot of perennial ryegrass turf implies a deeper understanding of the relationship of environmental factors with gray leaf spot epidemics (Uddin et al. 2003). The results of the research will provide insights into disease forecasting model and integration of novel cultural practices, which will reduce the heavy reliance of fungicide application of gray leaf spot. Molecular tools are not currently widely used in the turfgrass industry. Therefore, the implementation of a molecular technique to accurately quantify dollar spot DNA and predict disease epidemics will provide turfgrass managers with a new resource to combat dollar spot, as more money is spent annually for the control of this disease on high input turfgrass than any other disease (Viji et al., 2004; Vargas, 1994). Additionally, use of molecular tools would aid in the practice of integrated pest management and to reduce the use of unnecessary fungicide applications."

While not limiting in typical Western diets, thiamin deficiencies are common in developing countries where people subsist on diets consisting primarily of polished grains and seed products. By increasing thiamin levels in the seeds of important subsistence crop species such as rice and wheat, we can make a positive impact on human nutrition and global food security. In regards to abiotic stress tolerance, it has been shown that high thiamin containing seeds are better able to germinate and survive under environmental stress conditions including high and low temperature, drought and saline conditions. Seedlings stress tolerance in particularly important during the spring planting season in Nevada's high desert regions where dramatic temperature shifts are common. By engineering seeds for elevated thiamin, we will increase the nutritional value of seeds while at the same time increasing the survivability of the following generation's crop. The proposed research will significantly benefit global food security by leading to the development of more nutritious and stress tolerant food crops.

The identification of such genes offers the possibility to more fully understand the mechanisms of Fusarium susceptibility and to design transgenic strategies to increase FHB resistance in barley and wheat. We are using activating tagging to identify genes which confer resistance to trichothecenes. Activation tagging uses a modified T-DNA vector which contains multiple copies of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S gene enhancer arranged in tandem. In addition to knocking out genes, the modified T-DNA vector can also function as an enhancer when inserted either upstream or downstream of a gene to produce gain-of-function phenotypes. Using this approach, we have screened ~250,000 activation tagged Arabidopsis seeds for resistance to trichothecin and identified 30 lines that showed resistance. Characterization of one of these lines identified two novel lipid transfer protein (LTP) genes, designated as LTP4 and LTP5, which were overexpressed compared to the wild-type control. LTPs are small cysteine-rich proteins that transfer lipids between membranes in vitro. These results validated activation tagging as a valuable strategy to identify candidate plant genes for trichothecene resistance. The primary goal of this application is to determine if the novel genes identified from the activation tagging screen in Arabidopsis will confer resistance to DON and FHB in transgenic wheat and barley plants."

CVD is a major public health concern with an associated health care cost of approximately $503.2 billion and is the leading cause of death in the United States each year. Oklahoma ranks fourth in the nation in terms of death due to CVD with approximately 10,000 deaths in 2006 and an estimated associated cost of approximately $4 billion. Two of the major contributing factors to CVD include type II diabetes and obesity. In Oklahoma, approximately 30.4% of the adult population is classified as obese and ~10% have been diagnosed with diabetes. Based on these alarming statistics, it becomes apparent that CVD is having a significant impact on the quality of life of many Oklahomans along with the economic burden it represents to our state healthcare system. Therefore, it is imperative to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies to alleviate or reduce the impact of CVD in our state. Scientific evidence that has accumulated over the past decade has demonstrated that adipose tissue has endocrine functions in the body. In the case of obesity or excess adipose tissue, many pro-inflammatory mediators are produced that create a state of chronic inflammation. It is now understood that it is this chronic inflammatory state that accounts for many of the co-morbidities associated with obesity, including CVD and type II diabetes. There are a number of pharmacological agents that are used in the treatment of inflammation, including both steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents; however, these drugs are often associated with side-effects such as gastrointestinal, renal and hepatic complications. A non-pharmacological approach of reducing inflammation without the associated side-effects would be highly desirable. Investigating the role of natural products that are effective, inexpensive, and easily incorporated into daily regimen is one very appealing option. The approach of using natural products or their bioactive components to reduce or prevent chronic disorders has been the long-term goal of our laboratory. In this application, we propose to study the anti-inflammatory effects of wheat germ oil (WGO) which has been purified and characterized here at Oklahoma State University. We expect that because of the synergistic effects of the bioactive components found in WGO, WGO will have more potent anti-inflammatory effects than the purified compounds under both normal and inflammatory conditions in both human macrophages and endothelial cells. We also expect that WGO will alter the expression of key genes involved in the inflammatory response."

Stink bugs can also be a serious pest in corn, particularly adjacent to wheat. Because of the widespread pest status of stink bugs across multiple crops in the United States, particularly in the southeast, it is imperative that alternative management strategies be developed to reduce yield loss and the use of broad spectrum pyrethroid or organophosphate insecticides. The use of jasmonic acid to increase the natural control of stink bugs will be investigated as an alternative. Improving our understanding of insect dispersal (stink bugs, kudzu bugs, cereal leaf beetles) among crop and non-crop habitats will help to develop environmentally friendly management practices. Every corn field in South Carolina suffers from insect associated yield loss. Transgenic Bt. corn hybrids can help to reduce insect injury and have been widely adopted in the U.S. Recent trends in the corn industry are to stack multiple transgenic Bt traits for insect control by cross-licensing traits among the companies. With such a diversity of available Bt hybrids in corn, it is necessary to not only assess the efficacy of these products for growers, but also to determine the impact of these traits on the biology of target pests. Resistance management to Bt corn is a hot topic right now in the US, with corn rootworms now resistant to a Bt trait in parts of the midwest. Life history studies will be conducted to help identify changes in susceptibility of key pests to Bt toxins produced in transgenic corn in South Carolina. The exotic plataspid, Megacopta cribraria, commonly known as the kudzu bug, is now causing significant yield loss to soybean in South Carolina, with an average of 21% yield loss in untreated soybean plots and a maximum of 49% based on trials in South Carolina and Georgia. To reduce economic yield losses, growers currently rely on the application of broad spectrum insecticides. For correct decision making, growers and scouts need to use effective sampling procedures and use adequate numbers of samples per field. No research has been conducted on soybean to optimize sampling plans for this invasive pest. Precise sampling plans will help in managing this new pest. Research on the ecology of this new invasive pest will help to develop environmentally friendly control strategies."

In 2008, Louisiana faced the destructive insect-vectored plant pathogen, citrus greening which is transmitted by Asian citrus psyllid. Finding of citrus greening resulted in a quarantine of citrus stock sales in two Louisiana parishes (Orleans and Washington). This disease can affect yield, leading to decline and eventual tree death. If citrus greening reaches Plaquemines parish, the leading citrus-producing parish in Louisiana, a total loss of gross farm value would be $4.1 million. In addition, potential new insect vectored plant disease threats exist for Louisiana, such as laurel wilt a fungus pathogen transmitted by the redbay ambrosia beetle. Without an IPM strategy for insect vectored plant pathogens, losses to Louisiana agriculture could be immense. Of EIDs, plant viruses compromise the largest group (47%). Plant viruses can adversely affect agricultural production, being costly to both grower and consumer by limiting yield and impacting quality. For example, the two most important virus pathogens affecting potato production are Potato virus Y (PVY) and Potato leafroll virus (PLRV). These aphid transmitted viruses can reduce yields by as much as 80% with a net loss of $2 billion per year. In sweetpotato, aphid transmitted viruses reduced yields by 30 to 40%. For Louisiana sweetpotato, this could be a potential loss of $16 million. Interactions with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (whitefly transmitted) and Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (aphid transmitted) can cause up to 90% loss. Barley yellow dwarf virus and Cereal yellow dwarf virus, two luteovirues infecting wheat, can reduce yields by 20% in the Midwest. For Louisiana, this could result in $5.2 million. One of the main reasons plant viruses are on the rise is due to changes in vector populations. Of the 531 known vectors of plant viruses, 85% are transmitted by insects and of those, 37% are transmitted by aphids. In North America, the single biggest change in vector populations has been the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura. This has had a profound impact on seed potato production in the Midwest. Current environmental conditions and global climate change favor aphid population growth and thus, favor increased virus transmission. Clearly, viruses and virus vectors can have an incredible impact on U.S. agriculture. To effectively manage insect-vectored pathogens, knowledge of the interactions between the susceptible hosts, viable virus inoculum, favorable environment and insect vector are needed. For most agricultural production systems, these interactions are poorly understood."

Their primary commercial uses include pulpwood, engineered lumber products, and bioenergy. Because of their rapid growth characteristics, easy clonal propagation, and strong response to silvicultural treatments, Populus species and their hybrids are commonly grown in short-rotation intensive culture to meet ever-increasing global demand for fiber products. However, widespread adoption of short-rotation intensive poplar production is hindered by the occurrence of several foliar and stem infecting pathogens. For instance, Septoria leaf spot and stem canker is one of the most serious diseases affecting hybrid poplars in biomass plantations in the northeastern United States and Canada. Biomass losses due to this pathogen can be as high as 63% of total yield in a plantation. Therefore, it is pivotal to generate disease resistant clones to ensure plantation success. Previously we identified three candidate genes that have the potential to confer disease resistance: i. a wheat oxalate oxidase gene, OXO; ii. a synthetic antimicrobial peptide gene, ESF39; and iii. a Chinese chestnut laccase gene. We have also generated transgenic poplar trees carrying these candidate genes either individually or in combinations. Here, we propose to evaluate disease resistance of the transgenic poplar plants to leaf spot diseases caused by the fungi, Septoria musiva, Marsonnina spp. and Melampsora medusae; as well as stem canker caused by S. musiva in the greenhouse and laboratory. We also propose to grow transgenic poplars along with six wild-type clones in a field trial at Clemson University and evaluate their performance in terms of growth and disease resistance. Gene expression profiling between resistant and susceptible clones will be compared to identify candidate genes that can be useful in conferring disease resistance in poplars and other species.

Since 1985 when M. oryzae first appeared on wheat in Brazil, blast has become a major constraint to wheat production in several South American countries. It is critical to prevent establishment of wheat blast in the U.S. Disease control is complicated by the lack of a clear understanding of how the disease develops and spreads in the field, by extreme variability shown by the fungus and by unknowns associated with climate change. We will apply knowledge gained through previous research and cloned blast resistance genes for disease control, including developing methods for choosing effective resistance genes and rapidly deploying them, methods for forecasting disease risk and informing farmers of the best control options, and novel methods to control disease by turning off fungal genes needed for disease. Although genetic resistance is the most effective way to control blast diseases, high-yielding rice varieties preferred by U.S. farmers generally lack resistance. These varieties require expensive fungicide applications when weather conditions favor disease. There is urgent need for efficient strategies to move new resistance (R) genes into elite rice varieties while maintaining yield and quality. We will develop cisgenic technology, in which only rice DNA sequences are introduced, to precisely incorporate resistance genes into elite rice varieties. Adoption of cisgenic rice by U.S. farmers requires consumer acceptance in the U.S. as well as in Europe and other import markets. We will assess consumer attitudes in the U.S. and Europe toward cisgenic rice, as compared to transgenic rice in which some non-rice DNA sequences are also introduced. Strategies for promoting consumer acceptance will be developed based on this assessment. In contrast, few wheat blast resistance genes have been identified. We address this with strategies to identify wheat resistance genes through field tests of U.S. wheat varieties against native pathogen populations in South America. We will also test if moving rice resistance genes into wheat will provide effective wheat blast resistance. Development and use of a blast forecasting model will inform farmers if and when they need to apply fungicides, and will warn first responders when the weather is right for wheat blast disease to occur. Understanding wheat blast biology and training a first-responder network will enable rapid detection and response to any wheat blast outbreaks in the U.S. We will also develop novel strategies for blast control based on designing plants that block the fungus from expressing genes it needs to cause disease. Our extension programs will produce publications and workshops to inform extension specialists, farmers and other first responders about wheat blast and the novel disease management strategies. We will design and implement educational activities to attract undergraduate students to careers in plant pathology and in plant biosecurity."

In the southern half of the region, wheat, grown to supplement forage for livestock, adds significantly to the dramatic importance of wheat to the economic vitality of the region. Our stakeholders have identified wheat viruses as a major priority that constrains wheat production. Through this project we will develop a forecasting model that will improve growers ability to anticipate and take action to improve sustainability of wheat production systems. We also will deploy that model through Extension and educational curricula. To this end, we will pursue these objectives 1) develop a risk assessment and disease forecasting model that can be used to predict the risk for virus disease development in wheat and enable more effective management decisions, 2) determine the impact of environmental conditions, alternate hosts, and management tactics on vector population dynamics and subsequent disease incidence and risk in geographically and environmentally diverse production regions across the Great Plains, 3) identify primary interactions that occur in this wheat-mite-virus complex across the region, 4) increase producer implementation of integrated management principles for the wheat-mite-virus complex across the Great Plains, 5) develop student (graduate, undergraduate, G4-12 science teachers, and their students) training opportunities and resources that encompass the management of this wheat-mite-virus complex to demonstrate the principles of biology, ecology, and IPM, and 6) externally evaluate the impact of the research, extension and education objectives of the project. The outcomes of this project will be the development of a risk assessment model that will enhance the growers ability to make efficient management decisions related to this wheat-mite-virus complex.

There is a critical need to minimize the risk of foodborne pathogens in low-moisture foods by incorporating a lethality step in the last leg of production processes. Radio frequency (RF) waves heat these products rapidly and volumetrically and therefore we propose to develop a high temperature short time RF process. Heating non-uniformity and arcing have been the major issues limiting the successful deployment of RF process technology. We propose modeling as a tool to develop guidelines for design of RF applicators and design of continuous treatment systems (pumps for paste and conveying and packaging systems for powders) to improve heating uniformity and therefore food safety. The overall hypothesis is that computer aided design of RF process system will result in improved heating uniformity which will facilitate development of high temperature short time RF treatments for enhanced microbiological safety of the products. The specific objective are to: 1) develop continuous RF processing system for in-package powder (wheat flour) and pumpable food pastes (peanut butter) by using computer simulation as tool for designing applicator and package configuration for uniform heating, 2) determine RF process parameters based on microbial inactivation kinetics and product quality deterioration kinetics, and 3) validate process design with microbial challenge study. The successful development of RF processing for two products will wide open the application of this technology in to other low moisture food products. Development of this RF-based lethality step will improve microbiological safety and will give a competitive edge to US food processers in global market."

Approach: This cooperative project between the ARS (Bushland and Lubbock, Texas), Kansas State University, Texas A&M University, Texas Tech University, and West Texas A&M University, elucidates innovative management technologies appropriate for the Ogallala Aquifer region of the U.S. to enhance and sustain rural economies. The results are applicable to other areas in which there is increasing demands on the water supply.  The in-research program addresses issues related to water management practices in cropping and integrated crop-livestock systems, and irrigation management and automation for increased water use efficiency (WUE). Knowledge of the processes affecting soil water content during a growing season will facilitate refinement of models to simulate water balance and assist in assessing the merits of alternative practices. Longer-term studies will be used to quantify effects of reduced tillage on crop yield, WUE, and soil physical characteristics for wheat-sorghum-fallow crop rotations and alternative cropping sequences.  Several experiments focusing on different hydrological aspects and time scales will investigate management effects on soil water and availability to crops utilizing watershed, remote sensing, and meteorological networks.  Research approaches related to irrigation management include determinations of crop water use by weighing lysimeters, neutron scattering methods, etc. Experiments include variations in irrigation methods, irrigation amount, tillage, and/or crop and crop rotation. Automatic irrigation systems based on sensing of crop water status are being engineered and tested. Remote sensing approaches to water use prediction are expected to improve their utility in decision making by farm managers, irrigation projects or water districts, and policy makers. University partners have critical roles in supporting the above activities as well as providing additional expertise in technology transfer, hydrology and economic assessments of existing and future water conservation technologies and policies. Support from cooperating university is evaluated annually. Work plans are developed for each project describing research to be conducted during a 2-year period. Yearly workshops are held with stakeholders and cooperating scientists; these workshops are used to review progress, re-define or clarify research priorities, and inform stakeholders, project leaders and administrators. Annual and final reports are used to document progress of the research."

Stripe rust of barley can cause significant yield loss in the western U.S. The long-term goal of this project is to reduce losses in wheat and barley yield and quality caused by stripe rust and assure stable, sustainable production while protecting the environment. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding virulence compositions of the pathogen population, identification of new sources of resistance, disease forecasting, and control of the disease using fungicides in recent years. However, more research is needed to monitor dynamic changes of virulent races, obtain better knowledge of resistance genes in elite germplasm, to identify more genes for effective resistance, and to develop molecular markers for use in the efficient incorporation of new genes into wheat and barley cultivars. For the next five years, we will conduct research to achieve the following objectives: 1). Use molecular markers and host plant responses to characterize and differentiate current and emergent virulent races of the stripe rust pathogens of wheat and barley. 2). Determine the distribution, nature, and effectiveness of host plant resistance genes amongst elite wheat and barley germplasm. 3). Identify and determine linkage relationships of new major and minor stripe rust resistance genes, and develop molecular markers for application in wheat and barley breeding efforts. Accomplishment of these objectives will lead to improved knowledge of the disease epidemiology, more resistance genes and germplasm, and more effective technology to achieve sustainable control of stripe rust.  Approach: Rust survey will be conducted in commercial fields, monitoring nurseries, trap plots, and experimental plots of wheat and barley, as well as wild grasses, during the plant growing-season. Rust samples will be collected by collaborators and us during rust survey. Stripe rust samples will be tested in our laboratory for race identification. New races will be tested on genetic stocks, breeding lines, and commercial cultivars to determine their danger potential. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers will be used to characterize races and populations of the stripe rust pathogens.          All germplasm and breeding nurseries of wheat and barley will be evaluated in two locations: Pullman (eastern Washington) and Mt. Vernon (western Washington) under natural infection of the stripe rust pathogens.  Uniform regional nurseries and cultivar monitoring nurseries, which include currently grown cultivars and advanced breeding lines from all U.S. regions and important stripe rust resistance stocks, will be tested with selected races at seedling stage under the low temperature profile (4-20C) and at adult-plant stage under the high temperature profile (10-30C) for determine race-specific all-stage resistance and/or non-race-specific high-temperature adult-plant resistance in wheat and barley germplasm.  Stripe rust resistance genes in elite germplasm will be determined or postulated by testing elite lines, together with single resistance gene lines, with a series of races that will be selected to distinguish important genes; analyzing the pedigrees of the elite lines; testing elite lines, together with known gene lines, with molecular markers associated with particular genes; and conducting genetic studies to identify and map new genes.         To identify and map new genes for effective resistance to stripe rust in wheat.  Crosses have been made with resistant germplasm lines with a susceptible line. The recombinant inbred line s of these crosses will be phenotyped for stripe rust resistance in fields and also in the greenhouse with selected races and genotyped with resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP), SSR, and SNP markers.  The phenotypic and genotypic data will be used to map the resistance gene(s) or QTL in each cross.  New genes will be identified based on their resistant types, reactions to various races, and chromosomal locations in comparison with previously reported genes."

Fusarium head blight (FHB) has been ranked as one of the greatest threats to the production of wheat and barley.  This project is focused on identifying the wheat genes with essential functions in FHB resistance.  This will be accomplished using a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay which can down-regulate, or “knockdown” the expression of chosen genes so that their function can be inferred from the phenotypic change.  This functional assay for genes involved in FHB resistance has been validated and a key role for genes in the ethylene-signaling pathway has already been established.  In the next 5 years of work, we will conduct an in depth survey for genes functioning in FHB resistance, and determine if these genes can be used to engineer improved levels of FHB resistance.   Objective 1:  Determine if over-expression of genes involved in the ethylene signaling pathway can confer improved resistance to Fusarium head blight in wheat.   Objective 2: Determine whether pathogen recognition receptors have essential roles in Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat.    Objective 3: Test if elevated expression of pathogen recognition receptors can be used to improve resistance to Fusarium head blight and other fungal pathogens of wheat.    Objective 4: Determine expression of genes in floral tissue from FHB resistant and susceptible wheat genotypes as they respond to challenge by Fusarium graminearum.  Subobjectives 4A and 4B: A. Employ VIGS to test if the candidate genes identified in the RNA-seq survey encode proteins with functions that are critical for FHB resistance in wheat.  B.  If new genes encoding functions essential for FHB resistance are identified initiate transgenic studies to test if they can be used to improve FHB resistance.  Approach: This project is designed to identify the key genes involved in resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB), and where possible, test if these genes can be utilized to improve FHB resistance.  The project will utilize RNA-seq technology to identify candidate genes with possible roles in FHB resistance and susceptibility.  Candidate genes will be tested by virus-induced gene silencing to assess whether or not they have functional roles in FHB resistance.  Two genetic pathways, ethylene-signaling and pathogen-associated molecular pattern-induced signaling, have already been identified as having significant roles in FHB resistance, and will therefore be an important focus for this research.  Genes in these pathways and others will be utilized in transgenic experiments attempting to improve FHB resistance."

Research is focused on genetic variation in both the host cereals and their rust pathogens that determine the resistance/susceptible phenotype of the interaction. Isolates of rust fungi obtained from annual surveys of the wheat, barley, and oat crops are used to inform the breeding process. Successful control of cereal rusts with host resistance cannot be achieved without knowledge of variation in cereal rust populations. Studies of virulence and molecular variation in cereal rust populations can answer questions that range from the applied, such as which host resistance genes are effective against the current rust population and what resistance genes are in current cereal cultivars, to more basic questions like what are the origins of new races and how do they spread. Discovery of the molecular  Approach: Cereal rust fungi are dynamic leading to constant changes in the U.S. population which leads to the erosion of effective rust resistance in cereal crops. In addition, the introduction of foreign isolates, such as Ug99, further threaten cereal production. Development of cereal cultivars with effective rust resistance and management strategies of these diseases will depend on the monitoring and characterization, virulence phenotypes and molecular genotypes, of cereal rust pathogen populations. Rust resistant cereal germplasm will be selected by testing wheat, oat, and barley lines from breeding programs throughout the United States for resistance to Puccinia coronata, P. graminis, and P. triticina, using the prevalent races, and races that have high virulence to rust resistance genes common in released cultivars and breeding lines. Testing with selected isolates of the cereal rust pathogens and host genetics studies will identify the rust resistance genes in breeding lines and germplasm. Advanced germplasm lines with combinations of rust resistance genes will be selected. Rust fungi produce a large arsenal of effector proteins in order to infect and colonize the plant host. Genetic and genomic approaches will be used to identify and characterize effector genes from P. graminis."

Develop large recombinant-inbred populations segregating for the Stb2 and Stb3 genes for resistance to Septoria tritici blotch in wheat and identify additional closely linked molecular markers. Sub-objective 3b. Develop mapping populations to identify quantitative resistance against the Septoria pathogens of wheat. Sub-  Approach: The preferred approach will be sequencing of messenger RNAs produced during several stages of pathogenesis by Mycosphaerella graminicola and Stagonospora nodorum on wheat, and of non-host resistance responses on barley. Numerous libraries will be analyzed from as many treatments as possible to obtain the greatest number of expressed genes, which was shown to be very effective in a previous analysis of EST sequences. Some treatments will consist of the pathogen exclusively in pure culture to identify genes involved in fungal development and responses to light, while others will include the pathogen in its host to identify genes involved in fungal pathogenicity and in host resistance. Most experiments will be done with isolate IPO323 of M. gramincola, the strain that was sequenced. Availability of a completely sequenced genome for M. graminicola provides a unique opportunity to analyze global gene expression to identify candidate genes for pathogenicity, sporulation, mating, light reception/regulation and other important biological processes. For some host-pathogen interactions isolates T48 from Indiana and isolate Pasco from Australia may be used. Isolate T48 is avirulent on all resistance sources tested so far but gives good infection on susceptible controls. It was used to map genes Stb1, Stb4 and Stb8. The Pasco isolate was used to map resistance genes Stb2 and Stb3 and can be used as a backup in case of problems with one of the other isolates."

Specific objectives:  1. Characterize necrotrophic effectors from Stagonospora nodorum, the causal agent of Stagonospora blotch of wheat, and determine their association with the corresponding wheat susceptibility genes.  Apply this information to develop procedures useful in the selection and identification of resistant wheats.  2. Identify and characterize virulence factors of Pyrenophora teres f. teres, and P. teres f. maculata, causal agents of net form net blotch and spot form net blotch of barley, respectively, to elucidate and exploit the mechanism for resistance to these diseases.  3. Identify viral genome sequences and interactions affecting pathogenicity, virulence, and transmissibility of viruses infecting barley, particularly barley stripe mosaic virus and oat blue dwarf virus.  Approach: Fungal and viral diseases of small grains pose an economic threat to production throughout the U.S. and the world.  This project focuses on both fungal and viral pathogens in an effort to solve issues related to pathogenicity, virulence, and host resistance.  It is our goal to identify and characterize pathogenicity/virulence factors of Pyrenophora teres (net blotch of barley), Stagonospora nodorum (S. nodorum blotch of wheat), barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV), and oat blue dwarf virus (OBDV), and evaluate their importance in disease production.  Our approach will be to:  a) Identify and characterize virulence determinants and host genes important in net form net blotch and spot form net blotch of barley through phenotyping and mapping of segregating host and pathogen populations. Host resistance genes will be mapped and characterized, and pathogen virulence genes will be mapped, characterized, and cloned. Additionally, the newly acquired P. teres f. teres genome sequence will be used to identify necrotrophic effectors (NEs) involved in disease induction. b) Identify and characterize NEs and their corresponding host sensitivity genes important in S. nodorum blotch of wheat. Host-pathogen interactions will be characterized through evaluation of host mapping populations and identification of new NEs through purification and bioinformatic analysis.  c) Identify and characterize factors affecting pathogenicity, virulence, and transmissibility of viruses infecting barley through the characterization of BSMV and OBDV model systems.  A reverse genetics approach will be used to analyze viral phenotypes and further elucidate genome structure-function relationships.

You (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Winnipeg) Bread wheat is one of three pillars on which the global food supply rests. Despite wheat''s exceptional importance, a high quality draft sequence of the wheat genome is not available due primarily to its hybrid origin (polyploidy) and the enormous size of its genome. To assist the international bread wheat genome sequencing effort, a high quality draft of the genome of Aegilops tauschii, one of the three progenitors of bread wheat, will be produced. The large size and great complexity of the Ae. tauschii genome necessitate adopting the ordered-clone sequencing strategy for generating a high quality genome sequence draft. This strategy will involve the sequencing of about 50,000 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones harboring large fragments of Ae. tauschii DNA that have been ordered to represent the contiguous sequence of nucleotides in Ae. tauschii chromosomal DNA. Pools of BAC clones will be sequenced with a next generation DNA sequencing platform and assembled into long contiguous sequences. The correctness of the assembled sequences will be validated with a novel optical nanotechnique. Genes and transposable elements in the assembled sequences will be annotated. In this way, the sequence, location, and orientation of all genes and transposable elements in the Ae. tauschii genome will be determined. The most immediate impact of the Ae. tauschii genome sequence produced by this project will be in predicting the location of genes in wheat and its relatives, thus accelerating progress in genome sequencing of wheat and its relatives and facilitating gene discovery and manipulation in these species through traditional breeding methods and biotechnology. The Ae. tauschii genome sequence will serve as a reference in analyses of genomic changes that have taken place in the wheat genome since wheat''s origin, providing significant and fundamental contributions to the understanding of grass genome structure and evolution. Association of the more than 36,000 genes predicted within the draft genome sequence with biological functions will be a daunting task. For this reason, the project will engage the large research community interested in analyzing genes of Ae. tauschii in community-based manual gene annotation and graphical compilation of the results in the project database. To maximize the awareness about the project resources among the wheat breeders and other stakeholders, regular presentations/workshops of these resources will be made at professional meetings attended by wheat breeders. The project will also provide excellent interdisciplinary training for students and postdocs in plant genomics, bioinformatics, DNA sequencing and sequence assembly, validation, and analysis. Validated sequences of BAC contigs and sequences parsed to individual BAC clones will be deposited on a monthly basis to a project website (to be developed). All sequences will be deposited at the long-term NCBI repository and incorporated into the Gramene, GrainGenes, and MIPS comparative databases. Individual BAC clones or their groups from the nine libraries of Ae. tauschii AL8/78 and the minimal tiling path (MTP) across the contigs are publicly available and distributed through http://probes.pw.usda.gov/WheatDMarker/."

In many plant species, flowering occurs at a particular time of year in response to the sensing of seasonal cues such as changes in the length of day and temperature.  This project is designed to further our understanding of how the timing of flowering is regulated by environmental cues at a molecular level in the grasses. Despite the fact that grasses include important food crops such as wheat, rice and corn and potential bioenergy crops such as switchgrass, sorghum and miscanthus, little is known about how flowering is regulated at a molecular level in the grasses. This project will employ Brachypodium distachyon as a model because this grass species exhibits a large range of natural variation in flowering behavior that is genetically tractable, and it is straightforward to identify the genes responsible for genetic differences in flowering among different Brachypodium varieties. Understanding achieved by this project has the potential to inform research designed to improve the productivity of food and bioenergy crops.  This project will result in the training of graduate students and postdocs for independent careers in science, and will provide undergraduates with an opportunity to learn about research in genetics, molecular biology and plant biology.

The molecular communication between bacteria and host plants that allow the establishment of specific symbiotic or pathogenic plant-bacteria interactions are known in detail. However, commensal plant-microbe associations that dominate in the rhizosphere have not been studied to the same extent and relatively little is known regarding the strategies used by commensal soil bacteria to initiate a loose association with plant root surfaces or the spatiotemporal dynamics of these associations. This research aims to characterize key bacterial determinants implicated in the establishment and maintenance of commensal bacteria-plant associations and the spatiotemporal dynamics of these associations, in real-time. Experiments will characterize the role of sensing and chemotaxis in the association of Azospirillum brasilense with wheat roots, which is an excellent model to quantitatively analyze beneficial commensal plant-microbe associations at high temporal and spatial resolution scales. Using iterations between experiments and mathematical modeling, the research will characterize the selective advantage that multiple chemotaxis pathways provide to the ability of bacteria to sense and respond to gradients relevant to their lifestyle in the soil and in the rhizosphere. Next, the role of receptors capable of integrating metabolic status with sensing in mediating rhizosphere colonization will be determined. The project will also use a novel expression system to track how changes in the intracellular concentration of a key metabolite (c-di-GMP) affect locomotor behaviors in real time. Last, a quantitative approach to monitor, in real-time, the role of sensing and chemotaxis in the spatiotemporal dynamics of commensal plant-root colonization will be implemented. Most soil bacteria form commensal associations with the roots of plants and the sequenced genomes of these bacteria encode at least two Che pathways. Results obtained will be directly transposable to other motile soil bacteria and will provide much needed quantitative insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment of commensal plant-microbe associations. This knowledge is a prerequisite to a systems-level understanding of the diverse plant-microbe associations that exist in the rhizosphere. The approach to real-time and quantitative monitoring of commensal plant-microbe associations will document the spatiotemporal dynamics of these associations for the first time and ultimately inform future effective strategies to manipulate the rhizosphere to improve plant health and productivity. Broader Impacts:  This project will provide new tools and methods to quantitatively analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of plant-microbe associations, including approaches to track real-time root-microbe associations. The mathematical model derived from this research will be useful in future systems-level simulations of plant-microbe associations for rhizosphere manipulation and promotion of plant health. The project will also characterize sensory modules that will enhance the synthetic biology toolkit. In addition, cross-disciplinary interactions in biology and mathematics for graduate students and undergraduate students, including members of underrepresented groups in the sciences, will be established."

Rodolfo Romero and Bertil Stromberg both at Andritz, Inc. who will direct a project to improve our understanding of the differences in lignin structures amongst monocot and dicot angiosperms with emphasis on the Poaceae family that includes wheat, corn, sugarcane, switchgrass and Miscanthus. These differences in lignin structure would be due to biochemical and other natural chemical processes during lignification. The academic partner (Francis) and industrial partners (Stromberg and Romero) have been collaborating on two different projects for more than two years. In this NSF GOALI project, it has been observed that the lignin in sugarcane bagasse (SCB) depolymerizes to monomers at surprisingly high yields under mild alkaline pulping conditions. The other project, dominated by the industrial partners, showed that lignocellulosic ethanol (LE) production is technically and economically feasible from some non-woods that are available at low costs. Indeed, Andritz is presently in the process of designing and building portions of a commercial LE plant and a large LE demonstration plant for clients.Society would benefit if more energy were to be produced from wood and other biomass (CO2- neutral sources) and by a reduction in the emissions of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing compounds into the environment (from crude oil processing). The proposal addresses one of the challenges associated with the production of LE that is syntheses of value-added products from the lignin by-product. It is hoped that favorable results would stimulate increased R&D in the area of LE from wood and other biomass. Development of new mechanisms, techniques and analytical tools that can be used by the entire scientific community is also likely to result from the research.

Peters (Montana State University)CoPIs: Jean-Michel Ane (University of Wisconsin - Madison), Michael Udvardi (The Samuel Roberts Nobel Foundation) and Christopher A. Voigt (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)Key Collaborators: Giles E. Oldroyd (John Innes Centre, UK) and Phillip S. Poole (John Innes Centre, Oxford University, UK)Nitrogen is an essential element of biological molecules and life on earth.  Lack of usable nitrogen limits growth of microbes, plants, and animals. Scarcity of nitrogen in agricultural soils limits plant production of food, feed, fiber and fuel.  Nature solved the nitrogen limitation problem via evolution of biological nitrogen fixation in a type of bacteria, diazotrophs, that are able to reduce atmospheric N2 to NH3, which is readily assimilated into biological molecules.  Biological nitrogen fixation is promoted by a complex metal containing enzyme called nitrogenase, whose oxygen-sensitivity may explain its restricted distribution amongst bacteria.  Some plants, including most legumes and a few non-legumes form intimate, nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs that provide the plants with ammonia.  As a consequence, legumes have been an integral part of sustainable agricultural systems for thousands of years.  Unfortunately, many important food species, including the grasses maize/corn, rice, and wheat cannot establish effective nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs, making them dependent on nitrogenous fertilizers for high yield. Large-scale use of industrially-produced nitrogen-fertilizer has doubled the influx of nitrogen into the terrestrial biogeochemical nitrogen-cycle, with serious negative consequences for human health and the natural environment.   Therefore, the long-term sustainability of massive nitrogen-fertilizer inputs in agriculture has come into question. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators from the US and UK to solve the dual nitrogen problems of nitrogen-fertilizer over-use in developed countries and soil nitrogen-paucity in developing countries by developing effective endophytic (bacteria inside the root) and associative (bacteria attached outside the root) nitrogen-fixing symbioses in a model and a crop plant species.  The overarching goal of the project is to develop effective N2-fixing symbioses between the model C4-grass, Setaria viridis, as well as the related crop species, Zea mays, with the endophytic bacterium, Rhizobium sp. IRBG74, as well as the associative bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescenes Pf5.  Successful deployment of biological nitrogen fixation in model or crop grass species will pave the way for a second Green Revolution to increase crop yields for resource-poor farmers and decrease the use and environmental-impact of industrial nitrogen-fertilizers by wealthier farmers. This project will establish a powerful new model system for the study of plant-microbe interactions and demonstrate the power of synthetic biology in engineering new associative relationships and interdependencies that have the potential to be universal for all crop plants.  It will test this potential in the important crop, maize.  The integrated US-UK research partnership will provide a unique training opportunity for students and post-doctoral associates with active exchange of personnel between academic laboratories and research foundations in both countries.  Data and materials generated in the study including plasmid constructs and genetically modified bacterial and plant species will be made available via websites maintained in the US and the UK.  To broaden the impact of the work, traditional and non-traditional outreach strategies will be used to help K-12 teachers, students, and the public understand the fundamentals and benefits of interdisciplinary research and the implications of synthetic biology for the next generation of biotechnological solutions in agriculture."

In crops such as wheat with more complex genome structures and less advanced genomic tools, the major genes underlying many aspects of plant architecture are yet to be identified. However, due to functional conservation, genes regulating traits in rice (and other crops) are likely to play similar roles in wheat. Once new alleles of these genes have been identified they will be subsequently evaluated for the ability to alter wheat architecture and improve yield in the greenhouse and in the field. As a non-GM technology, products from TILLING can rapidly advance to commercialization and do not face market or regulatory restrictions. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the economic impact of improved wheat yields. The U.S. is the largest wheat exporter globally, yet the competitiveness of U.S. wheat, both globally and domestically, is declining significantly. Planted acreage is down thirty percent since the 1980s, in large part due to competition from other crops with higher returns.  Net returns to farmers from wheat are consistently half or less than that from corn and soy. With a conservative 5% increase in yield resulting from this project, the yearly value creation to the U.S. farmer is estimated at over $30/hectare. In addition, the value of higher yielding wheat varieties to a seed company arising from this research in the U.S. alone is more than $40 million annually. By incorporating favorable alleles of plant architecture genes into a commercial wheat breeding program, it is believed that this project will make a significant contribution to improving the competitiveness of U.S. wheat."

For example, Rhynchospora has the greatest number of taxa (49) endemic to the SE North American Coastal Plain of any plant genus. This study will use ''anchored phylogenomics'' (identifying and sequencing 100s or 1000s of highly conserved anchor regions flanked by more variable regions scattered throughout the genome) to produce a robust phylogeny for ca. 100 beaksedge species that will be used to the timing of diversification of the group and the evolution of fruit morphology, habitat specificity, and C3/C4 photosynthesis.The project will generate a ''toolkit'' for anchored phylogenomics in the monocots, a group of 65,000 species that provides the great majority of the human diet (e.g., rice, maize, and wheat).  Better knowledge of the relationships among these crop plants and their wild relatives is useful in crop improvement. The project will also enable more precise identifications of beaksedge species, which are often only identified to genus in ecological and conservation studies because of difficulties in identification.  This is especially significant because 81 beaksedge species are recognized as wetland indicators in the United States and under-representation of the tribe''s diversity reduces the accuracy of conservation assessments and makes the study of some ecological interactions impossible.  The project will also train a graduate student in phylogenomics, which is emerging as an increasingly important skill set in systematics, biogeography, ecology, and evolution."

To effectively deploy genetic resistance against important pathogens in crops we must understand the mechanisms underlying the different layers of plant innate immune systems. This project will investigate the stem rust race Ug99 resistance mechanism in barley in order to characterize the underlying molecular pathways and protein interactions mediating resistance against this highly virulent race of stem rust, currently considered a threat to world food security. The investigators will utilize genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches to answer the question of what mechanisms are responsible for resistance and if they have the characteristics of the more durable non-host type of resistance. The function of the genes involved and the timing of the resistance response indicate that the only known Ug99 resistance mechanism in barley, the rpg4/Rpg5 locus, is possibly a remnant of a multilayered non-host resistance mechanism. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that barley is a recent host of wheat stem rust and this pathosystem has not resulted from ancient co-evolution between the pathogen and the host. The investigators expect to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the response and determine if it is an early non-host type of resistance. This information will fill gaps in the limited knowledge of plant innate immune systems and also be utilized to deploy more effective and durable resistance in important cereal crops including wheat and barley. The project will be utilized to recruit and train the next generation of molecular plant pathologists with special emphasis on peoples underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The cutting edge research tools and techniques used in the project and mentoring by the lead investigator will give undergraduate and graduate students an excellent educational opportunity."

Engineered micro-organisms can convert sugars into a broad cornucopia of biorenewable products, including fuels and materials. However, the sugar must be very inexpensive to compete with existing petroleum-based products. Non-food agricultural byproducts, such as corn stover and wheat straw, and fast growing trees can be converted to inexpensive sugar through a multi-step biomass conversion process. One of the most challenging aspects of this conversion process is the generation of toxic inhibitors that kill the micro-organism, and thus prevent them from producing a product. In particular, furfural and hydroxy-methyl furfural (HMF) are two of the most toxic inhibitors to micro-organisms. It is proposed to engineer and optimize a synthetic biodetoxification pathway that enables industrial micro-organisms to consume furfural and hydroxy-methyl furfural, converting them into useful cellular building blocks, and enabling the manufacturing of products using inexpensive cellulosic sugars. This work will also combine furan biosensors with genetic circuitry to automatically tune the pathway''s activity in the presence of changing bioreactor conditions. The living cell will only activate the pathway when it needs it. Further, this work will develop new biophysical modeling and computational optimization approaches to make engineering cellular metabolism more efficient and reliable. The proposed model-guided approach will substantially reduce the amount of experimentation that will be necessary to optimize new metabolic pathways, and control their activity according to a metabolite biosensor. New methods will be available through a user-friendly web interface.The investigator will promote the scholarship and education of high school students, undergraduate students, and graduate students through three targeted programs. The first program will recruit high school teachers to create new design-build-test engineering labs that will demonstrate key engineering principles while illustrating the intersection between biotechnology and our daily lives. In the second program, the PI will enhance the early-stage research opportunities for undergraduate students, especially ones from under-represented groups, as a way to increase graduation rates and encourage the pursuit of higher education.  In the third program, the PI will develop a new graduate-level course on Synthetic Biology. This graduate-level course will be a higher-level version of an existing undergraduate course that integrates a genetic, metabolic, and protein engineering curriculum with research topics from the bioenergy and biopharmaceuticals fields."

These receptors, often called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), typically carry or associate with non-arginine-aspartate (non-RD) kinases that initiate complex signaling networks cumulating in broad-spectrum resistance. While it is now widely appreciated that PRRs play a key role in the immune response of plants and animals, little is known about the signaling pathways governing these responses. This is especially true in monocotyledonous species, which are estimated to contain a ten-fold larger number of PRRs as compared to dicots. This project exploits RiceNet, a previously experimentally validated genome-scale functional gene network of rice genes, to explore PRR-mediated immune responses in cereals on a genome-wide scale. Taking advantage of the observation that genetic modifiers of the same gene often cluster in gene networks, novel regulators of PRR-mediated immune responses can be effectively identified and prioritized based on local connectivity in such networks. The project will identify and validate subnetworks (i.e. sets of genes) governing rice, barley and wheat PRR-mediated immune responses, generate a new dataset for rice based on an innovative proteomics approach, and establish a genome-scale functional network for wheat. Results from these studies will lead to major advances in understanding the PRR-mediated immune response of cereal crops. Because pathways controlling PRR-mediated responses in rice are similar to those in other plants and animals, the expected results will be relevant to other species that will serve as a starting point to develop new strategies for engineering resistance in cereal crops. Researchers at all levels, from undergraduate student interns through postdoctoral scientists, will receive essential training in genomics, proteomics, pathology, and systems biology. The project will organize and hold a Networks in Immunity (NetI) workshop that will facilitate collaborations between increasing numbers of researchers in this important discipline. Results will be made broadly available, allowing for generation of novel hypotheses and biotechnological applications, and serve as a basis for comparative genomics studies. All validated interactions will be deposited into central protein-protein interaction databases such as IntAct, MINT, DIP, or bioGRID.

Donovan Bailey (New Mexico State University - Las Cruces)Senior Collaborator - Colin Hughes (Zurich Botanical Garden)The extensive application of next generation sequencing in agricultural research has focused on yield improvements in the most important global food crops (e.g., corn, wheat, rice, and soybean).  However, lesser-known crops in tropical systems are also of tremendous significance; yet these receive comparatively little research attention. Several such plant groups are broadly known as  multipurpose crops , often representing key elements in sustainable agriculture that are fundamental to production gains in mainstream crops grown in impoverished regions. One such lesser-known system includes members of the genus Leucaena, which comprises 24 nitrogen-fixing species of small trees and shrubs. The unusually high leaf protein content of Leucaena (particularly L. leucocephala) helped to garner the titles  miracle tree  and  alfalfa of the tropics  and resulted in small- and large-scale plantings reaching 5 million lowland tropical hectares by the late 1980s. These introduced plantations provide: 1) unique protein-rich leaves for animal feed in livestock production systems, 2) green manure used as nitrogen-rich fertilizer for crops and for soil stabilization in alley-cropping systems, and 3) rapidly renewable woody biomass for construction, fuelwood, and even biofuels through lignocellulosic precursors.  The goal of this project is to investigate how plant transcriptomes change through time and in association with diversification of species.  Specifically, a cost- effective and phylogenetically informed approach will be used to sequence, assemble, and compare sets of expressed genes (transcriptomes) from all species of Leucaena. Insect feeding trials will be used to identify genes and broad metabolic pathways associated with psyllid insect resistance and susceptibility among different species of Leucaena.  In addition, the project will use the data generated to investigate broad patterns of transcriptome size variation and identify some of the specific changes that have been associated with speciation through geographic isolation in comparison to hybrid speciation associated with genome duplication (allopolyploidy).  Finally the data generated will be used to develop molecular markers for plant breeding and other studies.Newly developed breeding tools for tropical woody species are critical for future widespread use as contributors to sustainable agriculture in poor tropical regions of the world. NMSU is a minority serving university with existing programs successfully attracting underrepresented individuals to careers in scientific research.  Furthermore, this project includes the implementation of a new course and undergraduate laboratories developed to advance interest and the understanding of plant genome research among students at a Hispanic Serving Institution using a plant system of interest to Mesoamerican culture and heritage.  Support of this MCA-PGR project will provide extensive training and mentoring for the PI, associated postdoctoral fellow and graduate student who will work closely with a primary investigator applying new genomics technologies to address these research questions.

Only 17% of agriculture is under irrigation, yet it provides a third of the global food supply. Rice is arguably the most important crop for global food security, but is also the most salt-sensitive among staple cereals. The extent of genetic variation for salt tolerance in rice is largely unknown and under-utilized. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap by utilizing newly developed genomic resources in combination with recent advances in high-throughput image-based phenotyping to elucidate the underlying genetic basis of adaptive responses to salinity stress. This project will provide genome-level information that will link genes and pathways associated with physiological responses associated with salinity tolerance in rice. Knowledge derived from this work will ultimately inform breeders as to which alleles present in the vast genetic diversity of germplasm banks can be introduced into elite cultivars for salt tolerance. This comprehensive study of physiological impact of salt stress in rice will be broadly useful for other cereals such as wheat and maize. Both the biological knowledge and the methodologies used and refined during the course of data analysis will be valuable for large-scale biology projects that have significant phenomics and genomics components.Sequence data will be deposited at the NCBI and Gramene. Phenotypic, sequence, and GWAS data will be available via the project website. Image analysis software and scripts will be available upon request. Investigators will develop multidisciplinary active learning modules for undergraduate students in Plant Physiology and Image Analysis courses at the University of Nebraska and at summer workshops for graduate students and predominantly minority undergraduates at Arkansas State University. Development of instructional material based on the research in this project will be broadly useful in both traditional and online learning environments. Six students and postdoctoral scientists will be trained in multidisciplinary research at the intersection of plant physiology, quantitative genetics, bioinformatics and image informatics. Training students in phenomics will fill a void as high-throughput phenotyping is increasingly deployed in industry but not yet available at most public institutions for research and training."

While genotyping can now be accomplished with low-cost, next-generation sequencing technologies, phenotyping is labor intensive and has become the limiting factor in plant biology studies and crop improvement programs. This project will develop transformational capacity for field-based high throughput phenotyping (HTP) by creating platforms for rapid assessment of multiple quantitative plant traits. Proximal sensing tools and GPS referencing will be integrated to develop mobile platforms that are low-cost, flexible, robust, and amenable for a range of species.  A central premise of this work is that integrating streams of data from multiple types of sensors will increase both the accuracy and number of traits that can be quantified for field grown plants. Thus, a second objective is to develop novel algorithms for analyzing HTP data to quantitatively estimate phenotypes expressed in field environments. The newly developed sensor systems, indexes, and algorithms will be applied in test cases that examine multiple quantitative traits in wheat, soybean and cotton. The development of HTP platforms will complement the explosion of genomic information currently being collected and will enable field level experimental biology on a scale that has not been previously possible. Because the focus of this project is on field-based assessment of economically important crop species that represent different plant types and production systems, the platform and analytic methods developed in this project are expected to have broad application to a range of target environments and species and allow scalability for larger studies. The tools and methods developed will be transferred to the scientific community through hands-on training workshops. Training materials, equipment designs and software will be publicly available through a project website. This project will provide training for graduate and postgraduate scholars while hosting multiple internships for undergraduate engineering and plant science students in the field of HTP."

The edible parts of several major food plants, including corn, rice, wheat, beans, and peas, undergo a specialized process called endoreduplication in which their cells enlarge and increase their DNA content several fold. Despite its importance, little is known about how endoreduplication is regulated, and it is difficult to investigate in food plants because the endoreduplicating nutritive tissues are buried deep within their developing seeds. To overcome this difficulty, the research proposed will use genetics, cell biology, and genomics to investigate endoreduplication in exposed cells on the surface of the Arabidopsis flower. In this new system, the cells are accessible for experimentation in growing plants. In particular, the research will address the question of how endoreduplication influences the cell undergoing the process. First, a mutant with increased numbers of endoreduplicated cells will be used to elucidate how endoreduplication is controlled. Second, the mechanism through which endoreduplication turns off one gene will be determined. Normally scientists think of external signals turning on and off genes within a cell.  However, exciting recent results suggests that in, at least one case, endoreduplication can turn off a gene. Finally, to find how many genes are turned on or off by endoreduplication, the expression levels of all of the genes in the Arabidopsis genome will be compared between endoreduplicating cells and their non-endoreduplicating neighbors. Findings from this research may show new ways to increase crop yield. In addition, this project will train two graduate students, provide opportunities for summer research for three undergraduate students, and will enable workshops targeted to interest school girls in science."

However, in plants, vascular cells also are important for structural support, and form during the development of all plant organs. The goal of this research is to learn more about how the vascular system in plants forms, and how it can be manipulated to increase plant productivity.  Both biochemical and genetic approaches will be used to find genes that are important for making the different types of cells that form the vascular system, with the goal of identifying genes that can be manipulated to increase the amount and quality of the vasculature in plants. These genes can then be used to help develop crops that can withstand extreme conditions. In the 1960s, the vigor of standard cereal crops such as rice and wheat were limiting for food production. The creation of new varieties that were shorter and did not fall over as easily led to increased production of grains and averted a major food crisis. Today, as the citizens of the world face climate change with its more volatile weather, an understanding of how the vasculature forms is needed so that they can be manipulated to alter the strength and function of stems and other plant organs in extreme and volatile environments.  Undergraduate positions supported by this award will be filled by Arizona students from low-income backgrounds. Teachers from local high schools will be supported through this award to develop lesson plans about plant genomics and biotechnology for their high school classes."

The innovative technology described here is based on the use of a novel microorganism isolated from Yellowstone National Park, which is able to withstand extreme acidic conditions and is capable of efficiently degrading cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose. The organism produces high concentrations of lipids (30-60% of cell volume) in a one-step process when grown aerobically on waste feedstocks in minimal dilute acid medium. The primary objective of this SBIR Phase I is to determine the feasibility of lipid production from various lignocellulosic substrates and determine fatty acid profiles for biofuel production under laboratory scale systems.  Additionally, high value commercial products will be evaluated including waxes, biolubricants, and nutraceuticals.  Preliminary lab bench studies have shown conversion of wheat straw to lipids ideal for biodiesel at 80g lipid/kg dry weight and the goal of this study is to produce 110 lipids/kg, which cost analysis studies indicate would be competitive with fossil fuels. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the potential for a low cost, simple and effective means for lipids (biofuel precursors) from abundant lignocellulosic substrates. The products produced by the proposed innovative process includes biodiesel, fatty acids for specialty markets, enzymes for biofuel production, and raw material for wood product substitutes and fuel pellets. These products will be sold to biodiesel producers and distributors, petrochemical companies, composite material manufacturers, and fuel pellet manufacturers. Only a few companies and research groups are investigating microbial biodiesel production directly from lignocellulosic waste and, therefore, the scientific community will benefit from this research through a better understanding of direct degradation of lignocellulose materials and production of lipids by microorganisms. Furthermore, research into the growth and metabolisms of the novel microorganism described here will be directly beneficial to researchers studying other lipid producing strains. The success of this one-step technology would have a significant economic impact for the nation by providing a novel route to the production biofuels and biomass based industrial products from renewable sources."

Durum wheat can contribute to sustainable solutions, due to tolerating arid conditions and high temperatures. Durum production is limited by its culinary uses, which are primarily pasta and couscous. This limitation is due to its very hard kernels, and its weak gluten. Our proposal will &#39;fix&#39; both traits. We moved the soft kernel trait from bread wheat into durum. We will extend this by crossing our &#39;Soft Svevo&#39; soft kernel version of the Italian durum cv. Svevo, with durum germplasm possessing the strong glutenin proteins. We will cross the extrastrong glutenin allele from bread wheat &#39; Glenlea&#39; into Soft Svevo, and also cross Soft Svevo with high protein gene lines. The softness, glutenin and high protein genes will be crossed into elite CIMMYT germplasm and elite breeding lines of Elias Elias, NDSU. We will also develop 2- and 3-gene combinations, all in soft kernel durums. Lastly, we will evaluate the role of these genes in end-use quality, including dough extensibility and bread performance. Soft kernel lines with different protein genes will be baked from trials with two N fertilizer rates grown under 2 different rainfalls. This work extends the paradigm shift in durum wheat. Soft kernel texture produces better pasta, and fine flour with low starch damage. Introducing stronger gluten will facilitate expanded culinary food uses."

Wheat production has been continually challenged by various threats, including climate variability/change and new disease pathogens and pests. There is a constant need to find and deploy new genes in wheat to fight against various new threats. However, the narrow genetic variability of wheat has increasingly made this task more challenging. It is essential to expand the genetic variability of wheat and enrich the gene pool usable in wheat breeding. Here we propose to systematically engineer the wheat genome to introduce novel disease resistance and salt/waterlogging tolerance genes from wheat-related wild species into wheat by inducing exchange of genes between wheat and wild species. Also, this research will generate a pipeline for long-term gene introgression from the wild species involvedinto wheat. Meanwhile, this research will provide a better understanding of the wheat genome,which is essential for the genetic improvement ofwheat. Ultimately, this research will develop breeding-ready wheat germplasm that can be utilized immediately for the development of superior wheat varieties. Also, we will generate a pipeline for long-term gene introgression from these two wild species into wheat to meet constant needs of wheat breeding for new genes and extend genetic variability of the wheat genome. This will potentially strengthen the defense of US wheats to the biotic and abiotic stresses and sustain or enhancewheat production under those threats."

Over 50% of the world&#39;s potentially arable lands are acidic, making this problem a major constraint to crop production, particularly in the developing world. The development of cultivars adapted to acid soils is therefore a key aspect in sustainable crop production. To achieve the full genetic potential in breeding crops for aluminum (Al) tolerance, it is critical to understand the genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of this trait. Rice is the most Al tolerant cereal crop, providing a good model to identify Al tolerance genes, and offering the potential to identify novel tolerance mechanisms. The goal of this research is to enable the development of crops with superior performance on acid soils, based on a comprehensive understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying Al tolerance, the genetic variation in key Al tolerance genes, as well as how this variation contributes to the variance in rice Al tolerance. In this proposal, we will build upon the results of our expiring NIFA grant to: 1) Understand how natural variation in the sequence of a major rice Al tolerance gene, whose gene name is ART1, can be exploited to enhance rice Al tolerance. This work will identify versions of the ART1 gene that are most effective at enhancing Al tolerance, and may determine the best combinations of the most tolerant versions of ART1 in combination with the best rice genetic backgrounds. 2) Identify novel, cell wall-related Al tolerance genes and mechanisms, as our preliminary finding suggest that the very high Al tolerance in rice is due in part to curently unidentified Al tolerance mechanisms that protect the cell wall of growing root cells from toxic Al. 3) Translate our recent findings on a novel rice Al tolerance mechanism conferred by a transporter that moves toxic Al from the cell wall into root cells where it is sequestered in an internal cellular compartment. There is great promise for transferring this tolerance mechanism into other economically important cereal species such as corn, wheat and sorghum. This research on rice and other cereals should have immediate and practical applications in agriculture for increasing cereal yields on the acid soils that comprise large parts of the world&#39;s lands, inclduing the southeastern United States and many developing countries in the tropics and subtropics."

Among them is increasing dead organic matter (i.e., stored carbon) in soils by reducing the frequency of agricultural tillage - a practice that can also conserve soil, water, and nutrients. This approach has enormous promise because of the amount of land used for agriculture and the speed with which tillage practices can be changed. However, there have been contradictory findings about the impact tillage has on global warming because it can sometimes lead to disproportionate increases in the very strong greenhouse gases of nitrous oxide and methane, even though more carbon is stored in the soils. These strong greenhouse gases are produced when part of the soil lacks oxygen, but in the past it has been difficult to measure when and why that occurs. This research project will measure the soil structures producing the strong greenhouse gases with a new set of techniques and will perform an array of experiments to determine the features that regulate production. We will start by measuring the amount of greenhouse gases produced by soils in both tilled and untilled fields planted with wheat and other crops. Then we will take soil samples from those fields and study them back at our lab to determine the potential for the soils to produce greenhouse gases under many different conditions, such as wetter and drier climates. These experiments will help us understand what causes the gases to be created - for example, we may find that a soil&#39;s physical structure controls the gas output, or instead, that it is the dead organic matter from plants that plays the primary role. Finally, we will build a mathematical model of our findings that can be added to pre-existing computer programs used to predict gas production in agricultural and other soils. The experiment and model will improve our ability to predict climate change worldwide and will help farmers, land managers, and governments know how their choices will impact global warming."

Regular wheat varieties typically have very low levels of resistant starch, so the development of high resistant starch wheat would provide a ready means to increase dietary fiber in the diet. For this project, we have identified novel alleles in genes affecting resistant starch levels. Through standard breeding and use of molecular markers, we will develop new pasta and bread wheat varieties high in resistant starch."

We have developed an affordable gasification-based technology which converts low value agricultural residues which are produced during seed cleaning operations into renewable power. This gasification platform also produces two coproducts, heat and char which we believe can be developed into new enterprises with relatively low startup costs and marketed to existing local markets, creating new opportunities for rural communities. This project will extend the utility of this system by developing a practical approach to capture heat from the gasification process and utilize that heat to replace fossil fuel-derived energy used to heat commercial greenhouses. Implementation of this technology will create new business opportunities in rural communities where seed and grain cleaning occurs. Char from the gasification process also will be captured and used in slurries as a soil amendment, creating another market opportunity in these rural communities. This char has proven useful in reducing the impact of acidic soils on wheat production and has agronomic utility in improvement of crop production. Taken together, creation of new opportunities in rural communities, utilizing existing seed and grain cleaning infrastructures will reduce the need for purchased inputs for new businesses, reduce fossil fuel requirements, sequester carbon in agricultural and other soils, and improve employment opportunities."

At the same time, arable land, clean water and phosphate fertilizers are increasingly limited resources, the productivity gains of the Green Revolution are leveling off, the costs of using fossil fuels to transport fertilizer and food around the world are becoming prohibitive, and climate change will affect crop range and productivity in ways that are not yet predictable. To meet this new challenge, society needs inexpensive and sustainable approaches to improving productivity--not only of the major commodity crops like wheat and rice, but also local crops of all kinds, especially in areas of rapid population expansion, namely in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Fortunately, the field of plant-microbe interactions has entered an era of particular promise and has the potential to provide innovative and highly adaptable approaches to increasing plant productivity. Microbe-plant partnerships improve plant resistance to many kinds of stress, including disease, drought, salinity, limited nutrients, and extreme temperature.

The successful genetic manipulation of any trait in a crop improvement program requires 1) a thorough understanding of the expression of the trait and its genetic control, and 2) efficient selection. Genes that condition highly effective resistance against specific virulence genotypes of certain pathogens including Puccinia ssp and insects such as Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor), have been identified and deployed effectively in cultivars. However, repeatedly these hypersensitive resistance genes have proven to be overcome by new virulence genes, necessitating identification and deployment in new cultivars with new effective resistance genes (Singh et al., 2006; Jin et al., 2009). Effectiveness of genes that condition quantitative resistance, such as resistance to FHB, SNB, and slow rusting (Leonard and Szabo, 2005) has been shown to be more durable, but it has proven difficult and time consuming to breed for quantitative resistance, if one relies solely on phenotype selection (Singh et al., 2006; Crossa et al., 2007). Selection for resistance to certain pathogens or viruses, such as BYDV and CYDV in segregating populations is laborious because the procedure involves management of the aphid vector, and specific virus strains, in addition to carrying out infection of the plants and the test assay, ELISA (Crasta et al., 2000). Similarly, selection at the phenotype level for agronomic performance traits, which are typically inherited quantitatively, is often confounded by environmental effects and involves laborious and replicated testing to minimize selection error so that genotypic differences can be evaluated and genetic gain realized. Thus, identification of DNA markers that co-segregate with the specific genes that condition the traits of interest greatly enhances breeding efficiency for new cultivars that have multiple hypersensitive and quantitative resistance, and agronomic performance combined (Somers et al., 2004). Marker assisted selection is at the genetic level and circumvents confounding effects of the environment on the phenotype. As more markers that are linked to important genes are identified, efficiency of selection for combinations of desired characters will greatly increase. Thus, marker assisted selection is an invaluable and integral part of cultivar development. YDV, crown rust and stem rust are globally the most devastating diseases of oat. A. strigosa accession 6688 has highly effective resistance to these three diseases, and the resistance is present and highly effective in the selected lines derived after three backcrosses to elite A. sativa lines and cultivars."

Current control methods for these diseases include cultural practices such as changes in seeding date, tillage methods, and crop rotation, chemical controls such as foliar and seed-applied fungicides, and growing disease resistant varieties. However, these controls are not entirely effective across the wheat growing area of eastern Washington and losses in grain production occur every year. In some cases we need a better understanding of basic disease biology to develop new or better approaches to control. In others, cultural practices are inadequate and varieties with highly effective resistance are not available, so new genes for disease resistance are needed along with methods that will enable breeders to rapidly incorporate them into new, adapted varieties. The methods used to accomplish the objectives of this project will include field, greenhouse and laboratory studies. The outcomes of this project will result in winter wheat germplasm adapted to the PNW with resistance to eyespot, Cephalosporium stripe, the snow molds, wheat streak mosaic and soilborne wheat mosaic that is highly effective, durable, and has a broader genetic base than is currently available. In addition, more resistance genes with linked molecular markers will broaden the genetic base of resistance and facilitate use of marker-assisted selection to speed the development of resistant varieties. Knowledge of genetic and pathogenic variation within these pathogens and potential interaction with resistance genes will be useful in deciding which resistance genes to deploy and may lead to new insights for long-term control of these diseases. Insuring effective fungicides are available for eyespot control will provide growers with an effective control option until such time that eyespot-resistant varieties are available for all production areas of Washington State. A greater understanding of the density and location of common barberry bushes in Washington will result in eradication of the alternate and fewer epidemics of stem rust.

Within this group of producers, a modest number have begun to incorporate some reduced tillage practices into their farming operations, particularly when those practices have a direct affect upon crop success. Reduced tillage practices have been examined and found to be beneficial by many agronomic crop producers within the state of Oklahoma. In a survey of farms within the state it was found that approximately one-third of farmers are utilizing some form of reduced tillage in their operation (Wright et al. 2010). Farms that produce specialty crops exclusively may or may not be using reduced tillage practices. Traditionally, few specialty crop producers report the use of reduced tillage practices. Although these practices have many benefits including reducing soil erosion from wind and water and improving soil condition, their use is dependent upon crop type and harvesting technology. Not all specialty crops are compatible within a reduced tillage system. Crops such as leafy greens require clean tillage to prevent crop debris and insects from being harvested along with the crop. That said, there are many specialty crops that may lend themselves to a reduced tillage approach to farming. Fruiting vegetable crops, cucurbits, legumes and other groups of vegetables may work well within this system. There are several benefits that may result from further examination of reduced tillage practices in specialty crops. Obvious benefits would include verification of reduced operational costs, reducing soil erosion, conservation of moisture and fuel savings. Less tangible issues that need examining might include impacts on soil organic matter and quality, stand establishment, and pest management effects between conventional and reduced tillage systems. A whole systems approach that includes both agronomic and vegetable crops may prove to be beneficial to farmers that need a number of unrelated crops for crop rotations to complete their farming system."

The grain yields of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have increased 10 bushels per acre from the 1960's to the 2000's (Texas Agricultural Statistics Service). These increases are due to a combination of both the development of improved cultivars through breeding and enhanced cultural practices. The cultivars being grown today have a higher yield potential, better utilization of available nutrients, and better disease and insect resistance. However, there still is a large gap between yield potential and realized yield in farmers' fields. Because these cultivars are more efficient users of inputs and require less fungicide and insecticide applications, wheat production has remained profitable even with higher input cost and average prices. It has been estimated that there is a 30 to 60 percent annual return on plant breeding investments. The goal of the Texas A&M AgriLife Research wheat breeding program is to develop hard red winter (HRW) and soft red winter (SRW) wheat cultivars for specific adaptation areas and management programs in Texas. The statewide wheat improvement program is organized into two  centers of excellence  in Amarillo/Vernon and College Station/Commerce. The SRW class will be the primary focus for the program based in Commerce, but some research will be done on HRW and oats (Avena sativa)."

Leaf rust, yellow rust, stem rust (LYS rust) are the most common and devastating wheat diseases, which can lead to yield losses up to 40% in the world and resulted in losses of over $1 billion during the last ten years in the U.S. alone. In Oklahoma and in 2007 alone, leaf rust destroyed more than 10% of the wheat crop. Recent climate scenarios with increased temperature have also resulted in aggravation of the LYS rust diseases due to changes in geographic distribution of pathogens. The USDA Special Cooperative Agreement (SCA) program has recently funded a project to the wheat scientists in Oklahoma to breed elite wheat germplasm lines with effective major gene and/or minor gene resistance against new African races of stem rust. One of the new races, which was dubbed Ug99 after its country of origin (Uganda) and the year of its discovery (1999), may soon be headed to the United States. Phenotypic selection for resistance using common North American races will be difficult in most backgrounds due to the high frequency of endemic rust resistance genes. Therefore, marker-assisted selection for new resistance genes is necessary for virtually all new sources of rust resistance. Molecular techniques will be applied to select for the lines carrying the genes resistant to rust diseases in winter wheat. Contemporary varieties suitable for local wheat production will be determined according to adaptation to rust diseases and will be immediately extended to the wheat farmers and growers. These selected genes resistant to rust pathogens can be used to decrease yield losses and decrease costs on fungicide chemicals. These rust resistance genes will be combined with those genes for developmental genes for desirable traits in dual purpose wheat, including vernalization and photoperiod sensitivity, aluminum tolerance, spring-dormancy release, heading date and physiological maturity date to develop novel wheat varieties adapted to Oklahoma and surrounding states."

Our knowledge concerning how the rhizosphere microbial community contributes to plant productivity is still very limited, but what is known is that these microorganisms help plants grow by increasing nutrient extraction efficiency from the soil, protecting against plant pathogens, and providing growth stimulating compounds. However, despite years of effort we still know very little concerning the identities of the microorganisms that help plants to be more productive. One of the reasons for this is the fact that the rhizosphere is in fact one of the most microbiologically complex systems known consisting of tens of thousands to millions of different organisms in a single gram of soil. Sorting all this out with its bewildering interactions has been considered a herculean impossible task. However, recent advances in next-generation-sequencing technology and computers have for the first time given us the tools to identify productivity associated players. We recently published results of three years effort that lead to the identification of 42 bacteria that promote and 39 that reduces plant growth. We did this by growing a population of plants and categorizing them according to the level of productivity from high to low. Then we extracted the DNA from the rhizosphere from each category and compared the microbial communities in rhizospheres differing dramatically in terms of productivity. This pilot study was conducted on a single soil system and focused on the bacteria component only. Its been known for some time that the microbial community differs dramatically in different soils, and bacteria are not the only important rhizosphere residents that contribute to plant productivity. Other residents include viruses, fungi, nematodes, protozoa, and micro-insects all contributing to the function of a vast and complex ecosystem. In this study we extend the results to include not only bacteria but other microbial residents using a variety of soil types. Extending beyond single soils or single class of microorganisms opens up a whole new perspective on this complex underground ecosystem. We anticipate that we will not only find more beneficial bacteria but also higher order organisms that help maintain productivity relationships in the ecosystem. By identifying the important players and their interactions we hope to be able to better design agricultural systems that take into account the native services provided by the soil and reduce inputs for increasing plant growth and agricultural yield."

Several studies have shown that applications of PSMs rich in Al, Fe, or Ca can reduce soluble P concentrations in both soils and manure (Callahan et al., 2002; Elliott et al., 2002; Staats et al., 2004; Stout et al., 1998; Summers et al., 1996). For example, Stout et al. (1998) showed that a fluidized bed combustion fly-ash and a flue gas desulfurization by-product applied at 80 g kg-1 to Berks soil were able to decrease soil M3-P, Bray-I P, and water soluble P (WSP) by 45, 50, and 72%, respectively. Animal manures amended with PSMs can decrease P concentrations in runoff compared to non-treated manure when land applied (DeLaune et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2001, 2004). For example, Smith et al., (2001) conducted a study in which alum and aluminum chloride were amended to swine manure and applied to runoff plots. Non-treated manure resulted in 5.5 mg soluble reactive P (SRP) L-1 runoff while the treated manures ranged in runoff SRP from 3.66 to 0.55 mg P L-1 depending upon rate. As expected then, PSMs have also been shown to lead to short term decreases in runoff and leachate P concentrations (Elliott et al., 2002; Summers et al., 1996). In a study conducted by Elliot et al. (2002), leachate P was monitored from greenhouse columns where bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) was grown on Immokalee soil amended with triplesuperphosphate (TSP) at an equivalent rate of 224 kg P ha-1 and various water treatment residuals (WTRs) at 56 Mg ha-1. The authors found that in the absence of WTRs, 21% of added TSP leached over 4 mo, while co-applied WTRs reduced P losses to 3.5, 2.5, and < 1% for Fe, Al, and Ca WTRs. Significant reductions in runoff P concentrations can also occur when PSMs are directly amended to soils. In previous work, Penn and Bryant found that land applications of fly-ash, alum, WTRs, and gypsum directly to soil surfaces reduced runoff dissolved P concentrations 50 to 80% at one week after application. In addition, the effectiveness of the materials varied depending on site characteristics (soil properties). Very little research exists on the potential impact of drilling mud applications to soils. Bauder et al. (2005) conducted a study on wheat using water-based drilling mud. The authors showed that while the water-based drilling mud was not beneficial to wheat production, it was not detrimental to yield. Soil tests also indicated that the drilling mud applications did not increase extractable trace element concentrations. Less is known about oil based mud. These studies will contribute information on long term effectiveness of various PSMs in reducing P losses and determine an alternative use to locally statewide available waste products that would otherwise be landfilled. This work will address potential negatives impacts of land application of industrial by-products and how to assess this risk. Last, environmental risk information on land application drilling mud will be obtained, which will lead to improved recommendations."

Sales of these crops are more than 67 billion dollars and make up approximately 40 percent of the total value of all U.S. crops. Growers of these minor crops, such as fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices lack the availability of pesticides that are available to growers of major crops because the chemical registrants do not have the economic incentive to obtain the data necessary to register the pesticides on small acreage crops. Registrants are also concerned about product liability and will not register a use or will eliminate uses where liability is an issue. The USDA, with state agricultural experiment stations (SAES), recognized this problem in 1963 when they organized the Interregional Research Project Number 4 (IR-4) to assist specialty crop producers obtain EPA tolerances and new registered uses for pest control products. The IR-4 Project is the only publicly-funded program that conducts research and submits petitions to EPA to establish new tolerances and labeled uses for specialty crop growers. Growers are gradually losing many of the pest management tools they previously had because of regulatory issues such as the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) and other environmental concerns. There is a greater impact to growers of minor crops than those of major crops such as cotton, corn, soybeans and wheat. In the IR-4 program, federal scientists and state scientists work with growers, with researchers, and with extension personnel to identify minor use pesticide needs and with U.S. EPA to identify the data requirements to obtain clearances. This program is coordinated across the entire United States and Canada with 23 field research units in 18 states and 4 provinces and 5 analytical laboratories. The NCSU IR-4 Field Research Center was established in 1994 as part of this network. The IR-4 program concentrates its efforts on reduced risk pesticides as safer alternatives for minor crops."

Maintaining fallow conditions, either through tillage or through multiple herbicide applications for nine or more months every other year leads to soil degradation and declines in soil quality and soil organic matter levels. This cropping system is not sustainable over several decades. Intensified crop production is possible if crops other than wheat are included. This study is designed to determine the proper sequence of crops to optimize economic return of the crop sequence while at the same time reducing the risk of plant disease and potential build-up of crop pests such as weeds or insects. The impact of the adoption of intensified crop rotations on extensive acreages in the Northern Great Plains will stop the decline in soil quality and has the potential to reverse this long-term trend for the region. Stabilizing and improving soil quality will lead to a more sustainable system of production agriculture in these regions of dryland agriculture."

The most significant crop in Montana was wheat (5.4 million acres, $1.4 billion) followed by barley (760k acres, $159 million). Our grain goes not only to support the livestock industry in Montana, but also for the export market. Plant diseases occur on every crop, and many threaten plant yield, quality, and sometimes human health. My project seeks to provide practical disease management options for crops grown in Montana. I will focus on the use of fungicides to control foliar pathogens and the role of viruses in our cropping systems. In 2011 the results of my research were used to save farmers in Montana $100 million in crop losses due to stripe rust throughout the state, and $500,000 in crop losses in Pondera County due to wheat viruses. Fungicides are very useful tools for disease control, but recent marketing for plant health benefit applications without disease in cereal crops may cause the development of disease organisms that cannot be killed by these chemicals (fungicide resistance), as has been seen in Europe. In addition, the economic benefit of spraying fungicides in an arid environment such as Montana is questionable when significant moisture is required for most fungal diseases to grow and infect plants. In the last 5 years I have rarely seen a yield benefit to fungicide application. We will likely see an increase in the number of acres to which a fungicide is applied where the economic benefit of that application is questionable. This project will continue on-farm fungicide trials, measuring disease and resulting yields. The information I provide growers and agricultural professionals via my extension activities including fact sheets, AgAlerts, presentations, field days, and media appearances will be used on farms and contribute to the economic viability of Montana cropping systems. I will also focus my efforts on include wheat viruses. Cereal viruses represent a growing and complex threat to the sustainability of the cereal cropping system. The wheat curl mite vectors multiple viruses among grassy weeds and cereal crops. Moreover, although wheat, barley, corn, oats, rye are all susceptible to viruses including Wheat streak mosaic virus, the impact of the more recently identified Wheat mosaic virus and Triticum mosaic virus are unknown. Understanding the spread of cereal viruses is critical as no effective chemical (acaracide) or genetics-based (plant breeding) management options exist. This project will result in a greater understanding of the susceptibility of wheat varieties to WSMV strains from across the Great Plains of the United States. This will assist wheat breeders in variety selection for resistance against WSMV. Farmers at high risk for WSMV may choose varieties with resistance to viruses to reduce disease losses. This is particularly relevant in southern states, where early planting and grazing of winter wheat facilitates the pathogen survival in green plant material."

The aim of the proposed studies is to understand innate resistance mechanisms in bread wheat by dissecting the whole process leading to rust resistance; and to find out at which point we can manipulate the pathway to develop cultivars with durable resistance as well as more effective approaches to introduce exotic resistance genes.

As of January 1, 2011, North Dakota had 880,000 beef cows and 60,000 cattle in feedlots. Cow-calf production is the top ranked animal sector in North Dakota, and sale of cattle and calves ranked number four (behind wheat, soybeans, and corn) in farm receipts with a value of $596,094,000 in 2009. The area of production most critical in beef cow-calf operations is the ability of a cow to give birth and raise a healthy calf until weaning. Reproductive performance is variable among herds (Larson et al., 2006; Dahlen et al., 2010) and estimates indicate the beef industry loses $1.06 billion in revenue as a result of infertility (Lamb et al., 2008). Identifying reproductive techniques or management practices that enhance reproductive performance could provide North Dakota producers opportunities to recapture some of the $65.8 million lost annually to infertility. The area of cost control most critical to beef cow-calf operations is feed cost. Feed costs account for over 60% of annual cow costs (Miller et al., 2001). In 2010, North Dakota producers enrolled in the Farm Business management program spent $190.67 per cow on purchased or grown feeds (NDCTE, 2011). Based on these estimates, it would take $167.8 million to feed the 880,000 cows in North Dakota during the winter of 2011-2012 alone. Identifying methods to improve the utilization of feed resources and achieving producer adoption of these methods would have a significant economic impact. The objectives of this project focus on the cow/calf resource base and explore strategies for producers to optimize the management of their cows along with the calves they produce. The project objectives will be met with research projects that determine the impact of incorporating artificial insemination in commercial operations and with projects that evaluate nutritional strategies to optimize performance, production, and profit potential for producers. Issues addressed in this project are paramount to the continued sustainability of the North Dakota beef industry. Projects that focus on improving fertility are geared toward retaining a portion of the $65.8 million lost annually to infertility in North Dakota. Nutrition and management projects capable of improving feed utilization a mere 5% have the potential to save cow-calf producers in North Dakota $8.4 million with greater improvements yielding even more savings. Equally important to conducting quality research projects that address producer concerns, however, is the dissemination of project results. Discovering opportunities that improve performance, production, and profit in beef herds along with identifying needs-based research projects for and with the assistance of North Dakota beef producers will provide NDSU clientele the science-based recommendations needed to allow informed decision making and continued excellence."

They can replace some or all of the need for synthetic fertilizer, improve soil quality and productivity, and recycle nutrients that might otherwise contaminate ground and surface water. Biologically based fertility systems represent a fundamentally different approach to fertility management than fertilizer-based systems, with concomitant challenges and opportunities. This project addresses different aspects of biologically based system in two contrasting crops, organic bread wheat and lowbush blueberry. Additional studies will be added as needs and funding are identified. For organic bread wheat production, providing adequate nitrogen at the right time in the crop's development is a key challenge to producing grain that will meet the protein standard required by millers and bakers (minimum 12%). Grain protein quality also affects bread wheat baking performance but is less understood. Three separate field studies will investigate the effects of rotation and nitrogen sources on plant nitrogen uptake, grain yields, grain protein, and protein quality in both winter and spring wheat. Rotations will include different strategies for incorporating bread wheat into dairy cropping systems. Nitrogen sources will include mixed forage plowdown, red clover plowdown, dairy manure, chicken manure, and dehydrated chicken manure. For lowbush blueberry, biologically based fertility systems hold promise as a means to address soil quality issues while meeting crop nutrient needs. Compost will be compared to an OMRI-approved and a synthetic bagged fertilizer for effects on soil carbon, soil nutrients, blueberry nutrient uptake, flower and fruit set, fruit yield, and fruit quality. This project will develop management strategies for farmers who grow organic bread wheat, lowbush blueberry, and possibly other crops to optimize nitrogen use efficiency, soil quality, crop yields, crop quality, and profitability for cropping systems that use biologically based nutrient sources."

Eastern Montana produced nearly 48 million bushels of spring wheat in 2010, about 46% of the spring wheat produced in Montana. Approximately 82% of the Montana durum crop was produced in this region. More foreign markets are showing interest in purchasing durum from this area, including Italy and Japan. Malt barley acres have increased in eastern Montana and western North Dakota, with Anheuser-Busch contracting up to 20 million bushels. While eastern Montana is not a major winter wheat production area, winter wheat can be an important crop in rotation with spring wheat by controlling winter weeds and spreading out the timing of farm work in the spring and fall. About 29% of Montana alfalfa hay was produced in this region in 2010. This project develops and maintains several durum populations, selecting for high gluten strength, low cadmium content, disease resistance, and stem solidness for sawfly resistance. The project evaluates experimental lines and new varieties of various crops to identify those most adapted to this area. All tests are replicated small plots. Experimental lines are evaluated for disease and insect resistance, lodging resistance, and quality characters, including milling and baking, malt production, and pasta production. This resulted in the release of 9 spring wheat varieties, 21 winter wheat varieties, 10 barley varieties, 1 alfalfa variety, 1 forage wheat variety and 1 teff variety. More varieties are on track for release in the near future. This project has developed recommendations for seeding rates, nutrient management, and irrigation rates, and will provide more information to small grain and forage producers about yield and quality of various varieties so that the growers can make informed decisions about which varieties to grow and how best to manage the crop."

However, repetitive elements themselves are only recently being investigated and their impact on the corn plant is poorly understood. An interesting feature is the ability of some repetitive elements to move around the genome, disrupting various sub-genome regions. These are called retrotransposons, which actually excise from one area and re-integrate into another area of the genome. Therefore, this research will facilitate an improved understanding of how the repetitive elements of the genome affect gene expression, as variation in gene expression directly affects plant phenotype, growth and yield. As corn is the model of sorts for plants with large genomes (which includes many crop plants such as sugarcane, wheat and barley), the research proposed here will impact crop plants other than corn, if funded."

This project investigates the biology of one economically important gall midge, the Hessian fly, and its interaction with wheat, to discover the plant-galling process and the mechanisms plants use to defend themselves against gall-midge attack. Wheat ranks first among all crops in total production and acreage and provides more nourishment for people than any other food source. The total value of the US wheat crop suffers an estimated 6% average annual loss due to insects, and the Hessian fly is one of the most destructive wheat pests in the U.S. Resistant cultivars are the most popular and effective means of Hessian fly control, and the deployment of Hessian fly resistance into wheat cultivars has been a priority in many wheat-breeding programs. Unfortunately, resistance genes typically lose their effectiveness in 7 to 10 years due to the evolution of virulent Hessian flies. This project aims to improve the durability of native HF resistance as it improves our understanding of how plant parasitic insects damage plants and how plants protect themselves from insect parasites. The HF belongs to the gall midge family of flies. This is a large group of sessile and obligate plant parasites that produce plant galls. Many gall midge species are important pests. The biological attributes of the Hessian fly make it the most experimentally friendly plant-feeding gall midge, and as such, it is beginning to attract scientists with an interest in these phenomena. The special attributes this insect has include a short life cycle, small genome (160 Mb), and tractable genetics. The HF genome sequence will add to these attributes and greatly improve the ability to investigate the Hessian fly and other important gall midge species. The map will be available for use by others interested in plant-insect interactions, population genetics, comparative genomics, insect biology, and systematics."

This year, in some areas winter was very mild while in other regions winter was very harsh. This summer, there appears to be a widening drought situation across the nation. It is very possible that where the winter was harsh this year, it may be mild next year and where we have drought this year, we will have flooding next year. As such, we need to understand how these abiotic stresses impact crops and determine how to alleviate the impact of these stresses on crop production. Therefore, we propose to study the stages of wheat plants that are mostly impacted by drought, identify lines that vary significantly in drought tolerance, examine the role of proteins that control other genes that are responsive to drought conditions and finally to try to manipulate plant hormones that control both drought and freeze survival of crops. The methods we will use are very standard. We will use foliar application of the growth hormones as well as micronutrients to determine whether we can maintain the plants in a dormant state during the drought conditions. Once the drought is over, we will then stimulate the plants to start growing again. Our studies on the transcription factor DREB2a (a protein that controls the expression of other genes), will be performed with routine RNA detection methods. Knowing how this transcription factor operates during drought and cold acclimation will allow us to determine whether we can manipulate it to overcome either or both stresses."

Development of disease resistant, higher yielding, high-quality, lodging resistant varieties decreases the farmer's per unit cost of production by increasing the yield and quality of his product without increased costs. Control of diseases through the use of resistant varieties rather than through the use of fungicides is preferable because using fungicides increases input costs and fungicide use involves several risks; the risk of ground water contamination, and the risk of ineffective control because of weather limitations on timely application. The development of improved germplasm for use by other public and private sector wheat breeders will gain recognition for the University of Illinois. Use of this germplasm will benefit farmers in Illinois since resultant varieties may be well adapted in Illinois as well as in other states. Basic research studies on wheat will contribute to increased understanding of wheat genetics and development, increased efficiency in breeding and evaluation, and better methods of selection including molecular marker assisted selection.

In potatoes, PVY infection reduces yield and quality, and significantly limits the production of certified seed potatoes. Despite various control measures, PVY is a significant concern for potato production in the US and Canada due to the emergence of new strains, particularly ones that cause tuber necrosis. PVY is transmitted by several species of aphids during feeding. Since aphid feeding periods required for transmission are very brief, insecticides do not provide effective control. The use of border crops and biological control of aphids are likely to be important for limiting PVY, and both control methods are related to the configuration of crops and natural habitats in the landscape. However, research at this scale is lacking. In this project, we will study the importance of landscape complexity for the spread of PVY in potatoes in New York State. To address this issue, we will: 1) Identify landscapes of varying complexity in upstate New York using GIS and ground truthing. 2) Quantify the prevalence of different strains of PVY, aphid diversity and abundance, and natural enemy diversity and abundance in potato fields located in simple and complex landscapes. 3) Evaluate the use of sorghum and wheat border crops for reducing PVY transmission in agricultural landscapes. Our approach will include GIS analysis of landscapes, field studies to measure virus prevalence and insect diversity and abundance, lab assays to identify virus strains, and field experiments to determine the efficacy of border crops as barriers to PVY spread. A primary goal of this research is to enhance our understanding of the spread of different PVY strains by both colonizing and non-colonizing aphid species in landscapes of varying complexity and to evaluate the importance of landscape heterogeneity for biological control of PVY transmission. This research will improve our understanding of landscape controls on insect-vectored pathogens and contribute to developing environmentally sound control of PVY, a pathogen of worldwide importance."

Since 1993 excess water has significantly affected crop production in the Northern Great Plains. The precipitation received at critical growth stages has a greater impact than total annual rainfall. In June 2011, the North Dakota state average precipitation was 11.5 cm, which is above the 1971-2000 normal of 8.10 cm according to the North Dakota Agricultural Weather Network (NDAWN). The Prosper NDAWN observation site recorded 8.0, 13.1, and 15.0 cm rainfall in May, June, and July respectively in 2011. Water-logging has been shown to quickly decrease root-zone oxygen through displacement of the soil air by water. One option to manage water-logging is through subsurface tile drainage. Although subsurface drainage is common in the Corn Belt, the adoption of tile drainage in the Red River Valley is relatively new. Installing subsurface drainage can reduce the chance of water logging and prevent saturation by lowering the water table. Shifting water and temperature regimes influence the below ground nitrogen (N) dynamics. Saturated conditions (undrained) increase the potential of available N loss in the form of nitrous oxide (N2O), known as denitrification. Denitrification is an anaerobic process and saturated field conditions accelerate the denitrification process. Hence, subsurface drainage has the potential to reduce denitrification N losses through the reduction of saturation. Nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient in row crop production systems and N fertilizer is extensively applied to corn, wheat, and other non-leguminous crops. Common N-fertilizer management strategies include split applications of the total recommended rate and application of nitrification or urease inhibitors. Poorly-drained soils in the Red River Valley that warrant targeted N management include soils with high clay content. Knowledge of the trade-offs between N2O emissions from N fertilizer management practices and crop yield under subsurface drainage is therefore an essential requirement."

Wheat is the most important crop and cultivated on large acreages in the state. Many diseases occur on wheat in the region. Tan spot, Stagonospora leaf blotch, spot blotch, bacterial leaf streak, rusts, and Fusarium head blight are the most important diseases that have serious impact on wheat production in the South Dakota. Losses due to these diseases vary from year to year depending on the conditions suitable for disease development, pathogen virulence and cultivar used; however, 5 to 7% yield losses are common in every growing season. Recently, a new race (Ug99) has been identified in Puccinia graminis, causes stem rust of wheat and barley, which has the ability to incite disease in most of the wheat cultivars, resistant to previously identified races, grown worldwide. Host resistance and chemicals applications are considered to be the most effective disease management strategies. However, development of durable resistant cultivars to a particular disease requires a continuous search of new sources of resistance due to potential virulence changes in the pathogen population. Excessive use of fungicides, especially with a single site mode of action could lose their effectiveness quickly due to acquiring resistance due to single point mutation the pathogen population. Additionally, use of frequent fungicides as a disease management strategy provides opportunity to weak pathogens to thrive and becomes major problem and eliminate beneficial microflora. Multiple races have been reported in Pyrenopohra tritici-repentis (Ptr), causes tan spot of wheat based on their ability to incite different symptoms (necrosis and chlorosis) in susceptible wheat. The fungus also produces host-selective toxins (effectors) responsible for either chlorosis or necrosis symptom and considered to be the pathogenicity and/or virulence factor in wheat-tan spot host-pathogen system. Some Ptr isolates have been identified which lacks in producing any toxin (effector) but equally virulent on toxin sensitive and insensitive wheat genotypes. Similarly, some wheat genotypes have shown sensitivity to Ptr ToxA but resistant to its producer race. Multiple host selective effectors have been identified in Stagonospora nodorum, one of the important wheat and barley pathogens causes stagonospora nodorum leaf blotch, and play a significant role in the disease development. Knowledge of genetic variation in the pathogens population, disease epidemiology, pathogen physiology, and sources of resistance in the host plant is very essential in the development of integrated disease management strategies (IDMS). The improved IDMS would make small grains production more profitable that would ultimately improve the lives of their producers in South Dakota and help in eliminating hunger globally."

Management plans for rust diseases include the use of scouting to detect the presence of the disease, the use of preventative fungicide applications and host resistance, if available.

The benefits of the proposed research include expanding best management options for rust based on increased knowledge of the disease triangle (host + environment + pathogen = disease). Potential benefits include understanding the variability within populations of rust fungi affecting ornamental crops in Georgia. This will provide incite into the movement of these fungi through the ornamental market. A better understanding of the environmental impacts on rust diseases will provide growers with cultural control for disease managment. Optimizing fungicide use will help reduce input costs for growers. Developing new cultivars will allow Georgia growers to continue to produce high quality wheat resistant to ever-changing pest problems."

The vast majority of this production occurred in the eastern dryland production area of the state. Using an average price per bushel of $7.50, the value of the 2012 Washington wheat crop was just shy of $1.1 billion. This is a significant source of revenue for the state of Washington and its citizens. Weeds are major pests in barley and wheat production systems in eastern Washington, and herbicides are a major input expense for growers in conventional and direct-seed production systems. Weeds reduce grain yields as a result of direct competition for water, nutrients, and light. Weed seeds can also reduce the value of harvested grain by increasing dockage or foreign material above acceptable levels. Conservation tillage systems have provided many benefits to growers and the environment including reduced soil erosion by both water and wind; improved soil, water, and air quality; increased soil water storage, particularly in the drier rainfall zones of eastern Washington; and reduced fuel, time, and labor costs. Weeds often pose the single greatest threat to successful adoption and maintenance of conservation tillage cropping systems. Integrated weed management attempts to combine a number of weed control tactics to keep weeds at a manageable level. These tactics include mechanical (tillage), cultural, chemical, and preventative methods. Rattail fescue is a winter annual grass that is difficult to control in dryland direct-seed wheat cropping systems. Russian-thistle has been proven to be difficult to control in summer fallow without tillage. A combination of herbicide resistance and tolerance in weeds is making it very difficult to control a number of weeds in the small grain cropping systems of eastern Washington. New herbicide modes of action are increasingly rare. Eastern Washington small grain growers will need to adopt multiple tactics to control troublesome weeds in their production systems. This is particularly important in conservation tillage systems where tillage is minimized or eliminated. Developing the best combinations of tactics for troublesome weeds that are effective, economical to deploy, and environmentally sustainable will be the focus of the proposed work."

Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is by far the most important winter small grain crop and was planted on slightly more than 600,000 hectares in southern and western Nebraska in 2012. Having one program specifically targeting Nebraska production is needed to ensure that the Nebraska wheat producer has well adapted, high yielding cultivars. Winter triticale (X.Triticosecale rimpaui Wittm.) is an emerging crop that is slowly increasing in acreage, but has great potential as a feed grain and forage crop. Winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) has the smallest potential market, perhaps due to the increased risks involved with growing the least winterhardy small grain when compared to winter wheat and triticale. However, barley is the most drought tolerant grain crop of the three cereals and, with climate change, may increase its production area in the Great Plains. In addition to the changes in where and how small grains are grown, the end-use markets are rapidly evolving. .

In the germplasm area, transgenic and hybrid wheat are the last great frontiers in wheat and both have potential for significant productivity gains. Hence small efforts in both frontier areas should be undertaken. Biotic and abiotic stresses continue to be the major constraints to increasing productivity and the greatest cause of yield and end-use quality instability. The biotic stresses include diseases and insects. The abiotic stresses include low winter temperatures, high temperatures during grain filling, and drought, which can occur any time during the plant growth cycle, but especially affects winter small grain yields when it occurs during grain filling. Historically the USDA University of Nebraska collaborative research program has been the primary developer of wheat cultivars grown in Nebraska. Cultivars developed by this program are normally grown on 50 to 80% of the wheat acreage. As mentioned earlier, this program is the only public developer of winter barley cultivars, and along with the Texas A & M University program, we are one of only two public winter forage and grain triticale cultivar providers in the Great Plains. This market domination of UNL small grains cultivars has occurred due to the skill of the breeding team, the unique climatic conditions, and the people of Nebraska who provide funds to support cultivar development. Wheat cultivars that increase the state yield by one bushel per acre will increase farm revenue by $13,000,000. Additional benefits will accrue to the milling and baking industries and by the consumer."

The five major food crops (corn, wheat, soy, sorghum and rice) in the United States generate about 300 million tons of lignocellulosic crop residues as byproducts every year. These byproducts currently have limited use. These abundant and low cost ($50-$80 per ton) agricultural byproducts are renewable and sustainable without the need for additional natural resources. It has been demonstrated that lignocellulosic byproducts such as corn stover, rice and wheat straw can be used to obtain high quality fibers suitable for textile, composite and other applications (Reddy, 2005, 2006, 2007; Huda, 2008). Cellulose from these lignocellulosics can also be used to generate regenerated cellulose fibers (rayon) or it can be utilized as reinforcing agent or filler to plastics and resins. Similarly, biofuel production from cereal grains generates abundant carbohydrate and protein containing coproducts that have limited applications. For instance, more than 10 million tons of distillers dried grains (DDG) are generated every year and DDG has a selling price of less than $130 per ton, much lower than the current selling price of common thermoplastic polymers such as polypropylene and polyethylene (> $2,000 per ton). It has been demonstrated that coproducts of biofuel production such as distillers dried grains (DDG) can be used to develop thermoplastics (Hu, 2011a,b). Developing biobased products from agricultural byproducts and coproducts as well as wastes has the potential to increase income from the crops while benefits the farmers and biofuel industries economically and reduces our dependence on petroleum based resources. The new value-added products will increase income from crop production, help to establish small businesses and create new jobs leading to economic benefits. Similarly, biobased products can replace synthetic polymers based products and benefit the environment. Adding value to the coproducts of biofuel production will help to reduce the cost of biofuels and make biofuels competitive to fossil fuels and reduce our dependence on foreign sources for energy. This multi-state proposal provides an opportunity for experts in biobased products to collaborate synergistically and develop unique biobased products. Without such an effort, it may be difficult to commercialize biobased products, improve income from agriculture, reduce cost of biofuels and have a sustainable and economically competitive biobased industry. Similarly, methods to conserve energy and water and develop novel technologies to treat textile waste water will help to reduce cost of textile processing and pollution and help to make the textile industry environmentally friendly. This will give a competitive edge to the US textile industry and, in addition, will potentially save billions of cubic meters of water."

Because of continuous changes in arthropod pest problems, management technology, and regulations, the goal of this research project is to refine pest management in major field crops, with a focus on the Central Louisiana region. This research project will evaluate the efficacy of current and experimental management tactics for field crop arthropod pests. The role of weed management and plant drought and salt stresses in the severity of arthropod pest problems in Louisiana soybean will also be determined. In addition, this research project will monitor populations of the invasive Mexican rice borer and assess their potential negative impacts on Louisiana corn and grain sorghum.

Eight of the top ten commodities in Michigan are field crops, or dependent on field crops (livestock, egg production). Corn is the leading crop in the state in acreage (2.5 million acres) and cash value, followed by soybean (1.9 million acres). Unlike neighboring corn-belt states driven by corn and beans, Michigan grows a diversity of field crops, ranking first in several types of dry beans and fourth in sugarbeets. Other field crops include alfalfa, pasture, and other forages; small grains such as wheat, barley, oats, and rye. With the global demand for grain for direct consumption and livestock feed, as well as for biofuels, crop prices are at a high and field crop acreage is expanding in the state. Invasive species were and continue to be a major problem in the U.S. Michigan is a potential hot-spot for insect introductions, home to Great Lakes shipping ports, airports in Detroit and Chicago with non-stop flights to Asia, and a diverse crop base vulnerable to colonization by many species. Other invaders, foreign and native, are expanding in their range into Michigan. Thus producers are presented with new challenges from both foreign-invasive and native-invasive species that increase in pest status or range. Established and new insect invaders are now responsible for the majority of insect-caused yield and quality loss in Michigan field crops, influencing pest management decisions, driving insecticide use and reducing profitability. Tied in with invasive species is the issue of climate change. For some field crop insect pests, damage is getting worse and the damage period is growing longer during the season. A reality in field crop production is the use of biotechnology, specifically genetically modified crops with herbicide resistance or Bt insecticide toxin. According to the USDA Economic Research Service, 86% of the corn, and 91% of the soybean, acres in Michigan were transgenic in the 2012 planting season. Because universities have little role in the development of this technology, land grant entomologists are viewed as neutral observers and thus have an important role to play in education and making public statements. A by-product of the introduction of Bt crops is overuse. Growers plant hybrids expressing insecticides that they don't need, exposing insect populations to traits year-after-year. This is antithetical to the principles of integrated pest management, because it increases the chance for resistance. This project concentrates on understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive species, climate change and use of technology. The long term goal is to generate research and recommendations to producers that reduce unnecessary insecticide use, protecting growers profitability, the environment and human health."

Although members of this family can be found on a variety of niches, the best-known ones are plant pathogens that cause destructive diseases in our crops. For example, species of Mycosphaerella, Cercospora, Alternaria, Pyrenophora, Cochliobolus and Leptosphaeria are all notorious pathogens that produce devastating diseases on wheat, sugarbeet, vegetable crops, barley, corn and the brassicas, respectively. Notably, many Dothideomycetes are known to cause disease on a particular host only or to have a narrow host-range but the genetic and evolutionary bases of host-specificity as well as several aspects of their pathogenesis on plants remain unknown. Microbes secrete numerous proteins (collectively known as the secretome) to alter and adapt to their environment. The secretome has an essential role in microbial physiology, survival and communication with each other and the environment. Effector proteins in particular, are secreted by plant pathogens during pathogenesis to suppress or evade the plant immune system and thus can determine microbial pathogenicity. Comparative genomics analyses have revealed large differences in effector repertoires among microbial pathogens adapted on different or the same host, which contributes to and often sometimes defines the underlying differences in virulence and host-spectra among different species or strains of a species. While differences in effector repertoires can be indicative of changes in life-styles and evolutionary adaptations in particular hosts, similarities on the other hand can reveal the pathogenic core utilized by microbes to infect their hosts and their potential for a host shift. In such cases, host shifts are more likely for pathogens that infect different hosts but have similar effector suites. The aim of this Hatch project is to identify and functionally characterize the effector repertoire of 13 Dothideomycete species that although they are evolutionary relatives they differ in their host-range. These studies will provide a deeper understanding of fungal pathogenesis on plants and will shed further light on the genomic and evolutionary changes associated with adaptation of plant pathogens to different hosts and life-styles. This is extremely important in today's global ecosystem, not only because infectious diseases caused by fungi are increasingly recognized as a major threat to global food production and security, but also because globalization continuously brings previously isolated hosts and pathogens in contact with each other, thus increasing the risk for the emergence of new diseases. The engineering of durable resistance is one of the main goals of plant pathology and the successful completion of this project will generate novel opportunities for achieving this goal. Effector pathogenomics will facilitate the discovery and functional profiling of microbial effectors and cognate plant resistance genes at a high rate that will accelerate the engineering of resistance in plants through molecular breeding programs."

Tools available to producers and users of agricultural commodities for managing these types of risk include insurance, hedging, forward and futures contracting, etc. In addition, government support programs are available to help agricultural commodity producers managing production or price risk or both. The project would specifically emphasize the use of futures markets as a mean of managing agricultural risk. The project will also emphasize the modeling of risk related to agricultural production, in particular the risk related to the price of inputs. Increased volatility in agricultural commodity prices as well as increased linkages between agricultural and energy markets expose agricultural producers and the agribusiness industry to different types of market price risk. Increased market volatility in recent years can be attributed to various factors including reduced government stockholding, adverse weather events, and government policies. Many countries, especially in the developing world, have moved away from government stockholding. While this has tended to increase overall average prices, ceteris paribus, it has also led to increased variability in prices. Another important factor affecting agricultural commodity prices is recent developments related to biofuels and the resulting effects on demand for agricultural commodities, especially corn and soybeans. Government policy, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard, has been shown to have created strong linkages between agricultural commodity prices and energy prices. Previous research has also found evidence of volatility spillover from energy markets into agricultural markets. The increased integration of agricultural and energy markets likely also has implications for agricultural input markets as well as markets for agricultural commodities. For example, the agricultural sector appears to be importing price variability from the biofuels sector, as corn prices are increasingly tied to biofuel production given the energy policies implemented by the U.S. government. At a secondary level, corn prices influence other crop prices, such as soybeans, as they compete for acres and in other cases, such as wheat, can also act as a substitute in output markets. While many of the market relationships that create transmission of price risk across agricultural commodities are long standing, other relationships are now emerging; as are relationships between agricultural commodity markets and other international markets. Cross-commodity and cross-market correlations have likely changed affecting the efficacy of traditional price risk management strategies. Given the increased linkage of agricultural markets to other markets, it is important to investigate whether new approaches to price risk management need to be implemented by the producers of agricultural commodities. For example, it is important to investigate whether a more appropriate price risk management strategy is to simultaneously manage the price risk of the output and energy-based inputs."

Metabolites and transcripts associated with differences in physiological measurements will be identified throughout the photoperiod as well as throughout development. Our objectives will address the degree to which leaf and seed starch biosynthesis control whole plant growth and productivity. There are many advantages to the proposed experiments. First, we have shown that leaf starch biosynthesis is an important contributor to crop yield, as maize plants lacking leaf starch have significantly lower seed yield under agronomic conditions. Second, we have further data indicating that native leaf starch levels limit plant growth, as over expression of leaf starch biosynthesis in rice modifies whole plant processes resulting in increased plant biomass. Furthermore, we have shown that increased expression of starch biosynthesis in seeds of wheat and rice, results in increased plant biomass and seed yield. Additionally, we have the expertise to conduct all experiments and the experiments will be conducted in an agronomically relevant crop. Finally, these studies will be the first to comprehensively address key molecular processes limiting plant growth associated with starch biosynthesis."

An estimated 79% of Idaho's dairy cows are located in only 7 counties in Southwestern and South-central Idaho. Cows in the intensive dairy-producing counties produce an estimated 13.2 million tons of manure every year. In this same region, large acreage is dedicated to a variety of high-value crops. Specifically, there are 118,000 acres of sugar beets, 68,000 acres of potatoes, 111,200 acres of barley, and 231,450 acres of wheat. Fields that are nearer dairies commonly receive the highest rates of applications, as a means to dispose of the manure while avoiding expensive transportation costs to move the manure to fields further away from the dairies. Alternatively, many Idaho growers are realizing the benefit of manure as a nutrient source and soil amendment, and are applying manure to their fields as an affordable source of phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients. However, there are concerns that manure does not contain enough P and/or K to replace fertilizers at lower application rates. At the higher rates used for waste disposal, there are concerns with degraded soil quality due to salt and copper accumulations, degraded water quality due to phosphorus accumulation and nitrate leaching, crop yield losses, and crop nutrient toxicities. To avoid some of the issues related pest and pathogen pressure, sugar beet and potato growers commonly apply manures prior to establishing the grain crop in their rotation due to the perception that root crops are more susceptible to pathogen and disease issues than grain crops. Some fields near dairies continue to receive manure applications on a yearly basis, regardless of crop. The majority of the research regarding manure applications and plant growth in southern Idaho has been focused on only one, two, or three annual manure applications. These research efforts have not captured the impact of repeated manure applications over several years on crop production. These types of applications are more realistic to the common practices of a dairy operation, and will better reflect soil quality, soil nutrient, crop yield, crop quality, microbial, and pest pressure responses than shorter-term manure applications. The goal of this project is to determine the impact of repeated manure applications to a wheat-potato-barley-sugar beet irrigated crop rotation at varying rates and timings on yield, crop quality, plant nutrient uptake, soil nutrient accumulations, soil organic matter, and soluble salts. We will achieve this goal by conducting an eight-year field study focused on dairy manure application rate and timing. Three manure rates (7, 14, and 21 dry ton/acre) and two timings (every year and every other year) will be evaluated. We will observe how these treatments impact crop growth and soil quality. Crops to be evaluated will include wheat, barley, potatoes, and sugar beets. Using information generated by this study, the expected impact is improved crop quality, soil quality, and water quality on crop fields receiving repeated dairy manure field applications."

This contribution comes especially from corn, livestock production, soybean, wheat and hogs. However, there are some present challenges that impact productivity and the environment. These challenges are either due to natural calamities or improper land management and cropping systems, and include (i) soil salinity and compaction, (ii) drought problems, (iii) water quality impairment due to livestock and intensive tillage, and (iv) increased agricultural emissions due to heavy use of inorganic fertilizers, pesticides, and manure. Nutrients from mineral fertilizer are the major source of C, N, P, K and S for the crop growth. However, when available nutrient exceeds plant requirements, these can washed away with water and mix with the streams or emit as gases into the atmosphere and negatively impact the environment. Thus, innovative and holistic management practices are needed for minimizing the off-site movement of applied nutrients. The long-term goals of this project are to improve soil, air and water qualities of watersheds in South Dakota by using new practices and methodologies that can be useful at field, state, regional and national scales. Research shows that long-term benefits of conservation practices are improved soil organic carbon, reduced bulk density, better soil structural stability, improved soil hydrological properties, reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improved water quality. These practices include: (i) conservation tillage such as no-tillage and reduced tillage to improve soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, (ii) multi-purpose cover crops to facilitate biological N2 fixation, (iii) organic farming to help diversify soil biology and enhance soil health, and (iv) controlled grazing to modify soil N cycling. These alternative practices, when used appropriately, help minimize nutrient losses from agroecosystems, and benefit the environment. Models are helpful in assessing the benefits of long-term conservation practices on soils and environmental quality at different environmental conditions. Quantifying fluxes from different soils is expected to be difficult due to the heterogeneity of terrestrial ecosystems and the variability of the factors that control the fluxes. This project will provide potential outcomes as (i) better understanding of the influences of different conservation practices on soil properties; (ii) improved understanding of the biogeochemical processes affecting soil C and N losses through different pathways, (iii) mitigation strategies for reducing GHG emissions using process-based models, and (iv) watershed modeling for improving the water quality. These research goals are regional but feed into national in scope, and can be applied to different regions of the nation."

The two major advantages of the selected crops would be (1) the production of essential oil (a high-value product), and (2) the crop biomass will be processed with heat (will be cooked) during the extraction of the natural product (the extraction of the essential oil by steam distillation). The production of essential oil (a high-value product), would offset production costs and hence, and may be more attractive to growers. This project along with the recently approved SunGrant project with PI Dr. Valtcho Jeliazkov, will be the first in the United States to explore the proposed alternative biofuel crops as lignocellulosic feedstock for ethanol production. Expected significance and outcomes: (1) Evaluating species for double utilization as new approach to add value to lignocellulosic, feedstock production, and wheat straw; (2) Economic evaluation of selected high-value crops for double utilization vs. switchgrass and wheat straw; (3) Develop expertise on double utilization of high-value crops as feedstock for ethanol production; (4) Demonstration of the new high-value crops to potential growers and processors; (5) Enhancing opportunities for on-farm value-added processing and developing of local small-scale based on plant chemicals from alternative crops; and (6) Other possible spin off effects: add additional crops for feedstock production of biofuel in the US, improve economic performance and diversity of existing cropping systems by including the new high-value crops into existing rotations."

However, little is known about the consequences of biodiversity loss for the dynamics of vector-borne diseases. Understanding the impacts of declining predator diversity on the transmission of vector-borne diseases is of particular importance because ecosystem services provided by higher trophic levels, such as the suppression of disease vectors by predators, are predicted to be at greater risk from extinction than services provided by organisms at other trophic levels."

Improvements in the efficiency of cattle production are likely to be related to increases in availability of products (e.g., beef, milk, leather), improved economics related to production, and reductions in environmental impacts. Cattle in intensive production systems are often limited most by energy available to support physiologically productive purposes. Thus, rapidly growing or lactating cattle often consume diets that contain appreciable amounts of starch from cereal grains (e.g., corn, wheat, sorghum). Typically, cattle diets are designed to optimize ruminal fermentation of cereal grains because these diets generally have greater total tract digestion of starch. However, data indicate that small intestinal digestion of starch in cattle may be 30 to 42% more energetically efficient, and this may allow for considerable improvements in the overall efficiency of cattle production. Additionally, ruminal fermentation of starch has potential for production of methane and can be related to increased incidences of metabolic disorders. Therefore, small intestinal digestion of starch in cattle may provide opportunity to increase efficiency of cattle production and decrease environmental impacts. Unfortunately, the extent with which cattle apparently digest starch in the small intestine is less than nonruminants, and these limitations preclude benefits from shifting the site of starch digestion from the rumen to the small intestine. Previous data indicate that considerable improvements are possible to the extent with which cattle digest starch in the small intestine. If a greater understanding of small intestinal starch digestion in cattle is achieved this may allow for dietary manipulations and feed technologies that augment small intestinal starch digestion and facilitate considerable improvements in the utility of dietary energy by cattle. If improvements in small intestinal starch digestion can be realized then it is likely that the efficiency of cattle production could be significantly improved. This project will use cattle that allow for study of small intestinal starch digestion, and generate new knowledge that may be used to improve the efficiency with which cattle use dietary energy."

Modern genetic tools (DNA markers, genetic map, etc.) will be developed following standard molecular methods. Successful completion of this project will result in development of improved varieties, germplasm, large number of DNA markers, genetic linkage map and DNA markers linked to important traits for future molecular breeding.

Environmental factors such as drought, chilling and excessive heat can damage or impair photosynthetic processes. Our research goal is to increase knowledge of the response of photosynthesis to environmental factors (excessive heat, cold, and drought as well as use of nitrogen and water) that limit plant productivity. Our studies will be conducted under field and controlled environment conditions, with emphasis on whole-plant responses. We will use standard techniques such as canopy temperature measurements, gas exchange instrumentation, leaf fluorescence, pollen viability, seed-set percentage, and harvest index to quantify effects of heat stress, and develop remote sensing methods for assessing stress responses in the field. We will apply these techniques to evaluate genotypes of sorghum, wheat and soybean to identify tolerance to drought or heat stress. For example, to assess drought stress, canopy conductance will be inferred from digital images which provide information about leaf photosynthetic activity. As a consequence, new methods of evaluating plant performance, under stress conditions (including remote sensing) will become available and will lead to a refinement of our understanding of the impacts of these stresses on plant growth. Genes or metabolic pathways associated with water- and nitrogen-use efficiency and tolerance to temperature extremes and drought will be identified in wheat, soybean and sorghum. New stress tolerant crop hybrids and varieties, including those with greater nitrogen- and water-use efficiency, will be developed by manipulating the genes or pathways associated with environmental limitations to photosynthesis.

Yet yields for wheat and rice remain 15-30% below their biological potentials even when grown in ideal soils and climates using ideal irrigation and cultivation practices. Production of hybrid seed, which could close this gap, is not economically feasible for most major world crops including rice and wheat. In crops that are grown as hybrids, such as corn, high yields occur in the first season only. Hence, seed companies must produce hybrid seed every year, a process costing approximately $1 billion annually in the U.S. for corn alone. Additionally, the floral anatomy of wheat and rice prevents most seed companies from commercially producing hybrid seed of these crops. Such seed could be produced commercially if these plants were engineered to produce their seed clonally. Certain wild plants possess this capacity, including blackberries, dandelions, St John&#39;s wart, crab apples and Kentucky bluegrass. These plants are essentially high-yielding natural hybrids that pass hybrid vigor on to succeeding generations by asexual seed formation (apomixis). Apomixis does not occur in major world crops. One of our goals is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of apomixis in wild plants. A second goal is to engineer crops with genes that may induce apomixis so that hybrids of these crops pass their hybrid vigor on through succeeding seed generations. This could make hybrid seed production feasible for essentially all crops. Methods and evaluation plan: Eight to 10 species of putatively sexual and putatively apomictic Boechera will be collected. Mode of reproduction will be evaluated cytologically by analysis of at least 50 appropriately staged ovules per species, to determine mode of embryo formation (milestone, Dec 2015), and by flow cytometry of at least 200 seeds per species, to determine mode of endosperm formation (milestone, Jun 2016). Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of apomictic reproduction will be evaluated by sequencing small and large RNA pools from appropriately staged ovules of sexual and apomictic species and by identifying consistent differences among modes of reproduction in these RNA. These studies will provide information concerning the putative roles of genetics and epigenetics in the evolution and regulation of apomixis (milestone, Dec, 2017). Functional analyses of identified candidate genes will then be conducted by up and down regulating them transgenically in model species and in crop plants, the results of which may enable the engineering of crops that possess the agronomic impacts of apomixis as outlined above (milestone, Jun 2018)."

There is emerging evidence that immune system abnormalities are associated with symptoms in a substantial number of affected individuals.  Recent studies point to a role for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and defects in GI function in the context of autism.  Dietary gluten, a group of over 70 different proteins in wheat and related cereals, has been suspected of having a role in some patients with ASD.  Diets that exclude gluten are increasingly popular in the autism community, although their effectiveness has not been proven in controlled studies.  Despite years of speculation and immense interest by families of affected children regarding the potential connection between autism and gluten sensitivity, no well-controlled study has been performed to determine the levels of immune reactivity to gluten in patients, to characterize the antigenic specificity of this immune response, or to assess its pathogenic relevance to autism.  Our newly published data indicate that children with autism exhibit significantly elevated antibody reactivity to gluten, which is associated with GI symptoms.  Interestingly, the data show that the immune response to gluten in ASD is distinct from celiac disease (an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten) and involves a different mechanism.  The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that the immune response to gluten in ASD is fundamentally different from celiac disease, targeting a unique set of proteins and epitopes, which can be utilized to identify novel biomarkers and gain novel insights about mechanism.  The specific aims of this proposal, which represent a systematic approach to examine this hypothesis, are (1) to fully characterize the specific target molecules of the anti-gluten antibody response in ASD, using a gluten protein/peptide microarray system and (2) to map the specific target sequences of the identified gluten proteins associated with the antibody response in ASD.  The proposed study will utilize a novel gluten proteomic microarray system that has been developed by our team.  The gluten microarray would allow sensitive, quantitative, and accurate mapping of the immune response to the complex gluten antigenic mixture.  This approach has not been previously employed to profile the antibody response in autism.  If the aims of the proposed project are achieved, the results would (1) offer biomarkers that may be useful in identifying subsets of ASD patients or individuals at risk of developing ASD, (2) support the examination of specific treatment strategies, including gluten exclusion diet, targeted at the identified subset of patients, and (3) yield experimental support for closer examination of the role of the identified proteins or the immune response to them in the pathogenesis of the disorder.  This grant proposal is in line with the request for Idea Development Award applications that address the following needs of the ASD community:  understanding factors underlying the heterogeneity of ASD  and  conditions co-occurring with ASD.

Because the delivery of effector proteins is a fundamental process in diseases, an understanding of the underlying process may lead to novel strategies to control diseases. Based on our previous research, we proposed a model describing two sequential processes that the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae; a major pathogen of rice, wheat, and other crops) uses to deliver effector proteins into the cytoplasm of living rice cells: the fungus secretes effector proteins into the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC), a localized structure formed at the fungus-rice cell interface, and then, BIC-targeted proteins are subsequently translocated into rice cells. In this project, we will validate the proposed model and will provide cellular and molecular basis of effector delivery. We will develop live cell imaging-based assays to identify features in known effector genes and proteins, which mediate the delivery of effector proteins into host cells. Using fluorescence microscopy, we will determine how effector proteins are produced and whether BIC-targeted proteins are translocated into rice cells. The structure of BICs will be determined at high resolution using electron microscopy. The ultimate goal the project will achieve is to elucidate the mechanism of how fungal effector proteins are delivered into host cells. The results of the project will be published in scientific and professional journals, and also will be presented in several national and international conferences."

These grasses provide more than 20% of the caloric intake for the human population. The ability of these crops to flower at the appropriate time, is critical not only for the plant&#39;s reproductive success, but also to maximize grain production for human consumption. The plant&#39;s capacity to target flowering-time to the optimal seasonal window requires the coordination of two main environmental seasonal signals: day length (photoperiod), and long exposures to cold temperature (vernalization). Additional local environmental signals, such as drought and salinity stresses, or nutrient availability, also affect flowering-time. A precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the coordination of these seasonal and local environmental signals is required to engineer cereal varieties adapted to a changing environment - in particular global warming. This is exceptionally urgent in crop plants, where fundamental research into flower-time lags behind that of popular plant model systems (i.e. Arabidopsis). A direct translation of the information from model systems to the temperate grasses is not always possible because the vernalization and photoperiod responses in these two plant lineages evolved independently using different types of genes, resulting in very different flowering-time regulatory pathways. Thus, research efforts dedicated to investigating flowering-time in the temperate cereals must be carried out if we are to understand flowering-time in these crop plants. Recent studies in wheat have shown specific components of the flowering-time pathway to associate with a distinct family of proteins known as Nuclear Factor Y proteins (NF-Y). These proteins have been extensively studied in mammals and fungi where they exist as three individual gene subunits (NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC) that form a trimeric protein complex that regulates multiple genes. Interestingly, in plants, there has been an unprecedented expansion of these NF-Y gene families, where ~10 copies for each subunit are present. This increase in NF-Y gene number, together with their interactions with the flowering-time components, has the potential to generate a vast number of molecular combinations, providing a flexible system to integrate the many environmental signals involved in the regulation of flowering-time. However, the functional role of the different NF-Y genes in regulating flowering-time in the temperate cereals has not been studied so far. This is problematic because these genes play a central role in the integration of different environmental signals. This research uses a diploid temperate grass (barley) to elucidate the specific roles of the NF-YB proteins in the integration of photoperiod, vernalization and stress signals in the flowering-time pathway. The knowledge generated form this project is expected to accelerate the development of new barley and wheat varieties better adapted to a changing environment."

For example, increasing seed size or seedling emergence for crops grown in dry land regions (receiving less than 12  of rainfall/year) allows for planting in deeper furrows so that the developing seedling has access to ground water. Larger seeds are likely to increase the total harvest per acre via one or more of the following mechanisms: 1) increasing stand establishment, 2) increasing total yield per plant and, 3) in the case of small seeded crops, such as Camelina sativa, reducing combine blow-out loss during harvest. Thus, increasing seed size can have a major impact on the production of food, such as in wheat, and fuel, such as in the oil seed crop Camelina, both of which are being grown in dry land cropping regions of the United States. Our fundamental studies using Arabidopsis thaliana have identified a group of plant-specific genes (AHL) that, when mutated in particular ways, increase seed size, seedling emergence and/or adult plant biomass. Herein we propose to leverage this fundamental knowledge into increasing our understanding of the biological processes of the AHL gene family in plants that are important to agriculture. The goal of this project is to use molecular and cellular genetics as well as crop biotechnology to understand the role of the AHL gene family in wheat and Camelina with regard to seed, seedling and adult size and stature."

Recruitment of fellows will particularly target groups that are under-represented in the sciences. Academic training will include interdisciplinary coursework in plant breeding, genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, statistics, plant physiology, and soil-plant-water relationships. Professional development training will include courses in research proposal development and scientific writing. Experiential training will consist of a multiyear research project on wheat, canola, dry bean, or sorghum; a teaching practicum; an internship with a private seed company; and an international research experience at a collaborating institution. Benefits of the project will be three scientists with research and teaching expertise focused on plant breeding for water-limited environments, a more diverse workforce in the agricultural sciences, and a strengthened graduate research and teaching program in a subject area that is crucial for the future of U.S. and global agriculture."

An impressive body of evidence supports the notion that increasing consumption of whole-grain and/or cereal bran is associated with lower risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart diseases. The bran fraction of the whole-grain contains important bioactive phytochemicals and is the major source of cereal fiber. It is still unclear whether the observed beneficial health effect of cereal bran is due to phytochemicals or fiber or the combination of phytochemicals and fiber. Wheat bran is one of the most important dietary cereal brans and its consumption has been found to decrease the risk of many different chronic diseases. We recently studied the chemical profile of wheat bran and found that it contains three major types of bioactive components: alkylresorcinols, sphingolipids, and sterols and sterol ferulates. Studies have shown that these major phytochemicals may have a protective effect against the development of metabolic syndrome. Based on the literature and our preliminary data, our hypothesis is that the effect of wheat bran on metabolic syndrome resides in the additive and/or synergistic interactions among various bioactive components. The goal of this project is to characterize the roles of phytochemicals and fiber in wheat bran in the prevention of high-fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome. The present study will provide important information on the in vivo effectiveness of the phytochemicals in WB in the development of metabolic syndrome."

Genetic analyses suggest that FHB resistance in wheat is quantitative, controlled by two or three major genes plus some minor genes. Extensive mapping efforts have indicated that QTL Fhb1 plays a major role in FHB resistance in wheat. Our previous studies identified a candidate gene for Fhb1 (WFhb1_c1). Partial cDNA sequence obtained for WFhb1_c1 may encode a pectin methyl esterase inhibitor (PMEI). The goal of this proposal is to examine the role of WFhb1_c1 gene in FHB resistance in wheat. Our specific objectives include: to uncover potential DNA sequence polymorphism between the resistant and susceptible alleles of WFhb1_c1; to examine WFhb1_c1&#39;s role in FHB resistance in planta; and to study WFhb1_c1&#39;s potential PMEI activity. We will clone the gene including regulatory sequences from wheat varing in resistance. The gene will be overexpressed or silenced in wheat using a transient expression system for functional analysis. Recombinant proteins of WFhb1_c1 will be produced for PMEI activity assay. This project directly aligns with Program Priority Area-Understanding Plant-Associated Microorganism and Plant-Microbe Interactions (A1121) and two of the research area foci. A thorough understanding of the mechanism by which wheat interacts with Fusarium should help identify key step(s) that can be manipulated to mitigate FHB epidemics, which offers significant economic value to US agricultural production."

Objective 1: Develop durum wheat genetic stocks with improved tolerance to Fusarium head blight, using wild relatives as sources of FHB resistance. Sub-objective 1a. Develop alien disomic addition and substitution lines involving desirable chromosomes of L. elongatum and Th. bessarabicum. Sub-objective 1b. Incorporate alien chromatin into the durum genome through homoeologous pairing between the alien and durum chromosomes by manipulating (suppressing)the Ph1 gene. Sub-objective 1c. Characterize alien chromatin incorporated into the durum genetic stocks using cytological and molecular tools. Objective 2: Develop durum wheat genetic stocks with improved processing and nutritional quality, and enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses derived from wild relatives.Approach:   Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L., 2n = 4x = 28; AABB genomes) is an important cereal used for human consumption worldwide. It is widely grown in the northern plains area of the U.S. Fusarium head blight (FHB), or scab, is a ravaging fungal disease of wheat and causes huge losses. Because current durum cultivars have little or no FHB resistance we are using wild relatives, in the secondary/tertiary gene pool, as donors of resistance. Diploid wheatgrasses, Lophopyrum elongatum (2n = 2x = 14; EE genome) and Thinopyrum bessarabicum (2n = 2x = 14; JJ genome) are excellent sources of FHB resistance, and abiotic stresses. We released in 2008 a FHB-tolerant durum disomic addition line by adding chromosome 1E of L. elongatum to T. turgidum. We plan to produce more addition lines for other individual alien chromosomes and screen them for FHB-resistance. Alien disomic substitution lines will facilitate integration of desirable chromatin from the added chromosome into the durum complement. Chromosome pairing in durum wheat and its hybrids is precisely regulated and alien chromosomes do not pair with the corresponding wheat chromosomes. To induce integration of alien chromatin in the wheat genome, we plan to remove or inactivate the pairing regulating Ph1 gene in the hybrid derivatives. Chromosome-specific molecular markers and fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization (fl-GISH) will be employed to characterize alien chromosome/chromatin integration into the durum genome. The desirable genetic stocks having alien chromatin will also be tested for tolerance to abiotic stresses, and improved nutritional and end-use quality."

Over the past five crop seasons (2007-2012), these crops have been grown on an average of 1,260,000 acres in the US with an average harvest value of over $320 million. These crops also contribute to the success of the US wheat and barley industry by serving as useful rotation crops in small grain production systems.   This research project has three objectives that focus on developing new and improved varieties of cool season food legumes (peas, lentils, and chickpeas) and effective integrated disease control strategies for these crops.   1) Develop and release new varieties and germplasm of peas, lentils, and chickpea that have higher seed mineral concentrations; improved host-plant resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, Sclerotinia wilt and Ascochyta blight; and higher yields than existing commercial varieties.   2) Identify genetic markers closely associated with superior yield, optimal plant height for harvest, seed mineral concentration, resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, and improved cold tolerance for autumn-sown peas, and validate their utility for marker-assisted plant breeding. Sub-objective 2A:  Identify molecular markers in adapted pea populations that are associated with important traits including concentrations of minerals in seed, resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, and winter hardiness.  Sub-objective 2B:  Identify molecular markers in adapted chickpea populations that are associated with seed size and early maturity.   3) Develop efficient techniques to screen peas, lentils, and chickpeas for host-plant resistance to Ascochyta blight and Sclerotinia wilt, and characterize genetic and physiological factors responsible for the virulence of these pathogens.  Sub-objective 3A:  Develop efficient techniques to screen peas, lentils and chickpeas for resistance to Ascochyta blight and Sclerotinia white mold. Sub-objective 3B:  Deter  Approach: New varieties and germplasm will be developed from pure lines selected from among segregating populations of peas, lentils, and chickpeas. Cyclical hybridization will be conducted to combine favorable alleles for traits of interest. Parental lines will include adapted germplasm, commercial cultivars and accessions from the various international breeding programs. Promising breeding lines will be released as either germplasm or varieties based on a rigorous comparison of their performance relative to that of commercial check varieties.   Linkage analysis and the detection of associations between markers and different traits will be done using simple sequence repeats (SSRs), expressed sequence tagged- SSRs, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pea recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations will be developed from a cross between Aragorn and Kiflica to identify markers associated with seed mineral concentrations. RILs from a cross between the pea cultivars Medora and Melrose will be used to identify markers associated with cold tolerance. Molecular markers associated with seed size and early maturity in chickpea will be detected using a RIL population developed from an interspecific cross between C. arientinum line Flip 90-27 and PI599072 (C. reticulatum). Associations between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) conditioning traits of interest  will be detected by composite interval mapping.  Improved methods will be developed to screen chickpea for reaction to Ascochyta blight. Toxins will be purified from liquid cultures of A. rabiei. Toxins will be adjusted to various concentrations and applied to detached chickpea leaflets. Leaflets treated with water will be used as controls. The speed of lesion development and final lesion size will be used to compare the reactions of different chickpea genotypes. The relationship between field disease scores of the chickpea genotypes and their sensitivity to the toxin will be determined. Studies to develop more efficient methods to screen peas and lentils for reaction to Sclerotinia white mold will initially examine resistant and susceptible materials reported in prior studies. Plants will be grown in the greenhouse and inoculated with agar plugs containing mycelia of S. sclerotiorum. Disease reaction will be scored by measuring the length of the lesion produced by the fungus over different time points.   Two approaches will be taken to investigate the genetic factors responsible for pathogenicity and virulence of S. sclerotiorum. One approach will be to use Agrobacterium mediated transformation (AMT) to generate random mutations that will be screened to detect mutants with reduced virulence. The other approach will be to identify genes of S. sclerotiorum that are differentially expressed during the processes of infection and disease development."

Specifically, during the next five years we will focus on the following objectives. Objective 1: Determine how forage livestock production systems interact with plants, soils, and climate with respect to carbon and nitrogen cycling under forage and grazing systems typical for the southern plains. Sub-objective 1A: Evaluate continuous and management intensive rotational grazing systems on native prairie pastures and quantify cow-calf production traits, animal and plant productivity, input requirements, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in the soil-plant-animal-atmosphere continuum. Sub-objective 1B: Determine greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soil, plant, and animal components of diverse grazing systems.

For objective 1), two farm-scale replicates of two grazing systems on tallgrass prairie are used to evaluate the long-term impacts of grazing system on input costs, animal performance, rangeland health, soil ecological function, and plant diversity. Grazing systems consist of continuously and rotationally grazed under an adaptive management framework. Animal production, forage biomass and species diversity will be monitored. Angus:Brahman F1 cows bred to Charolais bulls will constitute the grazing cow herd. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be monitored on: 1) native tallgrass prairie and 2) wheat pasture. Eddy covariance flux towers will be established in each pasture type to calculate CH4, CO2, water, and energy fluxes. Cattle position will be monitored using global positioning devices. Differences in GHG production with and without cattle will be determined. Simultaneously, forage intake, diet digestibility, and methane emissions will be determined using marker systems on a select group of individual animals to assess components of efficiency at the animal scale.  Under objective 2, research will be conducted to match finishing system with cattle genetics to optimize biological, economic, and ecological efficiency. Frame score, associated with rate of maturity and reproductive efficiency, will be used to characterize different genetic types. At weaning, calves from each frame score class will be assigned to one of two postweaning treatments: 1) conventional (wheat pasture followed by feedlot), and 2) extended forage followed by a short feedlot phase (30-50 days) if needed]. When finished, calves will be harvested; carcass data, Warner-Bratzler shear, sensory by a trained panel, and fatty acid profile will be determined. Under objective 3, all replacement heifers, and some companion steer herd mates, will be evaluated for feed efficiency at weaning. They will be fed forage-based diets to achieve 1 kg/d gain, and individual daily intake and weight gain will be recorded. After the heifers reach maturity they will again be evaluated as mature, non-lactating cows (5 years of age). Cows will be fed a ration based on Bermudagrass baleage at maintenance for 84 d, weighed at 14-d intervals, and after final body weights are recorded on day 84, offered ad libitum access to the same ration.  Efficiency will be determined as the difference in requirements and feed consumed and related to productivity during the first four calf crops.  Under objective 4, research will be coordinated with the Range and Livestock Unit at Miles City, MT, and the Genetics, Breeding, and Animal Health Research Unit at Clay Center, NE. Sample collection and analysis protocols will be developed collaboratively. Novel genomic approaches will be used to enhance knowledge of the bovine genome, improve genetic merit of purebred and crossbred beef cattle, and improve beef cow energetic efficiency, especially related to grazing and high forage based diets."

Sub-objective 1A: Compare the effects of different systems of intensive grazing on plant communities and soil properties of over-utilized tallgrass ecological sites, and define shifts in responses to applied management regimes.

This project will develop management practices and identify forage genotypes that are resilient under variable climate and will increase forage productivity and input use-efficiency on livestock farms at a range of scales. Commensurate with the scope of the location as a Long-Term Agroecosystem Research network site, we will initiate assessments of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and agricultural production under different livestock systems of the Southern Great Plains, including both native prairie and wheat pasture.  Data from this study will be pooled with results from similar flux studies in the region to evaluate climate and environmental impacts on system response.  To evaluate system resilience, over-utilized prairie ecological sites with a mix of native and introduced species indicative of good and poor condition mixed grass prairie will be used to evaluate the use of infrequent, high-intensity grazing on succession and diversity of forage species at the sites. The impact of prior encroachment of redcedar on old-field nutrient and seedbank reserves and consequent recovery of understory and grass species following removal of redcedar will be assessed.  The use of legumes and grasses as green manure sources will be researched for summer (sorghum) and winter (wheat) grain crops to promote efficiency of N and water use.  Nitrogen turnover and utilization by the subsequent crop will be assessed.  Also, N-uptake and efficiency of utilization of cool-season annual and perennial species will be measured in greenhouse experiments to develop screening methods for plant germplasm.  Improved management methods will be developed to fully utilize the genetic potential of new cultivars by enhancing establishment, yields, and utilization by livestock. To increase marketing options of livestock producers, we will determine appropriate forage resources for production of farm-finished beef, either on all forage or with limited grain inputs.  Interactions of animal genetic type (frame score) and finishing system (forage or grain) will be assessed.  Time-series data from ryegrass trials in four southern states in the last decade will serve as the basis for examining the possible importance of 5-day and 7-day summary weather statistics of the near-surface environment, and the variations of those statistics around decade-long averages, as a predictor for seasonal production.  Plant breeding technologies will be used to develop improved cultivars of perennial C3 grasses, particularly fescue, that are more persistent under the regional climatic conditions, and are more water-use efficient. Basic molecular biology and biochemistry/physiology information will be developed that will improve plant breeding techniques and products."

Approach: Foundational and applied research will be conducted to reduce the impact of abiotic and biotic stresses on the quality and productivity of grasses that serve as the basis for livestock production, turf, and bioenergy. Objective 1 focuses on the improvement of grass germplasm by developing molecular and biological resources that can be applied to reduce the impact of abiotic stresses on the productivity of grasses. It has been shown that various types of endophytes can enhance a plant's ability to tolerant stress. Research will be conducted to isolate and identify novel bacterial or fungal endophytes from native grasses growing in saline environments along the Oregon Coast. These endophytes will be isolated from plant tissues and seeds, identified, characterized, and reintroduced into a model grass species that is salt sensitive, in order to determine if the novel endophytes are able to improve the plant's ability to grow when subjected to salt stress. There is limited knowledge on the perception or molecular responses to wounding in grasses and how these responses affect persistence, the regrowth of new tissues and the long-term nutritional quality of the grass. Research will be focused on identifying wound inducible genes, locally and systemically, and the signals involved in wounding in forage and turf related grasses. Since most stresses have an oxidative stress component, identification and utilization of oxidative stress response factors may provide useful strategies for increasing tolerance to multiple stresses in grasses. Using bioinformatics approaches, homologs of transcription factors that have been shown to be involved in mediating the oxidative stress responses in eukaryotic systems will be identified. Homologs of the genes will be identified, isolated from grass species and over-expressed in a model grass. These transformed plants will be tested to determine if the over-expression of the homolog gene will improve the tolerance of the plant to different of abiotic stresses. Research conducted in Objective 2 will reduce the impact of weeds and stem rust, two biotic stresses that negatively impact seed production and the utilization of grasses for livestock production, turf, and bioenergy. Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis, is a biotic stress that reduces the yield and quality of grasslands where perennial ryegrass is produced. Whole-plant inoculation and molecular genetic methods will be used to identify and map genetic markers associated with resistance to the stem rust pathogen. The identification and development of mapping and marker tools will enable the selection of perennial ryegrass germplasm with resistance to stem rust. Another form of stress that seriously impacts the quality and utility of grasslands is the presence weeds that can out-compete the agricultural crop for limited resources. Soil application of live pseudomonads which produce a previously identified bioherbicide will tested in two different environments to determine its ability reduce the germination of grassy weeds in field trials."

More than 140,000 small grains accessions will be conserved. Each year 5-10 percent of National Small Grains Collection (NSGC) accessions will be regenerated. Seeds and associated information will be distributed on request to scientists. 2) Conduct genetic characterizations and phenotypic evaluations of wheat, barley, oats, rye, and other small grains and related wild species for priority genetic and agronomic traits. Apply the preceding knowledge to genetic resource acquisition and curation of selected taxa. Ploidy levels of wheat landraces and wild species of wheat, barley, and oats will be verified. Characterization data will be completed for key descriptors in wheat, barley, and oats. Kernel hardness will be determined for accessions of common bread wheat. 3) Identify and genetically characterize host-plant resistance to the virulent stem rust race Ug99 from NSGC wheat accessions.  Approach: Established procedures will be followed to maintain all NSGC germplasm accessions, with special attention to seed preparation and planting, plant pathogen monitoring, harvest, and laboratory processing. Seed of NSGC accessions are held in medium-term storage under controlled temperature (5-6 C) and relative humidity (25%). Inventory records, including quantity of seed on hand, viability, and date of last regeneration, are maintained in GRIN. Accessions will be scheduled for regeneration based on a priority matrix. Seed will be provided to the NCGRP for safety back up. Standard procedures for GRIN Order Processing will be followed. Distributions outside of the US will follow phytosanitary requirements of the recipient country, including import permits, phytosanitary certificates, and additional declarations. USDA-APHIS will be consulted regularly for the latest information on seed export. The ploidy analyses will be conducted with the Partec CyFlow Ploidy Analyser® following protocols from the manufacturer and modifications developed locally for more efficient analyses of small grains species. Descriptor data will primarily be collected from the voucher images, but direct field and laboratory observations will also be used. Kernel hardness analyses will be performed with the Perten® Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS 4100), which is the wheat industry standard and is supported by USDA-Federal Grain Inspection Service. To identify new sources of resistance to the Ug99 lineage of Pgt, winter habit wheat landraces from the NSGC will be screened. Because field testing capacity at Njoro, Kenya is limited, the accessions will first be tested for adult plant resistance to US races in field trials St. Paul, MN in cooperation with an ARS scientist at the USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory (CDL). Accessions with resistance to the US races will then be tested as adult plants in the field for resistance to Ug99 and its variants in the USDA nursery in Kenya.   Accessions showing resistance in one Kenya test will be re-tested to confirm results and tested for seedling resistance to race TTKSK at the CDL. To map resistance to the Ug99 lineage of Pgt in spring wheat landraces and ascertain the relationship to known sources of resistance, mapping populations will be developed from crosses previously made with the susceptible spring line LMPG-6. Mapping populations will be generated either through single seed descent to the F6 generation or through doubled haploid (DH) production. At least 150 DH lines or recombinant inbred lines (RIL) per cross will be generated. The lines will be evaluated for adult plant resistance in the USDA nursery in Kenya and as seedlings against race TTKSK at the CDL."

PAUL,MN,55108,UNITED STATES,,,10.001,2013,404983.0,,"Objective(s): Wheat improvement is a balancing act requiring simultaneous selection for multiple diverse traits, including resistance to a range of diseases, to develop superior new cultivars. One of the diseases that is a subject of investigation here (Fusarium head blight, FHB) continues to cause significant economic losses to the U.S. wheat crop, while the other (stem rust) has the potential to do so. The overall goal of this project is to identify and characterize genes that will improve resistance to these diseases in wheat. The proposed approaches for improving wheat disease resistance will generate novel strategies, tools, and knowledge for protecting wheat against both FHB and stem rust that complement current breeding efforts for both diseases. These research activities will be coupled with the coordination of a service activity that permits wheat breeders to evaluate advanced germplasm for agronomic quality and disease resistance. Combining basic and applied research in this manner will ensure that new wheat cultivars continue to retain high yield and quality while also being protected from current and potential disease threats. To achieve project goals, three objectives will be pursued:  Objective 1: Develop and evaluate hard red spring wheat with improved Fusarium head blight resistance by mapping and introgressing both a new resistance QTL and a novel genome deletion that increases resistance. Objective 2: Evaluate genotypic background effects on Fusarium head blight resistance expression by examining the genetic control of resistance suppression. Objective 3: Characterize and isolate genes for stem rust resistance from the model plant Brachypodium distachyon for introduction into wheat. Objective 4. Characterize non-host resistance to oat rust diseases in the model grass Brachypodium distachyon.  Approach: Wheat is the most widely grown crop in the world and is a major staple food for humans. Wheat is economically very important to the United States, which ranks third among all countries in wheat production and is the world’s largest wheat exporter. Both abiotic and biotic stresses can cause significant fluctuations in U.S. wheat production. Reducing current wheat losses associated with the fungal disease Fusarium head blight, and taking steps to protect the crop against the threat posed by stem rust, will increase both the stability and profitability of U.S. wheat production. This research project seeks to contribute to the goal of controlling these diseases by completing genetic, molecular genetic, and genomics research that will further our understanding of genes and molecular processes that are involved in resistance to these diseases. The results of this research will provide both new resources and new knowledge that can be used to increase resistance to Fusarium head blight and stem rust in wheat. This in turn will lead to improved wheat yields and yield stability for producers and will ensure that the U.S. wheat crop is protected against current and future disease threats."

Identify and develop wheat germplasm adapted to the Pacific Northwest of the United States with improved tolerance to pre-harvest sprouting, drought stress, cold temperatures, rusts, and soil-borne diseases.    1A.  Identify sources of drought, cold, and disease tolerance by phenotyping subsets of the National Small Grains Collection as well as international and regional nurseries.   1B.  Reduce production risk by developing germplasm with increased resistance to stripe and stem rust.   1C.  Breeding club wheat and hard white winter wheat.  Objective 2:  Develop more efficient wheat and barley breeding approaches based on high throughput phenotyping and genotyping methods as well as genomic selection models.   2A.  Identify and apply SNP markers for basic biology and MAS in wheat and barley. 2B.  Develop high-throughput phenotyping methods for measuring freezing and drought tolerance. 2C.  Develop statistical models for genotype response to environmental stress that improve the efficiency of selection and breeding.    Objective 3:  Investigate the mechanisms controlling drought and cold tolerance, pre-harvest sprouting, and rust resistance in wheat.   3A.  Identify and combine physiological mechanisms that support yield under water stress in wheat including water-use efficiency, root architecture, and photosynthetic efficiency.  3B.

Examine the role of the plant hormones ABA and GA in controlling seed dormancy, germination, and preharvest sprouting tolerance.  Approach: Objective 1.  We will evaluate a total of 6,356 accessions for resistance to freezing injury, Fusarium crown rot, lesion nematodes, cyst nematodes, and stripe rust. We will conduct these evaluations using facilities at WSU, including controlled environments in the WSU Plant growth facility and at the Spillman Agronomy Farm. We will use the genomic information generated by the T-CAP for the existing core collection to link phenotypes to genotypes. We will also screen germplasm from U.S. regional nurseries. These selections will be genotyped to determine relationships and, on the theory that genetic control of resistance will be different among genetically diverse genotypes, traits from the most diverse will be introgressed into adapted cultivars, and germplasm adapted to various regions of the U.S. carrying unique new sources of resistance and molecular markers that can be used to select for these new resistance loci.   Objective 2.  Specific areas that are being targeted in SNP development include identification of SNP markers linked to stem and stripe rust resistance genes, climatic resilience and identification of SNP in wheat responsible for regional and market class adaptation. The current small grains single plant core collections are being evaluated for SNP linkages to drought, stripe, leaf and stem rust response. As new, verified markers are identified, they will be made available to the customers of the genotyping laboratory as applicable to the customers’ research and breeding objectives. Our goal is to transition away from single gene selection using SSR markers, genotyping by sequencing and incorporate genome selection utilizing SNPs through SNP-chip platforms.  Objective 3.  Pathways and mechanisms controlling drought and cold tolerance, pre-harvest sprouting, and rust resistance in wheat will be elucidated. Indirect selection for tolerance to freezing and to drought based on physiological traits associated with drought and freezing tolerance will be carried out as part of the selection process. Plant lines will be selected for higher water use efficiency, deeper roots, and higher photosynthetic efficiency to develop better grain yield and grain-filling under drought stress. Transcriptome analysis will be used to identify pathways and mechanisms responding to freezing stress and stripe rust. Key genes will be identified and their expression monitored under stress conditions, thereby identifying plant lines differing in their abilities to respond to parts of the freezing or infection process. Variation in sensitivity to plant hormones will be investigated as a means to control and improve seedling emergence and preharvest sprouting tolerance. These different abilities and sensitivities will be genetically combined, resulting in improved stress tolerance."

Approach: The goal of this project is the genetic improvement of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) by application of molecular genetics and biotechnology to increase disease and pest resistance. Research will target molecular mapping approaches for resistance to greenbug [Schizaphis graminum (Rondari)] and Russian wheat aphid [RWA Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov)], insect pests that are of increasing importance as barley production moves west and additional aphid biotypes are discovered. Initial association mapping of RWA resistance suggests involvement of genes for domestication. This association will be further investigated using an expanded population and single nucleotide repeat (SNP) markers to identify candidate genes in key genomic positions. Additional biotypes of RWA will be tested on the expanded population to identify biotype-specific resistance. The two named greenbug resistance genes Rsg1 and Rsg2 do not provide protection against some of the new isolates emerging in farmers’ fields. Eight new sources will be mapped using F6 derived lines from crosses to a winter barley cultivar. Fusarium head blight (FHB) and resultant contamination of grain with the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) are ongoing problems in major barley production regions. Genetic transformation research will continue with candidate genes for resistance and low DON. In conjunction, ongoing research to improve tissue culture regeneration and transformation systems will continue to examine the role of ethylene in regeneration and to test improved transformation constructs carrying genes for reducing FHB and DON. Transformation constructs will be designed to separate genes of interest from selectable marker genes, and to insert the genes of interest into euchromatic areas that provide stable expression."

Documentation of fitness cost of virulence in Hessian fly to R genes in wheat will be assessed by determining effects on survival to adult and fecundity during selection for virulence to specific R genes over multiple generations.  Objective 3: An in planta translocation feeding assay that allows toxic proteins to be ingested by Hessian fly larvae will be used to discover potential transgenes for resistance in wheat to this pest. The most efficacious toxic proteins documented in the feeding assay will be selected for biolistic transformation of wheat in collaboration with a cooperator at Kansas State University and tested for efficacy of resistance in transgenic plants to Hessian fly as well as the other major insect pest of wheat (i.e. green bug, Russian wheat aphid and wheat stem sawfly). With Hessian fly, the ultimate goal is to have transgenes for resistance under the control of Hessian fly responsive promoters so that toxic proteins are expressed only at the feeding site of larvae and not ubiquitously in the plant. If issues arise with evaluation of toxic proteins with the Hessian fly feeding assay we will evaluate candidate toxic proteins in bioassays with Drosophila melanogaster. If Hessian fly responsive promoters do not become available, we will use other wheat promoters, such as a phloem specific promoter, to avoid ubiquitous expression in the plant. A phloem specific promoter should also be effective against aphid pest of wheat."

Screen for resistance to ear- and kernel-feeding stink bugs, sap beetles, thrips and maize weevil in maize germplasm from the GEM, the CIMMYT, and the U.S. maize germplasm collection. 1C. Evaluate sorghum lines from the U.S. germplasm collection for anthracnose resistance. 1D.

Develop maize and sorghum germplasm adapted to the southeastern United States with enhanced resistance to diseases and insects. 2A. Develop maize germplasm with reduced aflatoxin accumulation, increased resistance to insects, and enhanced agronomic performance in the southern Coastal Plain region. 2B. Develop sorghum germplasm with improved disease and insect resistance and high yield potential.  Approach: Objective 1:  Exotic maize germplasm from the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) Program, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (or CIMMYT), Mexico, and the U.S. maize germplasm collection will be screened for resistance to multiple insects and diseases, and reduced aflatoxin contamination.  Equal priority will be given to the GEM and exotic germplasm, since the GEM germplasm will likely have better agronomic traits but the exotic germplasm may have better adaptation to the South.  Such a combination has the potential that allows us to identify new germplasm resistant to multiple insects, diseases, and reduced mycotoxin contaminations.  To effectively serve the seed industries, the screenings of maize insect pests will focus on ear- and kernel-feeding insects, in particular, stink bugs, sap beetles, thrips and maize weevil.  The genetic and biochemical bases for the biotic stress resistance in these newly identified germplasm lines will be further examined.  Three genetic studies (i.e., diallel analysis, xenia effect, and heterosis) will be used to elucidate the genetic mechanisms, whereas phytoalexins and other secondary metabolites of plants will be examined to elucidate biochemical and physiological bases of biotic stress resistance.  A similar approach is utilized for the screening of sorghum germplasm for resistance to multiple biotic stress factors.  Previously identified disease resistant and agronomically-elite germplasm in the U.S. germplasm collection will be screened for resistance to fall armyworm, foliar anthracnose disease, and sorghum midge.  The genetic mechanisms of insect and disease resistance will be examined utilizing three genetic studies (i.e., North Carolina Design II, heterosis, and xenia effect).  The contributions of the secondary metabolites to biotic stress resistance in sorghum will also be examined.   Objective 2:  New maize breeding crosses will be made by recombining germplasm with superior agronomic traits with the newly identified germplasm that confers multiple insect and disease resistance and with reduced mycotoxin contamination.  New maize germplasm will be developed by continuously screening and continuous self-pollination of the segregating populations.  At the same time, recombinant inbred lines (RILs) will also be developed to identify DNA markers for the newly-developed multiple pest-resistant maize germplasm lines.    New sorghum breeding crosses will also be made using the newly identified sorghum germplasm lines that are resistant to multiple biotic stresses and with good yield potential.  The breeding crosses will be continuously screened and selected, and self-pollinated to develop and release new sorghum germplasm lines (B lines, or maintainer lines).  The best B lines will also be converted into A lines (or cytoplasmic-nuclear male sterile lines) to serve the seed industries.

The genetic diversity and genetic control of resistance in these crops will be characterized using genetic and genomic approaches, leading to advanced understanding of the defense mechanisms in the hosts and discovery of genes and factors that regulate host defense against insect pests.  The identified resistance genes will be transferred into elite, adapted genetic backgrounds.  Plant genotyping will be conducted to map aphid resistance genes to the crop chromosomes and to develop molecular markers for marker-assisted selection to facilitate the breeding process.  The research team of the project will work closely with collaborating plant breeding programs to obtain elite breeding lines to use as parents in backcrossing procedures to transfer aphid resistance and other value-added (e.g., enhanced ethanol production) traits.  The genetically improved germplasm will be field-tested for agronomic and quality performance prior to release.  The project will provide testing and selecting support to assure these desirable genes move through the various breeding programs on their way to the producers via cultivar and hybrid releases."

Greater understanding of avirulence effectors in the Hessian fly and the leaf rust pathogen may lead to better strategies for durable resistance. Likewise, uncovering the mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance may lead to discovery of new tolerance genes with improved or complementary effects."

The new HMW-glutenins will be designed either to lack individual cysteine amino acids or with changes in the spacing of their cysteines. The variant genes will be introduced into hexaploid wheat by biolistics. The effects of the cysteine modifications on gluten polymer formation in the transgenic seeds will be assessed biochemically and with small-scale mixing tests.  In a second line of research, transgenic wheat containing high levels of HMW-glutenin Dx5 or Dy10 in their seeds will be crossed to one another to obtain lines in which the amounts of x- and y-type subunits are approximately equal.

These molecular tools will enable improved and precise engineering of complex, multi-gene traits in crop plants. Site-specific recombination systems and gene expression control elements with proven utility will be made available to researchers in the public and private sectors.  Objective 1:  Develop and deploy in crop plants site-specific recombinase-based systems for (1) targeted transgene integration and gene stacking, and (2) marker gene removal to prevent gene flow to non-genetically engineered crops.   Subobjective 1a: Enhance site specific recombination systems for precise integration and excision in crop plant cells. Subobjective 1b: Use Dual RMCE to produce Foundation Lines that will allow transgene stacking via reiterative targeted integration and marker gene removal.  Objective 2:  Identify and demonstrate the utility of crop-derived gene expression control elements (promoters/enhancers/terminators/insulators) that facilitate trait development in crop plants. Subobjective 2a:  Isolate and characterize novel promoters. Subobjective 2b:  Isolate and characterize novel transcription terminators.  Approach: Random mutagenesis will be used to generate site-specific recombinase variants that will be screened for improved integrase and excisionase activities in a recombinase activity assay. Versions with improved catalytic activities in bacterial cells will be tested in plant cells. Mutated recombinases with improved activity will be codon optimized and tested in transgenic plants. In parallel, “target” transgenic plants will be generated by Agrobacterium–mediated transformation of Camelina. “Exchange” T-DNA vectors will be constructed to test four pairs of uni-directional recombinases, and designed so that an incoming gene is integrated at the target site and the selection marker gene is excised in a two-step sequential process. The “exchange” vectors will be transformed into the “target” Camelina transgenic plants. Negative selection will be used to screen for transformants in which the incoming DNA has replaced the original transgenic locus (Recombinase-Mediated Cassette Exchange or RMCE). The resultant transgene structure will be molecularly characterized to demonstrate that cassette exchange and selection marker gene removal have occurred. The efficiencies of different combinations of the unidirectional recombinases in performing RMCE will be compared.    Candidate promoters with new cell-type/organ or stress-responsive specificities will be identified from crop plants using gene expression analyses. Emphasis will be on selecting candidates that have potentially useful expression patterns, but are not expressed in the grain. The candidate promoters will be fused to a reporter gene and transformed into rice, wheat, Brachypodium distachyon and/or other plants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens or biolistic transformation methods. Novel transcription terminator sequences will also be isolated from crop plants and fused to a reporter gene. The functionality of these promoter and terminator testing constructs will be examined in transient expression assays and stably transformed transgenic plants. Reporter gene expression levels will be quantitatively measured in major organs and compared to identify the sequences that provide the highest levels of transgene products while preserving promoter expression specificity. Additionally, a screen to identify “insulator” sequences that protect the expression of transgenes from undesirable interactions with nearby enhancers will be performed using a construct containing two copies of the highly active 35S enhancer. A library of crop genomic sequences will be tested for insulation activity using a transient expression assay. Selected candidate insulator sequences will also be tested in stably transformed transgenic plants. The functionality of the candidate insulator sequences will be validated if their insertion between the double 35S enhancer and a test promoter preserves the native specificity of the test promoter."

Mitigation of effects on end-users requires fundamental understanding of the influence of plant nutrition and environmental stress on flour protein composition, quality and allergenic potential. The project builds upon a portfolio of research accomplishments in proteomics, molecular biology and plant biotechnology using the US spring wheat Butte 86. Specifically, the research combines both transgenic and proteomic approaches to explore relationships between wheat flour quality and individual proteins that were shown previously to respond to high temperature or fertilizer during grain development. Objective 1 focuses on specific gluten proteins that are likely to play a role in flour quality while Objective 2 focuses on both gluten and non-gluten proteins that are known food allergens. A final component of the research investigates the effects of drought on the flour proteome thereby refining the picture of environmental impacts on flour quality and allergenic potential.  Objective 1:  Establish links between flour quality and quantitative changes in the flour proteome that occur in response to temperature or plant nutrition.   Subobjective 1A. Create transgenic wheat lines in which genes encoding specific proteins that respond to temperature or fertilizer have been silenced.  Subobjective 1B. Determine the effects of gene silencing on the flour proteome, glutenin polymer distribution and flour quality.  Objective 2:  Develop transgenic approaches to reduce the immunogenic potential of wheat grown under changing environmental conditions.  Objective 3:  Determine the molecular basis for variations in flour quality that occur in response to drought during grain fill.  Approach: Two hypotheses will be tested in Objective 1. Subobjective 1A will test the hypothesis that the silencing of genes in transgenic Butte 86 plants will provide genetic material for elucidating the roles of specific proteins in flour quality and in the response of the grain to post-anthesis nitrogen or high temperatures. RNA interference will be used to create transgenic lines suppressing omega-5 gliadins, omega-1,2 gliadins or s-type LMW-GS. The precise effects of the genetic modifications on the flour proteome will be evaluated by quantitative 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Subobjective 1B will test the hypothesis that reductions in omega-5 gliadins, omega-1,2 gliadins or s-type LMW-GS alter glutenin polymer distribution and flour quality in transgenic plants grown under different post-anthesis nitrogen regimens. Transgenic lines will be grown under a moderate temperature regimen with and without post-anthesis nitrogen to determine how the grain responds to nitrogen in the absence of omega-5 gliadins, omega-1,2 gliadins or s-type LMW-GS. Quantitative 2-DE will be used to compare the amounts of individual flour proteins from control and transgenic plants grown under the two regimens. The proportions of individual gluten proteins in extractable and unextractable glutenin polymer fractions also will be determined. Proteomic results will be correlated with analyses of flour quality in the same samples.  Objective 2 will determine whether food allergens that increase in the developing grain in response to temperature or fertilizer can be eliminated without major impacts on grain development or flour quality. RNA interference will be used to reduce or eliminate two confirmed food allergens, the omega-5 gliadins and the 9 kDa lipid transfer proteins, in grain from transgenic wheat plants. The extent of suppression will be examined by quantitative 2-DE of flour proteins and quality of the transgenic flour will be assessed using mixing and baking studies. Allergenic potential of transgenic lines lacking specific proteins will be tested by immunoblot analysis using sera from patients with confirmed wheat allergies.   Objective 3 will determine whether drought results in quantitative changes in some of the same flour proteins that are affected by temperature and fertilizer. Wheat plants will be grown in greenhouses under controlled temperature, fertilizer and water regimens and quantitative 2-DE will be used to identify specific gluten and non-gluten flour proteins that respond to drought. The effects of drought on glutenin polymer distribution and composition and flour quality also will be determined. The studies will expand the understanding of the effects of environment on the wheat grain and identify new targets for genetic modification."

In addition, one project objective also addresses the use of markers in wheat and common bean improvement through identifying loci impacting a range of traits including disease and environmental stress and product quality and developing additional markers for marker assisted selection.  An additional objective is the whole genome sequence analysis of two perennial soybean species that can ultimately serve as sources of genetic variability for cultivated soybean.  A final objective relates to determining the genetic influence of the soybean on the genotype of the nitrogen fixing bacteria that form root nodules on the soybean host plant.    The specific objectives of the project are: Objective 1:  Develop a Core Collection for wild soybean and provide whole genome sequence data of the Core Collection, as well as elite cultivars that will be used in crosses with selected wild soybean accessions, and analyze highly productive progeny as well as unselected progeny from the G. max x G. soja crosses to further define and delimit the genome regions associated with soybean domestication and agronomic performance.   Objective 2:  Discover QTL and genes controlling biotic and abiotic stress resistance, agronomic and quality traits in soybean, wheat, and common bean, and develop DNA markers that define haplotype variation across these and previously identified regions. Objective 3:  Determine the DNA sequence and define sequence variation and linkage disequilibrium of at least one perennial Glycine species.   Objective 4:  Determine the nature of the host–regulated genetic control of the specific strain of Bradyrhizobium japonicum that occupy the nitroge  Approach: The genetic analysis of 1,150 wild soybean accessions in the USDA Germplasm Collection with 50,000 SNP DNA markers will provide the genetic data to select a Core Collection of 60 wild soybean accessions.  Thirty of the accessions were used by collaborators in crosses with cultivated soybean followed by intense selection and yield evaluation.  The whole genome sequence (WGS) of the Core Collection, the adapted parents used in the cultivated x wild crosses, as well as a set of the highest yielding progeny and a similar set of unselected progeny from each cross will be determined.  These data will facilitate a comparative sequence analysis to identify genome regions containing genes associated with domestication and unique genomic regions/genes from the wild soybean.  Genetic markers to introgress the wild soybean-derived genes into cultivated soybean will be identified.   The available WGS of common bean and wheat will be analyzed to identify SSR DNA markers.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets flanking the SSRs will be designed and used to establish SSR marker databases for common bean and wheat.  To evaluate the utility of the databases, a set of SSRs will be selected to amplify DNA from a set of genotypes and the amplicons visualized for locus specificity and polymorphism.  In the case of wheat, additional WGS analyses using the HiSeq 2000 DNA sequencer will be performed on a small set of hexaploid wheats to provide additional data for SSR identification.  In the case of soybean, analysis of 50,000 SNP DNA markers on the USDA Germplasm Collection of more than 18,000 cultivated soybean accessions will be used to identify a set of 6,000 SNP markers that are highly informative and well distributed across the soybean chromosomes.  The 6,000 SNPs will be used to create a new Illumina BeadChip for soybean genome analysis.  This Beadchip, along with a previously designed 6,000 SNP BeadChip for common bean, will be used to discover genes/quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling important traits including resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and agronomic and seed quality.  Genomic DNA libraries of perennial Glycine species G. tomentella and G. canescens will be prepared for DNA sequence analysis on the HiSeq 2000.  Size-selected DNA libraries ranging from 500 bp to 10 kbp will be developed for paired-end sequence analysis.  Construction of four DNA libraries with fragment sizes of 500bp, 2.5kb, 5kb, and 10kb will be produced.  The resulting 150 bp sequence reads will be processed using SOAPdenovo software.  The resulting sequence scaffolds will be anchored to the G. tomentella and G. canescens chromosomes using genetic maps created using genotyping by sequencing.   Recombinant Inbred line (RIL) populations of progeny from crosses of Williams 82 soybean with nodulation-restricting genotypes PI377578 and PI417566 will be analyzed for nodulation phenotype.  Bulked segregant analysis using 1536 SNP DNA markers will be used to identify the position of the gene in each population controlling restricted nodulation.  Additional markers will be developed and used to verify the position of the genes controlling restricted nodulation."

This project eliminates the gigabit bottleneck by providing an order of magnitude faster networking than currently available, which is preventing researchers at Kansas State from fully and effectively collaborating with both local and distant partners. This project also provides a testbed for research and educational outreach to K-12, community-college, and Kansas-wide academics to explore bioinformatics, genomics, high-throughput phenotyping, and high performance computing.Kansas State University is installing enterprise-grade routers with a 40GbE core and plentiful 10GbE ports to provide a foundation for upgrading KSU's bioinformatics researchers' network capacity to their major research labs, including end-to-end connectivity for KSU's campus supercomputer cluster, the Arthropod Genomics Center, and the Integrated Genomics Facility. This impacts researchers across 16 locations, hundreds of graduate students, and millions of dollars in funded research.The improved connectivity allows scientists to look deeper when modeling genomes, enabling new algorithms to be developed for phenotyping and bioinformatics.

The process is based on a unique lipid- accumulating microorganism found in Yellowstone National Park that is capable of directly converting a wide range of feedstocks such as wheat straw, corn stover, and industrial by-products (e.g. molasses, glycerol) to valuable lipid products such as Omega-7 fatty acids and high-melting temperature waxes. Renewable oils, waxes and fatty acids have significant demand in a wide range of industries (e.g. neutraceuticals, biolubricants, cosmetics, candles and soaps). Consumers will clearly benefit from this technology through the reduction of our dependence on petroleum-based products while generating a market for agricultural wastes and by-products. Since few companies and research groups are investigating fungal lipid production directly from lignocellulosic biomass for higher- value products, both industry and the scientific community will benefit from the knowledge gained by this research. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project describes a simple, novel and cost-effective process for converting lignocellulosic and other waste feedstocks to high- value lipids using a microorganism isolated from Yellowstone National Park, which is capable of withstanding extreme acidic conditions and producing powerful enzymes for degrading cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose. The organism accumulates high concentrations of valuable lipids in a cost-effective ?one-step? process. The produced lipids based on renewable resources creates a market for waste agricultural materials. The primary objective of this SBIR project is to further develop the process for commercial production of lipid products from waste organic feedstocks. Phase II efforts will focus on optimizing the process with a bench pilot-scale system, performing process flow design and techno-economic analysis of commercial production systems, analyzing lipid products in detail, and targeting appropriate markets/customers for the produced lipid products. Coming out of the Phase II program, the goal is to have a pilot- level demonstration system designed to produce economically viable yields of high-value lipids from a variety of substrates for defined target markets and customers."

Ice nuclei are small particles that are especially efficient at forming ice crystals in clouds.  Very few particles in the atmosphere have this property, but their effect on clouds and precipitation is large.  The main aspect of this award will be the measurement of ice nuclei that originates from combustion sources, such as agricultural burning, wildfires, and vehicle pollution.  The number of ice nuclei and the ability of the particles to form ice crystals will be studied.  The end result of the project will be a better understanding of the role of particles from combustion sources in the cloud system, and an improved tool that will be incorporated into numerical models from the cloud scale to the global scale.  The researcher will also promote cross-disciplinary research between the atmospheric and biological sciences, as well as mentor a summer intern in order to enhance undergraduate training and learning.The ice nucleation activity of carbonaceous combustion aerosol is poorly constrained, with conflicting results from both field and laboratory studies.  This work will address this shortcoming through the direct sampling of combustion aerosols in the field, and associated laboratory work.  The main instruments to be used are the Colorado State University (CSU) continuous flow diffusion chamber (CFDC) to determine the number concentration of ice nuclei and the single particle soot photometer (SP2) to selectively remove refractory black carbon.  Biosamplers will also be used to determine the contribution of biological particles and organic materials.  Select particles will be further assessed using Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled to Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS).  The specific objectives of the project are to:  1) conduct laboratory experiments to test the technique of coupling the SP2 instrument to the CFDC, 2) measure ice nuclei from controlled winter wheat burns in Oklahoma, 3) conduct sampling of ice nuclei from wildfires in Colorado, 4) perform sampling of fossil fuel combustion near highways in Colorado, and 5) modify or create new parameterizations for cloud to global scale models."

Sustainability science is an emerging field that addresses the challenges of meeting human needs without harm to the environment, and without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. A strong scientific workforce requires individuals educated and trained in interdisciplinary research and thinking, especially in the area of sustainability science. With the SEES Fellowship support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish herself in an independent research career related to sustainability. This project focuses on food sustainability and security on a global scale. The partnerships built into this project will give the Fellow significant inter-disciplinary training (adding the components of randomized controlled trials and crop modeling) beyond the scope of her current expertise. This is particularly important since her goal is to become a sustainability scientist who combines methods and tools from the natural and social sciences to understand how humans are impacted by and adapt to environmental change. Specifically, the Fellow will participate in an interdisciplinary institutes (Center on Food Security and the Environment at Stanford, and Center for Effective Global Action at UC Berkeley). Also, at Stanford University, the Fellow will gain teaching and mentoring experience.Climate change is predicted to negatively impact agricultural communities and food security across the globe, with models estimating up to a 40% reduction in the yield of some crops by the end of the century. This is particularly problematic for wheat, which is a major staple crop (providing 20% of daily calories) that is already facing declining yields due to warming temperatures. Previous studies have shown that autonomous adaptation strategies (e.g. increasing irrigation, shifting planting date) are not enough to mitigate the negative impacts of warming, and planned adaptation strategies that introduce heat-tolerant wheat varieties are needed to sustainably bolster yields and food security in the face of climate change. Interdisciplinary research is necessary to (1) identify the most effective ways to introduce these new technologies to vulnerable communities, and (2) assess whether the predicted yield benefits of these crops are realized in the field where farmers may deviate from ideal management practices. This study uses randomized controlled trials from development economics to evaluate introduction strategies, remote sensing to quantify if new heat-tolerant wheat varieties provide yield benefits in the field, and process-based crop models to assess whether these new varieties provide predicted yield benefits in future warming scenarios. Understanding the effectiveness of information transfer is particularly important for heat-tolerant crops because, unlike high-yielding varieties introduced during the Green Revolution, heat-tolerant crops may not provide immediate benefits and only produce higher yields in unseasonably warm years. Thus, the adoption and diffusion of this technology may depend purely on whether farmers trust and receive accurate information about possible future benefits. This study is one of the first to examine the most effective ways to introduce new crops that mitigate against climate variability and future climate risk, which is necessary to sustainably enhance food security in the face of climate change."

The implications for how businesses run (online retailing, precision manufacturing), how science is conducted (environmental science, climate monitoring and modeling, astrophysics), and how governments operate (health care delivery, public safety, homeland security) are comparably enormous.  However, for many particular uses of massive data sets, not all of the available information is relevant; and a key first step in many big-data explorations is the identification of the most relevant subset of information required to address the particular question at hand. For example, when studying certain diseases, it is essential to first identify the most relevant risk factors and precursors. The more information that is available, the more difficult it is to identify the most relevant subset for a particular purpose, akin to the problem of finding a needle in a haystack.  Just as a threshing machine separates the wheat from the chaff, the research in this project will develop statistical methods that separate the relevant information (the wheat) from that information that is not relevant (the chaff), thereby enabling more focused and productive analyses of large data sets.More specifically, the research in this project will develop methods for identifying the subset of information that is most relevant when the data are used to derive a regression/prediction model or algorithm. In this case the problem of separating the wheat from the chaff is the often-studied problem of variable selection. This project will develop a new approach to variable selection that differs conceptually from existing approaches and promises to offer new insights as well as new methodologies. The new approach is based on the intuitive and universally relevant idea that a non-informative variable can be contaminated with noise without a subsequent loss of predictive power; whereas any amount of contamination to an informative predictor necessarily entails a loss of predictive power. Starting from the noise-contamination idea of variable informativeness, the project shows how the theory, methods, and algorithms from the field of measurement error modeling can be used to develop new methods of variable selection applicable across the full spectrum of model- and algorithmic-based prediction methods. Instances of the general strategy will be studied and refined for several particular prediction methods such as: nonparametric regression (based on splines, or kernels, etc.); classification/regression trees; dimension reduction methods (principle components, partial least squares, SIR, etc.); bagged or model-averaged predictors of any type; and ridge regression."

Morrell (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities)CoPIs: Kevin P. Smith (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities) and Justin C. Fay (Washington University)Through examination of the prevalence of deleterious mutations, the project will address a longstanding issue of both theoretical and practical importance. Important crops such as barley, rice, soybeans, and wheat are inbreeding and deleterious mutations could be of greater consequence on yield in these crops, as the mutations will more frequently occur in the homozygous state in inbreds than in hybrid cultivars. Once identified, deleterious mutations can be eliminated through marker-assisted selection using genomics tools that are independent of the cost and inaccuracy of phenotyping to increase yield and reduce disease prevalence in crop plants. The barley system to be used in this study is ideally suited to translate our understanding of the nature and importance of deleterious mutations to application within a nationally organized and primarily public sector plant breeding community. USDA regional genotyping laboratories serve barley and wheat breeding programs across the country, using contemporary genotyping platforms to perform selection with informative SNPs. Several large collaborative research projects in barley are developing next generation mapping populations, a centralized trait and genotype database and analysis tools, and other resources that can be employed to further explore the role of deleterious mutations in barley. The public nature of the national barley breeding community will make application of this research in commercially relevant breeding lines broadly visible to the agricultural research community. This provides a uniquely open research system where results can serve as a model for other plant species that are used for food, fuel, and other natural products. Finally, the project will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and an undergraduate in crop genomics, evolutionary genetics, and computational biology. Through involvement with outreach programs at both universities, the project will engage students from populations underrepresented in the sciences.The research aims to characterize the potentially conflicting effects of self-fertilization and strong selection on the proportion of deleterious mutations harbored in individual plant genomes. Using resequencing of barley exomes from wild accessions, landraces (local cultivars), and modern elite (high yielding) inbred lines, the project will determine the extent to which selection for yield has affected the proportion of deleterious mutations present across genomes. Given sufficient population sizes, active selection of progeny that are more productive than either parent clearly has the potential to reduce the proportion of deleterious mutations present in elite lines. Nevertheless, strong selection for alleles that improve inbred lines or adaptation to agronomic environments may also increase the frequency of linked deleterious mutations. Genome-level comparisons will permit the identification of loci subject to artificial selection and estimation of the degree to which barley breeding programs have eliminated deleterious mutations across the genome while simultaneously contaminating the genome with deleterious mutations through hitchhiking at agriculturally important loci. All data generated in this project will be accessible through long-term repositories such as the NCBI SRA, GrainGenes and the Triticeae Toolbox (T3) database.  Germplasm used in this project will be available upon request and through the USDA-ARS National Plant Germplasm System and Grin-Global."

This represents one of the first demonstrations of making glasses and glass-ceramics from unusual and sustainable mineral sources. The global production of new glass (excluding recycled cullet (recycled broken or waste glass)) is about 100 million tons, with flat glass accounting for approximately 55 million of these metric tons. Flat glass is typically ~70 wt.% silica, and so using these figures, it can be calculated that 36.4 million metric tons of silica is needed to satisfy the global demand.  Concurrently one can consider the worldwide production of the main three grains consumed by humans in 2011 was 2,173 million tons worldwide. These grains (of rice, wheat, and corn) produce waste in the form of husks, stems, and cobs, and they are about one fifth of the total production by weight. This figure amounts to about 435 million tons of waste, which will on average be 15% silica. Therefore, using these figures, 65 million tons of silica could have been harvested from these three waste streams alone.  This project will explore the feasibility of using these organic waste streams to make glass. TECHNICAL DETAILS: The research project addresses the following objectives: 1) understanding the physical and chemical properties of these novel glasses, 2) examining the advantages, if any, these glasses have over those produced with mined minerals, and 3) expanding this approach to other material systems such as glass-ceramics and ceramics.  A post-doctoral associate is working closely with Dr. Cornejo in each of the steps.  Initially, they are creating a catalog of minerals suitable for glass formation from food/agricultural waste.  From suitable precursor materials, glasses that are chemically identical to commercial glasses are being synthesized.  The resulting surface properties are being characterized using techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Although there is wide variation in maize resistance to herbivory, very little is known about the underlying genetic basis of these differences among maize cultivars. Genetic mapping, transcript profiling, insect bioassays, and biochemical approaches will be used to identify maize herbivore resistance genes. A particular focus area of this project will be the identification of biosynthetic and regulatory genes contributing to the production and transport of benzoxazinoids, a class of secondary metabolites with important defensive functions in maize, wheat, rye, wild barley, and other grasses. Research involving maize benzoxazinoid metabolism will provide a tractable model system for studying these agriculturally and ecologically important plant metabolites. Genetic mapping using a panel of diverse maize inbred lines will identify novel genes contributing to aphid and caterpillar resistance. Given the wide array of pests and pathogens against which maize plants protect themselves, there are likely to be interactions among the identified defense pathways. Defensive synergies and tradeoffs will be detected by comparing the genomic locations and biochemical functions of the identified maize genes that contribute to natural variation in herbivore resistance.  This project will lead to the identification of previously unknown maize genes that influence plant-herbivore interactions. Potential metabolic limitations and tradeoffs in maize defense against different classes of insect herbivores will be documented. It is anticipated that these expected results will open up new opportunities for using molecular breeding and transgenic approaches to improve herbivore resistance in maize, the most important agricultural crop in the United States. Research conducted through this project will help to train a new generation of students and postdocs for future careers in academia, industry, or government service. International research exchanges with the European ERA-CAPS (http://www.eracaps.org/) companion project entitled  Biosynthesis, transport and exudation of 1,4-benzoxazin-3-ones as determinants of plant biotic interactions (BENZEX)  will enhance the training of students and postdocs.  Experiments involving maize-herbivore interactions will be fully integrated into an established education and outreach program at the Boyce Thompson Institute. Undergraduate students from throughout the United States will be recruited to be part of a ten-week summer internship program. In one-week training sessions, biology teachers from under-resourced schools will develop new plant science modules for their classes. Experimental kits for conducting caterpillar-feeding assays in local science classrooms will not only provide students with hands-on research experience, but also generate new information about the mechanisms of maize defense against insect herbivory.  All data and resources generated through this project will be publicly accessible.  A major output of this project will be a publicly available toolkit for studying the role of benzoxazinoids in maize defense against herbivores and pathogens. Seeds of near-isogenic lines and mutants will be deposited in the Maize Genetics Cooperation stock center, DNA clones will be available upon request and assay methods will be published in scientific journals.  All DNA sequences will be deposited in public databases such as the NCBI SRA, Gramene, and MaizeGDB. Metabolite and metabolomics data will be deposited at METLIN (http://metlin.scripps.edu/).

Kianian (University of Minnesota-Twin Cities/ USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory)CoPI: Changbin Chen (University of Minnesota-Twin Cities)The interaction between the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes plays a critical role in the development of all eukaryotes. Hundreds of human diseases and many phenotypic variations in plants are known to be the result of alterations affecting this communication. However, the nature of nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions in plants is poorly understood. Wheat has the largest array of alloplasmic lines containing cytoplasmic genomes derived from wild and related species  than any other mammalian, insect, or plant system and is an ideal model system for the study of nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions. Studies in the PI's laboratory  showed that alloplasmic lines containing cytoplasm from wild wheat relatives showed significantly increased disease resistance, vigor, and productivity when compared to the corresponding euplasmic (with true cytoplasm) lines. Sequencing data from these lines also show that not only does the mitochondrial genome change by replacement of the nuclear genome but that those changes result in alteration of mitochondrial gene expression patterns. This EAGER proposal will investigate the role of cytoplasmic modifications in stress tolerance which could provide a new way of breeding for biotic and abiotic stress in crop plants.  The specific objectives are to: 1) determine the extent and role of cytoplasmic genomes on biotic and abiotic stress tolerance by investigating ~100 alloplasmic lines for resistance to pathogens and salt stress; 2) identify the cytoplasmic genome that is responsible for the altered response to biotic and abiotic stress; and 3) investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of cytoplasmic genomes on stress tolerance. This project will advance understanding of the role that cytoplasmic genomes play in providing increased tolerance to biotic and abiotic stressin plants and will be important in breeding. Current breeding strategies  rely purely on homogeneous cytoplasmic background of the predominant species. This study could change this paradigm to take advantage of cytoplasmic genomes from wild species that confer tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress.  The research activities will be interfaced with the University of Minnesota's programs designed to recruit and train students at all levels. A postdoctoral scientist will be mentored and advised by the two PIs and given training in genomics, bioinformatics, grant writing, networking and teaching, according to the individual development plan designed by the postdoctoral associate. All sequencing data generated by this project will be deposited in public databases such as NCBI. The germplasm developed by this project will be made available upon request through the USDA National Small Grains Collection."

Genetic exchange among species has played a major role in the group?s complicated evolutionary history, so a clear understanding of the relationships among species remains elusive. In species that exchange genetic material, the genomes can be mosaics derived from multiple sources, and as a result, evolutionary relationships inferred from genetic data can differ depending on which portion of the genome is used for the inference. Gene exchange has been convincingly implicated in the Triticeae, but the extent is still unknown. This research addresses the question by applying a genome-wide approach, sampling large numbers of short DNA sequences from throughout the entire genome from a broad sample of Triticeae species. The density of genome sampling, combined with the ability to determine the genomic location of the sampled sequences, will lead to a better assessment of the extent of genetic exchange, including which species are involved, and which regions of the genome are most affected.The results of this work will be informative to Triticeae breeders who rely on the processes of hybridization and gene exchange as tools for crop improvement. The methods of data analysis developed in this project will be useful for studies of other groups of organisms that undergo gene exchange. The funding will support training for one graduate student, along with discussion groups and training for a selected group of undergraduates from Olive-Harvey College, a minority-serving two-year college in Chicago."

Maize, and closely related grasses, produce spikelets in pairs, doubling the number of kernels produced in contrast to other, more distantly related cereals, such as rice, wheat and barley, which produce spikelets singly. Understanding the molecular and developmental basis for paired spikelet formation is of great practical significance as this information could be used to double yield in cereals that produce single spikelets. Collaborative comparative genomic studies also provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand the molecular basis for the evolution of this derived trait. The identification of the suppressor of sessile spikelet (sos) loci in maize provides a breakthrough into the understanding of the formation of the paired spikelet. Molecular, cellular and developmental approaches will be used to dissect the function of Sos1.  Additional molecular and developmental studies of Sos2 and Sos3 will enable the identification of additional genes regulating paired spikelet formation. The paired spikelet is produced by a meristem called the spikelet pair meristem.  Meristems continually produce organs through balancing the functions of maintenance and determinacy. The Sos loci will enable the dissection of the interaction between these two fundamental developmental processes, as well as providing insight into the evolution of grass inflorescence architecture.This research involves collaboration between a maize developmental geneticist and an expert in the evolution of grasses, and hence is interdisciplinary in nature. One graduate student and at least six undergraduate students will be trained in the McSteen laboratory. A summer seminar series will be developed to provide training for undergraduates in understanding the broader implications of evolutionary studies in science, education, and society. The PI will also speak to the public on the domestication of corn."

Co-combustion of biomass in existing coal-fired power plants is an attractive option to increase the share of renewable fuels in the energy market. Designing equipment for these blends requires knowledge of pyrolysis and combustion characteristics to maximize energy output, reduce emissions and optimize fuel ratios. The objectives of this research are to: obtain thermal evolution profiles (kinetics and devolatilized compounds) of region-specific coal-biomass blends and probe the effect of heating rate, particle size, and coal to biomass blend ratios on pyrolysis and combustion behavior. A systematic study on locally available second generation feedstocks (agricultural wastes - woods, wheat and corn stalks, and local manufacturing wastes - cocoa shells, barley, hops, fruit pits) blended with coal used by regional power plants will provide knowledge for the incorporation of locally-sourced organic refuse into power generation, and a broader understanding of optimizing such blends for energy generation. The proposed work aims to bridge the gap between fossil fuel dependency and a green energy future while expanding opportunities for students from underrepresented groups to ensure our future engineering workforce is as diverse as the population it serves.Intellectual Merit: Given infrastructure already in place for coal, the most likely avenue in the immediate future for biomass utilization is as a blended feedstock in coal-fired power plants. Coal-biomass blending has the potential to limit the overall cost of fuel for a power plant, assuming the costs to process the biomass (transportation, drying, milling, etc.) are lower than the coal while lowering the carbon footprint of energy production. This proposal explores the thermodynamics and kinetics behind coal-biomass blend combustion to maximize process efficiency, while simultaneously monitoring devolatilized compounds to ensure the co-combustion of biomass and coal represents an improvement in the emissions profile. The knowledge garnered from this work is immediately applicable to state air resource permitting agencies, and directly addresses the EPA's debate over the next three years on how to regulate biomass emissions. The proposed work also provides fundamental data on the behavior of U.S.-specific biomass-coal blends to assist in the transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources; the design of an effective thermochemical conversion unit requires knowledge of the chemical composition, thermal behavior, and reactivity of the fuel in question.Broader Impacts: Altering our workforce to more accurately mirror the composition of our society is a gradual process, requiring strong mentors and role models. If we are broadly inclusive -seeking out contributions from all perspectives - we can solve issues surrounding energy and the environment for future generations. The potential benefits of the proposed project to society are twofold: first, by investigating the blending of biomass with coal we can potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining current energy production. Second, by actively seeking students (graduate and undergraduate) from traditionally underrepresented groups, we better leverage our human capital to facilitate a diverse, competitive and globally engaged workforce. As many UNH students choose to remain in New England after graduation, a project that specifically addresses local energy needs prepares them to understand regional issues when competing on the job market. To engage the public and industry, the students and PI will present findings from this research at academic conferences and in peer-reviewed publications, and in technical reports to assist in policy-making and industrial energy production schemes. As part of her Broadening Participation Plan, the PI proposes to implement a seminar series called  Engaging Your Future  to the science and engineering community at UNH to work with students on overcoming challenges they face as underrepresented groups, building a resume, and identifying career opportunities. As a woman with a disability, the PI is in a unique position to mentor students from traditionally underrepresented groups through building a research agenda with direct applicability today?s challenges in energy and the environment."

Interest in aqueous extraction processes has been revived by increasing environmental concern about hexane which is the traditional solvent used by oilseed processors. The new technological developments such as accelerated solvent and enzyme aided water extraction methods improve oil yields and make aqueous processes economically viable as an environmentally benign cleaner alternative for oil extraction. The main limitation of aqueous extraction process is the formation of oil-in-water emulsion and its implications on downstream processing. Demulsification is one of the most critical processes associated with water extraction. Centrifugation and coalescence technology (addition of a compound that helps coalescence of oil as a continuous phase) are used to break emulsions. Centrifugation requires high energy input and the efficiency of the coalescence method tends to be low.Membrane technology can be an inexpensive and efficient alternative method for separation of oil and water phases from an emulsion. CMS has identified a low cost non-thermal process (room temperature) which can dramatically enhance separation of water from oil. Preliminary calculations suggest approximately 10-fold reduction in operating costs for the CMS membrane system. If this program is successful, we will be directly responsive to USDA&#39;s need for developing a process for using minimally or non-thermal techniques for food preservation. Since the process is low temperature with no gas-liquid interface, product degradation should be minimal and cost should be low.In this Phase I USDA SBIR, Compact Membrane Systems will work closely with Oklahoma State University to first fabricate targeted membrane modules and then demonstrate that these membrane modules can effectively remove water from wheat germ oil. Basic data from this evaluation will then be used for a preliminary economic evaluation of the drying process. Target processing costs are less than $0.01/gallon."

Empirical results from training populations and cross-validations show the great potential of GS to improve the annual rate of gain. Genomic selection can affect many aspects of a population that impact breeding efficiency including trait values, allele frequencies, diversity, and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Genomic selection is now being adapted by many breeders and it imperative to assess the impact of multiple cycles of GS on trait improvement and genome structure. This knowledge could be used to develop breeding strategies that enhance the efficiency of GS by accentuating positive changes and negating negative ones. The goal of breeding for a complex trait is often to make an undefined incremental improvement. Data used to implement GS can also be used to develop more concrete goals, develop strategies to achieve the goals, and monitor progress. For example, GS models could be used to estimate the maximum trait value a population could produce and to pick parental pairs and breeding method that provide the best probability of obtaining the maximum value.Overall Hypothesis:Genomic selection will affect traits and other aspects of the wheat genome and GS models and data can be used to develop efficient breeding strategies.Specific objectives:1) determine the impact of five cycles GS on target traits and breeding values (GEBV), 2) Assess impact of GS on the wheat genome 3) Assess GS strategies to obtain a target trait value, 4) develop criteria to pair parents to provide the best probability of obtaining a target value.Potential impact and expected outcomes: The research will help breeders decide whether to use GS and how best to implement GS. Our assessment of the impact of GS on genome structure can be used to determine population size, number and which crosses to make, strategies to offset the negative effects of drift, strategies to maintain diversity, and the extent and persistence of negative and positive linkage blocks and how to deal with them. Coupling GS with early generation breeding strategies designed to improve the efficiency of attaining defined goals will produce a greater probability of success and will improve the effectiveness of all subsequent breeding activities and resources."

We are focusing on four areas: Agriculture, Communities, Pest Diagnostic Facilities, and Pesticide Applicator IPM education. Under agriculture, we are maintaining a cutworm monitoring network that has been useful to alert growers to cutworm pests in crops such as wheat, barley, and peas so that management can be implemented in a timely manner. We are also working with farmer cooperators to initate real-time pest monitoring. A new pest monitoring website was initiated in 2014 where cooperators check traps and enter data into a website, allowing their communities to anticipate pest pressure due to the orange wheat blossom midge in cereals. This platform can be extended to other pests in the future. We will also continue our outreach efforts about insects, plant diseases, and weeds in the crop landscape including the popular AgAlerts (emailed alerts to stakeholders for notificaton about urgent pest issues). For community IPM, we are starting a new program to educate real estate agents about noxious weed identification and management so they can assist their clients in managing weeds and complying with state regulations. We will also be educating on new (Japanese Beetle) and old (bedbugs) insect pests in cooperation with Colorado and Wyoming. We will continue our efforts to educate landscape professionals and Master Gardener volunteers about IPM. A cornerstone of all of these educational efforts is the diagnostic laboratory at Montana State University. Every sample is an opportunity to educate the client about IPM based pest management. At the request of our stakeholders we are making a major effort to increase awareness of our services. Pesticide applicators are also being educated about IPM through traditional workshops as well as new publications and hands-on training materials."

The most severe crop pest is the wheat stem sawfly and after harvest, insects in storage reduce profitability of wheat in storage. The wheat stem sawfly is a difficult pest to manage because its biology and location within the stem of the plant makes it invulnerable to conventional agronomic management, including insecticides. Host plant resistance that has been used since the middle of the last century is vulnerable so there is a critical need to implement new measures to control this pest. The climate in Montana makes the use of protectant insecticides redundant and the residues from these impact ongoing trade negotiations with export markets. New methods to control the wheat stem sawfly are based on the successful implementation of integrated pest management, incorporating monitoring to make management decisions. We have developed a pheromone based monitoring template that can be adapted to provide data readily to Montana wheat producers. This data can be used to determine agronomic procedures at harvest and strategize potential implementation of trap cropping we have developed that is based on attractive and unattractive varieties of wheat. This tactic needs bioeconomic supporting data. In this unique system biological control by native parasitic wasps is very important. Using the same techniques to develop the capability to monitor for parasitic wasps is important, so that augmentation or conservation strategies can be undertaken when necessary. New methods to control wheat stem sawfly will be isolated from existing host plant defenses in related cereal and grass species and new resistance may be identified via selective screening of the world wheat germplasm. Testing known candidate factors for genetic manipulation to control the insect will be undertaken to show feasibility. We will also demonstrate that storage insect pests can be adequately managed using aeration to reduce grain temperature. Inert dusts are another effective tool for management of storage insects and we will develop more effective types of these fits well within the goal of limiting pesticide residue on Montana wheat. Profitability of wheat production could be enhanced by 10% if the existing tools we have researched and developed are fully utilized. The difficulties posed by the wheat stem sawfly are increasing in other states and the insect is unexpectedly moving south. With this worsening situation, it is imperative that new resistance techniques based on research on host plant defenses be strategically targeted as a critical research endeavor. Existing widespread problems with storage insects can be addressed more effectively with new inert dusts as candidate media for control of these insects, so these must also be developed. As new products for management of critical pests that are present both before and after harvest are developed agribusiness is stimulated as an associated benefit."

The majority is stored in commercial or cooperative storage facilities (approximately 35,000,000 bushels). Most of this grain is wheat. The major source of quality loss is insect infestation. As much as 15% loss of grain can be due to insect infestation. Assuming a market price of $4/bu, this loss may pose almost $22 million dollars. Therefore, producers and managers must keep close control of insect invasion to maintain marketable quality of their product. OPI Systems of Calgary, Canada, markets a product called Insector&reg;. There are three weaknesses in this system: it cannot accurately identify the insect, it cannot count internal feeding insects within the grain bulk and the system becomes overwhelmed with beneficial insect counts. These weaknesses open the door for vast improvements in the area of insect detection design. Other Oklahoma-produced commodities include lignocellulosic biomaterial. Biomaterial for biofuels production has characteristics necessary for optimum conversion efficiency. In order for ethanol producers to maintain their marketplace, real-time sensing and handling methods must be developed and adopted. The purpose of this project is to focus applied research efforts on the development of sensors to estimate insect populations, moisture content, biomass characteristics, and temperature and management techniques and handling methods to enhance the profitability of postharvest handling of grain, seeds, herbs, and lignocellulosic material."

Delisting of conventional insecticides necessitates the development of new insect management techniques compatible with IPM practices. This proposal will employ molecular genetic techniques to achieve these goals. In the case of wheat stem sawfly, basic molecular biology studies are completely lacking. To address this whole genome will be sequenced, assembled and annotated. This genetic information will facilitate the discovery and development of new molecular insect control targets. Lepidoptera sex pheromones are an example of an IPM success and are used in monitoring and mating disruption programs. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pheromone detection by the receptors will facilitate modern pharmacological-style approaches to developing new attractants and repellants. The dingy cutworm is an emerging pest that exists as three cryptic sibling species in the Northern Great Plains, each responding to slightly different sex pheromones. Its sex pheromone receptors will be cloned and functionally characterized. Wireworms are an example of pest resurgence after the removal of older first generation insecticides from the agricultural market. Past insecticidal seed treatments provided excellent control of wireworm damage for more than four decades and little research was conducted on basic wireworm biology. While as many as 20-30 different species may be potential pests in Montana there is no information on which species are damaging the crops, in part because species level identification is very difficult or often impossible using the damaging larval stage. By using DNA bar coding to elucidate the species actually damaging crops in Montana we will accomplish the first critical step of IPM, accurate pest identification."

Spring wheat and winter wheat are the major grain cereal crops grown in Montana. The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus is major pest and infesting both winter and spring wheat in the Golden Triangle Area. In contrast, two species of wireworms Limonius californicus and Hypnoidus bicolor are recently found to be serious pests infesting wheat and barley. All these species are causing millions of dollars annually ever since the management has been very difficult and challenging. The biological control program with entomopathogens, pheromone-based trapping technique to improve the capture efficiency of wheat stem sawfly and role of nutrients in C. cinctus management will be investigated. Since the pheromone compounds are not identified for the wireworm species found in Golden Triangle; the pheromone compounds of European based wireworm species will be evaluated. These works are as a part of the development of pheromone trapping techniques for monitoring and management for the wireworms and wheat stem sawfly. Canola is an important oilseed crop in the northern Great Plains of the United States and Canada. Flea beetles, Phyllotreta cruciferae and P. striolata, and diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, are the most serious insect pests of canola. The damage to oilseed Brassica crops from these beetles alone can exceed $300 million annually in North America. Producers are frustrated by the high incidence of flea beetles and diamondback moth on canola. Even small numbers of adults on plants can cause severe damage to the cotyledons and true leaves. While some control methods do exist, chemical application is both undesirable and expensive. Without appropriate effective controls, these insect pests are likely to cause significant reduction or complete loss of canola production in Montana. Canola growers in the Golden Triangle areas of Montana are applying various chemical pesticides and often seem to be expensive and not environmentally safe. The action threshold levels are used in pest management programs and are known to reduce insecticide usage. There are reports of flea beetle and diamondback moth infesting canola in several locations in the Golden Triangle areas of Montana. These insect populations can build rapidly, and cause problems in canola when plants start to bloom. We do not currently have any research-based economic thresholds from Montana for managing insect pests on canola, so the study will be undertaken to develop nominal threshold levels for P. cruciferae and P. striolata, and P. xylostella in spring canola. Once these threshold levels are developed, a sustainable pest management program will be developed based the action threshold levels. Research results from all projects will be disseminated to producers and extension personnel at community meetings and through extension publications. Contributions to the scientific community will be made through conference presentations and the publication of scholarly papers."

The anticipated long-term outcome of this germplasm improvement (breeding) project is the development and selection of economically viable cultivars of hardy kiwifruit for New England. The anticipated long-term impact of this project is the establishment of a new horticultural industry in the region that provides a new delicious, healthful product to consumers and a profitable option to growers. 2. The development of genomics resources for barberry: Present throughout New England, barberries have been shown to function as the alternate host to stem rust and stripe rust, two of the most devastating fungal diseases of small grains like wheat and barley. This project will assemble a collection of diverse barberry germplasm from around the world and develop needed molecular tools to aid researchers conducting barberry surveillance work in the region and globally. The anticipated outcome of this germplasm characterization (pre-breeding) project is a set of robust molecular tools that can discriminate among the nearly 500 species of barberry and lay the foundation for identifying the genetic mechanisms of rust resistance in the alternate host. The anticipated impact of this project is to help reduce the threat of wheat stem and stripe rust globally, as well as to educate growers of the risk posed by barberries in New England, in the face of increasing demand for local grain production."

Once lines are identified the mechanism of this resistance will be investigated. With the identification of mitochondria which improve disease resistance and the mechanism of this resistance, the information may be used by breeders to generate more disease resistant wheat lines. The results may also indicate other methods that could be used to increase disease resistance in wheat. Lastly the results will also provide insight into the interactions between the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome and how this interaction affects the health of the organism."

Fat and sugar are seen as the main contributors to the development of obesity and its many associated health issues. Consumption of high fat and/or high glycemic diets are related to the increased risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Reduced fat and low glycemic food, such as whole wheat breads, are recommended in order to prevent weight gain. Unfortunately, foods with low-glycemic index and reduced fat content are usually not favorable in terms of the texture and the palatability. Strategies that can reduce fat and sugar absorption without sacrificing food taste and sensory properties are in great demand. The main purpose for the supposed work is to develop dietary solutions for prevention and treatment of diabetes and obesity. Two potential solutions will be studied: 1) using nanocellulose to remove oils from gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and 2) using enzyme inhibitors to prohibit the digestion of carbohydrate and lipids. Although these two solutions are not necessarily related to each other, they both will contribute to effective dietary interventions for disease control and health improvement.

The roles played by individual proteins and enzymes of saliva is unclear. Research done has begun to enumerate the proteins, enzymes, and aphid saliva. The identification of the roles of these proteins and enzymes is just beginning. Identification and enumeration efforts on saliva-proteins/enzymes have featured mainly transcriptomics and proteomics. We will look at the insights in the pea aphid system from a combined proteomic and transcriptomic approach. Given our incomplete understanding of the aphid salivary-gland secretome, the goal of further identifying proteins and enzymes of aphid saliva will be central in our research. Obj B: The Russian Wheat Aphid (RWA) exists in biotypes which differ in the ability to feed on cultivars of wheat and barley. These differences may lie in the proteins/enzymes of saliva, allowing individuals of a given biotype to feed or be unable to feed on a given cultivar. Understanding biotype differences in proteins of saliva could lead new approaches to lessening the agricultural impact of RWA by genetic engineering of wheat and barley. The biotypes of most importance in the US are RWA1 and RWA2, and they have strikingly different abilities to feed on various cultivars of grains. Obj C: Of the various proteins/enzymes that have been identified, protein C002 is the one for which there is the clearest evidence of a required role in aphid feeding on a host plant. We provided the initial evidence, largely through a combination of transcript-knockdown by injection of dsRNA and electrophysiological studies. Knockdown of the C002 transcript resulted in early death of the aphids and a lack of feeding. Other researchers have provided different evidence that supports a role of protein C002 as an effector in aphid feeding on plant tissue. We have shown C002 knockdown has no effect on feeding by pea aphids on artificial diet. It appears that protein C002 is involved with the interaction of the aphid with the plant, and in particular in establishing or maintaining prolonged contact with the sieve element and the phloem sap. Obj D: We have found that levels of transcripts of proteins of pea aphid saliva increase up to 30-fold when aphids are moved from artificial liquid diet to a host plant. Only some of these changes are observed when the aphids are placed on a non-host soybean. Measuring changes in levels of transcripts that encode proteins/enzymes of saliva appears promising as a means of determining the roles played by the proteins now believed to occur in aphid saliva and the different classes of proteins of saliva. We will investigate the Russian Wheat Aphid, where the existence of biotypes provides a beautiful experimental system and an opportunity to gain insight into the mechanisms by which ability to feed on a cultivar of wheat is established. Obj E: The only aphid for which a genome sequence has been reported is the pea aphid. Efforts are underway now on the green peach aphid genome. Undertaking a genome sequencing project on the RWA is also important, given the agricultural impact of this aphid and the existence of RWA biotypes."

Among the major diseases of soybeans in South Dakota, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines)and the Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) are the most common. SCN is particularly a problem in South Dakota because it is relatively new and growers are either not aware or because of the absence of visual SCN foliar symptoms, growers don&#39;t consider SCN as a problem. Bean pod mottle virus is disseminated primarily by bean leaf beetles (BLB)and the overwintering and first summer BLB generations are the most important in the spread of BPMV. Lack of pre-plant overwintering BLB population prediction makes it difficult for growers to decide on insecticide seed treatment.In wheat, Fusarium head blight and leaf spot diseases cause significant yield reductions annually. Use of fungicide as a management tool for wheat fungal diseases has been increasing in South Dakota. However, most fungicide applications follow calendar sprays (for instance tank mix with herbicide application), irrespective of the disease intensity. This is in part due to lack of informationon effectiveness of timely application of fungicidein the management of fungaldiseases as well aslack reliable prediction of the likely risk ofplant diseaseepidemic development.Determining the occurrence and distribution of Heterodera glycines (HG) types present in South Dakota and continued sensitizationof the soybean growers on importance and management of SCN is crucial for increased soybean yield as well limiting SCN resistance development. Use of plant disease prediction tools can go a long way in limiting pesticide usage and ensuring a timely and effective pesticide application. The major focus of this research is determining HG types distribution and occurrence in South Dakota, validating the prediction tools for Fusarium head blight and bean leaf beetle winter mortality, and determining the effectiveness variousfungicide timings in controlling fungal pathogens in wheat.. The anticipated impact of this research is effective and sustainable management of major soybean and wheat diseases and ultimately increased profitability of the two crops."

In Alabama, farm gate receipts for these crops are estimated at more than $260 million ($139 million for corn, $90 million for peanuts, and $31 million for wheat) (USDA-NASS, 2010). Much is understood about diseases of each of these crops; however, cultivars, pesticides, and cultural practices continue to evolve, and such changes necessitate on-going evaluation. For example, peanut cultivars with resistance to TSW have allowed greater flexibility in planting dates in recent years. In addition, since resistance deployment is an economically efficient means of managing plant diseases, contributions to the development of improved cultivars would provide benefits to breeders and growers alike. Aflatoxin problems in either corn or peanuts are still poorly understood, but efforts continue to focus on predicting occurrences of these problems, developing cultivars with resistance to aflatoxigenic fungi and accumulation of the toxins, and development and deployment of biological agents with activity against aflatoxigenic fungi."

The first commercial biorefinery in the world was commissioned just this year (2013) in Crescentino, Italy. This facility, currently projected to produce 20 million gallons of bioethanol a year from wheat straw, was built by a partnership between Beta Renewables and Novozymes, Inc. Construction on at least two commercial-scale biofuels facilities are currently underway in Iowa by POET and Dupont. California has a rich resource of agricultural crop residues that can be used as feedstock for conversion to biofuels and bioproducts (1). Two of the leading companies in the push to establish the biorefinery industry, Novozymes and Dupont, have a strong presence in California. A tremendous opportunity exists for local production of biofuels from agricultural residues in California. The incorporation of cellulosic biofuels into the nation&#39;s liquid fuel portfolio is congressionally mandated as part of the Renewable Fuels Standard (2). The technological challenge, however, lies in the recalcitrance of cellulosic substrates to degradation (3). The state of technology relies on energy and chemically intensive pretreatments to aid in the breakdown of such substrates to fermentable sugars (4). Cellulosic (also termed &#39;lignocellulosic&#39;) substrates are chemical and structural complex. Moreover, cellulases and other complementary enzymes that breakdown the substrate into fermentable sugars are not fully characterized and understood. Taken together, the saccharification reaction (enzymatically breaking down lignocellulosic biomass to sugars) is not yet predictable and is challenging and costly to scale-up. This project seeks to further understanding on the mechanisms underlying enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass to ensure the future of biorefineries. Our studies include investigating cellulase-cellulose interactions and the origins of the resistance of cellulose to degradation and the nano- and micro-scale, investigating the mechanisms of common biomass pretreatment and processing strategies in improving enzyme digestibility of biomass and investigating the impact of biomass properties on saccharification challenges at high solids loadings (low water inputs)."

After rice is harvested, it is stored as rough rice in large storage bins on-farm or in commercial storage bins. It is then moved periodically to rice mills where it is processed as various products including brown rice, milled white rice and rice flour. As rice is stored and milled, it can be infested by a number of stored-product insects, greatly reducing the quality of the product. Insect pests of stored grains include the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica), red flour beetles (Tribolium casteneum), Indianmeal moths (Plodia interpunctella), warehouse beetles (Trogoderma variable) and other insects. These insects can either attack the whole kernel or they can attack the rice that is milled, and the byproducts of milling. There have been many studies conducted on the biology of stored-product insects in wheat. However, there are very few studies on insects associated with post-harvest rice, especially pertaining to the development and biology of insects infesting rice and rice milling components. Studies are needed so relevant integrated pest managementstrategies can be used at rice storage and milling facilities. The goal of this project is to understand the biological attributes of various stored-product insects associated with stored rice and milled rice fractions. Specific objectives will be toexamine the development of stored-product insects on various rice milling components (rough rice, bran, hulls, brown rice, white rice, broken rice and rice flour) using strains collected from rice mills/rice storage facilities in Arkansas; to determine the development of lesser grain borer and other stored-product insects on flora native to habitats in Arkansas and to determine if forested environments allow a refuge for stored-product pests. Understanding the biological requirements for insects associated with rice would allow for a strong foundation to develop IPM programs for the rice industry."

Changes in management inputs within crop production systems may be altered to increase the efficiency of use and the subsequent potential loss of nitrogen to the environment. The potential of nitrate leaching has not been fully evaluated within the delta of Arkansas. The development of tools to assist growers in decision making is important. Diversification in production systems within this region will also require an evaluation of the risk associated with nitrogen use.

These fungi and nematodes (tiny worms) attack the root system, so plants cannot take up adequate amounts of water and nutrients, which reduces yields. Growers do not have resistant varieties or fungicides/nematicides that can be used on these crops with a relatively low value per acre. However, there are natural populations of bacteria in the soil that can build up and suppress or limit these root pathogens. Natural suppression has been observed in eastern Washington, where the pathogen is still present, the host is still susceptible, but disease has declined or no longer occurs. How has this happened? We want to identify these microbes and their communities that limit these detrimental pathogens, understand how they work, and how growers can manipulate their growing systems (i.e., tillage, rotation, irrigation) to favor the buildup of these friendly microbes. The result is a natural control of these diseases without any costly grower inputs. In addition, soilborne pathogens continue to cause significant quantitative and qualitative losses in vegetable and vegetable seed crops in the Columbia Basin and northwestern Washington. Soil amendments such as limestone and compost show promise for inducing suppressiveness to some of these pathogens, and will continue to be evaluated in grower-cooperator trials and at research centers to assess mechanisms of suppressiveness, optimized use of induced suppression of soilborne pathogens, and cultural practices to reduce losses to these pathogens."

Exposure to C. neoformans is common, as it is an environmental fungus found in the soil and can enter the lungs through inhalation, leading to pulmonary infection. An increased rate of infection occurs in individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, particularly those with AIDS and recipients of immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment of cryptococcal meningitis relies on three old antifungal drugs each of which poses specific challenges such as in cost, toxic effects, and sustainability of supplies [1]. Acetate has been shown to be a major fermentation product during cryptococcal infection [2-4], but the significance of this has not been reported. Little is known about what enzymes are responsible for acetate production and how it is transported. However, genes encoding enzymes from three putative acetate-producing pathways and two putative acetate transporters have been shown to be upregulated during infection, suggesting that acetate production and transport may be a necessary and required part of the pathogenic process [5]. The primary objective of this study is to determine the role of acetate production and evolution in C. neoformans in metabolism and infection. The three acetate-producing pathways are present in other medically and agriculturally important fungi that affect South Carolina. Fungal infections pose an increasing threat to public health resulting in 10,000 deaths and an associated cost to the U.S. health care system of approximately $1 billion a year (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091222141624.htm). These include opportunistic infections of people with weakened immune systems caused by Cryptococcus and Exserohilum (causative agent of the meningitis outbreak tied to contaminated steroid injections in fall 2012), hospital-associated infections caused by Aspergillus, and community acquired infections caused by fungi that are abundant in the environment such as Coccidioides (valley fever) and Histoplasma. A recent survey from the international community resulted in the generation of a Top 10 fungal plant pathogen list [6]based on scientific/economic importance. The three acetate-producing pathways are present in all of the fungi on this list as well as many other important fungal pathogens that are not on the list such as Aspergillus. Therefore, our understanding of the role of these pathways in Cryptococcus will likely translate into a better understanding of fungal plant pathogens. We have also characterized one of the acetate-producing enzymes from the wheat pathogen Phaeosphaeria nodorum, and its characteristics are very similar to the C. neoformans enzyme. Thus, development of antifungal agents that target acetate production in C. neoformans will likely impact other pathogenic fungi of humans and plants. I have assembled a team that is uniquely positioned to carry out all of the genetic and biochemical approaches discussed in this proposal. We originally identified the acetate kinase pathways in eukaryotic microbes including a new pathway for acetate production in fungi and have a track record in the biochemical characterization and structure-function analyses of acetate kinase and AMP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase. The laboratory of James Kronstad (Director of the Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia) has extensive expertise in C. neoformans molecular genetics and in vivo characterization of virulence in a mouse model for cryptococcosis, as well as techniques for identifying genes that are regulated during infection or under other metabolic conditions."

In North Carolina, cucurbits, wheat, corn and blueberry are some of the most economically important vegetable and field crops. Stagonospora nodorum is among the key diseases that affect wheat in the US. This disease has become more common due to no-till wheat production, and particularly where wheat is double-cropped with soybeans. Downy mildewof cucurbits spread rapidly throughout North Carolina causing major losses in the spring crop and near total loss in the summer crop and many fields were abandoned without harvesting and suffered 100% loss. Aspergillus ear rot (Aspergillus flavus) of corn have become increasingly important due to losses associated with quality reduction due to mycotoxin contamination in harvested grains. One approach to increase the effectiveness of the disease control options is through the application of epidemiological principles to guide disease management strategies. Due to the lack of resistant varieties, growers frequently apply fungicide to control SNB in epidemic years with no form of decision support system to facilitate such applications. Although fungicides can be effective disease in managing the disease in epidemic years, the cost can be economically prohibitive when the price of wheat is low. Fungicides also have a negative impact on the environmnt and beneficial microorganisms. There are knowledge gaps in the utility of pre-planting factors in assessing the risk of SNB during the season to reduce fungicide applications. Currently, forecasts of cucurbit downy are provide in the US to guide the first spray but the within-season risk assessment to guide subsquent sprays has not yet been established.Further, due to the uncertainty in the initial sources of inoculum, there is a need to quantify the regional patterns of temporal increase and spatial spread of CDM. Knowledge on the early temporal and spatial spread is important to be able to predict future spread and potential damage of CDM. The recent resurgence of the disease also points towards a &#39;new&#39; pathogen population that has yet to be determined.Developing a forecast system to predict the carpogenic germination of M. vaccinii-corymbosi pseudosclerotia require detailed knowledge of the effect of important environmental factors on this process. This will allow growers to time fungicide application to coincide with when a majority of mummies are likely to germinate. Biological control is the most promising option for the management of aflatoxin contamination in corn. However, the efficacy of biocontrol based on the fields of application as well as agronomic and host factors that influnce biocontrol have not yet been determined.The proposedworkwillresult in more effective control and management of cucurbit downy mildew, Stagonospora nodorum blotch of wheat, mummy berry disease of blueberryby applying fungicide if and when it is necessary. This in turn will reduce the cost of production and thus, improve profits growers will make. In addition, reduction in the number of sprays will reduce the negative effects associated with pesticide use on the environment and beneificial organisms."

The threat to groundwater and surface waters is well recognized and understood; the threat to air quality is more poorly recognized but no less real. Nitrogen trace gases can significantly affect regional / global climate over long time scales, as can other trace gases such as methane. Agricultural landscapes may play a critical role in global balances of these greenhouse gases, and the inclusion of perennial biofuel crops in the landscape may represent a mitigation option. Our research is showing that crop management can significantly affect nitrous oxide (N2O) production and methane (CH4) consumption in Michigan corn-soybean-wheat rotations. Importantly, low-input management strategies do not necessarily affect gas fluxes less than high-input management - in fact, systems in which leguminous cover crops substitute for inorganic fertilizers can have higher N2O fluxes, and similar CH4 fluxes. Specific modern management practices in general may, however, have less of a long-term impact than the simple historical effect of original land-use conversion. This means that the transient seasonal fluxes of gases from row-crops may occur on top of a baseline flux that is already elevated due to original forest clearing and, in highly productive systems, is since supported by high cycling rates of added organic and/or inorganic nitrogen. Because of the importance of these gas fluxes to global climate change, and the potential for changes in environmental policy and emerging biofuel markets that could affect future crop management potentials (IPCC 2007, Robertson et al. 2008, 2011), it is important to better understand the nature of elevated fluxes in row-crops - from the standpoints of both long-term legacies related to land use change as well as contemporary management impacts. Our research is designed to address these questions by measuring fluxes in different agricultural systems, conducting experiments to identify the controls on fluxes, and testing mitigation opportunities in a whole-system context. Research findings will help to allow agriculture to play a positve role in climate change mitigation."

The impact of speculation, primarily by long-only index funds, on the booms and bust in commodity prices has been debated but with no conclusive evidence to either support or reject this hypothesis. Hence it is important to develop fundamental economic models that will address this issue followed with developing proper methodologies that will enable accurate assessment of the impact of speculation on commodity prices. Finally,I willassess the impacts of speculation via changes in commodity prices on producer welfare of North Dakota farmers. The United States is one of the world&#39;s largest both producers and exporters of agricultural commodities in general and grains in particular (FAO, 2013). Sudden and large price changes have large impacts on both demand and supply patterns, and in turn on agricultural producers. Sustained periods of high commodity prices lead to increased farm net-revenues and higher farm land prices (Shaik and Miljkovic, 2010). However, high grain commodity prices combined with changes in bioenergy policies and ethanol production also lead to decreased farm net-revenues in some sub-sectors of agriculture in which grains are used as production inputs such as livestock and dairy farming (e.g., Miljkovic, Shaik, and Braun, 2012). Hence impact of speculation on commodity prices is of utmost importance to overall farm sector in the United States as well as to the state of North Dakota, where agriculture is one of most important industries. While undeniable increased volatility in commodity prices due to increased presence of speculators in commodity markets has been a reason for dissent among farmers in the United States (Sanders et al., 2010), possible increase in farmers&#39; wealth due to the same impact may overshadow this negative impact of increased price volatility. It is therefore critical for both policy makers and farmers to fully understand the implications of increased presence of non-traditional speculators on commodity prices and farmers&#39; welfare. The results of this research should enable policy makers to better understand the interactions between operations of the futures markets, role and impact of speculations on fundamentals in commodities markets, and in turn on farmers&#39; long-term welfare.

Evidence of structural change comes from a doubling of the prices for corn, soybeans and wheat starting in 2006. The last time prices doubled was 1973-74. The higher prices were driven by rapid increases in ethanol production and the associated derived demand for corn. Exports were also a factor in structural changes due to a continuing devaluation of the dollar. In recent years one cannot ignore the emergence of China as an economic juggernaut with a middle class exceeding the entire population of the United States. The demand for food, protein, feed grains and other agricultural products is already reaching significantly into the U.S. Over the period of 2007-2012, U.S. agricultural exports rose from $82.2 billion to $135.8 billion - a 65 percent increase. Imports rose from $70.1 billion to $103.4 billion resulting in a positive agricultural trade balance going from $12.2 billion to $32.4 billion - a 166 percent increase (ERS and FAS, 2013). The principal benefits of this research includes information pertaining to trade creation and diversion, supply response, import demand, land values, price variability, agricultural value added, food safety, the environment, and emerging bio-energy issues. Improved competitiveness of the U.S. in international food and agricultural trade is expected to strengthen the employment base and increase income levels in respective states.

Income is derived from both grain and the increased value that is added as weight gain to growing cattle. This project is a multidisciplinary research and education project involving the Animal Science, Plant and Soil Sciences, and Agricultural Economics Departments. The goal is to be the premier program in the world for discovery and dissemination of scientific information that decreases production risks and improves profitability of feeder cattle and grain production from dual-purpose winter wheat; thus, strengthening the economies of rural communities in the southern Great Plains. The objectives of the research and education program are to: (1) develop supplementation programs and programs for delivery of new technologies that will decrease production risks of growing cattle on wheat pasture and increase profitability of the enterprise, (2) develop and distribute new wheat cultivars which maximize profitability of dual-purpose wheat enterprises, (3) determine the ecophysiological effects of grazing intensity on hard red winter wheat in an integrated crop-livestock system, and (4) determine the economic consequences of alternative strategies for managing cropland suitable for dual-purpose winter wheat production. Annual income in Oklahoma could be increased by $82 million by improving the technical efficiency of production of the approximate 1 million stocker cattle that are grown to heavier weights on wheat pasture in Oklahoma prior to being finished in feedlots. In addition, reductions in production risk would most likely result in greater utilization of the 5.8 million acres of wheat for grazing cattle contributing an additional $37 million annually to the state income. Therefore, the potential impact of this ongoing research project could increase annual state income by $176 million. Furthermore, this research has similar potential impacts on the 18 million acres of wheat planted annually and the 5.5 million wheat pasture stocker cattle in the states of Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, and In addition, because about 50% of the wheat grain produced in the southern Plains enters the export market, wheat grain derived from this enterprise must continue to support a wheat export industry that contributed $5.9 billion to the U.S. economy in 2010. Any single weakness in the enterprise will have multiple economic consequences."

However, the total area of wheat in the state has been decreasing steadily since 1990, as wheat cultivation is replaced by corn and soybeans. This large-scale change over the last 23 years has been beneficial to North Dakota&#39;s agricultural producers. For example, the introduction of several short-season corn and soybean varieties during this time frame has allowed producers to select from a wider variety of crops that can be produced profitably in North Dakota growing conditions. Increasing export demand for soybeans for foreign livestock operations has also increased soybean prices, making soybean production more profitable than before throughout the world. Federal subsidies for ethanol and biodiesel have also encouraged adoption of corn-soybean crop rotations by further increasing demand for these two crops as industrial input in the biofuels industry. Overall, these economic drivers of land use change are beneficial to farmers. However, land use change and public policy that promotes land use change may have unintended consequences for the environment. For example, different crops leave soil more or less exposed, potentially affecting soil erosion and water pollution levels. Productive agricultural lands also provide habitat for certain species. For example, winter wheat planted into stubble from the previous crop mimics the tall grass habitat preferred by early-nesting duck species. Spring wheat is also suitable nesting habitat for late-nesting duck species. These types of habitat are also preferred by pheasants. Thus, change in crop selection in North Dakota may affect the prevalence of certain economically valuable game animals. This project is an effort to model the economics of land use change in North Dakota and to explore the links between the agricultural economy and the environment in the state. It is anticipated that the resulting research will be useful to agricultural policy makers at the state and national levels, and may help private conservation organizations in targeting their conservation efforts."

Mycotoxins considered to be important, including aflatoxins, ochratoxins, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone, are produced mainly by three fungal genera, Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium. Some of these fungi may invade plants and cereal grains in the field during the growing season, as well as during postharvest handling processes such as drying and storage. Cereal grains are the most frequently affected commodity while all major crops and commodities may be contaminated with one or more mycotoxins. Moreover, the stable nature of mycotoxins often leads to contamination of products in downstream processes including finished products destined for human and animal consumption. Infection of mold and subsequent toxin production may occur naturally virtually at any conditions. However, among the various environmental factors, temperature and precipitation are considered most critical for invasion, growth, and toxin production in grain in the field. For instance, cool and wet weather during the growing season seems to be the most important factor for wheat in the development of Fusarium head blight (FHB) as well as accumulation of trichothecenes (including deoxynivalenol). The climate condition in Pacific Northwest region, or Palouse, allow wheat and other commodities to grow naturally without irrigation by seasonal precipitation. Fertile soil and lack ofsevere temperature fluctuation also contribute to the high yield of the important staple food crop. However, recent variability in climate prompted better understanding of agroecosystem to ensure grain quality and food safety since the fungal infection and mycotoxin production may not remain the same under the varying environmental conditions. It is particularly true in Pacific Northwest where natural precipitation in the past allowed agricultural commodities, e.g. wheat, to be cultivated without irrigation system. The lack of extreme fluctuation in temperatures during the growing season also contributed to the higher yield of crops in comparison to those from other regions. However, increasing daily and seasonal fluctuation of temperature in addition to the variability in precipitation due to climate change would affect mycotoxin production. Variability in climate may cause changes in soil system, including organic and inorganic matters, where plants are rooted to grow. As many plant pathogenic fungi and mycotoxin producers, e.g. Fusarium species, are soilborne and their population is largely affected by the climate and soil system, it would be plausible to investigate the impact of climate changes on the soil system that will determine toxigenic fungal population and their potential in growth and survival of the organism as well as mycotoxin production. Therefore, Pacific Northwest region may provide a unique model system to study impact of climate variability on agroecosystem particularly in fungal population in the soil and quality of grains by assessing potential for mycotoxin production in wheat and other agricultural commodities."

Capturing and measuring these emissions is of interest, because CH4 is a greenhouse gas and represents a loss of the potential energy in the feed the animal consumes. In this pilot study, we will use head boxes made of clear polycarbonate plastic, which the animal places its head in, to measure CH4 emissions from Holstein dairy heifers. An animal training and sampling protocol will be developed from this study for using the head box system in any future studies. Furthermore, there is little to no data on enteric CH4 emissions from grazing stocker cattle on native grass or wheat pastures in US production systems. A study will be conducted to quantify enteric CH4 emissions from cattle grazing dormant winter and early summer native range or winter wheat pasture and their subsequent individual finishing performance, feed efficiency, water intake, and enteric CH4 emissions. Heat stress in cattle is both an economic and animal well-being issue for the US beef industry. Annual US beef industry losses from heat stress are estimated to be $369 million and a large proportion of those losses occur in states such as Oklahoma that have large cattle populations and high summer temperatures (St-Pierre et al., 2003). Using shade structures in feedlot housing systems has been shown to improve animal performance (e.g. gain-to-feed ratio) and well-being (Mitloehner et al., 2001, Mitlohner et al., 2002, Gaughan et al., 2010), and has the potential to improve profitability, especially in areas that experience hot summers (e.g. the Southern Great Plains).The impacts of heat stress abatement strategies, such as shade, on feedlot economics and feed nitrogen use efficiency of the feedlot is an unexplored research topic. A study will be conducted to determine if shade use can simultaneously impact animal well-being, N use efficiency, and the economics of finishing beef cattle. The research will provide valuable insights to the cattle feeding industry on how a practical heat stress mitigation technique (i.e. shade) may simultaneously affect the well-being of cattle, the environmental impact of beef per unit of production, and feedlot economics. The proposed work will address the National Institute of Food and Agriculture&#39;s priority science area of Climate Change, and specifically address the challenges of mitigating and adapting to climate change and keeping American agriculture competitive while ending world hunger"

While vitamins are commended for providing immediate human health benefits, numerous long term health-promoting roles have been ascribed for phytonutrients. In plants, phytochemicals provide necessary defenses against abiotic and biotic stresses to ensure healthy growth and development. Therefore, it is perceivable that manipulation of phytochemical profile can potentially improve crop yield and nutritional quality by protecting crops from diseases and by enhancing the nutritional value of foods, which are two key aspects of obtaining food security. Yet our knowledge of phytochemical biosynthetic pathways in crop plants is still very limited, presenting a major hurdle for crop improvement. The overarching theme of my research program is to elucidate the key genes/enzymes and regulatory mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis and accumulation of phytochemicals in plants. Phenolics, terpenoids and alkaloids are three major classes of phytochemicals based on structural classifications. This Hatch project entails understanding and manipulating phenolic and carotenoid (tetraterpenoid) biosynthetic pathways in several economically important crops, including pomegranate (phenolic), wheat (carotenoid) and potato (phenolic). The molecular and biochemical tools derived from our work can be directly applied to development of designer crops using traditional breeding and biotechnology approaches. This work will also have broad implications in enhancing the disease resistance properties and nutritional qualities of other crop plants that possess similar biochemical pathways."

At one extreme are tropical-climate cereals such as maize and rice that suffer chilling injury when exposed to 10oC. At the other extreme are the temperate-climate cereals including barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum spp.), and rye (Secale cereal) capable of surviving the temperate-climate winter. This ability to survive the temperate-climate winter is known as winter hardiness. Wheat, barley, and rye are generally classified as being of either a winter or a spring growth habit. Spring growth habit types are inherently reproductively competent and are typically sown in the spring. In comparison, winter growth habit types are sown in the autumn. They grow vegetatively for a short period before overwintering and then develop reproductively the following spring. If spring-sown they fail to properly develop reproductively. Spring and winter growth habit types also differ from one another in their ability to survive the temperate-climate winter. Typically winter growth habit types are able to survive colder temperatures than spring types and have greater winter hardiness. Winter genotypes are often preferred because they are capable of returning yields 40% greater than that of their spring counterparts. Winter genotypes are also much more efficient at making use of available water due to an extended vegetative growth phase and a much more extensive root system over spring genotypes. In Ohio and other states of the East North Central Midwest, winter barley and winter wheats are essential components in the crop rotation cycle with maize and soybean. Spring types have not been recommended for Ohio as conditions early in the spring are erratic leading to unpredictable and generally poor yields. Recent studies in wheat and barley have led to the identification of several key factors underlying the molecular basis of winter hardiness. These studies also reveal that expression of the genes underlying these factors are themselves affected by developmental programming inherent to the genetic makeup of the plant, and by environmental factors. Moreover, current data strongly supports the premise that the key factors act antagonistic to one another. It is these phenomena and the genetic basis underlying them that I am working to better understand. A goal of the work proposed here is to gain greater insight into their regulation, to better understand the nature of this interaction between the factors, and how their regulation is affected by the environment. These studies will contribute fundamental knowledge that can be used to enhance the productivity and freezing tolerance of cereal plants."

The U.S. supplies 33% of the world&#39;s soybean production. In Louisiana, soybean accounted for 23% of the total agricultural production, with soybean production valued at $408 million.A recent survey conducted inLouisiana has shown that the number of acres scouted and the number of insecticide applications has doubled over the last four years. Losses due to insecticide applications and insect damage averaged $41.22 per acre. Thus, soybean producers will likely be more risk-averse, unwilling to suffer grain quality and yield losses due to insect pests. An effective and sustainable soybean IPM will be necessary to reduce pest impacts while increasing productivity.To implement this plan, knowledge on pest biology, host range, and population dynamics is necessary. Louisiana soybean is attacked by a diverse insect pest complex, but the primary problems in recent years have been associated with stink bugs, threecornered alfalfa hoppers, bean leaf beetle, and several Lepidopteran defoliators (velvetbean caterpillar, soybean looper, corn earworm, and green cloverworm). In addition, kudzu bug reached Louisiana in 2013. One or more of these pests are significant annual problems and are responsible for limiting soybean yields in Louisiana. This is an evolving system and new management tactics are needed to combat a changing pest assemblage. This project utilizes short and long term objectives to generate the necessary data on pest density, impact, biology, and control tactics that are critical to improve the overall soybean IPM program."

Therefore, continual adaptation and innovation are needed to maintain and improve grain and co-product quality. During the 2012 Annual Technical Meeting, a roundtable consisting of industry representatives discussed trends currently influencing the U.S. and global grain industries, and outlined research needs of the industry. These were combined with the knowledge of NC 213 researchers to give the following listing of challenges that are on the horizon. First, it is likely that the yearly volume of grain produced will continue to increase, requiring an increase in storage, handling, and drying capacity. During recent years the rise in importance of local markets (e.g. ethanol processors) and the desire on the part of producers for more marketing options have led to an increase in the volume of grain stored on farms. At the same time, public concern for food safety has increased and the Food Safety Modernization Act (FMSA) of 2012 includes requirements for supplier verification, record keeping, hazard analysis, inspection, and product tracing that will require compliance from sectors of the grain industry. Finally, additional demands are being exerted on grain supplies by new uses for grain (biofuels, bio-products). Together these challenges mean that there will be additional pressures on the industry and its management infrastructure. The opportunities and challenges presented by the above are explained in more detail in the Multistate Research Project Summary.The needs of the industry will be addressed using a collaborative approach to accomplish the following project objectives: 1) development of methods to measure grain quality and methods that preserve and improve quality; 2) development of grain storage, handling and processing systems and strategies that maintain quality, capture value and preserve food safety; and 3) effectively disseminate to the industry, research results and knowledge that can help the industry preserve and improve grain value and quality. We anticipate that the end result will be an increase in overall grain and co-product quality and purity, improvements in efficiency and effectiveness of grain handling, storage and processing facilities and systems, and increased public confidence in the quality and value of their grain based food sources."

In California, about 30% of the 4.2 million irrigated ha are affected by salinity. Globally, salinity afflicts 69.5 million ha of land in Africa, 53.1 million ha in the Near and Middle East, 19.5 million ha in Central and East Asia, 59.4 million ha in Latin America, 84.7 million ha in Australia, and 16.0 and 20.7 million ha in North America and Europe, respectively. If salt-tolerant crops could be grown on only a fraction of the salt-affected land, global food production would be significantly increased.The development of technology for coping with soil salinity is important for agricultural economy in this country and globally for feeding the growing human population. The development of crops that are productive on salinized soils and tolerate irrigation with low-quality water containing high concentrations of dissolved salts is an important component of this technology. Plant tolerance of salinity is genetically complex and very little progress has been made to improve salinity tolerance of crops using traditional breeding. Yet, many wild plants evolved genetic mechanisms that enable them to grow in highly saline environments. Wheatgrasses of genera Lophopyrum and Thinopyrum naturally grow in salt marshes and on sand dunes around the Mediterranean basin and are very salt tolerant. Their unique asset is their close relationship to wheat with which they can be hybridized. Previous studies with genetic stocks developed from wheat x wheatgrass hybridization (called here tritipyrums) demonstrated that tritipyrums express wheatgrass salt tolerance.We will develop here technology for genetic improvement of tritipyrums using wheat germplasm in order to increase tritipyrum grain yield. We will also develop tritipyrums with high biomass production on saline soils and evaluate its quality and digestibility by livestock.Achieving these research objectives will make tritipyrums a new crop for salinized soils and improve the economy of irrigated agriculture in the western states. The development of tritipyrums as grain and forage crops and demonstration of their utility in this country will promote their deployment in other areas of the world with salinized lands."

Farms are family owned and fields are small. Alfalfa hay is the primary crop but pecan acreage is rapidly expanding. Cotton is used as a rotation crop. In Lea County, in the High Plains of New Mexico, crops include wheat, corn, sorghum, peanuts and a number of vegetables. Agronomic conditions are quite different from the southern New Mexico desert valleys which only average 10-12 inches of rain per year. Counties on the NM eastern High Plains average 13- 17  of rain per year. Fields are larger, and farms are larger with most fields in sprinkler irrigated circles. (USDA-NMAS 2012).Insect pressure and insecticide use is higher in the High Plains. The Pecos Valley currently has lower pressure from insect pests, but changes in management practices will likely increase insect pest pressure. In particular, a reduction in alfalfa acreage, a concomitant increase in pecan acreage and larger fields coupled with the increasing use of center pivot irrigation will likely increase insect pest pressure in all crops (Corbett and Plant 1993, Flint and Roberts 1988). Historically, insect pest pressure in the Pecos Valley has not only been lower than in Lea County but also lower than in a very similar valley 160 miles west, the Mesilla Valley. This is likely due to higher acreage of alfalfa in the Pecos Valley and the high production of beneficial arthropods in hay that provide significant control of arthropod pests in nearby crops. Replacement of alfalfa acreage with pecans will likely increase insect pest pressure in all crops but alfalfa. Although it is important to respond to issues as they arise, we will likely continue to emphasize three of the major crops in southeastern New Mexico: pecan, cotton and hay.Currently the primary pest in pecan is pecan nut casebearer. Aphids, leaf miners, stinkbugs, hickory shuckworm and leaf footed bugs are occasional pests that also may cause economic losses. The primary need in pecan in SE New Mexico is to evaluate biological control to determine techniques to conserve and enhance populations of predators and parasitoids (LaRock and Ellington. 1996). Our initial work has indicated that predation levels are typically high, but periodic disruptions in populations of beneficials have been associated with dramatically higher populations of insect pests, particularly aphids. In 2011, for example, when populations of beneficials were unusually low, some growers made up to 4 applications for aphids, when typically growers average less than one application.The near eradication of cotton boll weevil and pink bollworm has opened up more opportunities to use pest management tactics in cotton that were less tenable before eradication due to routine insecticide applications. In addition, the widespread use of Bt cotton varieties have further reduced problems with lepidopterous insect pests. Now, the primary insect pest of cotton in SE New Mexico is thrips. Conchuela stink bug, Chlorochroa ligata, lygus, and leaf footed bug are occasional pests that can cause economic damage. In non Bt cotton varieties we also need to consider a complex of lepidopterous pests. The key lepidopterous pest is cotton bollworm with beet armyworm a secondary pest. Cotton square borer, Strymon melinus Hubner, and cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni Hubner, are present but not at economic levels.The market for cotton has been difficult. Growers compete on a world market and do not receive significantly higher returns for a higher quality crop. The low price of cotton has resulted in a reduction of acreage in recent years. An effort is underway to increase crop value by growing a value added variety that is glandless, producing seed that can be consumed by humans or used for high value feed such as farm-raised shrimp. The primary obstacle to the production of glandless cotton has been insect pressure, since gossypol provides some baseline resistance to insect pests (Benedict et al. 1977, Jenkins et al. 1966). It is hoped that relatively low insect pressure and research into other management tools to suppress pest populations will allow New Mexico growers to produce glandless cotton without resorting to excessive insecticide applications. We have been evaluating the potential for insect damage in SE New Mexico and potential management techniques including the impact of biological control and modifying nitrogen rates.Although beneficial arthropods often control insect pests in alfalfa hay, alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal), is still a key pest in New Mexico. Secondary pests can also cause economic damage. These include numerous species of cutworms, beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), cowpea aphid, Aphis cracciuara Koch, and alfalfa caterpillar, Colias eurytheme Biosduval. Damage from secondary pests can produce extremely high economic impacts by causing the loss of stands particularly, but not exclusively, in young stands of hay.Emerging pests are expected to cause issues over the next five years. Brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomopha halys(Stal), for example, has been detected in New Mexico. It is already established in parts of Texas and much of the continental U.S. Bagrada bug, Bagrada hilaris (Burmeister), has been detected in New Mexico and has become an issue feeding on cotton in Arizona. These are examples of just some emerging issues that are likely to become the subject of research in the next five years in New Mexico."

In North Dakota, three foliar diseases have significant impact on both common and durum wheat production in recent years, including, tan spot caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB) caused by Stagonospora nodorum, and bacterial leaf streak (BLS) caused by Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa (XTU). Using resistant cultivars is a preferred choice for disease management because it is economic and environmental safe. However, breeding for resistant cultivars for these three diseases is challenging, largely due to the lack of resistant sources and our understanding of host resistance, pathogen virulence as well as the host-pathogen interactions. In this project, we will screen a large amount and diverse wheat germplasm to identify resistant sources for the wheat breeding programs. To aid in the transfer of quantitative resistance to elite cultivars, the genomic locations and DNA markers linked to host resistance will be identified through association mapping in nature populations and QTL mapping in bi-parental populations. S. nodorum and P. tritici-repentis are referred to as necrotrophic fungal pathogens and known to produce necrotrophic effectors (NEs) as an important virulence factor. We will further dissect the genetic and molecular basis of the wheat-P. tritici-repentis interaction with the goal of identifying new effectors and their corresponding sensitivity genes and characterizing their involvement in disease development using various wheat populations. In addition, the mode of action of SnTox1 and SnTox3, two new NEs identified from S. nodorum will be investigated with an emphasis on the site-directed mutagenesis of SnTox3, and identification and characterization of plant molecules that directly interact with SnTox1. In BLS, we will examine the role of transcription-activator like effector genes in the virulence of XTU through molecular genetics and genomic tool. Investigating the genetic and molecular basis of these pathosystems regarding host resistance and pathogen virulence will not only help us understand how necrotrophic fungal pathogens and bacteria pathogen cause diseases, but also may directly provide knowledge and tools that would be useful for developing novel and effective management strategies."

These changes have been followed by the wide spread use of new technologies such as Global Positing Systems (GPS), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Variable Rate Technology applications (VRT), Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). The average size of farming operations has increased. This was accompanied by the introduction of larger planting, spraying, and harvesting equipment in an attempt to complete farming operations as soon as possible. Cotton acreage has declined because of low prices and many cotton gins and oil mills have closed. Soybean, corn, and wheat acreage has increased dramatically because of favorable prices. Entries in the Mississippi State University Soybean varietal trials have increased. The resistance of these varieties to the major diseases will be determined. Also, fungi have developed resistance to some currently used fungicides. Alternative fungicides will be determined. Input costs have also risen in part because of increased crop yields which led to increased nutrient removal and the greater need for fertilizer applications. Seed applied pesticides have improved and the use of in-furrow and hopper box fungicides, insecticides and nematicides has all but disappeared. Higher commodity prices and higher yielding varieties along with new more effective fungicides and nematicides have allowed the producer to consider the use of seed and foliar applied fungicides as a means of increasing and insuring the highest possible yields. The importance of certain diseases and nematodes has changed because of the acreage shifts and farming practices. An example is black root rot (6) which has become a problem on soybeans grown on land previously cropped to cotton. Another example is the increase in the importance of the root knot nematode. Corn is not a host of the reniform nematode. Corn, soybeans and cotton are all hosts of the root knot nematode. Research will be conducted on control methods for these diseases and nematodes. There has been a large increase in acres cropped to soybeans and corn. In many cases the soils on which these crops are grown are deficient in Potassium or other nutrients. Potassium deficiencies predispose soybeans to foliar diseases. In some fields, the addition of potassium will result in foliar disease control. Research is needed to determine the interaction between low potassium levels and foliar diseases. The method of acid delinting cotton has changed. Bacterial blight of cotton incidence has increased. In summary, research will be conducted on seedling and late season foliar diseases of cotton, corn, soybeans, and wheat. Resistance of the entries in the Mississippi State soybean varietal trials to stem canker, frogeye leaf spot, purple seed stain, black root rot and other diseases will be determined. Efficacy and optimum rates and timings of seed and foliar applied fungicides and nematicides will be determined. The interaction of Potassium deficiency and increase susceptibility to foliar diseases in soybeans will be researched. Cooperative research will be conducted to identify resistance and tolerance to the reniform nematode in cotton. Cotton varieties will be screened for resistance to bacterial blight."

Zebra chip disease, which is caused by the vector-borne pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso), was first reported in 2011 in potato production areas in Idaho, and is now of a major concern. This proposal is set to address four specific objectives: The first objective quantifies the level of susceptibility in four of the most commonly used wheat cultivars in Idaho, to BYDV infection, at different stages of plant growth. Variables used to measure the degree of susceptibility include visual assessment, titer quantification, and biochemical evaluation of the plant tissue.The next two objectives address the wireworm issue in small grains. A survey of wireworm species will be conducted to determine most damaging wireworm species in central and eastern Idaho. For the most damaging species, insect movement and the inflicted damage will be correlated with environmental variables to determine suitability and timing of different management approaches in order to achieve reduction in insect pressure.The last objective addresses Lso-plant (potato tuber) interactions post-harvest and during storage, in relation to the time of infection and vector density. Practices which would trigger pathogen development post-harvest will be identified.Findings will be communicated to the producers and scientific community through extension publications, presentations, and refereed research papers."

There are numerous well-documented occurrences known in plants and polyploidy appears to have been frequent throughout the evolutionary history of flowering plants. Polyploidy is known to generate morphological diversity, genetic diversity, diversity in reproductive biology, ecological diversity, and even functional diversity. The relationship between polyploidy and diversity is important in evolution and ecology of natural systems, but polyploidy also plays a very important role in the origin of many crops and is critical in some breeding programs of crop and ornamental plants. Many crop plants, including major crops in Michigan, are of polyploidy origin, or have resulted from breeding programs that involve polyploidy. Corn, many varieties of wheat, potatoes, many cultivars of apples, strawberries, blueberries and blackberries are well-documented examples. However, research on polyploidy has focused on just a few traits, and most studies focus on a single origin of polyploidy in a single taxon. Research is needed, then, to determine the breadth of changes resulting from polyploidy across the morphological landscape of the polyploid plants and whether polyploid events generate the same changes in plants--either within a species or in closely related species. This project will address these questions by studying morphological variation in a series of polyploid populations of three closely related species of Phlox. Each of the three species has diploid (two sets of chromosomes), tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes), and hexaploid (six sets of chromosomes)populations. We will measure numerous morphological characters in multiple populations of each ploidy of each species, generating the largest data set documenting morphological change in polyploid systems known. We will also study differences in reproduction and ecology (physiology) at one site where diploids and tetraploids are known to occur. These studies will help us gain a broader understanding of how polyploidy works in natural systems, which will inform applied researchers using polyploidy in plant breeding programs."

Addressing each of these areas is vital to improve soil health, reduce the fertilizer inputs required to produce high yielding crops, and promote the sustainability and profitability of cropping systems in northern Idaho. Research into the area of soil acidity and liming could result in improved yields, improved nutrient availability, and increased nitrogen fixation in legume crops grown in rotation with wheat. Likewise, new information concerning variety response to nitrogen inputs and evaluating the feasibility of using biostimulants in north Idaho cropping systems will lead to improved soil health and reduced fertilizer inputs, resulting in lower quantities of nitrogen and other nutrients leaching into waterways.The research planned to address each of these problems will be a combination of greenhouse trials and field research plots that will be conducted on University of Idaho research farms as well as grower fields in collaboration with grower cooperators. In the case of the acid soils research, several commercial sources of lime are being tested at varying rates of application at three locations in northern Idaho and eastern Washington in collaboration with growers. Additional field trials will examine nitrogen use efficiency in combination with liming treatments and explore the ability of commercial lime sources to reduce the impact of Cephalosporium stripe on winter wheat. A regional soil survey will also be conducted to determine the scope of the acid soil problem and identify those areas where lime application is likely to have the greatest impact in reducing soil acidity and/or aluminum toxicity. A second component of research will examine impact of varying seeding rate and nitrogen rate on winter wheat varieties that are commonly grown or are being tested for possible variety release. Agronomic measurements, including yield components, will be collected to identify optimal seeding rate/nitrogen rates for each variety. The ultimate goal is to design nitrogen and/or seeding rates that can be custom tailored to each variety being produced. Likewise, variable rate seeding experiments will be established in cooperation with growers interested in this technology, with variable rates applied in strips on a field scale. In addition to yield information obtained by the grower at harvest, additional agronomic measurements will be collected during the growing season to identify optimal seeding rates for different portions of the field. The third project will examine the use of biostimulants through a combination of field tests to examine the feasibility of using biostimulants in crop production as well as via greenhouse testing to determine whether biostimulants can improve microbial activity and potentially increase the general suppression of soilborne plant pathogens.There are several goals for these projects. In the case of the acid soils research, the goals are to better understand the distribution of soil acidity and aluminum toxicity in northern Idaho in order to identify those areas that will benefit the most from liming; to provide additional information on liming sources, rates, and the economics of lime application; and to identify secondary benefits to liming in northern Idaho, namely improved nutrient use efficiency and reduced plant disease incidence. The goals for the seeding density and nitrogen rate studies with respect to new wheat varieties is to provide updated and variety specific information to allow growers to produce optimal yields with lower inputs. In addition, the variable rate seeding may allow growers to add additional precision to how they grow their crops through more accurate seeding rates, making more efficient use of available water and reducing nutrient inputs. Finally, there is a movement to examine ways to improve soil health through the use of cover crops, novel crop rotation, etc. As part of this effort, the research on biostimulants may identify an additional tool that can be used to promote more sustainable crop production and help to introduces alternative management strategies into mainstream crop production. Overall, this research should help to improve soil health and promote more sustainable production through more efficient use of resources for production in northern Idaho."

It is important to continue the development of resistant varieties that utilize different genes for resistance, so as to provide more options for growers. Furthermore, it is important to regularly monitor the effectiveness of the presently deployed resistant varieties of spring wheat to determine if Hessian fly biotypes capable of attacking the resistant varieties are increasing in proportion in the fly population. The availability of adapted, Hessian fly-resistant varieties will provide Pacific Northwest wheat producers with an option to minimize the potentially increasing economic losses associated with this pest."

Currently poultry meat consumption is the primary animal protein consumed in the United States. The majority of US broiler and turkey feed is pelleted. The pelleting process involves the application of heat, moisture, and pressure to induce conformational changes in feed nutrients in order to bind ingredients and create pellets of high structural integrity. Thermal processes of feed manufacture may also effect nutrient availability. Pelleting of wheat and Barley based diets typically increases nutrient availability; however, corn and soybean based diets (most common in US poultry feed formulation) have been consistently demonstrated to be reduced in nutrient availability due to pelleting. In addition, feed additives such as enzymes are common in today&#39;s feed formulation and susceptible to denaturation during feed processing. Enzymes and other micronutrients can also be difficult to assess in terms of activity level and batch uniformity.Feed manufacture equipment and technique are highly variable among commercial feed mills in the US. Changes in ambient temperature, ingredient nutrient level, and feed manufacture technique adjustments contribute to the complexity of the feed manufacture process. Due to the small number of US Universities with feed manufacture research programs and the inability of commercial mills to perform in-house research, the relationship between feed manufacture variables, pellet quality, nutrient availability, poultry performance, and overall production economics is poorly understood.Our long term goal would be to develop a protocol to properly sample feed during manufacture for nutrient, feed additive, and mycotoxin content. These specific inclusion types vary from kg/tonne inclusion to parts per billion inclusion and will likely impact protocol. Next variations in feed processing that decrease nutrient availability as determined by poultry performance and in vivo digestibility assays would be correlated with numerous in vitro assays post proper sampling technique. The best in vitro assay could then be used as an indicator of nutritional quality of pelleted poultry feed."

It impacts the lives of millions of people in many different ways, however. The turfgrass industry has grown into a multibillion dollar business worldwide, that includes $57.9 billion in business in the U.S alone in 2000. According to the last North Carolina Turfgrass survey (1999), the total acreage of tufgrass in the state neared 2.14 million acres. Over $1.22 billion was spent to maintain these areas. Single family dwellings were by far the largest single sector of the industry, with 69% of the turf area and 60% of expenditures. Regarding the types of grasses used, tall fescue accounted for over 40% of the total area of maintained turf. Centipede and Bermuda were the next two most common types with 16% and 11%, respectively. North Carolina is located in the transition zone for cool- and warm-season grasses. While this means that we can grow both types of grasses, no one type of grass does well in all weather conditions. Cool season grasses go dormant during hot, dry months and can turn brown and even die during extremely hot and dry conditions. Warm-season grasses are very drought tolerant because of their low water requirement, which makes them ideal during the summer months. However, they go dormant and turn brown during the cool days of fall and winter, and winter kill can often be a problem in the NC region.Applied plant breeding can be used to develop turfgrass cultivars that are better adapted to environmental conditions present in North Carolina. Development of cool-season grasses with increased heat and drought tolerance, and warm-season grasses with improved cold tolerance would contribute significantly to different sectors of the turfgrass industry. Genetics and applied plant breeding can also be used to improve aesthetics, performance, and disease resistance of turfgrass cultivars which, in turn, affect the efficiency of maintenance and production. The long-term goal of the program is to improve the sustainability and economic gain of the overall turfgrass industry in the state through the development of cultivars that require reduced inputs and that are capable of tolerating biotic and environmental stresses while still maintaining good quality and overall performance.Despite the fact that large amounts of genomic information have been generated for other grasses such as rice, maize, and wheat, turfgrass species have lagged far behind. Work is needed to generate such information and utilize it to relate phenotypic traits to DNA nucleotide polymorphism."

Grain yield of wheat in Texas has increased from an average of 20 bushels per acre during the 1960&#39;s to 30 bushels per acre since 2000 (Texas Agricultural Statistics Service). As a result, less land, money, and natural resources are needed to produce a bushel of wheat. Modern cultivars generally have a higher yield potential, are more efficient at utilizing available natural resources, and respond better to inputs. They generally have greater resistance to pathogens and insects, thus reducing the need for chemical applications. Investments in plant breeding have consistently produced a high rate of return. Most estimates range between 30% and 60% annual return on plant breeding investments. Plant breeding is a continuous process and a sustained investment is necessary to maintain genetic gain and to realize a return on previous investments.There is still a large gap between yield potential and realized yield. In addition to incessant stresses such as drought and high temperatures, new pest problems continually emerge to restrict yield. New cultivars must be designed to increase profitability. Continued improvement in forage yields and quality will benefit both stocker cattle operators and wheat producers. Wheat cultivars should have specific end-use functionality properties for specific products. For example, the dough properties needed for tortilla manufacturing are different from those needed for bread-making.The goal of the TAM (Texas A&amp;M) wheat breeding program is to design small grain cultivars for specific adaptation areas and management programs in Texas. Hard winter wheat will be the primary commodity, but some work will be done with triticale."

For example, injury due to use of non-selective herbicides and stripe rust in wheat, drought in rice, and aflatoxin contamination in cotton are problems of global conerns. Development of stress-resilient varieties is the most cost-effective and environment friendly approach to managing these stresses. Conventional breeding has been successful in many crops in development of varieties that are tolerant/resistant to different stresses. Howver, conventional breeding takes time and the progress has been slow because of the quantitative inhertance of stress tolerance traits. Moreover, the unavailability of resistant donor (e.g., cotton against Aspergillus flavus) in the available germplasm is limitation to plant breeding where transgenic approach is the only alternative. By using latest tools of gene expression and genome mapping, the present proposal is evisioned to accomplish a common goal of identifying genes and subsequent development of gene-based functional markers that will facilitate marker-assisted breeding for metribuzin and stripe rust resistance in wheat, drought tolerance in rice, and genetic engineering for A. flvus resistance in cotton."

This project will alleviate deficiencies in the current hard white wheat gene pool by developing wheats with low levels of grain polyphenol oxidase, tolerance to pre-harvest sprouting, and resistance to wheat stem rust and Wheat streak mosaic (WSMV) and Triticum mosaic (TriMV) viruses.   Genes for these traits will be pyramided using traditional mating approaches, and fixed in resultant germplasm via direct phenotypic selection, and DNA marker evaluations.  Virtually nothing is known about the molecular biology of TriMV and the roles of viral proteins in replication, vector transmission, and virus-plant host interactions. Improved understanding of the genetic basis of these basic viral functions will be gained by characterization of induced mutants in viral genes.  Antibody and nucleic acid based approaches will be used to develop novel procedures to study viral replication and transmission.  The mechanism of resistance present in wheat lines carrying known resistance genes Wsm-1 (effective against both WSMV and TriMV) and Wsm-2 will be investigated via characterization of small interfering (si)RNAs produced by resistant plants.  Knowledge gained from these experiments will be used to develop transgenic wheat with resistance likely to be effective against a broad spectrum of WSMV and TriMV strains."

A field experiment consisting of 9 crop rotations will be undertaken to determine if increased oilseed production is met by cropping intensification, which replaces summer fallow. Annual crops include winter wheat, winter triticale, winter oilseed, spring wheat, spring triticale and spring oilseed. Using winter wheat-summer fallow as a control, various crop sequences, comprised of spring and winter-types of cereals and oilseeds, will be assessed for agro-economic performance. Crop systems will vary in intensity from 2 to 3 phases thus providing flexibility for accommodating year-to-year differences in weather. Specific experimental data will include crop quality and yield; biomass; crop yield loss due to weeds; dates of emergence, anthesis, and maturity; and water and N balance measurements. Process-oriented modeling will be used to simulate each crop system and provide insights into biophysical factors that drive crop performance.  2B. Field measurements will be obtained to ascertain if oilseeds will increase N use efficiency by reducing the microbial soil nitrification and nitrifying populations. To test this hypothesis, microbial community diversity of rhizosphere and bulk soil, plant nutrient availability, and soil physical properties will be examined to identify the etiology of observed benefits. A variety of microbial activity assays will be conducted for organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling.  2C. The research will also test whether diverse crop systems create soil surface conditions that emit less dust than conventional systems. A portable wind tunnel will be used to measure dust emissions in all crop sequences after tillage and planting when soil is susceptible to wind erosion.  2D. A second field study will examine if rain capture, infiltration, and soil water storage will be improved by the root systems remaining from harvested oilseeds. Volumetric soil water will be calculated from gravimetric soil water and bulk density measured to a 1.2 m depth. Water balance will be calculated as pre-tillage soil water + rainfall - post-harvest soil water. Soil aggregation, a possible indicator of infiltration, will be characterized using wet sieving of whole soil collected before spring tillage. 2E. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool will be calibrated and applied using hydrologic, sediment, terrain, soil, and weather data collected on Wildhorse Creek in NE Oregon. Sensitivity of the calibrated model will be evaluated using various statistical metrics.   3. Data from 2A will be used to determine if diversified crop systems are more profitable and less risky than conventional crop systems. Production costs, net returns, and income variability of winter wheat-summer fallow vs. mixed crop systems of cereals and oilseeds will be compared using partial budget analysis.  4. Life cycle assessment will be used to test the hypothesis that mixed cereal-oilseed systems under reduced tillage will conserve more nonrenewable energy and reduce gaseous emissions than conventional wheat-based systems under intensive tillage."

The purpose of this project is to advance oilseed production reliably into drier areas in the Columbia Plateau of the interior Pacific Northwest (PNW). Specific objectives are listed below.   Objective 1: Identify cultural practices for expanding oilseed production in the drier acreage portions of Columbia Plateau (Pullman, all of Obj 1).  Sub-objective 1A: Assess the effectiveness of crop residues and the stripper header for maintaining soil moisture for tillage-based and chemical fallow systems.  Sub-objective 1B: Identify best varieties and crop management practices for optimizing seed yield and quality attributes, and managing weeds in spring oilseeds.  Objective 2: Identify and evaluate dryland cropping systems comprised of cereals and oilseeds that can be used to produce biofuels and derive environmental benefits (Pendleton all of Obj 2). Sub-objective 2A: Evaluate the yield performance of cereal-based rotations that include oilseeds. Sub-objective 2B: Determine whether diversified wheat-oilseed rotations compared to WW-SF provide belowground benefits derived from changes in microbial communities. Sub-objective 2C: Measure dust and PM10 emissions from diversified crop rotations. Sub-objective 2D: Determine the effect of crop sequences on overwinter infiltration, rain capture, and soil water storage for spring crops. Sub-objective 2E: Calibrate and use SWAT to determine potential changes in crop productivity, hydrology, and sediment loads resulting from a shift from conventional to diverse cropping systems.  Objective 3: Compare farm income from conventional winter wheat-summer fallow with diversified cropping systems (Pendleton and Pullman).  Objective 4: Conduct life cycle assessments of different cultural practices and drylan  Approach: (Pullman only) 1A: Hypothesis-Soil moisture will be increased in chemical fallow by planting winter triticale and harvesting with a stripper header compared to a winter wheat-tillage fallow system. The study consists of four cropping/harvesting systems in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The systems include; the traditional fallow-winter wheat with wheat harvested using a conventional header, chemical fallow-winter wheat with wheat harvested with a stripper header, chemical fallow-winter triticale harvested with a conventional header, and a stripper header.  The long-term goal of this study is to plant winter canola into chemical fallow when soil moisture is 4 to 6 cm from the surface compared to summer fallow where soil moisture is >13 cm deep. Data collected includes crop yield and biomass, gravimetric soil water content (spring and post-harvest) to 1.8 m, organic matter and, soil profile NO3-N and NH4-N to 1.2 m. Water use efficiency will be determined by the ratio of crop yield to spring soil water content minus post-harvest soil water content. Soil water content will be corrected for precipitation. Three 1.8 m soil cores per plot will be composited by 0.3-m increments at each sample date. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) of crop yield, biomass, organic matter, and soil N will be performed using a generalized linear mixed model in PC-SAS with crop rotation as the fixed effect, and replication and crop rotation x replication as random effects. How soon winter canola can be planted will depend on how much residue is produced and how much moisture is received. 1B: Hypothesis—Herbicide-resistant spring canola planted in narrow rows will improve crop yield and oil quality compared to either the same varieties planted in wide rows or spring carinata planted in both row spacings. This study will compare the grain yield and oil quantity of two spring oil seed crops, B. napus canola and B. carinata, planted in two row spacings. Oilseed crops include; “Genuity” early and late maturing spring canola B. napus; “InVigor” spring canola B. napus; and, “Resonance A100” spring B. carinata. “Genuity” spring canola is resistant to Roundup and “InVigor” spring canola is resistant to Liberty herbicides. “Resonance A100” is not an herbicide resistant variety of spring carinata. Crops will be planted mid-April with a JD9400 no-till drill at 5.5 kg/ha in row spacings of 17 and 34 cm. Treatments will be replicated 4 times and arranged in a RCB design. Varieties are main plots and row spacings are split-plots. Crop populations will be determined by counting plants in 2 rows in five 1 m lengths in each plot. Crop yield will be determined by machine harvest. Oil quality and quantity will be determined using a scaled oil extractor to simulate industrial scale processing. ANOVA of crop yield and seed oil content will be performed using a generalized linear mixed model in PC-SAS. Fixed effects will be crop, row spacing, and their interaction. Field experiments are subject to weather variances and the studies may have to be extended in duration. Random effects will be replication and crop x replication. Objectives 3 and 4 will be joint efforts."

Aquaculture is the fastest growing agroindustry while the world fisheries catch has leveled out. Consequently, half of all seafood consumed today is farmed. Unfortunately, at least 30% of fish feed is derived from forage fish, the anchovy and sardine-types at the base of the food chain. With demand for forage fish growing while wild populations remain level at best, the price of fish meal and oil (FM&0) climbs by 15% yearly. Clearly, dependence on FM&O is unsustainable. For fish farmers to thrive without abusing the oceanic ecosystem, substitutes are essential. One solution is to use vegetable-based ingredients such as wheat and soy, but these lack vital omega-3 fatty acids. Another is to turn to the insect world, especially by culturing ecofriendly black soldier fly larvae (BSFL). The larvae are fed seafood residuals mixed with marine kelp and/or microalgae so that the natural omega-3 passes through. The larvae are dried and separated into FM&O-like meal and oil. The overarching question is: can this be accomplished competitively? Apparently it is possible, but a 2-year pilot plant is required to prove the practicality.    The proposed project will not only demonstrate that very large volumes of BSFL can be cultured using omega-3 loaded wastes and algae, but that substitute fish feeds that are palatable, stimulate growth and confer health are feasible. This is best achieved by simultaneously conducting feeding trials with a variety of species, including isolated bottom dwellers such as black sea bass and, alternatively, schooling pelagic creatures such as California yellowtail. Observing degrees of palatability is straight forward. But as with any cuisine there are numerous ways to enhance the offering: live, dried or pelletized and, if the latter, unit size, moisture content and even some surface additive that confers a natural taste ? perhaps crab-like for black sea bass and squid-like for California yellowtail. Such refinements grant significant economic margins by virtue of better survival rates, shorter time in the tanks and less costly ingredients. At this local level, both the farmer and the consumer benefit while globally these gains can favorably impact food security, especially with marine species that only require saltwater, with recirculating system that discharge little or no waste and, of course, with substitute foodstuff derived from waste bio-remediated by flies."

One (called the dicot strategy) is for the growing tip of the plant to climb upward by producing an elongating stem below it. The alternative strategy (termed the monocot strategy) is for the growing tip to stay protected at the base of the plant and produce a series of leaves that rise above the plant and then grow around it. This latter monocot strategy has the advantage of protecting the growing tip at the base of the plant for much of its life. It enables grasses to survive extensive grazing, and it is the growth strategy that is used by plants like wheat, maize and rice. Despite its use by plants of ecological and agricultural importance, this monocot strategy is not well understood. In this project, a collaborative team of US (University of California, Berkeley) and UK (John Innes Centre) investigators  will use a combination of tools including high resolution imaging and computational methods to test mechanisms that will develop predictive and testable models. These models will describe the processes of growth and shape changes in the monocot leaf. Because the position of the leaf blade has an effect on the amount of light a plant can harvest for photosynthesis, this work could significantly impact crop yield. Biotech industries will benefit from the work, through greater fundamental understanding of processes involved in tissue development. The investigators will be actively engaged in education at all levels, including K-12 and public education, through the development of hands on training activities, YouTube videos, and more traditional methods of diffusion of research findings.   Computational modeling has led to preliminary hypotheses of monocot leaf development. A key idea is that growth is oriented by a polarity field, which is analogous to the way a magnetic field can be used to orient directions of navigation. The observed growth and shape changes of the monocot leaf can then be explained by simple changes in the polarity field and the pattern of growth rates it orients. The aim of this project is to test and further build upon this model and determine whether the polarity fields and the growth rates the model predicts are correct using the maize monocot system (which has the advantage of well-developed genetics and associated technologies.) By looking at markers that highlight the presumed polarity fields and by determining the growth rates in different regions of the leaf, predictions of the model can be tested. Models will also be tested by analyzing mutants in which key transitions of development are disrupted. These studies will be made quantitative by writing computer programs that automatically extract the relevant measures. New computational methods will also be developed and applied to this system so that the processes can be understood at different levels, i.e. from cellular to tissue scale.  This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council."

Information about growth and development is encoded in a plant's DNA, which has four fundamental chemical components, often referred to as A, C, G and T. However, the C can also be modified by a process called methylation, which allows it to function as a 5th information component in DNA. While it is apparent that methylated Cs play an important role in plant growth and development, their role has yet to be fully understood. In this proposal, the number and pattern of methylated Cs among different crop plants will be compared, including barley, einkorn wheat and sorghum. These comparisons will be used to investigate the influence of methylated Cs on the function of genes. The overall goal is to better understand the contribution of methylated Cs to plant growth and development, so that eventually this information can be used for crop improvement.  DNA methylation is one of several epigenetic modifications that are crucial to plant genome function. Recent work has also shown that methylation has broad consequences for genome evolution, including the composition of intergenic DNA, as a fundamental evolutionary property of specific genes, and as a driver of compositional biases among genomic regions. Given the importance of epigenetic mechanisms, a thorough understanding of the evolution and function of plant genomes requires characterization of epigenetic variation among plant species. Yet, such a characterization is presently lacking. This project will generate and analyze whole genome bisulfite sequencing (BSseq) and transcript (RNAseq) data for an array of grass species. The data will be released to the Short Read Archive and Gene Expression Omnibus databases prior to publication. The goal is to use the data to better understand the relationship among DNA methylation, gene evolution and gene function, as measured by gene expression. To achieve this end, a series of unique evolutionary analyses will be developed that will address three specific hypotheses: 1) that gene-body methylation is a conserved feature of functionally important genes and maintained over evolutionary time by natural selection; 2) that evolutionary shifts in gene body methylation (and/or the methylation of flanking regions) drive shifts in gene expression between species; and 3) that DNA methylation variation among tissues - specifically in genes and flanking regions - contributes to tissue-specific gene expression."

Kelly Dawe (University of Georgia-Athens)   Co-PIs: James A. Birchler (University of Missouri-Columbia) and Jiming Jiang (University of Wisconsin-Madison)   All plant genomes contain centromeres, structural regions that ensure chromosomes segregate properly during cell division. Centromeres are a challenge to study because they contain repetitive DNA sequences and few genes. The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of how the sequences in centromeres relate to their function, and how changes in centromere size or changes in a key centromere binding protein (CENH3) can alter the behavior of centromeres.  In particular the project will study genetic crosses and mutants that can induce centromere failure and chromosome loss in hybrids. Chromosome loss induced by centromere modification can result in haploid plants, which are of great value to corn breeders, as they can rapidly accelerate the production of new inbred lines. It is anticipated that the information and technology generated will have direct applications to agriculture - not only in maize but all other crops that utilize haploids as a breeding tool. With regards to training and outreach, the project will provide research training for undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows in plant genomics and biotechnology.  In addition, a series of training workshops will be held to disseminate techniques and materials generated in this project. All project outcomes will be made available to the research community through a dedicated project web site and through dissemination by long-term repositories that include NCBI, MaizeGDB and Gramene.   The overall goals of the project are to understand the genetic and epigenetic components of maize centromeres and to reveal the role of centromere size in uniparental chromosome elimination which leads to haploid formation. The specific objectives are to: 1) determine whether common centromere repeat sequences are sufficient to induce centromere function using novel chromosome painting probes, chromosome visualization tools that dramatically improve the ability to detect changes in chromosome structure; 2) determine how a suite of chromatin markers are affected by changes in centromere size and location using maize chromosomes transferred into oat as well as B chromosomes that have undergone a cycle of inactivation and reactivation; 3) test whether centromere size disparity can cause uniparental genome elimination by screening lines with centromeres whose size have been modified by manipulating genome size, and by using cenh3 mutants with specialized transgenes; and 4) determine how maize centromeres behave in situations of uniparental genome elimination, particularly in wheat X maize and oat X maize crosses that are regularly used in haploid breeding schemes."

Among herbivores that feed on plant tissues, insects are by far the best characterized. However, plant-feeding mites, which are distant relatives of insects, can also be major pests in agriculture. In particular, many mite species thrive on and damage drought-stressed plants, including major cereal crops like maize and wheat. Under these situations, mites pose a significant challenge for control as they are often resistant to commonly used pesticides. Plants can defend themselves against attack and damage by herbivores.  For example, for a number of plant species, certain varieties are known to be more resistant to mites than others because of their ability to produce compounds toxic to herbivores. The objective of this research is to understand the genetic and genomic nature of plant defense pathways that function to deter agriculturally important mites. The mite species to be examined are the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and the Banks grass mite (Oligonychus pratensis) that are associated with significant outbreaks on drought-stressed maize or other cereal species. The research will use genomic and genetic methods to elucidate which plant defense pathways in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) respond to mite herbivory, and how variation in these pathways impacts plant resistance. Moreover, the effect of drought (water stress) on these defense pathways will be assessed, an objective motivated by the observation that each of these pests can be economically damaging during droughts. This project has relevance, therefore, to efforts to develop more mite resistant crop plants. All data will be accessible to the public through long-term public repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and MaizeGDB. Biological resources generated during the project will be available upon request. As part of the project, the work will train undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate scholars.  In addition, educational material will be developed on plant-mite interactions for distribution to the public on the Learn.Genetics website (http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/).  To identify genetic pathways in plants that respond to spider mite pests, gene expression profiling using the RNA-seq method (high throughput sequencing of cDNA) will be performed on maize and barley leaves infested with both two-spotted spider mites (a generalist pest on both dicot and monocot plants) and Banks grass mites (a specialist pest on grasses). Further, to understand the effect of an agriculturally important abiotic stress on plant defense pathways, expression profiling for mite responses will be performed on both well watered and water stressed plants. Comparisons of plant transcriptional response to the two herbivores, and as a function of an abiotic stress relevant to mite outbreaks, will shed light on the specificity of plant responses to generalist and specialist herbivores, and how the environment affects the interaction in plants. A specific outcome will be the identification of gene regulatory networks underlying mite resistance. Further, susceptibility to mite damage is known to vary among individuals within plant species, including maize. To investigate this, a collection of inbred maize lines used to create the Nested Association Mapping (NAM) community genetic mapping resource will be screened for susceptibility or resistance to each mite herbivore. Gene expression studies with sensitive and resistant maize lines will then be used to assess the genomic basis of variation in plant mite resistance. In parallel, and to relate plant molecular phenotypes of mite response to plant performance upon mite infestation in an agricultural setting, field trials for resistance will be performed on plants under high water and drought stress conditions for a subset of maize inbred lines."

Duplication occurs when an offspring ends up with two copies of all of the chromosomes of its parents. Genome duplications have occurred frequently within the flowering plants (300,000+ species), and likely contributed to their success. Most agricultural crops are the result of one or more recent duplication events, including wheat, cotton, corn, potato, and sugarcane. Thus, the research will be of broad importance in agriculture as well as the study of biodiversity.Tolmiea (Saxifragaceae) contains one polyploid, T. menziesii that arose directly from the single diploid in the genus, T. diplomenziesii. Ongoing work found divergence both in abiotic niche preference and physiological water stress responses between diploid and autotetraploid Tolmiea. In concert with other ecophysiological investigations, this research will characterize the role autopolyploidy has played in the divergence of gene expression patterns using a common garden experiment consisting of multiple populations and multiple water-stress treatments. This study will: 1) provide insights into genome-wide patterns of gene expression in a natural autopolyploid compared to its diploid parent, 2) evaluate the variation and responsiveness of gene expression levels to the presence and absence of water-stress, and 3) use synthetic polyploid lines to determine whether these changes are the immediate effect of polyploidy or the result of subsequent evolution. This study will increase our understanding of gene expression changes resulting from autopolyploidy, and will provide valuable information for future breeding management and improvement of autopolyploid crops."

Endosperm is the product of a second fertilization event, but rather than developing into a second embryo, it becomes a tissue that mediates the relationship between the maternal plant and its compatriot embryo. Endosperm is also an essential part of the human diet: the seeds that provide most of the calories people consume (rice, wheat, corn) consist primarily of endosperm. Studies in model plant species have begun to piece together the mechanisms that control endosperm development, and have revealed that gene imprinting plays an important role. Imprinting occurs when an allele inherited from one parent is silenced. Little scientific attention has been given to how imprinting has evolved in flowering plants. This project will address this discrepancy by analyzing the expression of genes during development of endosperm in the water lily, which is a member of one of the most ancient lineages of flowering plants. While the water lily is uniquely suited to become a model system for the early diverging lineages, it is also on the brink of extinction - making it a compelling case for why exploring and preserving biodiversity is essential for furthering basic scientific research.   Analysis of gene expression will be accomplished by creating RNA-seq transcriptomes of key stages during ovule and seed development. From this dataset, two main categories of genes will be targeted for homolog identification: genes that are involved in imprinting-regulation mechanisms and genes that are themselves imprinted. Simple presence/absence of homologs of these genes during seed development in N. thermarum will help to resolve the question of when during angiosperm evolution did these mechanisms became important regulators of endosperm development. In addition, the sampling scheme will make it possible to distinguish suites of gene activity that correlate to specific sets of developmental processes. Finally, the accompanying sequence and expression data will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of relevant gene families. This database will represent an important resource for understanding the evolution of angiosperm seeds, and will be made publically available."

The revenue resulting from annual cotton production is estimated to be $100 billion in the USA alone. Cotton is an excellent model system for studying fiber cell differentiation, cell expansion, and cellulose biosynthesis, as well as polyploid genome evolution and crop domestication. Upland or American cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and Pima or Egyptian cotton (Gossypium barbadense L.) have been independently domesticated from allotetraploid species. Improving cotton fiber yield and quality will provide a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based synthetic fibers. Generating a reference-grade genome sequence for domesticated allotetraploid cotton will enable both basic and applied research that will provide new insights into fiber development and cellulose and wall biosynthesis with broad impact for biomass crops and biofuel production. Since most crops are of polyploid origin, methods and principles being developed from this project will also advance research in other crops with complex and polyploid genomes. Genomic sequence and gene expression data will be made available through public data depositories, including GenBank, GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), miRBase (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/), and the NCBI's SRA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/seq.html).  Plant materials and the final version of annotated sequence will be distributed through CottonGen (http://www.cottongen.org/icgi/home), the cotton research community website. Innovative and scalable education and training modules in plant genomics and bioinformatics will be developed for middle and high schools and undergraduate institutions in the Mississippi Delta. The effectiveness of education and outreach will be enhanced through close collaborations with Alcorn State University and Mississippi Valley State University, two Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  The overall goal of this project is to develop high-quality sequence resources to address fundamental questions in crop plants that are of economic importance.  The physical map-guided hybrid approach in combination with whole-genome shotgun (WGS) and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is among the best strategies to sequence and assemble  gold-standard  reference-grade genomes of complex polyploid species including cotton and other important crops such as wheat.  The research team has developed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) resources including a physical map and BAC-end sequences (BES), WGS, PacBio long reads, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of Upland cotton (TM-1).  Moreover, the critical pilot data have been generated, which are necessary in preparing a successful strategy for sequencing the allotetraploid cotton.  Specifically, the project will sequence and assemble individual BAC inserts from the minimum tiling path that covers ~85% of the genome.  The gaps will be filled and/or reduced by the second iteration of additional 3,000 or more BACs with integration of WGS contigs, mate-pair and PacBio long reads.  The sequence contigs and scaffolds will be ordered by high-density linkage maps and BES-targeted GBS.  The final sequence will consist of thirteen pairs of homoeologous pseudo-molecules, including validation by targeted GBS and BAC-fluorescence in situ hybridization.  The reference-grade sequence will be annotated by Phytozome with the RNA-seq data collected from ~20 cotton tissues.  This reference-grade sequence will be immediately released to the research and breeding communities to improve Upland cotton that accounts for >95% of the world cotton production.  The sequence will be utilized for analyzing epigenomes and their roles in fiber development of allotetraploid cotton."

Hidden within loaves of bread is one of largest and most complex genomes of important plant species.  The size and complexity of the bread wheat genome, which is more than five times larger than the human genome, have hindered development of a reference framework that can serve as a resource for genetic studies and breeding applications.  A better understanding of the wheat genome will also give insight into the structure, function and evolution of complex, polyploid plant genomes.  Advancement of population-based sequencing methods for assembling plant genomes will have broad implications throughout the plant genomics community, particularly for species with limited genomic resources and large, intractable genomes.  User-friendly tools for population sequencing developed through this project will enable applications of this approach in the broader plant genome community.  Through integrated education and outreach activities, this project will recruit and train new generations of computational biologists to address complex and challenging genomics questions.  In partnership with the Kansas Foundation for Ag in the Classroom (KFAC), multi-tiered educational materials on plant genomes and domestication will be developed and implemented in middle and high school classrooms across the state.  Through KFAC, students will be given access to advanced material targeting Next Generation Science Standards, including resource materials on careers in plant science.  At the undergraduate level, internships will be developed to attract non-biology students from computationally-intensive fields.  Interns with diverse social and academic backgrounds will be challenged with cutting-edge bioinformatics through coursework and research in U.S. labs followed by summer internships working with European project collaborators.  At the postdoctoral level, scholars working on this project will gain skills in cutting-edge genomics along with mentoring and international research experience.  To disseminate bioinformatics approaches developed through this project, annual workshops for bioinformatics training in population sequencing and genotyping-by-sequencing will be held for graduate and postdoctoral training.As an approach for developing sequence resources for crop plants with large genomes, next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be applied to rapidly generate a whole genome sequence that is readily assembled into short contigs.  These contigs primarily contain the gene-rich, non-repetitive portions of complex genomes.  However, WGS assemblies have limited utility because these gene-rich contigs remain unanchored and unordered on the chromosomes.  Novel, cost-effective approaches are needed for anchoring and ordering large, complex genomes.  Through this project, new methods for assembling and ordering complex plant genomes will be developed and applied to understanding the genomes of wheat and its wild relatives.  NGS will be applied to segregating populations of diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat species, leveraging linkage information to develop an ordered whole-genome assembly for each species.  This approach (POPSEQ) uses millions of genetic markers to order the assembled gene space onto a physical framework.  The project will target 1x whole-genome sequence coverage across multiple diploid (AA and DD genomes), tetraploid (AABB) and hexaploid (AABBDD) populations to develop high-density genetic maps.  These high-density genetic maps can then be used to anchor sequence contigs and scaffolds, giving physical context to genome assemblies.  Ordered assemblies will be iteratively improved and made available to the wheat community through MIPS (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/genomes.jsp), T3 (http://triticeaetoolbox.org/) and GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/) databases.  Genetic stocks will be made available through the KSU Wheat Genetics Resource Center and the USDA-ARS National Small Grains Collection."

More than 80% of crop and turf diseases are due to fungal infections. Direct application of chemical fungicides continues to be the most effective and widely used strategy to control these diseases. A large fraction of the crop fungicide market includes two fungicide classes: The triazoles and strobulins. Both classes are used in increasingly larger amounts to overcome developing resistance, and both have known human and animal toxicities when used at high levels. Emerging resistance to therapeutic antifungals for treatment of acute human and animal fungal diseases (e.g. aspergillosis) has been directly linked to the overuse of the most widely used triazole crop fungicides. Therefore, declining effectiveness due to resistance, environmental impacts, animal/human toxicity, and costs challenge the use of these and other chemical fungicides. The research and use of the novel antifungal aminoglycoside K20 that acts synergistically with triazoles and strobulins as described in this proposal address these challenges, and the need for such transformative strategies.  This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop the synthetic protocol for production of aminoglycoside fungicide K20 in high yield and purity, and determine the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) for each batch of K20 in combination with metconazole or pyrachlostrobin using standard checkerboard analyses.  In addition, the plan is to conduct greenhouse and field tests of K20-fungicide combinations against Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease of wheat. Among the combinations showing synergy are K20 mixed with metconazole and pyrachlostrobin. The widespread and heavy use of these fungicides has been linked to a number of environmental and human/animal health issues. Striking and consistent synergistic inhibitory activities are observed with the crop pathogen Fusarium graminearum - the causative agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat, barley and corn. The synergism between K20 and these widely used fungicides has broad and important implications. It offers the possibility of using dramatically smaller amounts of fungicides for crop protection, which will counter the increases in global fungal resistance, and reverse the rise in human and animal health problems."

The ability to increase crop production in the coming years will depend on developing a better understanding of reproductive mechanisms. The goal of this project is to take what has been learned about the molecules that mediate fertilization in a model plant species (Arabidopsis) and extend this knowledge using a comparative genomic approach in seven plant species including corn, rice, and tomato. The expected findings will allow for the identification of specific mechanisms that are targeted by environmental stresses during sexual reproduction in crops and will assist in the selection of stress-resistant cultivars. The outputs of this project will provide a deeper understanding of the evolution of sexual reproduction of economically important plant species. In addition this project will provide cutting edge training in biological imaging, genetics and genomics in the context of a critical crop plant (tomato) for a diverse team of researchers that will include a post-doctoral fellow and an undergraduate researcher. Importantly, this research team will be benefit from participation in this large, multidisciplinary and international effort comprising eight laboratories from five nations.Research during the past five years has delivered tremendous new insights into gamete physiology and the mechanisms involved in fertilization in Arabidopsis. This progress has established the view that gametes are hyper-differentiated cell types with highly specific transcriptional profiles. Advances in microscopy based on fluorescent reporters and live cell imaging have also transformed research capability and provided insights into the mechanisms involved in gamete delivery, interaction and activation of seed development. Yet, the understanding of the complexity of double fertilization that characterizes flowering plants is far from complete and lacks any knowledge about the origin of mechanisms that predate double fertilization. In this project, emerging models representing key stages in plant evolution will be used to provide insight into the ancestral mechanisms of gamete differentiation and fertilization. Gene co-function networks will be identified from expression atlases for several plant species that include the liverwort Marchantia, the moss Physcomitrella and the extant basal flowering plant Amborella. These will be complemented with co-function networks from Arabidopsis and the economically important crops maize, tomato and rice and used to study the conservation of gene co-function networks governing male and female gametogenesis, pollen tube growth and fertilization mechanisms in flowering plants. Moreover, these investigations will provide novel molecular markers of fertility in crops. It is expected that this project will result in identification of fertilization factors that were lost from ancient angiosperms during the evolution of monocots (grasses) and eudicots and those which have evolved de novo in the angiosperm lineage.  All data produced will be freely and continuously shared within the consortium. Specifically, RNAseq datasets will be accessible through a consortium database as well as through publicly available data repositories."

This project will take a comprehensive approach to define the epigenome of bread wheat, the functional consequences of epigenetic modifications, how the genome is re-shaped, stabilized and inherited in newly formed hybrids, and how the environment may influence patterns of epigenetic modification. These are fundamentally important questions in biology and are necessary for understanding trait variation in wheat hybrids.  It is anticipated that this project will have broad impacts across three specific themes. The first of these relates to food security. Food security is an ever-increasing challenge in the face of factors such as urbanization and world population growth. One factor that significantly affects agricultural yields of bread wheat is the epigenetic regulation of high-yielding hybrid lines. A better understanding of this process will help others understand the basic processes involved in the creation and stabilization of hybrid lines and thus improve the efficiency at which they can be derived and contribute to food security. The second broad area where the work will have significant impacts is in the area of climate change. Understanding how changing climate affects epigenetic regulation of an important crop genome will likely have broad implications for the understanding of how agricultural yields will be challenged and can be modified to respond to changing climate. Lastly the project will have broad impact in the area of enhancing scientific education and understanding. Rapidly advancing science and technology presents a challenge in conveying a general understanding of that technology and the science behind it to the general public. This project will be used as a platform to better explain science to the general public using different and new educational tools. In addition to the training of students, the project will provide summer international exchange research training for graduate students associated with the US-EU consortium.Wheat is a polyploid arising from recent hybridization of goat grass (Aegilops tauschii, DD) with wild tetraploid emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides, AABB) to form hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum AABBDD). This process of hybridization is critical to achieving the high yields produced by modern wheat varieties. However, much is not understood about this process particularly in terms of how epigenetics regulates which parental line is expressed within the agriculturally significant hybrids. This project will generate information about the epigenetic regulation of the bread wheat genome and its role in the stabilization of the component genomes within the hybrids. One aim is to understand how epigenetic variation alters gene expression in hybrid wheat by identifying how epigenetic traits or epigenetic marks are set during hybridization in the formation of new wheat strains and how these are maintained in stable wheat hybrids to allow for high agricultural yields. It is the expectation that this project will provide a much better understanding of the molecular mechanisms related to epigenetics that are involved in the creation and stabilization of high-yielding hybrid wheat strains. All data produced will be freely and continuously shared within the consortium. Specifically, all datasets will be accessible through the iPlant Collaborative and European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) as well as through publicly available data repositories including GenBank."

Phosphate esters, compounds that contain a C-O-P bond, make up the backbones of DNA and RNA and are also a component of the molecular energy molecule ATP. Thus, phosphate esters have been well studied for many decades. Less thoroughly examined are organophosphanates, compounds which contain a C-P bond. Organophosphonates are thought to have predominated on primitive Earth, when oxygen concentration was likely lower than today. More recently, organophosphonates have been noted for their importance as commercial products, from antibiotics to fungicides, and in providing nutrients for organisms living in extreme environments. Additionally, organophosphonates have recently been recognized as an important component of the marine phosphorus cycle, accounting for up to 25% of oceanic dissolved organic phosphate. Understanding organophosphonate breakdown and utilization is thus important for understanding environmental phosphorus cycling. Work will be conducted with Professor Taichi Takasuka, at Hokkaido University, to make and test the function of enzymes proposed to be able to break down these compounds. It is possible that they have the ability to break down organophosphonates in a way that has never been reported before.   The most well known microbial pathway for organophosphonate catabolism is that of C-P lyase, a multi-subunit enzyme complex that, in all bacteria studied, is under control of a single, phosphate-activated promoter. C-P lyase?s mechanism has recently been proposed, along with mechanisms for alternative organophosphonate catabolism. Of these alternative pathways, most have been at least partially characterized. However, three recent publications present evidence for as-yet-uncharacterized catabolic pathways of phosphonate degradation in Campylobacter spp., Heliobacter spp., and Synechococcus spp. Specifically, in Synechoccus spp. isolated from Yellowstone National Park, gene products have been implicated in organophosphonate catabolism, but neither verified nor characterized. These putative phosphonatases will be expressed using a wheat germ embryo-based cell-free protein production system, and biochemically characterized, using quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). The putative phosphonatases (phnases) implicated in phosphonate catabolism by this study and their metabolic products may reveal novel mechanisms of breakdown of this important subset of phosphate containing compounds. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Many pathogenic fungi and oomycetes develop a feeding organ named the haustorium to extract nutrients from host plants. Such pathogens cause widespread and/or devastating crop diseases such as wheat powdery mildew and rust, potato late blight and sudden oak death, resulting in huge crop losses and tree damages worldwide.  In recent years, much has been learnt about the molecular mechanisms concerning plant immunity. However, how defense responses are executed at host-pathogen interfaces is poorly understood. Interactions between the model plant Arabidopsis (epidermal cell)and Powdery mildew (haustorium) provides a convenient single-cell system for addressing this challenging question. The project utilizes an Arabidopsis resistance protein that is specifically targeted to the plant-fungal interface as a unique tool to investigate the formation of the interfacial membrane, how that formation is coupled to immune signaling and protein trafficking to enable defense execution at specific subcellular sites. New information from this project should help elucidate the fundamental cell biology principles governing formation of and activities at host-microbe interfacial membranes, and yield new insight into novel intervention strategies to control plant diseases caused by haustorium-forming pathogens. The outcome of the host-pathogen interaction is determined at the extra-haustorial membrane (EHM), the host-pathogen interface. However, both the origin and biogenesis of the EHM and the molecular host-pathogen interactions at this interface are largely unknown.  The long-term goal of this project is to understand the biogenesis of the EHM and its role in host defense and fungal development. These investigators have shown that (i) a host resistance (R) protein named RPW8 from Arabidopsis is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted defenses via an unknown mechanism; and that (ii) RPW8 contains two putative basic residue-enriched motifs essential for EHM-targeting.  Therefore, RPW8 can be used as a unique tool to understand the host defense at the EHM, the origin and biogenesis of the EHM, and the EHM-oriented protein trafficking in the invaded host cell during haustorial development. Specifically, there are three major aims for this project. Aim 1 addresses how hydrogen peroxide is produced and accumulated in the host-pathogen interface during RPW8-mediated and basal resistance against haustorium-forming pathogens. Aim 2 is focused on characterization of a special protein (SNARE) complex that is engaged in the EHM-oriented vesicle trafficking. Aim 3 investigates EHM biogenesis and its role in host defense and fungal pathogenesis. A combinatory forward and reverse genetics approach, aided by chemical genetic assays and state-of-the-art confocal imaging will be employed to achieve the above three specific objectives. Novel and important knowledge from this project will significantly advance our current understanding of the cell biology and molecular interaction between plants and haustorium-forming pathogens, which should help design new strategies to control plant diseases caused by such pathogens in the future. The investigators will also continue to produce short videos of their work that can be disseminated and used for teaching."

The currently used dwarfing genes, which were instrumental in bringing about the  green revolution , are at least partly responsible for this bottleneck. These dwarfing genes, present in more than 90% of the wheat varieties grown worldwide, render most of the wheat crop prone to losses due to abiotic (non-living) stresses. This research project will use the products from an NSF-funded academic research to characterize new types of dwarfing genes for wheat, and commercialize selected dwarfing genes around the globe. Outcomes and products from the proposed research project are poised to alleviate the bottleneck created by the currently used dwarfing genes, and have the potential to significantly increase wheat yields, especially under abiotic stress conditions. The research project, while creating a viable commercial product with global appeal, also will contribute positively towards food security in this changing climate.  This STTR Phase I project proposes to further develop and test alternative dwarfing genes to improve wheat yield and abiotic stress tolerance around the globe. Semi-dwarf mutants rht1 and rht2 in wheat are credited for the gene revolution, and are present in more than 90% of the wheat varieties grown worldwide. Their height reduction is due to a reduced production or perception of a plant hormone, gibberellins (GA), which plays a critical role in abiotic stress tolerance. Under abiotic stresses that affect more than 85% of the US and 50% of the world's wheat growing areas, these GA-dwarfs exhibit adverse effects on various agronomic traits including abiotic stress tolerance. The project will characterize newly identified 22  GA-normal  dwarfing genes for their agronomic advantage over the currently used genes, especially under heat, drought, and salinity stresses with the objective to identify ideal dwarfing gene systems for various wheat growing conditions. The selected dwarfing genes also will be mapped relative to DNA markers for intellectual property protection, and for their transfer to wheat cultivars via marker assisted selection."

Canola is an oilseed thatproduces healthy cooking oil, which bears a qualified health claim stating consumption can reduce the risks of coronary heartdisease. The USA imports approximately 80% of the canola oil it consumes, thus a significant need exists for more acres and increased production to meet this large consumer demand. In regions where spring canola production is common, land area available for expansion is limited by the introduction of corn and soybeans. Today, the southern Great Plains shows the greatest potential for expanded canola acreage and production.With more than 20 million acres of wheat planted in the southern Great Plains annually, the potential for expanded canola production is substantial. In addition, growing winter canola in rotation with winter wheat will improve the sustainability of wheat-based cropping systems through increased yields and reduction of troublesome weed, disease, and insect pressures that often plague wheat production. Through this project, new winter canola varieties are being developed that are adapted to the climate of the southern Great Plains. Production systems are being created and modified to effectively and profitably plant and harvest the crop.

Grapes are one of the largest specialty crops in the U.S. with a farm gate value of over $6 billion and an annual production of over 7 million tons on one million acres. The majority of grape production is centered on regions with specialized climates suitable for temperate fruit production with increasing pressure to become more environmentally sustainable. With increasing pressure on resources, including human capital, it is imperative that the U.S. viticulture industry improves its resource use efficiency to remain sustainable and competitive. Commercial vineyard management practices are currently inefficient because soil, vine, and crop management decisions are applied uniformly across entire production blocks without measurement or response to spatial variation in soil or vine characteristics. Uniform vineyard management on a non-uniform system is done because there is currently no user-friendly or cost-effective way to collect, interpret, or use spatial vineyard information for efficient variable rate management. We propose to use GPS technology, off-the-shelf soil and canopy sensors, and new project-developed sensors to collect, validate, and map spatial data within commercial vineyards. In annual horticulture systems, like corn or wheat where new seed is planted each year, individual vineyard maps, such as soil maps, give farmers a useful picture for future management. In perennial systems, like grapes and apples where soil as well as plant production in one year will influence plant growth in the second year, layering and integrating multiple maps is necessary to make appropriate management decisions, but dealing with multiple large spatial data sets can be complex and challenging for the end-user. To overcome this technological limitation, this project proposes to develop a mechanism for the validation, processing, and mapping of spatial vineyard data so that raw data files can be turned into useful information. Our vision is for a vineyard manager to upload raw data files to a web based portal where the spatial data is processed, mapped, and emailed back to the vineyard manager for viewing in Google Earth. The integrated vineyard maps will then be used to create different management zones across vineyard blocks indicating where different and more efficient management operations can be performed. To show the potential horticultural, environmental, and economic impacts of this technology, the project team proposes to test and evaluate the effect of data-driven variable rate management against traditional uniform applications in commercial vineyards. The research and development results, the introduction to a web-based spatial data processing application, and the positive impacts of variable rate management will be delivered to grape producers across the U. S. though a defined outreach plan. The goal of this project is to improve vineyard productivity, fruit quality, profitability and sustainability through an innovative, science-driven, and approachable precision viticulture platform for all sectors of the U.S. grape industry. The trans-disciplinary project team includes engineers, viticulturists, economists, extension educators, and commercial partners working closely with stakeholders to ensure the long-term goal of a production to consumer system that is environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable. This project is a high priority for the National Grape and Wine Initiative, a national grower-led entity whose membership includes all grape crops (wine, juice, table, and raisins), spanning farms of all sizes in all grape producing states. The research and extension activities in this project aim to deliver the research, technology, and education for spatial vineyard measurement and management for all grape producers in the U.S. regardless of operation size, vineyard location, management style, or market."

Moreover, the establishment of a differential host series to distinguish pathogen races, and the collection/testing of pathogen isolates to allow the discovery and isolation of a spectrum of races, has traditionally been a multi-year undertaking.

The work is potentially transformative as it will provide a rare opportunity to test such hypotheses in natural and controlled field experiments, and because the applicability of a broad diversity of plant, animal, and human pathogens with fat-tailed dispersal kernels will be rigorously evaluated via the interdisciplinary modeling efforts. Conclusions should apply over a very wide range of spatial scale due to the nature of dispersal kernels of pathogens that have the potential for long-distance dispersal. The proposed work has significant potential to increase our knowledge of the spread of pathogens of taxonomically divergent hosts and pathogens and may lead to improved control of major diseases and to mitigation of invasive epidemics. Pathogens with long distance dispersal capability are responsible for some of the most potentially damaging and fastest spreading diseases of humans, livestock, and plants. The work also will make a significant contribution towards integrating work on disease spread in plant and animal systems."

Rice and beans merit biomarkers for nutritional assessment without reliance on self-reported intakes for whole grains and legumes during nutrition assessments as wheat, barley, rye and soybeans have been studied in dietary patterns and for relationships with disease risk. A major challenge with validating dietary biomarkers is that an elevated level of consumption is often required for reliable quantification, and emerging evidence supports that the overall dietary pattern (e.g. vegetarian, omnivore) can influence the profile of metabolites detected. The identification and validation of dietary biomarkers using metabolomics is an emerging field of investigation with broad-spectrum applications of health importance, and is the major focus of the research strategy for developing rice bran and navy bean biomarkers in children and adults herein.

Due to their natural occurrence in food and high toxicity, trichothecene contamination of food and livestock feed (&gt;78% toxin present) poses a great threat to food safety and human, animal, and planthealth.However, there is a critical gap in our knowledge about the way the toxin works in living cells leading to toxicity that endangersanimals and humans. Previous studies identified novel mechanisms for trichothecene-induced cell death involving themitochondria, an important component of thecell that functions to help produce energy. These studies have shown that the toxin-induced cell death involved mitochondria and genes involved in lipid metabolisms which mediated sensitivity to these toxins. Therefore, the proposed project will study the role oflipid signaling as a mitochondrial &#39;surveillance&#39; mechanism induced in response to trichothecene-mediated stress.Applying high-throughput methods in molecular biology and biochemistry, this research will identify lipids altered in response to toxin treatment and determine if lipid signaling is important for trichothecene-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation. It will also measure therecognition and degradation of trichothecene-damaged mitochondria by mitophagy, a selective degradation of damaged mitochondria. The research will identify critical components of the mitochondrial-nuclear signaling pathways using yeast (highly conserved between yeasts and animal cells) and then investigate them in more detail in animal cells. This research will leadto new insights into how these toxins modulate themitochondria and mitochondrial signaling and advance our understanding of mechanisms whereby environmental toxins derail the fate of mitochondria in the affected animals. The knowledge gained here will aid efforts to mitigate the impacts of trichothecene contamination in food and food safety; facilitating the development of safer practice and standards in human and animal consumption of contaminated products.Ultimately, the project will aid in promoting safer food, developing potential applications for animal health improvement, and reducing economic losses due to trichothecene contamination."

PHS results in reduced yield and degrades the end-use quality of cereal grains. Dormant grain cannot germinate at maturity until it is exposed to a dormancy breaking condition such as after-ripening during a period of dry storage or soaking in water in the cold. PHS susceptibility results from insufficient grain dormancy at maturity to prevent germination. Wheat grain dormancy is associated with red kernel coat color and with higher sensitivity to the dormancy-promoting hormone abscisic acid (ABA). In addition to causing economic losses, persistent PHS problems have limited the geographic area farming white wheat. Hard (for bread) and soft (for cakes and cookies) white wheat are desirable because whole white flour has longer shelf life, is easier to mill, and has a less bitter taste in high fiber whole grain products. A two-pronged approach will be used to improve white wheat PHS tolerance: 1) PHS tolerance from white ABA hypersensitive wheat will be mapped and deployed into soft and hard white wheat winter wheat, and 2) genome-wide association mapping and a genomic selection model will be used to identify and more effectively breed for PHS tolerance in existing northwest white wheat breeding programs. The genomic selection model will seek to balance the needs for preharvest sprouting tolerance with the need for good seedling emergence within the breeding programs."

A crop&#39;s ability to adapt to changing environments depends on the availability of variants of genes increasing plant&#39;s resilience to climatic extremes. Owing to their broad geographic distribution, crops and their wild relatives are a rich model system for investigating the genetic mechanisms of local adaptation, providing a valuable source of new diversity, of which only a small fraction so far has been used for improving crops&#39; adaptive potential.An effective strategy for developing climate resilient varieties is to use variants of genes from the wild relatives of wheat. Previous studies showed wild relatives from stressed environments are a valuable source of new diversity for improving the drought and heat adaptive potential of wheat.With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies it has become possible to generate whole genome variation data for large geographically diverse populations of plants. These data combined with climatic data collected from the sites of sample collection were successfully used to identify variation in DNA sequence that helps plants to adapt to local environments. The main rationale behind these approaches referred to as genome-wide environmental scans (GWES), is that variation contributing to local adaptation can be identified based on an unusually high correlation between their frequencies in local populations and local climatic variables. Importantly, studies on a model plant species demonstrated that the presence of genetic variation correlating with climate in a specific plant line could serve as a good predictor of its performance in a specific environment. The proposed project will develop a strategy based on the NGS of wild goatgrass, one of the wild relatives of wheat, collected from regions along the environmental gradients to identify DNA sequence variation contributing to climatic adaptation. A genome-wide variation dataset will be tested for correlation with seasonal variation in temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, season lengths, and aridity.We will perform genetic crosses of wheat lines adapted to Kansas environment with multiple goatgrass accessions to develop populations that will carry the segments of wild chromosomes. These populations will be tested for the presence of genetic variation strongly associated with climatic variables, and will be planted at several locations across the state of Kansas showing significant seasonal differences in the amount of precipitation and temperature. Performance of wheat lines will be assessed by collecting phenotyping data reflecting their ability to cope with variation in temperature and water availability. These data will be used to test the utility of climate-associated variation to predict performance of wheat lines in Kansas environments. The information collected will be valuable for developing a new generation of genomic prediction models that will more effectively handle the uncertainty of phenotype predictions in diverse environments, and increase the overall effectiveness of crop breeding for targeted climatic conditions. The project efforts will also lead to the development of novel germplasm that will be used to support variety development and will be shared with the wheat breeding community. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to empower the US and international wheat breeding programs by establishing genomic and statistical tools that will leverage information about the genomic signals of eco-geographic adaptation to prioritize global genetic diversity in germplasm repositories for deployment in breeding programs."

With a population that is expected to approach 10 billion in the next 35 years, the necessity to develop high-yielding crops is paramount. Additionally, with the stresses being placed on the environment by global climate change, over-cropping, and stripping of nutrients from the soil, it is going to become increasingly important to understand how plants obtain and use nutrients, so that we can develop plants better equipped to grow on less-than desirable lands. We need to understand these aspects of plant nutrition, before we can begin to develop strategies to overcome nutrient deficiencies and optimize plant growth and yield.Some nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are required in large amounts, while others are only needed in very small doses, but if that requirement is not met, the result is disastrous for the plant. One of these nutrients required in very small doses is the element boron (B). Without any B at all, plants cannot live, but small amounts of B are sufficient for proper function. B deficiency limits yields, particularly in cereal crops, and B deficient soils are widespread in the US, and worldwide. Despite B being a nutrient essential for plant health, it is one of most poorly understood plant nutrients. It is known that B is important for plant cell stability and rigidity, but how this affects basic processes in the plant is unknown. For instance, it has been shown that spraying certain crops like wheat with B can increase yields, but the reasons why remain a mystery. These experiments highlight the potential for developing simple but effective methods to improve crop yield, especially since B is cheap and relatively abundant compared to other nutrients. However, excess B is toxic to plants so understanding when and how B is needed and how it functions in the plant is essential. Thus, further research on elucidating the basic roles of B in plant growth and development particularly in important crop species such as maize is key to implementing strategies to overcome nutrient deficiency.One of the best ways to figure out how a nutrient functions in a plant is to take away the nutrient and look at the effect on growth and development. In our previous work, we identified maize plants that were altered in their ability to take up B from the soil, distribute B throughout the plant, and had problems with growth and ear development. These plants essentially mimic the effect of growing normal maize plants in B deficient soils, which provides us with a useful tool we can use to study the effect of B deficiency. Using these inherently B-deficient plants, we can apply a variety of different methods, including genetics, molecular biology, microscopy, physiology and biochemistry to 1) determine the basic cellular processes that require B and 2) identify genes that are important in taking up, distributing, or utilizing B in plants. We have designed our experiments such that we are using complementary approaches to achieve the end goal of identifying functions for B and the genes involved in B function. On one hand, we are directly testing whether B affects specific cellular processes by looking at genes known to be involved in those processes in our B deficient mimic plants. On the other hand, we are also looking at the effect of B deficiency on all genes to identify patterns that will point to specific processes being affected. Ultimately, these two methods should converge onto common processes and genes, providing strong support for specific roles. Through these studies, the more immediate goal is to be able to provide farmers with better information as to the amount, timing and frequency of B applications to maximize yields. This type of information can be distributed through publications as well as more informal means, including social media, and can potentially impact local communities very quickly. Ultimately, our goal is to identify genes that can be used to develop maize plants that are modified for optimized growth under low B conditions, thus increasing potential yield in marginal soils."

This challenging goal is further complicated by growing competition for land, water and energy, as well as by the potential negative impacts of climate change on crop productivity. Therefore, continued and dedicated research efforts are essential to increase yields and to expand the range of locations and environments where these crops can be grown productively.One of the most critical factors underlying grain crop productivity is a precise timing of the developmental transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages to optimize seed production. For example, in environments with hot summers, early-flowering photoperiod insensitive wheat varieties mature prior to the onset of damaging high temperatures and show significantly higher yields than photoperiod-sensitive later-flowering varieties (&gt;35% in Southern Europe). By contrast, photoperiod sensitive wheat varieties show yield advantages in milder climates, as their delayed flowering extends the period of vegetative growth providing more resources for biomass and grain production. Similarly, late-flowering forage and energy sorghums show increased biomass, whereas grain sorghums are selected for early flowering to ensure sufficient time for grain maturation while avoiding drought. This proposal is focused on improving our understanding of the photoperiodic regulation of flowering in the grass family to assist breeders in selecting better adapted crops with improved yield and wider production environments.A critical factor underlying crop productivity is a precise adjustment of the developmental transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages to optimize seed production. In wheat and sorghum this adjustment is regulated mainly by the PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 37 (PRR37), a gene that accounts for most natural variation in photoperiodic response in several economically important grass species. In spite of its central role, it is still not known how PRR37 promotes flowering in wheat but represses flowering in sorghum under long days. The first objective of this proposal is to determine the cause of the reverse activity of PRR37 in short-day (sorghum) and long-day (wheat) grasses using transgenic approaches to exchange critical photoperiod genes between the two species. The second objective is to understand the interactions between the different photoperiod genes. Populations segregating simultaneously for the different genes will be used to determine their interdependencies in the regulation of flowering genes and heading time. The final objective is to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms involved in the differential activity of PRR37 in the regulation of its downstream targets by analyzing PRR37 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.A precise understanding of the similarities and differences in photoperiod regulation of flowering time in wheat and sorghum can have a significant impact on the development of novel varieties better adapted to a wider range of environments. In addition, the understanding of the similarities and differences in photoperiod regulation of flowering time in crops as diverse as sorghum and wheat will also enable the translation of this knowledge to other economically-important crops, including both short day (e.g. rice) and long day species (e.g. barley)."

P. nodorum is one of several necrotrophic pathogens (pathogens that feed on newly killed tissue) that affect wheat and wheat relatives. In the Northern Great Plains, consistent yield losses of 5-10% due to SNB occur, generating losses in the Northern Great Plains of more than a billion dollars in the last decade. For breeders, SNB has been a difficult problem to overcome due to the lack of understanding of the underlying basis of the disease. Rarely have major resistance genes been identified, however, many minor quantitative genes that contribute to the overall disease have been identified.Given the decreased cost of DNA sequencing, we are combining next generation sequencing technology and genome wide association mapping, a technology driven by intractable genetic systems, most prominently human and animal systems, to identify genomic regions contributing to SNB of wheat. Additionally, we would like to understand the basic biology of how necrotrophic pathogen-produced proteins (necrotrophic effectors) are triggering cell death, and how this class of pathogens is using these effector proteins to avoid or protect from the effects of the host innate immune system.The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how necrotrophic pathogens interact with their corresponding hosts. This information is critical for the successful development of wheat varieties that harbor durable resistance to this pathogen. Additionally, this knowledge can be applied to other necrotrophic plant pathogen problems in wheat and other important crops."

Wheat production has been continually threatened by various biotic and abiotic stresses. There is a constant need to find and deploy new genes in wheat to strengthen its defense against new threats. However, wheat has limited genetic variability due tothe nature oforigin, which has increasingly become a bottleneck for wheat improvement. It is essential to bring new genes into wheat to expand its genetic variability. The wild grass relatives of wheat represent an invaluable gene pool for wheat improvement. Favorable genes of wild grass relatives can be incorporated into wheat by ph1b mutant-induced homoeologous meiotic recombination. However, the ph1b mutant, originally developed in the old Chinese wheat landrace &#39;Chinese Spring&#39; (CS) with poor agronomic characteristics, has not been deployed in most classes of US wheats.

It is also by far the highest yielding of all the grain crops (e.g., compare U.S. average 160 bu./acre for maize versus soybeans, 43 bu./acre, and wheat, 46 bu./acre). The higher yield potential of maize is attributable to a specialized photosynthesis process, termed C4 photosynthesis, that maize leaves use for fixing CO2 into carbohydrate. In contrast, all the other major grain crops, with the exception of Sorghum, rely on a more widely occurring photosynthesis process termed  C3  photosynthesis. The difference between C3 and C4 photosynthesis in terms of productivity (i.e., carbohydrate synthesized per unit of absorbed sunlight) is striking. By using C4 photosynthesis, maize leaves can synthesize twice the amount of carbohydrate from assimilated CO2 versus grain crops that utilize C3 photosynthesis. Because of the huge productivity advantage conferred by C4 photosynthesis several consortiums of plant scientists world-wide are now organized with the expressed aim of engineering C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species such as rice. Recent studies estimate that a  C4  rice would yield up to 60% more grain than present day C3 rice cultivars. To enable the introduction of this powerful photosynthetic engine into C3 crop species, a comprehensive understanding of how C4 photosynthesis is biochemically regulated in leaves will need to be gained. This research project will expand our knowledge in this area by elucidating how a newly discovered enzyme in maize leaves called pyruvate phosphate dikinase isoform 2 (PDRP2) biochemically regulates the C4 photosynthesis enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK). Our working hypothesis is that PDRP2 functions to biochemically inactivate PPDK enzyme that inadvertently accumulates in a specialized leaf cell called bundle sheath (BS) cell. According to current models of C4 photosynthesis, the presence of any PPDK in the BS cells would result in a short circuiting of the photosynthetic process. We propose that PDRP2 prevents such a short circuit from ever developing by ensuring that any PPDK that appears in this cell type will be rendered catalytically dead. This hypothesis will be experimentally examined using principally immunological (antibody dependent) methods. These methods include high resolution western blotting and confocal microscopy. In parallel to these experiments, an in-depth investigation into the biochemical properties of PDRP2 will be conducted to better understand the mechanism of how PDRP2 catalyzes biochemical regulation of PPDK. In all, this project will contribute essential knowledge to those efforts aimed at engineering C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species."

The fungal pathogen is highly diverse in pathogen virulence with at least eight races having been described. So far, only three necrotrophic effectors (NEs), namely Ptr ToxA, Ptr ToxB and Ptr ToxC, have been identified as virulence factors, and also the fungal genes for Ptr ToxC production have not been identified. Recent evidence has suggested additional NEs and other genetic factors are importantly involved in wheat-P. tritici-repentis interactions. Despite a high quality genome sequence being available for the pathogen, characterization of P. tritici-repentis virulence/pathogenicity factors is incomplete compared to other important fungal pathogens. The fungus is homothallic in nature, which does not allow us to develop fungal populations and characterize virulence genes using genetic tools. We propose here to manipulate the fungal mating type system to create heterothallic strains, use these heterothallic strains to develop fungal populations, and perform genetic analysis as a new approach for identifying P. tritici-repentis virulence genes that are undetectable using current methods. Specifically, the genes governing the production of Ptr ToxC and encoding novel virulence/pathogenicity factors will be identified in this project. Further characterization of fungal virulence will not only improve the understanding of the disease system, but also provide knowledge and tools for developing wheat cultivars with durable resistance to tan spot."

Greater flow of high-quality protein (i.e., casein) or a specific amino acid (i.e., glutamic acid) can increase small intestinal starch digestion in cattle; however, little is known about how greater flows of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion or potential impacts on beef or milk production. We hypothesize that greater flows of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion by different mechanisms in cattle and that apparent influences on beef production will differ. This project will allow greater understanding of how increased absorption of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion by directly measuring pancreatic and small intestinal enzymes that can limit small intestinal starch digestion in cattle. Additionally, this project will provide insight to the potential value of increasing small intestinal starch digestion in cattle by greater postruminal flow of casein or glutamic acid by measuring increases in dietary energy (i.e., retained energy) and quantify fates in the body from starch digested in the small intestine. It is likely that the mechanisms that increase small intestinal starch digestion in response to greater postruminal flow of casein or glutamic acid differ and differences may have large impacts on dietary energy retained by cattle. Additionally, amounts of digested starch used for omental fat accretion may be less when small intestinal starch digestion is increased in response to greater small intestinal flows of casein or glutamic acid. Greater knowledge of how postruminal flow of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion in cattle and subsequent impacts on beef production may allow for broader application of diets that can increase efficiency of beef production in the United States."

In many cases, fortifying staple refined foods with thiamin can mitigate the deficiencies. To optimize the delivery of thiamin, it must be stable in the product throughout storage and use. Current US consumer demands (and therefore industry trends) include increasing both whole-grain (whole-food) and gluten-free products. More information is needed to document the impact of thiamin ingredient form, food matrix, and processing and storage conditions on the stability of thiamin throughout shelf-life in a variety of food products beyond refined and enriched wheat-based foods. The proposed study will document the magnitude of thiamin losses through production and storage scenarios, encompassing a variety of thiamin ingredient forms, model systems, staple refined foods (based on wheat, corn, and rice), and food products (including gluten-free). Not only will this information be useful to compare thiamin stability in whole and fortified foods made from staple crops throughout the world, but it will also be useful to support thiamin-containing gluten-free product development efforts. The ultimate goal is to improve the delivery of thiamin in a variety of foods to promote a safe (interpret this as gluten-free for Celiac patients), sufficient, and nutritious food supply for both developed and developing nations. This project will address the USDA program area priority in Program Area A1361  Improving Food Quality  by comprehensively investigating thiamin stability in natural and synthetic ingredients and whole and fortified foods and then developing recommendations to stabilize and optimize the delivery of thiamin in both ingredients and foods. While research on thiamin stability is available in the literature, we believe that ours is a novel approach, combining an applied characterization of thiamin content and stability in foods and ingredients, including investigations of gluten-free products, with a fundamental extension of the latest in scientific advances on solid state architecture from the pharmaceutical arena to whole food applications. In particular, our proposed research has the following novel features: 1) A systematic investigation of natural and synthetic as well as crystalline and amorphous thiamin structures; 2) Development of a mechanistic understanding of how common food ingredients (starch, proteins, and gums) disrupt the molecular assembly of thiamin additives, resulting in amorphous structures with altered physical and chemical stability; 3) A direct comparison of the stability of natural and synthetic thiamin forms in food and model systems across relevant production and storage scenarios; and 4) An understanding of the synergistic or antagonistic formulation/process/environmental interactions on the kinetics of thiamin degradation through processing and storage of foods. The Specific Objectives are designed to enhance the fundamental understanding of the impacts of vitamin form, formulation, solid state properties, and storage treatment interactions on thiamin stability and to develop recommendations for improving the stability of thiamin in foods. The Potential Impact and Expected Outcomes of the fundamental new knowledge we will generate in manipulating thiamin ingredients in crystalline forms and amorphous dispersions include the development of recommendations and implementation of solid state strategies to enhance thiamin additive stability in both ingredients and foods. Scientifically sound recommendations developed from this work will enable selection of the optimal form of thiamin for different products, with the potential to improve delivery of thiamin in a wide variety of products and ultimately reduce rates of thiamin deficiencies in both developed and developing countries."

Excess rainfalls near harvest can cause pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), rendering wheat unsuitable for human food use. This wheat can still be sold for livestock feed, but at staggering losses. Falling Number (FN) is a widely implemented method used to test enzyme activity of PHS-damaged wheat and determine pricing, but has not shown to be a reliable predictor. These discrepancies have highlighted a knowledge gap in how PHS influences starch properties within wheat kernels. The proposed FN system will be critical to addressing these issues as it will serve as the only means of communication between quality control and research. Our goals are to address critical issues related to wheat quality through (1) elucidating the mechanism for the effect of PHS, (2) clarifying the relationship between FN and end-use quality, and (3) facilitating the development of new wheat varieties that are more resistant to PHS. The acquisition of a FN system in this proposal will enhance research capacity at the University of Idaho (UI), the teaching quality of the food science and plant science programs, and the collaboration between food science and wheat breeding program at the UI. Through performing experiments, graduate students who are involved in the proposed project will receive laboratory instruction, and gain skills in performing experiment, critical thinking and problem solving. Through teaching starch chemistry course, students will learn specific knowledge of starch chemistry and apply the knowledge to solve related problems in food and agricultural industries. Students will be also more competitive in job markets after graduation."

A reading of world history provides countless examples of social, economic, and political chaos ensuing after just one or two years of poor grain harvests. Based on predictions of global populations in 2050, the FAO has stated that agricultural production needs to expand by 60%, at a minimum, to meet food needs and provide food security. Given the key position of wheat for food security, now is the time to formulate research plans for the coming decades.Biotic stress creates significant challenges for wheat production. In large part, biotic stress begins with attack by diseases and pests. The disciplines that study plant biotic stress, i.e., plant pathology, and entomology, developed independently over the past 100 years and until recently have emphasized different research questions. Genetics, genomics, molecular interactions, and direct plant resistance have been foci for plant pathology, while chemical ecology, signaling pathways, and indirect plant resistance have been foci for entomology (Harris et al. 2015). Direct plant resistance is conferred by plant traits that directly harm the plant&#39;s enemy. Indirect plant resistance is conferred by traits that attract natural enemies of the plant&#39;s enemy, with the natural enemy indirectly protecting the plant by directly harming the plant&#39;s enemy. Rarely have researchers explored what happens when a disease and a pest simultaneously attack wheat or any other plant.Genomics and molecular biology are changing this. Recent discoveries of shared strategies of diseases and pests for attacking plants, as well as shared strategies for plant defense, have raised questions about: 1) how plants integrate and prioritize defense responses against various forms of biotic stress, and 2) how defense responses influence other plant functions, including the survival, growth, and reproduction that are essential for wheat production. Alongside these questions are new opportunities for defending plants made possible by stunning advances in genomics and molecular biology.Today&#39;s plant breedersneed to stay apprised of thesechanges in science and technology. They also need to identify research priorities inasmuch new scientific discoveries and new technologies create new questions about the best way to proceed in plant breeding programs. Understanding plants as integrated systems, conserving and characterizing genetic resources, and training the next generation of plant breeders are essential if plant breeders are to continue translating scientific and technological advances into the cultivars that are the keystone of agricultural production and global food security.The critical role of plant breeding for Food Security is addressed in the recently released USDA Roadmap for Plant Breeding (March 2015). Two important points made in the Roadmap were: 1) one of three expected outcomes of the USDA&#39;s effort in plant breeding is to provide  An enabling context for both public and private plant breeding, including better insights regarding priorities for each sector  and 2) short-term competitive grants may not be the best way to promote the  tangible work the breeder is educated and hired to do.  Achieving an integrated understanding of how a crop plant like wheat actually functions in the real world can also be hindered by a lack of communication between the different disciplines in agriculture, e.g. plant pathology, entomology, weed science, agronomy, plant physiology, genomics, etc.Wheat breeders have a lot of responsibility on their shoulders. To a large degree, they are the ones who translate scientific and technological advances into the cultivars that are the keystone of agricultural production and global food security. Yet other scientists who study wheat and its biotic interactions also have responsibilities, one of which is to support the efforts of wheat breeders. Something that would be useful for all wheat scientists is a cohesive picture of 1) the challenges to wheat production caused by biotic stress and 2) the degree to which wheat can be defended against biotic stress by breeding resistant cultivars.This Conference Proposal will help tofunda 2016 interdisciplinary conference  Dissection and Deployment of Durable Resistance to Diseases and Pests of Wheat . For purposes of this conference, &#39;wheat&#39; includes: 1) hard red winter, 2) hard red spring, 3) soft red winter, 4) durum (hard), 5) hard white, and 6) soft white wheat. Key goals of the conference are to: 1) create a Wheat Biotic Stress Community that brings together plant pathologists, entomologists, plant scientists, and wheat breeders, 2) to start the process of producing a cohesive picture of biotic stress in wheat, and 3) to gain an understanding of the context in which breeding for resistance to biotic stress occurs, the reality being that wheat breeders also have to select for 50+ other traits that have little or nothing to do with biotic stress. As well as creating a cohesive picture of the challenges that biotic stress create for wheat production, we expect that conversations among members of the Wheat Biotic Stress Community will help to anticipate questions that arise as advances in science and technology provide new opportunities for breeding wheat cultivars. Anticipating such questions will help set research priorities for research questions that may take years to answer. Examples of such questions are: 1) Is genetic resistance to all diseases and pests present in wheat&#39;s gene pool or will some diseases and pests have to be controlled in other ways? 2) Do some wheat resistance traits create challenges that are beyond the evolutionary potential of enemies to adapt? Thus, can we make wheat resistance more durable or even permanent? If yes, how do we predict which plant traits will confer durable resistance? 3) Will more broad-spectrum resistance traits be found and how do these traits differ from traits mediated by species- and race-specific Resistance genes? 4) Do defense responses have costs for other plant functions, such as survival, growth, and reproduction?"

In order to feed the population crop yields must increase. Over time, plant breeding has contributed roughly 50% of the increases in crop yields; therefore, plant breeding has an important role to play in feeding the growing population. A key concern that accompanies population increase is the gradually warming environment and increased frequency of extreme climate events. Reduced yields of many important food crops including wheat are expected to occur in response to warming. Thus, the challenge to breeders is even greater.In this proposal, we will carry out studies in which breeding populations are artifically warmed by passive and active methods. We will measure response to all agronomic traits including yield, but will focus especially on the impact of warming on disease resistance genes. Breeders need to know how the disease resistance that they use in crosses will fare in response to warming.We will communicate the results of these studies to other breeders through scientific publications, posters and talks at scientific meetings. We will also communicate our results to stakeholders (e.g. farmers) whose enterprises will be affected by climate change and climate variability, so they can understand the importance of climate change adaptation traits when choosing a crop variety."

The overall goal of this MAES project is to evaluate the ecological underpinning of integrated weed management in Montana and the NGP. As part of an interdisciplinary team with research, teaching, and extension expertise in sustainable agriculture, I integrate systematic and reductionist research to answer mechanistic questions on pest biology with a systemic and holistic perspective to evaluate system-level issues associated with the sustainability of the farming enterprise. In incremental order of system-level complexity, the research topics proposed are: 1. Ecological characterization of multiple herbicide resistance in Avena fatua, 2. Optimizing efficacy of downy brome (Bromus tectorum) biocontrol in crops, 3) Ecological role of grassy weeds in mite-transmitted cereal viruses, and 4) Targeted grazing to reduce tillage in organic dryland: Environmental, ecological, and economic assessment of reintegrating animal and crop production.

Land managers, including farmers, need tools to efficiently manage in the face of uncertainty. The proposed project is aimed at developing computer based decision support for land managers so they can identify optimum management strategies that balance profit maximization with environmental sustainability. Our approach emphasizes the use of site-specific data from the management area of interest, obtained by the managers, synthesized by our interactive computer models and portrayed as probability of outcomes. We like to think of our framework for decision making as allowing for the natural resource manager to become a better gambler. Our agronomic relevant research will address the specific problem of nitrogen fertilizer management in Montana dryland wheat production. We will site specifically optimize N rates in fields to maximize net returns while minimizing N loss to ground and surface water. We will draw on the GIS driven variable application technology capability to automatically create N fertilizer rate treatments within fields coupled with response information from GPS linked yield and protein monitors to create our field specific models. By repeating these experiments over time we gradually identify the spectrum of outcomes and how they relate to precipitation, cost and price received variability. Within 6-10 years a farmer should be able to assess different N fertilizer for a given field with this framework and determine with confidence what economic and pollution risk is associated with different possible prescriptions. Generalized results from site specific models will be used to assess what management behaviors and government policies tend to put farms at greatest risk of economic collapse. Our NIS research similarly relies on manager obtained data to create invasion simulations and assess a suite of management strategies for their optimum efficiency based on cost minimization and invasive impact minimization. We are particularly focused on those weedy species like cheatgrass that have the potential to create positive fire feedbacks where their invasion results in systems dominated by the weed rather than the native plant communities that we depend on for conservation of species and livestock production. We hope to identify the biological, human, climate and disturbance (e.g. fire) factors that must come together to allow major shifts in the vegetation."

Potato acreage in ND ranks in the top three and total production is among the top three or four states, depending on the year (Anonymous, 2013). Additionally, added value to the states&#39; potato production comes from the two French fry production facility and multiple wash plants that pack and nationally distribute fresh market potatoes. ND is the second largest seed potato producer, much of which is exported out of state to other potato producing regions. Clearly, potato production is a major economic factor among agricultural commodities in the state, and ND plays an integral part in the US potato production market.Potato diseases are an extremely important yield and quality-limiting factor for this crop. A significantly higher percentage of the variable cost inputs into the potato crop are directed at disease management compared to other crops grown in ND. A primary reason for this is that the crop is vegetatively propagated. There are approximately 150 diseases that affect potato, of which 30-40 are economically important, all of which can be harbored in or on the tuber. Plant diseases that would normally not be a problem in a true seed crop such as wheat, soybean, corn or dry edible beans are transmitted and harbored by the potato tuber, making diseases of the crop a major economic constraint and very difficult to control.In 2006 and 2007, potato producers in ND and MN lost in excess of $8 million due to storage rots, leak and pink rot and approximately $12 million to bacterial ring rot (RD Offutt, Co., Simplot, Inc., Lamb-Weston, Inc; personal communication). The cost of controlling Verticillium wilt by soil fumigation with metam sodium is estimated to cost growers in ND and MN approximately $25-28 million (estimate provided by the manufacturer, AmVac, Inc.). This clearly illustrates the need to improve our understanding of these diseases, their management and the means to predict their development. In addition, new and emerging diseases occur all the time in potato production, such as the recent immigration of the new viruses PMTV and TRV into the U.S. and the development of ZC caused by a very primitive bacterium. We must be prepared to address such disease issues as they arise.Research performed by this project has made significant progress in the management of potato diseases that improve the profitability and sustainability of this crop to ND producers and to the value-added constituency. However, due to the nature of the crop and susceptibility of the major potato cultivars to many diseases, further progress is needed to insure continued productivity of the crop to the region and the U.S. Much of the future progress will be directed at providing immediate disease development strategies that are research-based and through the development of cultivars that resist disease."

Breeders can continue to make progress as long as natural variation is available. But for some important traits breeders have already exploited the natural variation or natural variation is not available. One way to create new genetic variation is to treat seeds with a mutagen. After treating wheat seeds with a mutagen, current molecular biology methods were used to identify mutations in genes affecting the hardness and milling efficiency of the grain (Puroindolines), the dough handling characteristics (Glutenins), and stem solidness of wheat. New forms of the Puroindolines have been identified that give a specific level of grain hardness. Novel forms of the glutenins have been identified that could potentially give unique dough handling characteristics. Mutation derived wheats have been identified that show solid stems at the base internode. This is important because solid stemmed wheats can provide some resistance to the wheat stem sawfly. The goals will be: Characterize a set of Puroindoline alleles for their impact on milling efficiency and dough and bread quality. The emphasis will be on further development of near-isogenic lines for Puroindoline alleles that show defined levels of grain hardness. These will be evaluated for milling and end product quality; 2. Further develop promising high molecular weight Glutenin alleles and characterize their impact on dough mixing and end product quality. The emphasis will be to develop near-isogenic lines for high molecular weight glutenin alleles that have shown unique dough mixing qualities; and 3. Characterize the inheritance and relationship to agronomic characters for sources of stem solidness derived from a mutagenized parent. This will entail measuring stem solidness and agronomic traits in segregating populations where the solid stem source was crossed to adapted parents. Molecular markers to track the stem solidness trait would be developed."

It not only provides an economically viable alternative to wheat, barley, or canola but also helps condition the soil for these other crops through its ability to add nitrogen, its low water use, and its alternate pests, weeds, and diseases. Relatively few public germplasm improvement programs service the region. In addition, the availability of a genomic sequence for barrel medic greatly increases the potential for rapid and dramatic improvement in the pea varieties available and our ability to manipulate the crop. As a species, pea possesses a high genetic diversity, and a wide range of crop types can be generated by traditional breeding techniques. We will focus on developing yellow dry pea varieties that have a high content of slow digesting starch. Such a starch content is particularly suitable for Type II diabetics or other individuals who desire to avoid high blood sugar levels. Products made from such peas or their flour are digested gradually and have a much lower glycemic index than other grains or starchy vegetables. Other genes that will be investigated include several that provide resistance to specific diseases of pea, including powdery mildew, enation virus and fusarium wilt. Each of these diseases is common in pea growing regions, and the loss of their effectiveness would greatly reduce our ability to grow this crop. The genetic basis of other, more complex traits critical for pea varieties in Montana and the Northern Great Plains with be investigated and markers developed so that these traits can be included in the growing number of characters possible to be screen for in pea breeding programs by marker-assisted selection."

Hawaiian agricultural products such as taro root, sweet potatoes, banana, cassava, papaya and by-products from other local agricultural activities such as wheat millrun, macadamia nut cake, molasses, sugar cane leaves, and anticipated bio-fuel by-products could together provide the basis for producing more affordable locally-manufactured feeds. However, there is very limited or no information on the nutritional values of those potential feedstuffs available locally, which limits their use in routine swine feed formulation. Moreover, environmental sustainability is a major concern of the local pork industry due to the geographical settings of Hawaii and pacific Islands.

Development of new crops within the state of Montana with the potential to produce co-products must not only be evaluated on an agronomic level but must be investigated to determine the value to Montana beef production as an alternative feed source. Objectives 1 and 2 encompass evaluating potential new feedstuffs and co-products of an industry being developed in Montana. Currently the emphasis is on camelina meal since it is the co-product that researchers and producers know the least about; however, as the project develops, other new crops or co-products can be evaluated. Camelina appears to grow adequately in Montana and appears to be effective as a low input crop (Lamb and Carlson, 2006). Camelina meal is not generally regarded as safe (GRAS) nor on the approved manufactured feed ingredient list (AAFCO, 2006). If study results are favorable, those results can be used by marketing individuals to generate petitions and supportive material to list camelina as an approved feed in manufactured feeds and to elicit inclusion as a GRAS feed for both humans and livestock. The only way camelina or any other new bio-based crop will exist is through government subsidies or to establish secondary markets that will subsidize the primary cost of manufacturing the desired product. Careful research and keeping the animal feeding component up to speed with agronomic measures is the only proper way to move crops or co-products through the developmental phase. Objective 3 represents cooperative work with a geneticist and will generate needed information on the maternally efficient selected cow herds indexed for increased weaning weight. Evaluating the economic merit of end products (carcass) is warranted. As the beef industry becomes more value-based price oriented, Montana producers need to understand the end product better and evaluate the impacts of selection placed on the cow herd. As research is generated from the genetic selection project and its non-selected relationship to residual feed intake or other calculated measure from the modeled intake achieve with the GrowSafe system, the end product will help future producers evaluate effective strategies for adding value to beef cattle for their operations. The ability to model the effects is limited until actual preliminary production figures for female reproduction, longevity and productivity are evaluated along with the bull test data. Objective 4 is an collaborative effort with the NRCS to determine the effectiveness of cover crops when replacing the fallow period in a traditional crop/fallow cropping system in Northern Montana. The effects of cover crops on wheat yield, soil health, water use and the potential use of the above ground biomass of a cover by livestock is being evaluated."

This balance is especially difficult to achieve with the nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles. Agriculture is an important driver of changes in regional nitrogen cycles because inorganic nitrogen fertilizers and legume cultivation are integral high yielding crop production. Society is increasingly looking to agricultural ecosystems to mitigate changes in the global C cycle by storing more carbon in soils and expanding production of bioenergy crops with low global warming potential. The overall goal of this project is to increase our understanding of the fates of C and N in agricultural and bioenergy cropping systems of Pennsylvania and surrounding states. Our specific goals are to: 1) evaluate the potential to replace synthetic N fertilizer with biological N fixation by soil microorganisms and cover crops, 2) improve computer simulation models to provide new tools for soil fertility testing and N fertilizer recommendations, and 3) evaluate whether expansion of bioenergy crops in the region could provide a fuel with low global warming potential.To meet these goals we will monitor existing and establish new field experiments at the Penn State research station and on private farms. We are comparing nitrogen losses from corn-soybean-wheat rotations with no cover crop, with monoculture cover crops, and with polyculture cover crop mixtures. Our hypothesis is that the high diversity cover crop mixtures provide more ecosystem services than monocultures. We are monitoring C and N cycles in willow, switchgrass, miscanthus, and biodiverse conservation grasslands to determine which bioenergy cropping systems may have low global warming potential. In some of these experiments we assess greenhouse gas emissions from different portions of the landscape (e.g. well drained slopes vs excessively wet valley bottom positions) to determine how the placement of bioenergy crops on marginal land may affect emissions. We are coupling a new type of soil fertility testing (the CO2 burst method) with a computer simulation model to develop a new tool for farmers seeking N fertilizer recommendations on lands with high cover crop N inputs. Finally, we are quantifying how microorganisms (cyanobacteria) growing on the surface of the soil affect soil quality and N inputs to the ecosystem."

Estimated losses from all wheat diseases averaged about 16% from 1976 through 1988. Using the average farm value for wheat for the past 5 years ($2 billion/year), a 16% loss would be equivalent to about 320 million dollars each year. Planting resistant varieties is arguably the best control method for plant diseases. Such a practice is relatively inexpensive and  environmentally friendly.  Annual savings to wheat producers in Kansas from planting resistant varieties has been reported in the past to be about $58 million but now surpasses $100 million. Obviously, it is important to continue to develop resistant cultivars to maintain and improve on this success story. A main component of this development is expertise provided by wheat pathologists to phenotype wheat lines. That is the main goal of the research outlined in this project. The wheat breeder is the focal point of the effort to produce new varieties; however, many other professionals also contribute. Wheat pathologists are members of that group because part of the selection process is determining the reaction of those breeding lines to important diseases (disease phenotyping). This can help the breeders eliminate susceptible lines from the population and advance resistant ones. Data produced by the experiments described here will help breeders develop wheat varieties with improved resistance to important diseases."

Summer annual crops such as grain sorghum and corn were successfully produced in rotation with winter wheat in a winter wheat-summer crop-fallow (WSF) rotation and usually resulted in greater economic net returns than WF (Dhuyvetter et al. 1996; Norwood and Currie 1997; Schlegel et al. 1999; Thompson 2001)."

As the global population increases, the sustainability of food production, distribution, and accessibility at the global level will be challenged. We also need to be conscious about reducing unwarranted pesticide applications by streamlining diagnostic processes and directly linking species identification to management information developed and maintained by researchers and educators. Overuse of pesticides in agricultural landscapes can lead to resistance problems and loss of product efficacy when most needed (severe outbreaks). As a result of these well-publicized concerns, a great deal of uncertainty exists among stakeholders on how, when, and where to use IPM tactics. The overarching goal of this project is to produce and deploy a comprehensive, integrated system like iWheat for cost-effective prevention, early detection, rapid diagnosis, containment and mitigation of new and emerging wheat pests that links all stakeholders who have common interests in pest detection and management. Projects and methods deployed aim to: 1) understand basic arthropod biology and ecology in Kansas agroecosystems through organized survey efforts, which will document the presence, establishment and spread of emerging pests; 2) develop best management practices (BMPs) that are profitable and sustainable and incorporate key integrated components like sampling protocols and thresholds, evaluating control efficacy and monitoring for resistance, describing natural enemies and non-target impacts, and evaluating new technologies (host plant resistance, transgenics, seed treatments); 3) characterize and document importance of ecology, biology, and behavior of ecosystem services (natural enemies and pollinators) in Kansas field crops; and 4) educate farmers, industry, colleagues, and agricultural professionals of research findings through traditional and innovative Extension tools and methods.The outcomes of this project will be more efficient integrated crop production systems, improved agricultural risk management, a safer food supply, and reduction of environmental externalities associated with agriculture (e.g., pesticide use). Specific goals include the improved profitability and sustainability of agriculture in Kansas and amelioration of the environmental impacts of agriculture through generation of novel pest management alternatives. This will require a balance of basic and applied research projects to meet these outcomes. Impact will be assessed through increased stakeholder awareness and adoption of information generated from this action plan."

Wheat producers across Indiana consistently experience moderate to severe damage due to FHB and even producers who used disease management tactics, such as fungicides, experience moderate losses from the disease. Best management recommendations include fungicide applications at anthesis, however, farmers struggle to apply effective fungicides at optimum timings, since the weather conditions that favor disease development (rainy and humid) also inhibit ground application of fungicides. More information on the timing of fungicide application and product efficacy is needed. A specific component of this research is to better understand the window of fungicide timing at which a farmer can apply fungicide for FHB and still receive adequate management of disease and the resulting mycotoxins.Currently, the most efficacious fungicides against FHB (metconazole, prothioconazole, and tebuconazole) all are triazole compounds classified within the same fungicide mode of action (3, 6). Use of a single mode of action increases the selection pressure for isolates that have reduced sensitivity to the triazole fungicides, and increases the speed at which this shift could occur (7). The DMI triazole fungicides are considered to be at a medium risk for developing resistance, and although resistance to the DMI class is a multi-step process, resistance has developed over time for 25 pathogens (2). Cross-resistance is also documented within this class of fungicides, meaning that if F. graminearum were to exhibit reduced sensitivity to one triazole compound, it is possible that all triazole fungicides available would have reduced efficacy against the disease (2). Understanding F. graminearium sensitivity to triazole fungicides will give us an awareness of how the population is changing in response to our management recommendations that incorporate fungicide applications. This information is of primary importance because FHB and DON can significantly impact yields even when cultural practices, variety resistance, and fungicide applications are implemented in a management program. Until improved genetic resistance is commercially available, it is likely that fungicide applications will be necessary in FHB management programs to suppress disease. Since there is only one fungicide mode of action available for effective use in FHB management, and there is a documented risk of fungicide resistance developing to this class, it is important to be proactive in monitoring for fungicide resistance in the F. graminearum population in order to prolong individual fungicide use in FHB management programs."

Three recent crop examples, rice, wheat and sorghum determinants that enhance flooding, and salinity and heavy metal tolerances, have translated basic knowledge about plant responses to these environmental extremes to cultivar development. The proposed research will focus on signaling that regulates mechanisms/processes that facilitate drought and low temperature tolerance. For both, the signaling pathways appear to be at the intersection between environmental sensing and signaling, and growth and development programs. This is of interest because tolerance to environmental extremes require appropriate phenological responses for which there is less understanding but likely are linked to yield stability."

One group of important but under-investigated pathogens specifically infects floral tissues (non-pathogenic on leaves or stems) (Ngugi &amp; Scherm, 2006). Some of them can mimic pollen tubes to invade and grow inside floral tissues (Ngugi &amp; Scherm, 2004). Because it is too late for disease control when symptoms become visible, crop diseases caused by floral pathogens such as wheat head blight, rice false smut, and ergots often result in significant yield losses and mycotoxin contaminations. Fusarium graminearum is the causal agent of wheat head blight or scab, which is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat in the US. On adult plants, this pathogen specifically infects flowering wheat heads and produces a trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which is an important virulence factor (Proctor et al., 2002). The expression of TRI genes responsible for DON biosynthesis, including the TRI5 trichodiene synthase gene was detectable at early infection stages and infection cushions, which is likely trigged by plant factors. Earlier studies have indicated that certain compounds in floral tissues could stimulate fungal growth and virulence (Ngugi &amp; Scherm, 2006). Floral pathogens must be able to recognize these compounds as signals for the expression of infection-related genes. To date, no such factors that predispose floral tissues to fungal infection have been identified and confirmed by molecular studies. The proposed study aims to take advantages of recent advances in analytical technologies and molecular biology studies to identify wheat compounds in anthers that stimulate virulence in F. graminearum and fungal genes involved in the recognition and responses to these compounds. Identification of the compounds in wheat anthers that stimulate virulence and DON production will have a broader impact because F. graminearum also infects other small grains, such as barley and millets. Results from proposed experiments will provide much needed information for understanding the recognition of floral tissues by pathogens. Characterizing their biosynthesis pathoways in plants and molecular mechanisms involved in its recognition by F. graminearum can be developed in to future fundable research projects. In addition, reducing or disrupting its biosynthesis in wheat anthers can be developed as a novel disease control strategy, which is a likely practical application out of this study."

In Oklahoma approximately 6 million acres of wheat are planted annually, and winter wheat is the most important agronomic crop produced. A common list of insect pests sporadically limits wheat yield and profitability. Losses to insect pests are difficult to predict annually due to the sporadic nature of these organisms, and adaptation of these species to management tactics ensure a constant source of emerging threats. Cereal aphids and Hessian fly remain important pests and comprehensive IPM programs continue to be refined. The greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) and Bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.; BCOA) are often the most important factors limiting profitable winter wheat production in Oklahoma, and much of the Southern Plains. Yearly losses caused by aphids in the Southern Plains have exceeded $100 million. The Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor Say) has re-emerged as a major threat to wheat producers in the Southern Plains. The sporadic nature of these insect pests justifies continued monitoring for new and virulent biotypes. Wheat producers in the region have moved towards rotational systems with winter canola which has expanded to over 250,000 acres in Oklahoma and is expanding annually. However, since the introduction of winter canola into Oklahoma, producers have battled devastating insect pest infestations (aphids, diamondback moth, cutworms, false chinch bugs). Insect pests remain the critical limiting factor for winter canola production in the Southern Plains and effective/sustainable management programs require continued monitoring programs and refinement of management tools. In Oklahoma and much of the South Central US, the effects of natural enemies on insect pests of wheat and canola have not been fully quantified. Critical information including spatial and temporal ecology of natural enemies, their nutritional requirements, the important tritrophic relationships among pests, plants, and natural enemies, and how these factors relate to pest population suppression are needed for a truly integrated management approach in wheat and canola systems. Field and laboratory studies are planned to refine pest management detection and sampling tools for wheat and canola, describe pest impact on crop productivity, investigate the role that natural enemies play in pest suppression, and evaluate how insecticides can be incorporated into holistic IPM programs for wheat and canola. Results from the proposed research are required to develop holistic, ecologically based, management programs for insect pests of wheat and canola. Field and laboratory studies will be conducted to address specific objectives regarding (1) documentation of pest abundance and pest status, (2) implementation of pest management tools and programs, and (3) the ecology of pest and beneficial insects in wheat and canola production agroecosystems."

This project will focus on studying price and volume relationships in commodity markets in selected countries to allow policy-makers and farmers to better understand the workings of their local and international markets. The issue of agricultural trade protectionism has been well researched (Anania et. al.). Some economists believe that trade liberalization on a regional basis reduces the cost of liberalizing trade between blocs, making global liberalization easier to achieve. Others claim that regional integration reduces the motivation for liberalizing trade on a more global basis, and results in excessive trade diversion. Despite the overwhelming economic evidence of the costs of protectionism in agriculture, trade barriers remain very high, due to political economy reasons.In fact, there has been little progress in reducing distortions to agricultural trade.China is becoming a larger and larger player in food markets. In 2010, China became the largest export market for U.S. agricultural goods. Trade is expected to take on a greater importancefor China in coming years (Carter, Zhong and Zhu). Most previous studies of China&#39;s agricultural trade have focused on the grain and oilseed sector, due to China&#39;s erratic trade behavior in these bulk commodities and the potential destabilizing role of China&#39;s trade liberalization. Surprisingly, little effort has been devoted to studying China&#39;s horticultural sector, despite its global importance. With an abundant rural labor force relative to its land base, it is broadly accepted that China&#39;s agriculture has a comparative advantage in labor-intensive horticultural crops, such as fruits and vegetables (Carter) and could become a more significant player in world markets for these food products. This is one of the issues that will be addressed by this project.Trading in futures markets establishes global price levels for many important agricultural, energy and financial assets. Producers and consumers base critical economic decisions on these price signals, such as crop choice. Additionally, futures markets serve an important role as a vehicle for risk management. A significant portion of California agricultural production is devoted to commodities traded on futures markets, such as cattle, dairy products, wheat, rice, and cotton. Additionally, other California products are indirectly affected by futures market prices. Hedge and index fund futures market activity has increased dramatically over the last few years, and now accounts for more than one-half of the open contracts for some commodities. Earlier studies attempting to measure the impact of hedge funds on futures prices can be improved on for two reasons. First, the data used was generally taken from a period before the rapid increase in hedge fund trading. Second, without detailed information regarding supply and demand fundamentals, an identification problem arises in attempting to connect speculative activity to absolute price movements (Janzen et al.). One way to avoid the identification problem is to consider the spread in prices for the same commodity for two different expiry months. In a given market, we expect that inter-temporal price spreads display long-run historical relationships. The rise of hedge funds, and their tendency to trade nearby contracts, may have affected long-run price relatives across expiration months. Furthermore, same crop year contracts for storable commodities should display a related response to fundamental information."

Nutrient management in intensified cropping systems is more complicated than in a crop-fallow system. Due to shortened fallow period, very little nitrate-N accumulates in the soil profile in continuous cropping compared to crop-fallow systems. Therefore pre-plant soil profile N tests as used for crop-fallow systems may not be an effective indicator of N availability for continuous cropping systems. The amount of N mineralized from crop residue and soil organic matter during the growing season may be of greater importance than pre-plant accumulated soil N. Developing nutrient management programs that capture potential in season N mineralization will increase our ability to accurately predict optimal N requirements for intensified crop production systems while maintaining environmental quality. A long-term experiment at the Agricultural Research Center-Hays (initiated in 1975) to investigate the effect of tillage intensity [conventional tillage (CT), RT, NT] and N fertilizer rates provides will be to investigate the long-term influence of crop management practices such as tillage, cropping intensity and N fertilization on N mineralization rates in dryland production systems. Knowledge gained in understanding the influence of crop management practices on nutrient cycling, and the ability of soils to supply plant available N during the growing season will enhance our ability to predict optimal N fertilizer requirements of crops to avoid over fertilization. In addition, N responses among adapted winter wheat varieties and grain sorghum hybrids will be conducted to identify winter wheat varieties and grain sorghum hybrids that exhibit high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) when grown under common tillage practices in Kansas.Aside nutrient management, one of the challenges facing agricultural producers and researchers in the northern and central Great Plains is to identify and evaluate alternative crops that are adapted to the semiarid climate. Oilseeds have been identified as one of the seven bioenergy feedstocks by United states Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy for biofuel production. Recent studies have shown that non-food oilseed camelina is a superior feedstock for biodiesel and jet fuel in terms of fuel performance based on flight testing on commercial airline and military fighter jets. As an energy crop, camelina has potential as a fallow replacement crop in wheat-based cropping systems. Growing camelina in the fallow period will avoid direct competition for land use with food crops in wheat-based production systems. Unlike other oilseed crops (e.g. canola &amp; sunflower), information on adapted winter and spring camelina genotypes, production systems and best agronomic production practices are limited. Field trials will be conducted to evaluate camelina planting date and varieties, nitrogen and sulphur fertility requirements, and camelina water use in a wheat-sorghum-camelina production system. These research efforts are aimed at developing production recommendations for camelina that will optimize camelina production as bioenergy feedstock in wheat-based cropping systems. Crop diversification by adopting bioenergy crops will diversify markets, manage crop pests, and increase overall crop productivity. This has the potential to improve farm income, profitability and long term sustainability of crop production systems in the region."

Hessian fly biotypes will determine a farmer&#39;s choice of wheat varieties, so it is essential to understand the effectiveness of Hessian fly resistance genes in Alabama. It is important to evaluate these IPM tools to determine their usefulness for Alabama farmers.The ecology and impact of corn pests in Alabama field corn is poorly understood.

A typical dry bean grower may use five to nine field operations over each acre of dry beans. Planting dry bean directly into previous crop stubble reduces input costs, and has the added benefit of reducing soil erosion and protecting the crop from wind damage early in the growing season. Another way to reduce input costs is to direct-harvest the dry bean crop instead of undercutting and windrowing. Previous experience seeding into wheat stubble and using direct harvest in dry bean has shown high levels of harvest loss (beans left on the ground after harvest). In 2013, harvest losses were over 30% in some fields, resulting in a loss of over $200 per acre in potential revenue. Growing conditions in 2013 were particularly problematic (wet conditions in the fall during harvest), which resulted in much greater harvest loss than usual. Even in a good year, direct-harvest may result in harvest losses of 5 to 10%, which would result in a loss of $40 to $90 per acre in potential revenue. This high potential for lost revenue is one reason we think more dry bean growers are not adopting a reduced-tillage/direct-harvest production system. There is great potential to increase the profitability and sustainability of dry bean production by minimizing harvest losses in a reduced-tillage/direct-harvest system.Here, we propose a project focused on reducing harvest loss through residue management and cover crops, while minimizing yield loss. To accomplish this, we will plant dry beans into wheat stubble of various heights, or winter wheat cover crop terminated at various times. If successful, this production system could greatly increase profitability of dry bean production, while also providing environmental benefits. If we can reduce harvest losses by even 2% (a very conservative estimate of what we think is possible) we could increase revenue by over $17 per acre. The reduction in input costs could result in an additional savings of $65 per acre."

The role of technological innovation in addressing these issues is important, yet often overlooked for several reasons. The payoffs to this type of investment are often slow in arriving, as crop-based agricultural research often takes a substantial amount time to complete. Additionally, in terms of research budgets, costs often appear to be large, often in the millions of dollars just to address one type of pest or disease. However, in general, the rates of return on the investments are high and the benefits that flow from the research far outweigh the costs.This research project seeks to evaluate costs and benefits from research into specific agricultural pest and disease technologies, and also to create tools that can be used to evaluate these technologies at multiple levels--helping individual growers in their decisions about whether to adopt these technologies, and also facilitating estimates of the net benefits (or costs) of the technology itself. This work will be conducted in two specific contexts: 1) ongoing research on pest and disease resistant grape varieties in collaboration with researchers at the University of California, Davis, and 2) pest and disease research relating to wheat and wheat rotation crops at Montana State University.The tools created will be accessible to a wider range of users than economists alone, increasing the applicability and usefulness of this research. Using a combination of budget comparisons and economic welfare analysis while working as a part of teams that include growers, pest control advisors, and plant breeders as well as economists will ensure that the methods and results are accessible to a range of interested individuals. Expected benefits include an increased understanding of both the costs and the benefits from research addressing agricultural pest and disease problems, as well as information that can be useful to growers and policy makers alike in deciding whether to adopt new technology and/or to fund its research."

Interseeding technologies outlined in this proposal, which combines cover crops, crop rotations, and minimum tillage operations, has the potential to overcome all of the production problems cited above while enhancing soil chemical, physical, and/or biological properties.On average, growers in the southeastern USA apply about 100 kg/ha N for cotton, 160 kg/ha for corn, and 100 kg/ha for wheat for a total of over 1.7 million metric tons for these three crops. Thissensor-based, site-specific N application,combined with soil amendments based on soil management zones, will enhance N use efficiency and farm profitability while substantially reducing N use and its adverse impact on ground and surface water quality by applying fertilizer at optimum rate. For example, a 20% reduction in nitrogen usage could save our cotton, corn and wheat growers over $135 million annually.From 2002 to 2007 irrigated acreage in the southeastern states increased by 70%. Competition for limited water resources has become a critical issue in some parts of the southeastern states.

Borlaug himself acknowledged that a Second Green Revolution is needed for future generations, but it can, in contrast to the First, no longer expand on fertilizer, energy, water, or arable land. In addition, agricultural production will be limited by more frequent natural disasters due to climate change, as well as facing the end of oil. In light of the latter, agriculture is in fact expected to expand its outputs from food, feed and fiber to include bioenergy. Taking these trends into account, the following developments need to take place. 1) Corn varieties need to be developed that can tolerate very high plant populations. The ERA project carried out by seed company Pioneer indicates that the per-plant yield of a modern variety corn plant does not significantly differ from that of a plant in the 1940s. The difference however, is that due to the architecture of the above ground plant as well as the root system, plants can be grown much closer together, which elevates the yield per acre. 2) The per-plant yield of corn needs to be improved further. 3) Corn varieties need to be developed that have a high resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. 4) Breeders need to be provided with engineering tools that allow them to conduct more experiments faster.

Genomic technologies offer new ways to interpret the ecology and evolution of pathogen emergence. This project investigates the emergence of fungal pathogens with economic and environmental relevance to build groundwork for sustainable strategies in the prevention and management of fungal epidemics.Economically important plants, including trees and commodity crops, produce defense compounds in response to infection by pathogens. Fungal pathogens, the most important threats to commodity plants, can become resistant to these compounds through the evolution of mechanisms to inactivate, evade or degrade them. For millions of years, plants and fungi have engaged in a chemical arms race of inventing and neutralizing novel compounds. In one part of this project, we propose to investigate the evolution of fungal counter-resistance to one class of plant defense molecules to better understand the basis of efficacy of natural resistance to fungi, using the economically important rice and wheat pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae as a model. The second part of this project aims to investigate the emergence of the fungus responsible for mass die-offs of bats, which provide significant agricultural services by reducing insect pest pressure on crops. Here, we propose to identify the factors in the emergence of virulence in the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, and identify the diversity of fungal viruses which may be used for biocontrol of this fungus by reducing the activity of these virulence factors."

It is estimated that the total costs associated with losses, damage, and control of weeds in crops in the United States reaches $27 billion each year (Pimentel et al. 2005). Based on acreages and estimated chemical costs, in 2012 Michigan growers alone spent over 177 million dollars in pesticides to help control weeds and other pests (USDA-NASS 2013). Shifts in production practices and the substantial use of glyphosate-resistant crops have changed the landscape of many agronomic fields. These changes have led to the increased occurrence of glyphosate- and multiple herbicide-resistant weeds. Glyphosate-/multiple-resistant Palmer amaranth may be one of the most devastating weed species that has been found in field crop production in Michigan and throughout the United States. Future weed management strategies will rely on understanding Palmer amaranth biology and ecology, as well as, exploring potential new strategies that incorporate different crop rotations, the use of existing and new technologies, and cover crops to help manage this weed. Other changes in crop production practices have led to the use of preharvest herbicide treatments or harvest aids in crops such as dry edible beans and winter wheat. It will be important to understand the effects of these treatments on crop quality (more specifically black bean color retention), weed desiccation, and crop harvestability. The principle objective of a weed management is to reduce weed densities to levels that do not impact crop yield or quality. Chemical control is often the primary tool for controlling weeds. However, incorporating cultural practices, such as cover crops may help influence a crops ability to compete with weeds. Understanding what factors in current weed management strategies that may affect the establishment and growth of cover crops will be important. We need to design integrated weed management systems that not only rely on chemical control, but can include other tools such as cover crops to manipulate the crops ability to tolerate and minimize the effects of weed competition. One mission of the AgBioResearch is to generate knowledge through strategic research that enhances agriculture to improve food, energy, and natural resources. Developing weed management strategies that are effective, efficient, economical, and environmentally sound for the Michigan farmer is critical to this mission. The overall goal of this research is to explore multiple strategies that manipulate and manage weeds in agronomic systems."

The project include five objectives. The objective 1 is designed to generate essential data needed for making science-based decision regarding the suitability of seed blend refuge strategies for Bt corn resistance management in the U.S. south region. Contamination of non-Bt refuge corn from Bt corn pollen and larval movement are the two major concerns for the use of seed blend. To address these uncertainties, resistance risk in seed blend will be assessed for three commonly used pyramided Bt corn technologies. Intensive laboratory, greenhouse, and field studies will be conducted to investigate the effects of seed blend on Bt protein expression in kernels, insect movement, survival, development, and reproduction of four major pest species targeted by Bt corn in the South. Data generated from these studies will be used to determine if seed blend significantly reduces refuge populations and/or create a favorable condition for resistance selection.Objective 2 will document and mitigate fall armyworm (FAW) resistance to Bt corn in the U.S. south region, a research priority recently identified by the Southern Corn-Insect Working Group. Our recent work has shown that resistance allele frequency to Cry1F Bt corn in FAW is high in some areas of the south and field resistance might have occurred in some spots in Florida. The consequences would be extraordinary if field resistance to Cry1F corn occurs and spreads in the U.S. Therefore, it is urgently needed to document the current status of the Cry1F resistance and develop the corresponding resistance mitigation strategies. In the study, F2 screen and dose-response bioassay will document the resistance status in FAW across the region and thus to determine the areas where mitigation actions are needed. Intensive laboratory, greenhouse, and field studies will identify Bt corn traits and chemical insecticides that can be used for Cry1F resistance mitigation. In addition, upon completion of the study, an enhanced Bt resistance monitoring program will be established. Such monitoring program is essential for implementation of effective resistance management plans for Bt crops.During the 2007-2009 cropping season, Hessian fly seriously damaged wheat in many fields across the state. Yield loss due to Hessian fly damage was estimated to be 60-80% in some fields in south Louisiana. In addition, a new insect, the sugarcane aphid, has recently become a severe pest of grain sorghum in 2013 in LA and several other states in the south. Effective management methods are urgently needed to control the outbreak of this pest in the state. Objectives 3 and 4 of the project will develop effective strategies for managing these insect pests. Data generated from this study will define the temporal occurrence, plant damage, and yield loss caused by insect pests of wheat and grain sorghum. Insect occurrence and plant injury will be surveyed in selected wheat varieties commonly planted in Louisiana. Agronomically acceptable varieties resistant/tolerant to Louisiana populations of Hessian fly or sugarcane aphid will be identified from the field trials. The information generated from this study can be used by wheat/sorghum growers in areas where Hessian fly/sugarcane aphid could be a problem. In objective 5, field trials will be conducted to evaluate novel seed treatment technologies for managing insect pests in early plant stages of field corn and grain sorghum in south Louisiana.A scientifically sound decision making of resistance management plans for Bt corn for the southern region of the U.S. is not only important for the south but also will be critical to ensure the long-term durability of Bt crops for the entire country. Accomplishment of the objectives will also ensure that effective mitigation plans will be implemented in the target areas to ensure the long-term success of Bt corn as an IPM tool. Resistant insect populations (e.g. corn earworm or fall armyworm) in the South, if developed, could move to the rorth and thus place a great threat to Bt corn in the North Corn Belt. In addition, data generated from this study will be useful to validate or improve the  conditionally approved  seed blend strategy that is currently used in the North Corn Belt. Information generated from this project will also provide supporting data to improve the current LA Cooperative Extension Service recommendations for pest management of corn and small grains."

However, continued genetic improvement of crops, such as cotton, maize, wheat, soybean and rice, will be largely contingent on the development of new knowledge and new tools enabling comprehensive understanding and effective manipulation of the traits important to agriculture, such as crop yield and quality. Therefore, extensive research has been pursued worldwide in molecular genetics, molecular biology and then genomics in crops in the past 30 years. However, few of the molecular and genomic tools have been widely used in plant genetic improvement and many of those used have been unexpectedly low in effectiveness due to shortage of cloned genes controlling agronomic traits and the molecular mechanisms underlying the trait development. This study will take advantages of the recent development of new disciplines and new technologies, including systems genomics, systems biology, next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing, high-throughput gene and QTL cloning, advanced computer science, bioinformatics and advanced statistics [1] to isolate the genes controlling 14 maize grain yield and quality component traits (number of ears per plant, plant height, grain moisture, number of kernel rows, ear length, ear diameter, kernel row length, cob diameter, kernel weight per ear, 500-kernel weight, protein, fat and starch contents) and 8 cotton fiber quality and yield component traits (fiber strength, uniformity, micronaire, elongation, lint%, lint yield, seed yield and seed size); [2] to decipher the molecular basis and regulation mechanisms of crop yield, quality, quantitative genetics, heterosis and polyploidization using the cloned maize and cotton yield and quality trait genes as model systems; and [3] to develop a gene-based breeding system enabling effectively enhanced breeding in two major crops in Texas and USA, cotton and maize. This project, once succeeded, will not only lead to cloning of a large number of genes controlling cotton fiber and maize grain traits and significant advance of our understanding of the molecular basis and regulation mechanisms of crop yield, crop quality, heterosis and plant polyploidization, but also revolutionize the current marker- or genomics-assisted breeding and precision agricultural production by gene-based breeding and gene-based agricultural production."

Merr.) belt, South Dakota is ranked eighth in the production of soybeans in the country. Four million acres are dedicated to soybean production in South Dakota and at least 100 million bushels are produced annually. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates soybean production in South Dakota to be at a record high of 196 million bushels and harvested area of 4.91 million acres for 2014, which is seven percent higher than the production in 2013 (USDA-NASS). For sunflowers (Helianthus annuus L.), South Dakota ranks first in the nation for production according to USDA and produced nearly half of all sunflower in the country in 2013 at nearly 1 million pounds (USDA-NASS, 2014). Despite tremendous improvements in crop yield potential, soybean and sunflower production remains highly dependent on climate and plant diseases are influenced by climate. New diseases continue to appear because of changes in crop varieties, cultural practices and genetic shifts in existing populations of pathogens. On soybeans, seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium spp., Fusarium spp., Phytophthora spp., and Diaporthe spp., ranked first among diseases that reduced yield from 2003 to 2005 in the states of North Central U.S. including South Dakota (Wrather et al., 2006). Among the seedling diseases, soybean growers have indicated an increasing concern about Fusarium root rot in the North Central U.S. states causing severe yield losses and poor root health based on field observations. For example, surveys were undertaken in Iowa in 2007-2009 to characterize the distribution of Fusarium species associated with soybean roots and 15 species were identified (D&iacute;az Arias et al., 2013). While Fusarium acuminatum Ellis &amp; Everh., Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, Fusarium oxysporum Schltdl., and Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc. were the most commonly recovered from the soybean roots in Iowa, Fusarium virguliforme O&#39;Donnell &amp; T. Aoki (the causal agent of sudden death syndrome) was less frequently found (D&iacute;az Arias et al., 2013). It is possible that management practices such as crop rotation and tillage could affect population shift of Fusarium species. Soybean producers in South Dakota use corn-soybean or wheat-soybean rotation in combination with minimum-tillage or no-tillage. These cultural practices can favor survival of Fusarium species on wheat or corn residues on the soil surface and affect soybean plants in the next growing season. Fusarium spp. are also known to interact with other soil-borne plant pathogens, of which Heterodera glycines (the causal agent of soybean cyst nematode (SCN)) is the most common and widely recognized synergist on soybeans. The synergistic interaction of H. glycines with Fusarium spp. (such as F. virguliforme) can result in greater damage on soybean (Wrather and Koenning, 2011). In South Dakota, considering (1) the widespread distribution of SCN, (2) the soybean cultivars have little or no resistance to Fusarium spp. and H. glycines, and (3) the amount of revenues invested in disease management, we require a thorough understanding of the two diseases and the possible interaction of Fusarium spp. and H. glycines to develop effective management strategies. On sunflowers, Phomopsis stem canker has emerged as a significant threat to sunflower production in the United States. According to data from the annual survey coordinated by the National Sunflower Association (NSA) in the United States, incidence of fields with Phomopsis stem canker has increased from approximately 1.5% of the crop in 2001 to 24.4% in 2012 (Kandel, 2012). In 2010, a Phomopsis stem canker epidemic occurred on sunflowers in the states of North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota, where over 75% of the U.S. sunflower crop is grown (USDA-NASS, 2014). Concurrently, 50% yield reductions have been reported from commercial fields and seed nurseries in these states. While it was thought Diaporthe helianthi Munt.-Cvetk., Mihaljc. &amp; M. Petrov was the sole causal agent of Phomopsis stem canker in sunflowers, some researchers previously hypothesized more species could be involved in epidemics in other locations. Research by Mathew et al. (2011) revealed two Diaporthe species, D. helianthi and Diaporthe gulyae Shivas, Thompson &amp; Young, associated with significant yield loss from Phomopsis stem canker epidemics in South Dakota in 2010 (Markell and Gulya, personal communication). One hypothesis would suggest a recent exotic pathogen(s) introduction might have occurred in the United States, particularly in South Dakota. An alternate hypothesis would be due to changes in cropping systems (no-tillage or minimum-tillage) or crop genetics in South Dakota. A final hypothesis could be the existence of multiple Diaporthe species on sunflowers were endemic, but the ability to distinguish Diaporthe species prior to molecular techniques was impossible and recent yield loss is coincidental. The identification of two Diaporthe species causing Phomopsis stem canker in South Dakota is critical for implementing effective management practices."

South Dakota is currently the second leading producer of sunflower and flax in the U.S. There is a need for information on variety performance, production practices and pest control, to help SD sunflower and flax growers improve crop management. Good varieties, combined with sound management practices, will boost economic returns to producers. For example, there were 650,000 acres of sunflower harvested in South Dakota in 2013. At the marketing year average price of $20.20/cwt, a 100 lbs/acre increase in yield would add $13.1 million to the value of South Dakota agricultural production. Other oilseed crops, such as Carinata, canola, crambe, mustard, and camelina, have shown promise for increased production in South Dakota, particularly for biofuel production. Biofuels produced from renewable raw materials represent an opportunity to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and imported energy, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Officially-mandated requirements to use renewable energy are growing worldwide. Vegetable oils produced from oilseed crops like camelina or Carinata can successfully be used as feedstocks for the production of biodiesel or jet fuel. These crops are relatively new to SD and basic production information is needed to assist growers with crop and variety selection and crop management if they are to become a viable option in SD production systems. New oilseed crops should also be evaluated for their potential as alternative crops in South Dakota. Oilseeds work well in rotation with more traditional crops such as corn, soybean, and wheat, helping to break weed and pest cycles.This project will cooperate with SDSU, CES, NDSU, USDA-ARS, and other regional personnel to conduct research and provide advice to growers on oilseed crop and variety selection, and general production practices for maximizing seed yield, oil content, and crop quality. We will evaluate the potential of new or underutilized oilseed crops such as Carinata, camelina, flax, canola, and crambe for increased South Dakota production and provide resources to growers interested in including oilseeds in their cropping systems. Results of the research will be communicated to the public through publications, field days, crop clinics, iGrow articles, mass media, workshops, and training sessions.Expected outcomes from this project includes increased knowledge of the researchers and public about oilseed crops which may lead to changes in production practices or cropping systems that have the impact of increasing farm productivity and profitability. This project will also provide information on the adaptability of new oilseed crops to South Dakota environments. Some of these oilseed crops could have a large economic and environmental impact in the area of renewable fuels."

Recently, construction of two canola based processing plants required a three-fold of canola production only in North Dakota. To meet the anticipated demand, it is necessary to improve the genetic potentiality of the crop adapted to this region, and to expand the Northern Plains production region by moving the crop into the more arid western ND and eastern MT and further south into the somewhat warmer central North Dakota. The spring canola varieties grown in this region are developed elsewhere (mostly in Saskatoon, Canada) and might not be highly adapted to this climatic and agronomic region. To facilitate this expansion, new germplasm with high seed yield, high oil and better agronomy adapted to increased drought or temperature conditions is needed. This crop must need to be well adapted to these regions because it will compete with wheat, durum, malting barley soybeans and corn acreage. Without better performance and better adaptation, the demand for US canola will not be met, and the processing plants will need to look to foreign sources of feedstock."

Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is the major crop grown in this region, with 3.75 million acres planted and 2.44 million bales harvested in 2013 (http://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Ag_Statistics/2013/). Other important cash crops grown in rotation with cotton include wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and corn (Zea mays L.). Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) and guar (Cyamopsis tetragonolobus L.) may be planted on more acres as water efficient crops are in more demand and are effective alternatives in a cotton rotation system. Water is the key limiting factor in crop production and dryland (rainfed) production is dependent on the timeliness and amount of rainfall. In areas where cotton has been established and maintained, record cotton yields have been recorded in part due to crop genetics and improved crop protection options. A key limiting factor to crop production is weeds. At least 12 billion dollars annually are lost due to weeds growing with crops in the United States (Holt and Orcutt 1991). Producers spend approximately 3.6 billion dollars on chemical weed control and approximately 2.6 billion dollars on cultural, ecological, and biological methods of weed control (Tsaftaris 1996)."

In 2012 and 2013, some soft red winter wheat (SRWW) varieties harvested in Wisconsin, were significantly affected by stripe rust epidemics. Recently researchers used modeling to demonstrate that areas of southern Wisconsin might be favorable for oversummering survival of urediniospores. This is significant epidemiologically because Wisconsin grows SRWW, which is planted in the fall. Urediniospores that oversummer in the area can serve as initial inoculum that can infect fall-sown wheat. Wheat infected in the fall might then become symptomatic in the spring. They also demonstrated that Wisconsin is not likely an area of urediniospore overwintering. However, this was not validated by field sampling. With changing climate, urediniospore survival might be possible in years when winters are mild, thereby resulting in high levels of initial inoculum in the spring. Little is known about the impact of stripe rust on SRWW yield in the upper Midwest.

They are present in every growing season and can cause significant yield losses. FHB also reduces the quality of harvested grains due to contamination of mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, or zearalenone) that are produced by the pathogens. These mycotoxins pose major threats to the health of humans and animals. Host resistance is considered as the most effective and economically sound method for controlling both FHB and root rot diseases. However, sources of resistance to these diseases are limited. Finding novel resources of resistance is essential for breeders to develop wheat varieties with improved resistance for growers to use. Furthermore, resistance to FHB and root rot is partial and often controlled by multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) with expression significantly affected by environmental conditions. Therefore, selection of resistance to these diseases by traditional methods is very difficult. Identification of DNA markers associated with resistance QTL can help in development of resistant wheat varieties and thus reduce the impact of the diseases in North Dakota and the US. Disease resistance-associated DNA markers are powerful not only for the quick and effective transfer of the resistance loci into spring wheat varieties, but also for combining QTLs for FHB resistance from different sources to achieve a higher level of and/or more durable FHB resistance in wheat. An understanding of the genetic, biochemical, and molecular interactions of the pathogens with their hosts could ultimately lead to the development of novel strategies for controlling these serious cereal diseases. In this proposed project, we will screen and identify wheat germplasm and breeding lines for resistance to FHB and root rot diseases, map the genes (QTL) for resistance to FHB and DON accumulation using various mapping populations, and develop DNA markers associated with the resistance QTL for use in spring wheat breeding programs. Furthermore, the pathogenicity and virulence genes of the common root rot pathogen B. sorokiniana will be characterized using genomics and functional genomics approaches. The research project proposed will not only facilitate the development of new varieties with better resistance to FHB and root rot diseases, but also provide basic information about the biology of the common root rot pathogen B. sorokiniana so that we can develop novel approaches for disease control. All these research activities relate to the vision statement of NDAES:  to develop information, technology, and products that will allow North Dakotans to succeed in this new century. "

Structural changes are occurring in markets important to the U.S. due toincome growth, urbanization, changes in demographics, and in the environment. For example, China as the numberone importer of U.S. agricultural products is going through major structural change. Since 2012, more than half of itspopulation lives in urban areas with 75% of its population projected to be urban by 2050. Income growth is expectedto continue at a rate of 7% annually, and its demographic structure is projected to change dramatically due to theaging of its population and its current one-family-one-child policy. These changes will affect U.S. agriculture inunknown ways given the current state of knowledge. Other countries such as the Ukraine and Russia are undergoingsignificant structural change in the organization of their agricultural production. Already, these countries have becomemajor exporters of wheat, and they could become large exporters of other commodities as they further develop theiragricultural production techniques and management skills. Recent failures in agricultural productivity in Africa and thegrowth in the size of their middle class indicates future increase in the demand for agricultural and food imports fromthe U.S. and other net agricultural exporting nations. Developments in China, Russia, and other parts of the worldsuch as Africa and South America make it imperative that future research focus on these issues. However, thetraditional trade partners like Canada, Mexico and Japan are still important trade partners. Therefore, future workmust consider these countries.The principal benefits of this research includes information pertaining to trade creation and diversion, supply response,import demand, land values, price variability, agricultural value added, food safety, the environment, and emergingbio-energy issues. Improved competitiveness of the U.S. in international food and agricultural trade is expected tostrengthen the employment base and increase income levels in respective states.If this type of analysis does not go forward, stakeholders will not be aware of the economic impacts of changes inagricultural trade and the global market environment. While various commodity groups may have researchers whoinvestigate their specific commodities and the related policies, the proposed work in this multi-state project will bringtogether a team of researchers to assess trade and policies across multiple commodities and products."

The breeding program is a classical field-based program but will adapt  new and improved  strategies, tools, and methods necessary to get the job done, as allowed by available resources. Quality objectives are high millability, good bread-making characteristics, and premium Asian noodle color and texture characteristics.

Cultivar development is an ongoing project where a 12 year breeding cycle is initiated and completed each year. The outcome of this research is development of superior wheat cultivars that meet quality requirements of Montana&#39;s domestic and export customers. This outcome is easily assessed as indicated by the adoption of improved cultivars in the State using annual variety surveys. Objectives 2 and 3 represent long-term efforts to improve the efficiency and productivity of the breeding program and identify components or modifications of production systems that will ultimately benefit the MT wheat producers. Success of this research program will result in superior wheat cultivars that are released to Montana agricultural producers.

Detoxification of the mycotoxins through either adsorption or degradation as the last defending mechanism in preventing the adverse effects of the mycotoxins to humans and animals is still critical. This study is aimed to select and modify clays and layered double hydroxides to improve their binding efficiency for these five major agriculturally important mycotoxins. We also will tackle more practical challenges in the use of the clays and layered double hydroxide in removing or inactivating the mycotoxins in vitro (fermentation) and in vivo. The specific objectives are to: 1) Modify smectites to ensure the nanominerals&#39; binding efficacy for aflatoxins in real corn fermentation solutions; 2) Modify smectites to improve the nanominerals&#39; catalytic functions in degrading adsorbed aflatoxins in corn fermentation solutions; 3) Engineer smectites to detoxify aflatoxins in vivo at realistic toxin levels in broiler chickens; and 4) explore and modify clays and layered double hydroxides for binding fumonisin, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone. Once implemented in practices, the adverse effects of the mycotoxins to animals and humans; and the economical losses of corn growers, biofuel industry, and animal industry can be minimized.Arsenic, zinc, lead, copper, nickel and many other heavy metals are the major concerns of acid mine drainage (AMD) resulting from the oxidation of sulfide minerals exposed to air. In theory, acid mine drainage and heavy metal contamination should not be problems in limestone areas due to the abundance of carbonate minerals that can neutralize the acidity. Poorly crystalline nanoparticles such as various iron oxides, silica, and the oxides of heavy metals are the most reactive compounds in regulating the heavy metals. Unfortunately, our knowledge on these reactive particles in the limestone environment or the liming reclamation areas is very limited due to the difficulties of characterization of these materials with common methods and instruments. The general objectives of our study are to: 1) characterize on an atomic scale low-crystallinity nanoparticles and colloids generated in AMD and examine their transformations in a limestone environment, 2) characterize As (the major focus), Zn, Cu, and Pb speciation in each associated solid phase and quantify the mobilization and transformation of As and the heavy metals associated with the mineral phase conversions, and 3) model the reactivity of the nanoparticles and the geochemistry of As and heavy metals in the limestone environment. This proposed study will characterize both representative field samples and simulation samples, combine several advanced spectroscopic and microscopic methods and geochemical modeling to address the speciation, composition, atomic scale structures and the influence of the heavy metals and metalloid on the nanoparticles. The results will offer more insight to the geochemistry of the nanoparticles AMD and offer more structural and thermodynamic parameters for modeling."

In addition to yield advantage over spring wheat, winter wheat production helps conserve soil moisture, in fall-seeded into no-till fields. Development and release of new improved winter wheat cultivars helps sustain and expand winter wheat production in the state by tackling the production challenges of the region. Most the winter wheat is grown in dryer parts of state and therefore cultivars with drought tolerance and winter hardiness along with pathogen/pest resistance are necessary for cultivar adaptation and successful production. The program will combine conventional breeding methods with the modern genetic tools like DNA marker technology for increased efficiency of genetic gain and variety development. To improve the program efficiency efforts will be made to apply advanced breeding technologies wherever possible. An aggressive crossing program will be performed using elite crosses, and when feasible, desirable lines will be rapidly advanced to homozygosity through the production of doubled-haploids (DH). We will develop improved winter wheat varieties with focus on higher and stable grain yield, improved end-use quality through our program to benefit wheat producers. We will identify, develop, and release new germplasm for economically important traits and identify genetic/genomic factors that will contribute to genetic improvement of wheat. Important knowledge and breeding materials will be shared with the scientific community through publications from our research.

In the United States (U.S.), 49 million metric tons of wheat are produced annually on over 23 million hectares, with nearly 20% of production occurring in California and the Pacific Northwest (PNW: Idaho, Oregon, and Washington). Two growth habit types, winter (fall-sown) and spring (spring-sown) are in commercial production in the PNW, and five market classes are grown, including soft white, soft white club, hard white, hard red winter, and hard red spring. Based on its high grain yield potential, winter wheat production predominates in the PNW, usually in rotation with spring crops or on a wheat-fallow rotation. Market classes are distinguished by grain color (red or white), grain hardness (soft or hard), head type (club or common), and in some cases growth habit type (spring or winter). In the PNW, no single cultivar has all of the traits needed to produce a wheat crop at the lowest input, lowest risk, and highest marketability. Although some traits are easily manipulated, more complex traits such as yield, test weight, and disease resistance are more difficult. Several diseases of winter wheat in the PNW have no chemical control available. Yield loss can be anywhere from zero to 50% or more for each disease. The cost in lost yield, although difficult to quantify, is highly significant. Reduction of required grower input and/or increased productivity of even very small amounts translate into improved economics of millions of dollars to the growers, grain trade and allied industries.A wheat breeders&#39; last success is their next target, in that they aim to continually replace established cultivars with improved ones. When developing winter wheat cultivars, many essential traits must be taken into consideration before releasing new cultivars for commercial production. To reduce potential production risks, all cultivar release candidates must have superior agronomic performance in the target production region. Production goals for agronomic traits, such as grain yield potential, grain volume, plant height, days to heading, straw strength, days to grain ripening, etc., will vary based on the length of growing season, amount of annual precipitation, and/or production location. Improved cultivars also must carry all essential pest resistance genes common to each production region to reduce risk and input costs for wheat producers. In addition, essential end-use quality traits must be incorporated into new winter wheat cultivars to meet the stringent demands of both the milling and baking industries. Traditional breeding techniques allow us to make cross-hybridizations and allow them to be evaluated under the diverse production regions of Washington State. Molecular techniques allow us to identify genes of interest and rapidly introgress these into adapted varieties. Early-generation end-use quality screening improves the end-use quality potential of advanced generation breeding lines. All of these efforts lead to the development of superior winter wheat cultivars in two to four years less time than traditional methods. With continued efforts to develop superior cultivars with enhanced disease resistance and agronomic adaptability, future WSU winter wheat cultivars will continue to have a significant and positive impact on the sustainability of wheat production in Washington State."

In addition to the adoption of conservation tillage systems particularly direct seed or one-pass seeding operations, the trend has been toward heavier and larger tractors and implements to improve operational timing and efficiencies on modern large farms.As an example, large tractors currently used in the PNW wheat-production region range in weight from 20 to 30 tons, two to three times the weights of tractors used during the early adoption of conservation tillage practices.The magnitude to which soil physical properties are affected by tillage practices and heavy agricultural equipment markedly influences crop growth and yield and are not well understood by producers. After two to three decades under direct seed and reduced tillage systems, producers are currently experiencing declining yields. Producer assessments for this trend are primarily anecdotal and include perceptions of greater disease incidence, low soil pH levels from the continued use and placement of ammoniacal fertilizers, increased compaction levels within the upper soil surface layers, or a combination of these various factors. The scientific factors for these yield declines must be determined and different management practices and/or decision processes developed to insure continued and increasing use of direct/reduced tillage systems to ensure efficient use of our existing soil resource and to adequately protect the environment from collateral damage from soil erosion and runoff. Research will be performed using field sites under continuous direct drill or reduced tillage management throughout the Palouse rainfed wheat production region. Each site will be required to have been under its respective management system for a minimum of 10 years; historical management practices regarding seeder/drill, tractors, and other implements used will be obtained for each field site. Soil properties, including density, soil strength, and permeabilty, will be measured in the surface soil layer (~0 to 12 inch depth) during the spring. From these measurements, the impact of heavy equipment traffic and seeding drill configuration will be determined on the soil physical condition and on the development of potential adverse production impacts causing poor crop growth or disease conditions. These findings will be used to inform growers about equipment use and configuration effects on soil conditions and, importantly, will help establish a scientifically-informed decision-making process to support effective and econonomically viable conservation tillage methods, particularly, direct seed management. Outcomes of this research will be delivered to grower-producers, agricultural commodity organizations, agricultural equipment/chemical dealers and fieldpersons, and extension personnel. The direct benefit of this research will be the continue improvement and protection of our valuable soil resource and the environment through grower satisfaction and confidence in direct drill systems and these systems continued and increasing use in the dryland cropping regions of the Pacific Northwest."

Farm bills define and authorize agricultural programs for the subsequent five or six years. The policy changes in the new farm bill are the most far reaching since the 1996 bill when policy changes were largely driven by efforts to comply with World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations that stipulate member nations must reduce their use of production-promoting and trade-distorting agricultural policies.As a result of a recent trade dispute brought before the World Trade Organization&#39;s dispute settlement panel, cotton was singled out for the first time in the 81 year history of field crop subsidy programs in the 2014 bill. Cotton is excluded from two new crop programs but is eligible to received payments under a new insurance program exclusive to cotton. While these unprecedented changes to the treatment of cotton in the new farm bill make significant progress towards reforming cotton subsidy programs, the question remains whether the new policies are less trade-distorting than the predecessor policies. In addition, it has yet to be determined whether or not the policies awarded to cotton are more or less distorting than policies awarded to other feed grains (referred to as  program crops  which include corn, wheat, oats, barley, soybeans, and rice). This research seeks to address these questions using USDA data and simulation analyses.Furthermore, cotton is now excluded from receiving payments from programs upon which payments are calculated based on historic production determined by crop specific acreage and yields during a specific previous time period. These historic acres are referred to as  base acres . While cotton producers are no longer entitled to payments calculated using base acres, cotton producers with historic base acres associated with cotton production now have the ability to reassign these cotton base acres, referred to as  generic base , each year to another planted program crop. For that year, those generic base acres are considered base acres for the program crop to which they were assigned for the purposes of calculating program payments. Thus, producers with generic base acres have an incentive to make planting decision based on expected support payments for the various supported commodities and market price expectations. This is likely to lead to production distortions. This research seeks to estimate the potential production distortions associated with producers reallocating their base acres using USDA data and simulation analyses."

In theory, the availability of improved weather and climate forecasts should improve the economic welfare of growers, whether through increased revenue and/or reduced volatility in revenue. Farm-level studies place the value of forecasts to US agriculture anywhere between $0/acre and $3.40/acre (Mjelde et al., 1998). As climate change increases both the variability and uncertainty of weather and climate patterns, the value of improved forecasts to growers should also increase and growers should rapidly and fully assimilate improved forecasts into their crop management decisions.In reality, reliance on improved weather and climate forecasts is limited and not commensurate with the estimated benefits of doing so. In Kentucky, self-reported forecast use is limited and it is unknown how these forecasts have translated into modifications in crop management (Van Sanford et al., 2013). For a novel source of weather information to have any real marginal value, it must lead to changes in management choices that result in improved outcomes. Between information dissemination and information use stand many factors. Limited reliance on new information sources could be a function of any of the following: grower objectives and risk preferences, enrollment in risk-management programs (e.g. crop insurance), the inability (financial, physical, or perceived) of changing practices in response to forecasts, and the reliability of the forecasts themselves (Artikov et al., 2006, Sonka et al. 1987, Klockow et al., 2010, Carriquiry and Osgood, 2012, Cabrera et al., 2007).The research proposed here focuses on the issue of reliability, both real and perceived, of weather and climate forecasts, and asks to what extent this may matter in growers&#39; decisions to use sources of improved forecasts. The question of whether and how improved climate and weather forecasts lead to welfare-improving management choices is important and timely as it is the maintained hypothesis underpinning large-scale projects such as the Kentucky Mesonet (http://www.kymesonet.org/) and the Oklahoma Mesonet (http://www.mesonet.org/index.php/agriculture/monitor). These two projects provide 15-minute weather updates that allow growers to adjust crop management decisions in real time. Such projects are testaments to significant advances in forecasting technology, including improvements in forecast skill (accuracy); yet it may still be the case that the forecasts that such Mesonets provide are insufficiently accurate for growers to find reliable.A critical question is  How skilled must forecasts be to generate any welfare improvements for farmers?  This is a non-trivial question, given that an old strand of theoretical economic literature argues that a significant increase in the informational content (i.e. accuracy) of a signal has a large marginal benefit, yet small increases in informational content can bring little or even no marginal benefit (e.g. Radner and Stiglitz (1984)). That is, there may exist a threshold level of forecast skill below which the forecast has no value whatsoever (e.g. Moeller et al. (2008)).More generally, the proposed project addresses a disconnection that exists between the way that economic value-of-forecast studies depict forecasts and their use and the way that forecasts are increasingly presented to users: Economic impact analyses typically assume perfect, deterministic forecasts (&#39;It will rain.&#39;) and consequently also assume perfect adoption of forecast information. However, meteorologists conceptualize and increasingly present forecasts in more realistic, probabilistic, terms (&#39;It will rain with 60% probability&#39;). Probabilistic forecasts simply make explicit the inherently uncertain nature of weather and climate forecasts. The reliability of forecasts, both real and perceived, can potentially pose large obstacles to the widespread adoption of improved weather and climate forecasts. Thus the majority of value-of-forecast studies, by assuming perfect (deterministic) forecasts, likely overstate the value of weather and climate forecasts. Unfortunately, the process by which end users assimilate probabilistic forecasts remains poorly understood (Asseng, 2012).Despite the general trend toward presenting weather and climate forecasts as probabilistic predictions, the empirical literature on how growers understand and respond to probabilistic forecasts is sparse, and sparser still is theoretical work proposing models of assimilation of probabilistic forecasts. Through the project, I propose to develop a model of (probabilistic) forecast assimilation on the part of decision makers, to test the model empirically using a framed field experiment with Kentucky wheat growers, to estimate the value to Kentucky farmers of improved weather given probabilistic forecasts and current producer perceptions of their reliability, and to derive a marginal benefit curve of forecast accuracy. Because increasing the accuracy and delivery of climate and weather forecasts incurs costs, it is crucial to understand the nature of the marginal benefit curve, in addition to the marginal cost curve of such an initiative."

Their life cycle is characterized by &#39;monocarpic senescence&#39; - after fertilization, over a time span of a few weeks, parental plants turn yellow and die. Importantly, this process is characterized by massive remobilization of nutrients (including nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, sulfur and more) from senescing parental plants to the developing grains. Senescence timing therefore influences key agronomic traits including nutrient use efficiency, yield (with late-senescing or &#39;stay-green&#39; varieties often exhibiting higher yields), grain protein and micronutrient concentration. Senescence onset and rate are controlled by genetic and environmental factors; water deficit stress is the most important external factor inducing early/rapid senescence, and leading to lower yield. In this general context, the present project will (1) analyze the function of a regulatory protein at the intersection of plant senescence control and water deficit response, investigating different plant developmental stages, and (2) identify and characterize some of the enzymes (&#39;proteases&#39;) which are important for nitrogen remobilization from senescing leaves to developing grains. These goals will be achieved using a combination of greenhouse and field-based drought experiments, advanced molecular techniques for gene/protein functional analysis in senescence regulation and drought response, and advanced biochemical techniques to characterize N remobilization from senescing leaves. The project will provide novel information about molecular processes controlling cereal performance under water-limited conditions, and will identify and characterize genes contributing to nitrogen use efficiency, grain protein concentration and (indirectly) yield. This information will establish a physiological basis for breeding efforts aimed at improving several important crop performance parameters."

A legume could make farming and ranching in the region more economically profitable and environmentally sustainable. A legume in rotation can integrate cereal and livestock production. In addition to providing high quality livestock feed as either forage or grain, legume benefits include added soil nitrogen, increased soil organic matter, reduced soil erosion, better pest control, increased soil water-storage and crop-water-use efficiency, and greater economic diversity. Growers elsewhere around the world have successfully integrated cereal and livestock production with winter feed pea in crop rotation.The traditional WW-SF system has helped to assure successful establishment of wheat in alternate years in a semi-arid environment. However, approximately 50% of native soil organic matter has been lost on the Central Great Plains since the inception of the WW-SF. Also, only 20-30% of precipitation during the long 14-month fallow is conserved. A WW-WP system might more efficiently use water and, at the same time, provide a sufficient short true fallow prior to wheat planting.Finally, many eastern Wyoming agriculture producers are both wheat growers and livestock producers but, generally, the two aspects of their operations are not integrated. Perhaps a locally adapted legume, such as winter feed pea, might sustainably and synergistically integrate crop and livestock production in Wyoming.This producer-driven project involving the University of Wyoming is to evaluate the initiation of a winter wheat-winter pea (WW-WP) rotation in comparison with WW-SF over two growing seasons at four sites, three farms/ranches in Laramie and Platte Counties, and UW SAREC in Goshen County. Producers will plant, manage, and harvest the crops. UW will evaluate wheat grain yield (in both rotations), pea yield (for both forage and seed in the WW-WP system) and changes in soil water content over time (in both rotations).This project is distinctive because it will utilize the first winter pea line bred in Wyoming for the Central Great Plains. In local trials, &#39;Wyo No.11&#39; has proven superior in terms of adaptation and yield to existing cultivars that were bred elsewhere in the U.S. &#39;Wyo No.11&#39; is currently under seed increase for cultivar release under the auspices of the Wyoming Crop Improvement Association. For both growing seasons, UW will provide 100 pounds of &#39;Wyo No.11&#39; seed in the Foundation Seed Class, more than sufficient to plant five acres. At harvest, most of that land (minus a small amount sampled for experimental purposes) can be harvested and sold by the growers as high-value Certified Seed, thus entering &#39;Wyo No.11&#39; into the marketplace and making it available to other Wyoming producers.In sum, UW has bred a winter pea for local adaptation and superior yield. However, the potential for adoption of peas into rotations by producers is not yet known. Ultimately, producers will determine whether or not these locally adapted peas can be adopted into their operations. Thus, we will evaluate performance of Wyoming-bred pea, and compare and contrast two rotations (WW-SF and WW-WP), on Wyoming farms/ranches in this producer-driven project."

Until screenings of dry bean and barley genotypes are completed under Wyoming conditions, producers may not have the best adapted genotypes for their field operations and for economic/environmental sustainability.The proposed project will test experimental genotypes of major crops grown in Wyoming and nearby regions (including but not restricted to dry bean, hard red winter wheat, and barley) for their performance under limited-irrigation conditions. Some experiments will also be conducted in the greenhouse where water availability can be controlled very closely. Field studies will be performed in northwestern and southeastern Wyoming. As drought-tolerant genotypes are identified, the PI will work with breeders to make crosses between the drought-tolerant types and adapted public lines with the ultimate goal to develop new cultivars with higher yield and/or quality than existing varieties."

Identification of plant viruses, monitoring for new viral diseases, understanding the vectors that transmit viruses, and determining viral and vector impacts on the growth and development of crop cultivars and lines is vital to managing and controlling these diseases. In addition to damaging crops and causing yield losses, plant viruses interact with vectors and other diseases to increase the damage from the diseases/pests. This increases the difficulty of controlling both the plant virus and the interacting pathogen or vector. Defining this interaction between plant viruses and other diseases important to South Dakota agriculture is an additional goal of this project. Development of a database for reactions of winter wheat lines and cultivars to WSMV will expand the utility of data that has already been obtained and future data to wheat stakeholders."

We will pursue testing of winter wheat and dry bean as new varieties and experimental lines become available. For example, Colorado State University has been developing upright varieties of dry bean, which offer advantages in terms of disease control, drying, and harvesting. In 2014, irrigated malting barley averaged 145 bu/acre and met or exceeded all the quality standards for malting. We will continue testing malting barley for its yield potential, quality, and economic viability. There is a lot of interest in industrial hemp but information about its adaptability or potential benefits for southwestern Colorado is lacking. We will test several industrial hemp varieties in 2015 to evaluate their performance and adaptation to our environment. One opportunity that may generate additional income for growers in southwestern Colorado is the production of virus Y-free seed potatoes. Potato Y virus (PVY) is a serious threat to potato production in the San Luis Valley and even though potatoes have been grown sporadically in southwestern Colorado on a small scale, it is conceivable to find isolated areas where the likelihood of PVY infestation is small. We will explore this possibility as well as the potential to produce specialty potatoes, which may have additional benefits compared to conventional (e.g., white-fleshed) potatoes. Regardless of the crops grown, water is the most limiting factor to crop production in southwestern Colorado. There are approximately 169,000 acres of irrigated land in southwestern Colorado but water availability fluctuates from year to year. For example, there were severe irrigation water shortages as recently as 2013. We will continue developing management practices and strategies to conserve water and optimize its use efficiency. The emphasis will be on alfalfa, which is the largest irrigated crop in southwestern Colorado and the one that uses the most water compared to other field crops. We will determine the effects of water stress on alfalfa stand, dry matter, and time of recovery. Even though irrigation accounts for a significant percentage of crop production in southwestern Colorado, dryland farming is still important. Constraints include low and erratic precipitation, low soil organic matter, wind and water erosion, and low yields. We will test cover crops as an environmentally friendly way to enhance soil quality and health and to reduce soil erosion. Cover crops will be grown during the fallow period in (winter) wheat-fallow, wheat-bean, and wheat-safflower-fallow rotations. We will monitor soil moisture, soil fertility, soil erosion, weed infestation, soil biological activity, and crop yields and returns. We will identify cover crop mixtures and management practices that will enhance the sustainability of dryland farming in SW Colorado and SE Utah. The information generated by this project will be shared with a large audience via field tours and workshops, social media, annual technical reports or bulletins, journal articles, and presentations at relevant events. Success will be measured by how well the research and outreach objectives are met and by the impact this project will have on the sustainability of crop production in southwestern Colorado."

Herbicides typically exert enormous selection pressures due to high control efficacies. Currently, herbicide-resistant weeds pose an immense threat to crop production efficiency worldwide. As of 2015, there are 449 unique cases of herbicide resistance in 245 weed species across the world (Heap 2015). A common phenomenon shared by these cases is that weed management practitioners relied heavily on few herbicide options without implementing sufficient management diversity (Norsworthy et al. 2012).In Texas, the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds is an emerging problem in several cropping systems, tremendously affecting crop yields, quality and profitability. Currently, glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth and common waterhemp are two major weed issues in Texas causing serious economic damages in a number of row-crops, including cotton, sorghum, corn and soybean (Baumann 2013; McGinty et al. 2015). Herbicide-resistant annual ryegrass (resistance to ALS- and ACCase-inhibitors) is a serious threat to wheat production throughout the Blacklands of Texas (Swart 2012; Swart et al. 2012). The first ALS-inhibitor-resistant johnsongrass was reported in 2000 (Green 2000) and currently more resistant populations are suspected in Texas corn and sorghum. In Texas rice, ALS-inhibitor-resistant red rice (Avila et al. 2005) and barnyardgrass (Bradshaw, personal communication) are two of the important resistant weed problems. As a result of growing resistance issues, producers are forced to use more and more environmentally less-benign herbicides in their weed management programs, which has a direct impact on production costs and the environmental footprint of weed management practices. Surveys indicate that herbicide-resistant weed issues have tremendously increased herbicide use, hand-weeding, and mechanical tillage, tremendously increasing crop production costs (Sosnoskie and Culpepper 2014). In areas where conservation tillage practices have been adopted for long-time, returning to tillage as a means for controlling herbicide-resistant weeds has been jeopardizing all the soil conservation gains made over the past several years (Shaw et al. 2012). Overall, herbicide resistance issues have been threatening the sustainability of economical weed management in several cropping systems in Texas.Although herbicide resistance, particularly resistance to glyphosate, is a growing problem in Texas, it is still in its early stages in several parts of the state. There is a critical need to prevent further evolution and spread of resistant weeds and effectively manage already existing resistant populations. The key to preventing resistance is to be proactive, but a better understanding of the factors influencing the evolution of herbicide resistance can guide the deployment of robust and effective proactive tactics. Knowledge on weed biology, population genetics, management factors, and their interactions is vital to understand the evolutionary dynamics of herbicide resistance. However, research information is often limited in this regard.Developing a robust resistance management strategy begins with an understanding of the background levels of resistance at regional scales. A key consideration to herbicide resistance management is managing selection pressure (Norsworthy et al. 2012), which is achieved through diversifying management tools by integrating both chemical and non-chemical options. Diversified approaches will minimize selection pressure placed on a single management tool. Yet, the number of tools available for effective resistance prevention and management are limited. While there is a need to develop additional tools for integration, it is critical to protect and preserve all the management tools that are currently available. Additionally, research efforts are needed to develop stewardship practices to ensure sustainable deployment of herbicides and herbicide-resistant crop technologies in our cropping systems and minimize potential unintended impacts on the broader environment. Further, developing decision-support tools are necessary to facilitate extension and outreach activities geared towards promoting widespread adoption of sustainable resistance management practices."

Downy brome is a particularly troublesome weed throughout the region and an integrated approach to its control is needed. Downy brome is ubiquitous in winter wheat-fallow production systems and it has become increasingly difficult to control with herbicides. Understanding how traits control weediness of this troublesome species may lead to more effective control strategies in the field. Increases in opportunities for growers to manage downy brome using integrated management strategies based on biological knowledge of the weed, rather than the current approach of using herbicides, reduces pesticide load and improves production efficiency.There is a significant body of evidence that downy brome as a species is composed of a number of &#39;general purpose&#39; genotypes and multiple &#39;specialist&#39; genotypes. &#39;Specialist&#39; genotypes are typically found in highly stressful natural areas. In agricultural systems, downy brome is a particularly damaging and difficult-to-manage weed. We have no genetic information about downy brome infesting agricultural systems. It is the ideal species for association mapping, and an extensive effort to phenotype and genotype downy brome in the PNW would significantly increase our understanding of mechanisms of invasiveness by downy brome and enhance our ability to manage it. The resulting extensive knowledge of downy brome biology will ultimately assist growers in targeting particular traits of any specialist genotypes identified infesting agricultural ecosystems using integrated management strategies. The project is unique because growers could immediately take advantage of genetic tests on their particular downy brome biotypes based on the discoveries of this project."

Because both biotic and abiotic stresses differ markedly between geographical areas, genotype by environment interactions can be exploited to develop cultivars that perform particularly well in a given production area. In addition, as management practices change to become more sustainable, plant breeding must continually shift emphases to develop adapted material for current and future production systems. Food safety and food nutrition requirements also change with increased knowledge, and plant breeding is responsible for providing cultivars to meet the needs of increasingly more sophisticated consumers and allied industries. Plant breeders are tasked with development of these improved cultivars to meet the agronomic needs of local producers; cereal chemistry and rheology needs of the industries that processes these grains; and safety and nutrition needs of the consumers who purchase and feed their families with them. In addition to the direct research, the value of including undergraduate and graduate students as part of building and maintaining capacity in plant breeding and genetics should not be undervalued. Long range sustainability of U.S. agriculture will be enhanced by providing breeders with both the germplasm and the reliable selection tools to allow incorporation of resistance genes for common bunt and dwarf bunt in adapted cultivars. This project will also incorporate training field-based breeders by integrating undergraduate and graduate students funded by this project into ongoing productive plant breeding programs in Utah. As race changes occur in the disease organisms, identification of new resistance genes in critical. Previous screening of winter wheat accessions in the National Plant Germplasm System has identified a number of extremely resistant lines that contain previously unidentified and un-utilized resistance. We do not know, however, if these lines incorporate new combinations of previously identified genes, or if they contain novel, previously unidentified, genes. It will be vital to characterize novel genes for resistance that are available in the National Small Grains Collection (part of the National Plant Germplasm Collection). It is important to continue screening the National Small Grains Collection for winter wheat accessions to identify novel sources of resistance to both common bunt and dwarf bunt."

Grain shape, especially rice grain length, is a major agronomic trait affecting yield and quality of the grain product. Grain length is genetically controlled by a large number of genetic loci. During the past two decades, intensive genetic research work worldwide has led to the cloning of about a dozen genes that regulate grain length in rice. More genetic loci that may play a role in grain length determination have also been mapped to chromosomes. Working with our collaborators, we have recently identified a genetic locus that has a major effect on grain length control in rice. The mutant allele of this gene leads to the development of long grains in mutant rice lines. The putative gene underlying this mutation has been mapped to a small region of chromosome 2. The gene has been cloned and sequenced. In this project, we will characterize the isolated gene at the molecular level. We will investigate how this gene exerts its function to regulate grain development. Finally, we expect to identify its homologous genes in barley and wheat, and will explore the possibility of increasing grain length of barley and wheat by manipulating the function of this gene. An improvement in grain length may eventually help breeders to develop new cultivars of barley and wheat with increased grain yield and improved grain quality. Thus, the knowledge gained from the proposed work is important not only for rice research and production, but may also have potential applications to the improvement of grain size, yield and quality of wheat and barley, two major crops in Idaho and the whole USA."

Most of the wheat grown in the state is the red winter wheat and currently traded as grain for its flour (protein and starch). Wheat germ represents a small portion of the whole wheat grain (i.e., ~2%) and is usually separated during milling to improve storage quality of the flour. Wheat germ is a very good source of phytochemicals (i.e., ferulic acid, phytic acid), B vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. Wheat germ contains about 8-14% oil and WGO is an excellent source of n-3 PUFA (&alpha;-linolenic acid), policosanol, and it is one of the richest natural sources of &alpha;-tocopherol (the major form of vitamin E).

The average wheat planting area is 1.2 million acres with the average production of 100 million bushels. For winter wheat, 35% of the acreage harvested in Idaho during 2012 was irrigated, and 58% of the harvested spring wheat acreage was irrigated. Irrigated areas generally produce high wheat production, and are mainly located in southern Idaho. The high wheat production in southeastern Idaho greatly relies on the resources of the Snake River and its aquifer. However, seasonal water supplies are still challenging wheat production in this area. For example, seasonal water use in spring wheat (April to August) at Aberdeen (in southeastern Idaho) is approximately 550 mm, but the rainfall during that period is only 90 mm. The critical growth period in wheat starts from late May or early June, and by that time a large portion of the soil water from snowmelt is depleted by plants in the field. Without timely irrigation input, drought conditions thus rapidly ensue, and great yield loss occurs. To maintain crop growth and production, annual withdrawals of irrigation water in Idaho comprise up to 12% of national withdrawals, which was ranked second only next to California (20%). For growers, irrigation equipment and costs (i.e., water and energy) take a major investment for cereal production in Idaho. Under these circumstances, water resources for irrigation should be utilized more efficiently and effectively. The current project will address this issue with deficit irrigation techniques and wheat cultivar selection. Deficit irrigation means to deliberately impose drought stress on crops, such as irrigating at 75% of recommended crop use rates, or decreasing irrigation frequency. A variety of deficit irrigation techniques have been developed, and have shown the potential to maintain cereal crop yield and quality. The yield maintenance is due to plant acclimation to the water deficit environment. Additionally, wheat yield varies greatly between cultivars under different water regimes. Cultivars that can produce high grain yield under low water supplies are desirable especially in drought-prompt environments. The yield differences between cultivars result from plant characteristics in morphology, growth and development, which are closely related to their environmental adaptation and water requirement. The plant characteristics associated with high grain yield and/or low water requirement can be utilized in wheat breeding in future projects to facilitate field selection. Experimental plots will be set up in the field with different wheat cultivars and deficit irrigation treatments. Soil water content will be monitored continuously for soil water recharge from rainfall and irrigation, crop water uptake, and soil water evaporation. Seasonal rainfall and irrigation will be recorded as water inputs. During the crop growth season, measurements of crop shoot and root performance will be taken on wheat plants of each cultivar and under each irrigation treatment. At final harvest, crops will be harvested for grain yield from each experimental plot. Crop performance during the season and grain yield at harvest will be analyzed statistically. Wheat cultivar(s) that can produce high grain yield under low water supply will be selected. Deficit irrigation treatment(s) that can maintain grain yield will be selected. The selected wheat cultivar(s) and irrigation treatment(s) will be recommended to local growers. Cultivar selection and deficit irrigation practices are expect to decrease the water consumption per unit grain produced, that is, higher grain yield with the same or even lower water supplies. Indirect benefits of such practices also include more efficient use of energy and more sustainable use of agricultural land."

Sustainability of crop production in semi-arid and arid regions of the Western U.S. is threatened by limited water availability, which results in increasing competition from urban development, environmental restrictions, and energy production sector. Altered geographic distribution, intensity, and frequency of extreme climate events (such as heat and drought), and the recently approved water rights will continue to present challenges for agricultural producers in terms of water resource use and socio-economic stability. This phenomenon is compounded by the inefficient use of precious irrigated water due to the lack of solid scientific knowledge and clearly demonstrated methodologies for water and nutrient conservation.Nitrogen fertilizer is the principal (and the most costly) nutrient input, yet its use efficiency is only about 40 -50% in most U.S. agricultural operations. Thus, 50-60% of N fertilizer applied to cropland is not used by the crops and is lost to the environment. Low N use efficiency (pounds of N applied per bushel of crop produced) are resulting from a loss of applied N from the soil - plant system via various pathways including gaseous plant emission, denitrification, leaching, surface runoff and volatilization. An increase of N use efficiency in cereal production, by just 10 %, would translate into savings of about US $5 billion annually and, substantial improvement in environmental quality. Improving N use efficiency in cereal crops is a challenging task that encompasses the ability to accurately estimate a crops need for N and developing nutrient management practices that would provide the best return from fertilizer application.Wheat is an integral crop for Western U.S., where it is grown as a main cash crop or as a vital rotational crop in combination with other high-value crops such as vegetables. There is an urgent need to develop more efficient nutrient management strategies in order to maximize wheat grain yields and enhance grain quality.Advanced crop canopy sensors utilize the optical characteristics of plants and their associated vitality and health properties. The newly emerged hyperspectral remote sensing entails acquiring images in narrow and continuous spectral bands; these sensors are very useful for detection of specific characteristics and differences in vegetation. The recent technologies such as high-resolution multispectral sensors, hyperspectral digital cameras, spectroradiometers, and other optical sensors could play an important role in managing nutrients within the crop production systems. The specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum - i.e. narrow bands - have shown significant improvement in accuracy of discrimination capabilities among various types of plant stresses. Accurate and timely information regarding both water and N status obtained with remote sensors can be of tremendous help for irrigation and fertilization decision making. The proposed study aims to demonstrate that sensor-based technologies, utilized in combination with traditional practices such as soil testing and evapotranspiration (ET) monitoring, can substantially improve the management of N and water use.This study will serve as an initial step in developing robust practical sensor-based water and N management methodology for a variety of key crops grown in semi-arid regions. This project will enable us to identify the most valuable environmental and plant measurements for developing such a methodology. Agronomy Advisory Committee and Fertilizer Tax Advisory Committee are two key stakeholder groups in Idaho and Montana, respectively, advising University research and extension faculty. These two groups, as well as several commodity groups (Idaho Wheat Commission, Idaho Barley Commission, Montana Wheat and Barley Commission) have highly supported this proposed collaborative project. Addressing sustainability of crop production and food security in the context of continuously rising fertilizer costs and water limiting environment has been identified as the primary objective by many of these stakeholder groups.In close collaboration with wheat producers, we choose to conduct the field studies in Southern Idaho (where wheat is grown as a primary rotational component in cropping systems dominated by potatoes, sugar beets and seed crops) and Northwestern Montana (where exceptionally high yield and exceptional quality wheat is a primary cash crop).The project incorporates research and education is focused on: 1) conducting a field study for determining the minimum N and water requirements for optimum wheat grain yield and quality, 2) developing a sensor-based system for identifying - and distinguishing between - N and water stresses, 3) developing an empirical model for predicting wheat grain yield and protein content in varying water x N interactions, 4) developing water and N use recommendations for growers based on the developed model, and 5) deliver extensive educational outreach programs (workshops, field demonstrations, scholarly and educational materials) focused on water and nutrient conservation and utilization of sensor-based technologies.Expected outcomes: 1) developing grower recommendations derived from scientifically sound and robust model based on locally obtained data; and 2) improved grower understanding of how sensor-based methodologies can be successfully utilized for improving the efficiency of water and nutrient use."

In Idaho, 2014 production was estimated at 100 million bushels of wheat and 50 million bushels of barley (Idaho Wheat Commission, Idaho Barley Commission, 2015). Idaho now ranks first in the nation for barley production over the last five years. The malt capacity expansion of Anheuser-Busch, the addition of the Grupo Modelo malt facility in Idaho Falls, and the expansion of the craft brewing industry in Idaho has increased the production demand for quality malt barley. At 39 million bushels annually, Idaho&#39;s malting barley production is the second largest in the nation. Maintenance of this strength requires continual efforts to improve crop quality and productivity. This can only be accomplished by investing in progressive agricultural research programs that keep the industry at the forefront of the development and implementation of new agricultural technologies. Idaho&#39;s climate provides an excellent environment to consistently produce high quality grain. Almost 73% of Idaho&#39;s barley received a USDA/FGIS grade of #1 in 2008 (Olson, 2008). Most grain produced in the rainfed environments of the Intermountain West suffers little from foliar pathogens that impact quality. The development of new overseas markets for high beta-glucan food barley and for malt barley will expand the market options for our growers in rural Idaho. Another opportunity is offered by aquaculture with interest in grain-based fish meal. Because current varieties do not meet preferred characteristics, current production will not fulfill all the needs of these new markets. We must continue to improve small grain varieties for the rainfed environments of the West that reliably produce high quality feed for cattle, swine and fish, and provide the grain needed for growing food and malt markets.In the water-limited environments of Southern and Southeastern Idaho, production of dryland grain is hampered by fungal root rots that invade stress-compromised plants. There is increasing concern about adequate irrigation as we potentially enter another year with short water supplies. Simultaneously, there have been substantial changes in the U.S. grain industries. There is an increasing demand for hard white wheat in the domestic and international markets for bread and noodle products, and for specialty high beta-glucan barley varieties. These crops seem even more sensitive to disease and drought stress than their traditional counterparts. Continued effort is required to develop locally adapted wheat and barley varieties and agronomic practices that maximize productivity and profitability.We face increasing demands on water for irrigated crops, but supplies are limited. In 2015, snow pack estimates for the Snake River Basin above Palisades Reservoir that directly feeds Southeast Idaho indicated moisture content at 90% of average, but other water basins are well below 70%. A call on water by Idaho producers with senior water rights threatened to idle irrigated crop land (Idaho Mountain Express, 2015, http://www.mtexpress.com/news/blaine_county/), and force growers to stop pumping groundwater in Wood River Valley. While year water diversions were averted by record spring rains, such actions may not be avoidable in the future and would have devastating economic impacts on south \east Idaho. Barley, in particular, can be produced with less water than any other field crop grown in the region.A recognized barrier to grain production under dryland conditions is the water and nutrient-robbing fungi that infect stressed root and crown tissue. Currently, breeders do not routinely screen for resistance to the dryland root rot complex, other than indirectly in variety performance trials located throughout the area. Development of a semi-permanent screening nursery at Aberdeen allows testing of varieties carrying resistance to dryland root rot fungi. In this nursery, heavily inoculated plots are dedicated to screening advanced breeder lines and testing new transgenic lines for resistance to fungal root-rotting organisms. This should allow for identification of lines for dryland areas where grains are subject to dry-land foot rot infection, as well as provide a basic understanding of the effectiveness of transgenic and novel genes in grain to resist infection and disease expression.PREVIOUS WORK AND PRESENT OUTLOOK: Previous research at the University of Idaho identified prevalent root pathogens in dryland production areas of southern and southeast Idaho. These included Bipolaris sorokiniana, various Fusarium species, Rhizoctonia solani, and Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Strausbaugh et al., 2004). Dryland root rot, caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana and various Fusarium species, was present in 90% of the tested fields. Utilizing these isolates in trials conducted in growth chambers indicated significant differences in seedling tolerance among named cultivars for both Bipolaris sorokiniana and Fusarium species. Isolates of these fungi also were used in the field to screen several wheat cultivars for potential tolerance or resistance. Smiley et al., 2005, found that Fusarium culmorum and F. pseudograminearum caused the greatest disease severity and plant damage and were the only pathogens in their Oregon studies that reduced grain yield. While both of these pathogens were isolated from infected cereals in Southern and Southeast Idaho, the most frequently isolated species was F. culmorum (Strausbaugh, et al., 2004). Environmental factors play a significant role in determining the relative prevalence of various Fusarium species, as well as in the manifestation of symptoms by infected plants (Strausbaugh, et al., 2004, Smiley and Patterson, 1996, Klaasen et al., 1992, Pettit and Parry, 2001). Dry growing conditions will favor the development of dryland root rots, while humid, moist conditions can result in the development Fusarium head blight (FHB), often caused by the same species of the Fusarium pathogens. In the past in Idaho, there have been few reported instances of FHB infections . However, production of corn grown for cattle silage in Idaho has more than doubled from 1987 to 2014, and corn is another host for Fusarium fungi. With environmentally conducive conditions occurring under irrigation, there have been serious and devastating outbreaks of FHB occurring in spring wheat. Direct seeding of spring cereals in the PNW constitutes about 6% of production acreage (Paulitz, et al., 2002). Cereals under dryland or direct seed production are exposed to greater disease pressure from foot rot fungi. Screening of currently grown cultivars of wheat and barley will allow us to identify those cultivars with tolerance or resistance to dryland foot rot. In addition to reducing yield, Fusarium species produce tricothecenes, mycotoxins involved in pathogenicity (Edwards, et al., 2001). These mycotoxins can have serious detrimental effects on animal and human health (D&#39;Mello et al., 1999). Various labs have produced genetically transformed cultivars of wheat and barley with genes specifically to resist Fusarium infection (tricothecene efflux pumps and acetyltransferases that inactivate tricothecenes), (Okubara, et al., 2002, Dahleen et al. 2000), or that resist general fungal invasion (endochitinaseses, exochitinases, and other thaumatin-like proteins). The effectiveness of these genes in improving root rot resistance needs to be tested in the greenhouse and the field."

For consistent improvement in wheat yield and quality, a continual search for new genes/gene combinations and their introgression into adapted material is required. Also required is an efficient method of transferring and manipulating genes without undesirable carry-over chromatin.About 50% of all higher eukaryotes including important crop plants are polyploids. Unlike in diploids, more than two identical (homologs) or similar (homoeologs) chromosomes are available for meiotic pairing. Regulation of chromosome pairing is the key step in recovering a sexually propagating, diploidized, hence, fertile polyploid species. In the absence of chromosome pairing control, both homologs as well as homoeologs can potentially pair resulting in an irregular pairing and multivalent formation, giving rise to aneuploidy and thus, sterility. In order to recover reproductively stable polyploid a precise chromosome pairing regulatory mechanism is essential. Chromosome pairing regulator genes have been identified in wheat and many other species. Of these the Ph1 of wheat is the most prominent and perhaps the best characterized. This project is focused on characterizing the Ph1 gene, and manipulating it to develop a targeted method of alien introgression.The project will specifically address the following questions: i) how do the chromosome pairing regulator genes operate to distinguish homologs from homoeologs, ii) during which stage of meiosis are these genes active, iii) how do these genes fit into the current model of chromosome pairing and recombination, iv) are these genes functional only in fertile polyploid species or are they universally present, and v) what is the relationship between the gene with similar genes in other polyploids and with similar function genes such as mismatch repair genes. Currently, we do not have clear answers to any of these questions in any eukaryotic species. In addition to the above-mentioned novel information, characterization of the Ph1 gene will have a direct application in alien introgressions.The wild relatives of crop plants possess a wealth of genes useful for crop improvement. Ideally, only one or a few gene transfers are desirable from otherwise agronomically undesirable wild relatives. At present one/few gene transfers from wild relatives can be most efficiently accomplished by crossing-over between the chromosomes of cultivated and alien species. Because of the presence of Ph1-like genes, such crossing-over is restricted. As a result, many undesirable traits are also transferred along with the desirable genes. In wheat, mutants can be used to activate homoeologous chromosome pairing. Difficulty in the gene scoring has been one of the bottle-neck steps for such manipulations. The project outcome about the mode of action of the Ph1 gene may suggest novel approaches for such alien gene transfers in crop plants in general."

This process also includes testing of new protocols to improve functionality. One goal is to identify molecular markers that can take advantage of the polyploidy nature of potato and wheat. New technologies will be evaluated and utilized to increase the functionality of existing and new markers. Molecular markers can be used for many purposes and will be developed with these uses in mind. Markers can aid in the identification of plants with a particular gene of interest, and also identify plants with more than one gene. They also increase our understanding of complex traits. Ideally these applications will lead to better potato and wheat lines for growers."

Harvested barley acreage in Washington State decreased from ~500,000 acres seeded in 2000 to ~81,000 acres seed in 2010. This has been followed by four years of fluctuating harvested barley acreages, from 115,000 in 2011 to 175,000 in 2012, 195,000 in 2013 and 105,000 in 2014 (Small Grains 2014 Summary (September 2014), USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service). Including spring barley in crop rotations has been shown to be beneficial to winter wheat, yet barley acreage remains relatively low when compared to reported acreages from the 1950&#39;s to 2002. Washington ranks 4th among all states in barley production (WASS and USDA-NASS annual Washington Agricultural Statistics). Typically, barley production in Washington involves &gt; 95% spring and &lt; 5% winter types.Spring barley is well established in cropping systems as the preferred rotation crop with wheat, as more annual and three-year crop rotations and reduced tillage seeding systems are being utilized to reduce soil erosion and better utilize water and energy (Cook and Veseth, 1991; Schillinger et al., 1999; Cook, 2000). Plant back restrictions on barley due to grass weed herbicides used on winter wheat have begun to limit the amount of acreage where spring barley can be grown (Newhouse et al., 1992; Lee et al., 2010; Rustgi et al., 2014). For example, when spring barley is grown after a herbicide resistant winter wheat that was sprayed with Imazamox, the plants will germinate, grow to the two to four leaf stage, and then die due to the residual herbicide in the soil. Imazamox resistant spring barley is primarily intended to tolerate the residual herbicide in the soil rather than to be sprayed directly, as grassy weeds are not a major problem in spring cereals in the Palouse. These plant back restrictions have effectively removed the option to grow barley on many acres in the PNW because barley typically follows winter wheat.In addition to Washington being a major producer of feed barley, malting barley is also produced, and there is potential for specialty food type barley production as well. Production analyses indicate the demand for malting barley in the West will continue to increase largely because of the Fusarium head blight (scab) problem in the upper Midwest states (Steffenson, 2003). In 2006 the FDA approved a health benefit endorsement for barley based on its &beta;-glucan content and role in lowering blood cholesterol level in humans (Lazaridou and Biliaderis, 2007). With this endorsement the demand for barley for food will likely rise in domestic as well as export markets, especially Japan. This means that high yielding, especially multi-purpose cultivars that are suitable for malt and feed or food are needed to meet the needs of producers and users and to circumvent the development of numerous cultivars of either feed or malting types, especially for the higher yielding environments. A barley cultivar with yields competitive with the best feed cultivars that is acceptable for malting and brewing (as well as feed) would represent a breakthrough in barley cultivar development. In order to return this traditional malting barley region to maximum production, new varieties that possess premium malting quality, superior nutritional quality, and that are adapted to dryland production conditions must be developed.A better understanding of the factors affecting nutritional quality characteristics of barley is occurring due to increasing intensity of research (Bowman et al., 2000; Baik and Ullrich, 2008). The feed industry more fully realizes and appreciates the variability of feed quality characteristics and the value of barley in feed rations. The food industry, too, realizes the value of barley especially in terms of soluble and insoluble fiber (Lazaridou and Biliaderis, 2007). The opportunity to develop improved barley for feed and food is increasing. Specialty food types such as hulless, waxy, proanthocyanidin-free, and low phytate types are being developed (Bregitzer et al., 2008). Hulless types are somewhat utilized domestically and especially in Canada and eastern Pacific Rim countries. Again, the FDA health benefit endorsement is beginning to have a positive impact.All of the major types of commercial barley (2-row, 6-row; food, feed, and malt; spring and winter types) can successfully be produced in the Pacific Northwest, which provide growers production options and multiple market outlets. However, this situation dilutes breeding programs and spreads resources thin. To deal with this, especially in light of decreasing government funds, the breeders in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho are collaborating to some extent by dividing up the efforts in cultivar development. As a result, the WSU program is concentrating on spring barley while relying on Oregon and Idaho (USDA-ARS) to develop primary germplasm pools for winter barley.For decades, diploid barley has been used as a model experimental organism for plant genetics and physiological studies. The first and best organized comprehensive, high-density genome mapping and genome project--Enhanced Barley Through Genomics (EBTG, a.k.a. USBGP, a.k.a. NABGP, a.k.a. NABGMP; http://barleyworld.org/northamericanbarley.php) - using molecular marker and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses is underway in barley with many milestone results since 1992 (e.g., Kleinhofs, et al., 1993; Hayes, et al., 1993; Tinker et al., 1995; Han et al., 1997a; Marquez-Cedillo et al., 2000, 2001; Ullrich et al., 2004; Schmierer et al., 2004; Hayes and Szucs, 2006; Xu and Jia, 2007, Druka et al., 2008).Other techniques, especially advanced genome wide analyses and molecular breeding tools provide opportunities for the application of biotechnology to barley cultivar development. Since 2006, the multi-disciplinary, multi-state Barley Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP) has made advancements in these areas through gene chip and association mapping technologies (http://barleycap.cfans.umn.edu/, Waugh et al., 2009; Zhong et al., 2009). Much of the barley genetics knowledge base is applicable to other crop plants, especially other cereals that are more complicated genetically, e.g., wheat."

With this knowledge we may be able to modify these pathways to improve traits in crop plants. The second aim of this Hatch proposal includes studies to identify the genetic and biochemical similarities and differences amongst a family of DNA-binding proteins. Uncovering the mechanism of action for each of the family members will play a critical role in evaluating the use of this gene family for improving seed size, crop stand establishment and yield, with a focus on wheat and the oilseed crops camelina and canola. The third aim of this Hatch project focuses on uncovering the biochemical action of the SOFL family of proteins to help us identify potential pathways that can be manipulated to improve agronomic traits in crop plants.

This region covers 1,557,000 cropland hectares and is, by far, the largest contiguous cropping zone in the Western United States. A single family operates most farms and average farm size is 1,800 hectares. Since land was broken out of native grassland and sage in the 1880s, farming has been almost exclusively a tillage-based winter wheat-summer fallow system, where only one crop is grown every two years.Intensive tillage operations during fallow often bury surface crop residue, pulverize soil clods, and reduce surface roughness. Blowing dust from excessively tilled fields leads to major soil loss and reduces air quality. Wind erosion from dryland farms is a major cause of soil loss and degrades off-site urban air quality by small particulate emissions. These soils are dominated by particles &lt;100 um in diameter that are readily suspended and transported long distances during windstorms. Farmers need to convert to minimum and delayed conservation tillage methods using herbicides instead of tillage whenever feasible to reduce wind erosion. No-till fallow is successfully used in many regions of the world, but is not yet widely practiced in the low-precipitation winter wheat-summer fallow zone in the Pacific Northwest because of seed-zone drying during the summer. Wide-spread adoption of conservation-till and no-till fallow would, without question, sharply reduce wind erosion, blowing dust, and air quality problems.The overriding goal of all research conducted under this CRIS is to develop and extend new cropping systems and farming methods that reduce wind erosion and that can be profitably practiced by farmers. The long-term dryland cropping systems experiments (objectives 1, 3, and 6) will provide an in-depth knowledge base for the feasibility of intensive no-till and conservation-till systems with wheat, barley, triticale, canola, pea, and camelina.Removing emergence-impeding dwarfing genes from winter wheat varieties (objective 2) will enhance seedling emergence from deep planting depths in the winter wheat-fallow region of east-central Washington. Development and testing of a commercial-size deep-furrow drill prototype that will pass through and retain residue (objective 4) will reduce, and hopefully eliminate, the last road block (i.e., plugging the drill during planting) that farmers face in the adoption of conservation-till fallow of summer-fallowed soils.The irrigated winter canola planting method experiment (objective 5) will identify environmentally friendly methods for winter canola production in lieu of burning and heavy disking of winter wheat stubble prior to planting.Research on winter triticale agronomy (objective 7) will determine how this crop can compete with winter wheat and the rotation advantages (if any) that it provides.Approximately 80 percent of the research under this CRIS will be conducted in the field and 20% in the laboratory. Research results will be disseminated through local, regional, national, and international meetings, through field tours at research sites, and through popular and scientific journal articles."

We will use a state-of-the-artin situ root imager to study root development in the field as well as develop quantitative approaches to identify traits associated with beneficial root traits to increase yield. In addition, we will use molecular and genetic tools to study how plant roots optimize the uptake of essential nutrients such at phosphate and how they are best able to resist the onslaught of biotic and abiotic stresses they face.

This proposal seeks to establish intellectual know-how for a genomics-driven breeding program for the state of Oklahoma. The main objective is to evaluate the applicability of genomic prediction for crop improvement, using Oklahoma&#39;s dual-purpose, high yielding &#39;Duster x Billings&#39; breeding population as a &#39;test case&#39;. By integrating next-generation sequencing technologies with advanced computational algorithms into existing gene discovery and testing plots in the field, the research objective can be accomplished with specific aims:(1) Apply and implement a proven high-throughout genotyping platform for the &#39;Duster x Billings&#39; population. Illumina based GBS short-read sequencing will be conducted, with which the project will evaluate important factors aiding generation of quality SNP genotypic values, as well as linking the SNP profile of the &#39;Duster x Billings&#39; population with the public wheat polymorphism dataset.(2) Evaluate performance of genomic prediction algorithms for grain yield components; factors to be studied include sequence read depth, marker density, inclusion of QTLs and composition of training populations.This project will compare advanced predictive algorithms, such as kernel-based semi-parametric procedures and non-parametric, artificial neuronal networks, with basic additive linear models, to determine the best model for grain yield components specifically based on prediction accuracy and biological relevance.(3) Access efficiency for adopting genomic prediction by two-generation validation.To realize the actual genetic gain, generation advancement based on genomic prediction and on phenotypic selection will be compared at the same generation. Unlike other cross validation methods, the unique two-generation validation will provide realistic measures of confidence in adopting genomic prediction for crop improvement.The success of this proposal will expand our understanding of the genomic elements resulting in high yielding for crop improvement. Performance assessment of computational algorithms will strengthen the confidence in modern agricultural biotechnology prior to its application. Results of this research could also further aid the calculation of perceived risks, thus encouraging implementation of regulatory and policy actions to ensure ecological benefit and economic return. As the overarching goal of this proposal, we anticipate to establish a genomics-backed, science-based breeding program that translates genomics knowledge into genetic gain in the field, by the close collaboration between research-oriented academia, and the Wheat Improvement Team at OSU together with State-run wheat breeding programs."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial ôrhizobacteriaö, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or ôgapsö, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments. Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics.  Approach: Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems. Hypothesis: Dry bean genotypes interact with tillage management to affect yield performance under drought conditions.  Eight pinto bean genotypes with varying drought tolerance will be tested in a field previously sown to wheat. A split, split block with four replications with irrigation level the main plot, tillage level the split plot, and genotypes the split, split plot will be used. Irrigation will be manipulated to impose a terminal drought stress. Conventional tillage and strip tillage will treatments will both include use of a nonselective herbicide. Variables will include plant biomass, soil compaction, soil moisture, measures of plant stress and various yield components.    Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments.   Hypothesis a) Timing of herbicide application when available soil moisture and likelihood of precipitation is greater impacts weed control in chickpea.  Four herbicides will be tested at three application timings; 4 and 2 weeks prior to seeding chickpea, and post-plant, preemergence. Herbicide treatments will be replicated in a randomized complete block. Soil moisture will be monitored gravimetrically for 4 weeks after each application. Weed control and chickpea tolerance will be determined by taking weed counts and visual control ratings at 3 and 6 weeks after planting (WAP) and crop stand counts at 4 WAP, and chickpea seed yield.  Hypothesis b) Roller-packing impacts performance of pre-emergence herbicides in chickpea in dry soil conditions.  Four herbicide combinations applied post-plant, pre-emergence will be tested in chickpea with and without roller-packing. Experiments will be designed as a split block with herbicide as the main treatment and roller packer as the split treatment and each treatment replicated four times. Half of each plot will be roller-packed immediately after herbicide applications. Weed control and chickpea injury will be evaluated and visually compared to a non-treated check. Analysis of variance will be used to statistically separate treatment effects in all experiments.   Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Hypothesis: Rhizobacteria strains, soilborne pathogens and cultivar class significantly impact biological nitrogen fixation and yields of pea and chickpea genotypes.  The interactions between the root rot pathogen Fusarium solani, commercial rhizobacteria inoculants, and foliar applications of phosphorous acid, on nitrogen fixation and rhizobial colonization of the most popular dry pea cultivars grown in Washington and Idaho will be assessed in field and greenhouse trials. Plants will be evaluated for elemental content, plant height, dry shoot/root weight, root disease severity, nodulation and yield."

Some ingredients are developed in-house and we have both laboratory and pilot scale production capabilities. Digestibility of nutrients from specific ingredients has traditionally been conducted with large fish. The effect of strain and size will be determined. A tank system is available to collect feces both by sedimentation and stripping. The effect of strain and size on protein and amino acid retention will be conducted to determine the need for strain or life stage specific diets. Most trout culture use water from one raceway to another up to 5 times. A 36 tank system located on a commercial farm that receives water from 1st, 3rd, or 5th use will be used to determine the effect of water quality as a stressor on specific mineral and fat soluble vitamins in the tissues. A strain of trout selected  to utilize plant-based diets is available and the effect of the gut microflora communities will be characterized. Fish oil has been the source of the heart/brain healthy fatty acids, EPA/DHA. This source is limited by supply and cost. Variability among trout in a specific strain for their ability to biosynthesize EPA/DHA has been identified. Trout with this trait will be bred to enhance the nutritional quality of the fillet for the benefit of the consumer.  Objective 1: Develop and evaluate new ingredients and ingredient processing methods to increase nutritional and economic value. 1.A: Develop an improved soybean processing method to simultaneously separate protein and oil and remove anti-nutrients. 1.B: Development of alternative methods for the concentration of protein from wheat, barley, and oats.  1.C: Determine the nutritional and economic value of new and modified ingredients.   Objective 2: Determine whether stage specific and strain specific diets are needed by evaluating nutrient digestibility at  Approach: Objective 1: 1.A: An improved aqueous processing method that results in high oil and protein recovery and removal of anti-nutrients will reduce the diarrheic effect of soybeans for trout. Experiments to optimize pretreatment and extraction conditions will be conducted.  1.B: Improved processing methods will increase the nutritional and economic value of protein concentrates from wheat, barley and oats. Trials will be conducted with wheat to optimize starting material and processing conditions to concentrate to 70% protein, and remove the binding effect. This effect of wheat gluten limits inclusion level in extruded feeds. Protein concentrates of barley and oats will be produced using another aqueous fractionation method that features alkaline extraction, centrifugation, and acid precipitation of supernatant.  1.C: A seven phase program will evaluate the nutritional value of alternative ingredients. Complete nutrient and anti-nutrient analysis, fry screening trials, effect on feed intake and extrusion, nutrient digestibility, growth trials, and effect on fecal size will be conducted.   Objective 2: 2.A: Nutrient digestibility is affected by either fish size or strain or both. The ADC’s for major nutrients and amino acids will be determined with four unique strains of trout at three sizes (15, 500, 1500 g, 12 trials).  2.B: Nutrient retention efficiency is affected by fish size or strain or both. The same strains and fish size will be used as in 2.A in 12 week growth studies to evaluate protein and amino acid retention. Four diets varying in protein (40/45%) and lipid (20/25%) will be fed.  Objective 3: 3.A: Improved diets containing elevated levels of stress-affected minerals and fat soluble vitamins will improve performance of rainbow trout raised in serial-reuse water. The effect of water source (1st, 3rd, & 5th use) as a stressor in three strains of rainbow trout on tissue concentrations of fat soluble vitamins and minerals will be determined. 3.B: Specific combinations of ingredients and prebiotics affect intestinal inflammation and the consistency of rainbow trout feces. To improve waste management dietary factors that affect fecal particle size will be determined.   Objective 4: 4.A: Intestinal microflora community structure in rainbow trout is affected by diet and host genotype. Microbial communities will be identified in two strains of trout, one susceptible to soy enteritis and the other resistant.  4.B: Transplantation of microbiota from selected trout fed plant-based feed into non-selected trout will reduce intestinal enteritis when fed plant-based feeds. A cross-over experimental design will be used to determine if different microbial communities can protect a trout from soy induced intestinal enteritis.   Objective 5: The ability to biosynthesize EPA and DHA in muscle tissue of rainbow trout fed diets containing plant oils can be selectively enhanced. To evaluate the potential to increase the ability of trout to biosynthesize EPA and DHA in their muscle, variation among individuals and families of rainbow trout will be determined. Individuals with known performance values for this trait will then be selectively bred."

Each diet will be fed to five replicate ponds. All ponds will be harvested in October/November.  A partial budget analysis based on feed and fish prices will be conducted to determine the economic benefit (if any) of using low-protein alternative diets versus the traditional control diet.   This study will evaluate five 28% protein diets fortified with varoious supplements. Experimental design, diet analyses, procedures for stocking, feeding, pond management, data collection and statistical and economic analysis will be the same as described for Sub-objective 1.A.

Diet, statistical, and economic analysis will be the same as described for Sub-objective 1A.  Growth and disease resistance of juvenile channel catfish will be evaluated in fish fed diets with varying levels of taurine in replicated aquaria.   The proposed study will evaluate effects of no feeding, maintenance feeding, and re-feeding on growth, feed conversion ratio, and processing yield of hybrid catfish. Market-size hybrid catfish (1.5 lb) will be stocked into ponds at the end of May or early June.  The experimental design, procedures for stocking, feeding, pond management, data collection and statistical analysis will be the same as described for Sub-objective 1.A.    This study will compare production of hybrid fry fed immediately at stocking in 0.4 ha ponds with that of fry not fed until 6 weeks after stocking.     Four ponds will be stocked with channel catfish (600 fish/pond) and redear sunfish (10 fish/pond); four ponds will be stocked with redear sunfish only (10 fish/pond); four ponds will be stocked with catfish only (600 fish/pond). The study will be repeated yearly with the same stocking rates but with varying fish size. Catfish will be fed and managed according to standard industry practices and cultured through one production season.  Each treatment will consist of 4 replicate ponds to evaluate using hay, planted wheat, or rice as substrates to increase freshwater prawn production. Ponds with no substrate addition will served as controls. Ponds will be stocked with 10,000 prawn/ac.  All ponds will be fed range cubes. Prawns will be harvested in the fall.

Develop adaptive management practices and document their benefits to optimize yield and enhance ecosystem services for CGPR dryland agricultural systems most vulnerable to adverse changes in climate. 2. Extend the applicability of adaptive management practices across the CGPR using the development and evaluation of site-specific technologies and process modeling for field scales. 3. Develop and evaluate practices for remediation/restoration of degraded soils in the CGPR.  Approach: There are 27 million acres of cultivated dryland in the Central Great Plains region (CGPR). The primary limitation for cropping in the CGPR is a variable drought dominated climate. Despite system improvements toward more intensive cropping, 58% of the regionÆs dryland is still winter wheat-summer fallow (WF). Unfortunately, WF is not economically /environmentally sustainable. Our objective is to develop sustainable dryland systems for the CGPR. A central research theme is adapting the regionÆs cropping systems to the ever-changing semi-arid climate. The unit works to achieve that objective using a long-term ôcore experiment,ö the Alternative Crop Rotation (ACR) study. This field study compares 23 rotations for their economic,agronomic, and drought-mitigating effects and their effects on soil quality. In support of the core experiment, several satellite experiments evaluate the agronomic and economic potential of alternative crop species; quantify crop water use; evaluate changes in soil quality; develop management for remediating degraded soils; and evaluate nutrient use efficiency in these systems. The combined efforts of the ôcoreö and ôsatelliteö experiments will result in sustainable, climate-adaptive cropping systems for the region and will provide a quantitative knowledge of production limitations of the CGPR to climate change. Introducing biological and market diversity with broadleaf bio-diesel/oilseeds will reduce pest pressures inherent to the current grass-dominated rotations. Economic savings from improved cropping systems, reductions in agri-chemical use, and reductions in soil loss resulting from this research are estimated at $6-$35 per acre annually. Assuming 25% adoption of this technology will result in annual regional savings of $40 -$236 million."

The work will be conducted as the Midwest USDA Climate Change Hub and will be coordinated with NRCS, FS, and other USDA and non-USDA organizations in accordance with guidance found in the USDA Climate Change Hubs Charter, and Terms of Reference.  Approach: Studies across the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in this project will develop new methods for quantifying emission and dispersion (particulates, NH3, VOCÆs) from animal and cropping systems, improve methods for measuring different compounds in the air to provide increased quantitative capability to measure impacts of CAFOÆs on air quality, determine greenhouse gas emissions (N2O, CH4, CO2) from cropping systems, and quantify effects of changing climate on water, light, and nitrogen use by crops. The initial development of a lidar-based approach to measure plume dynamics from animal facilities will be evaluated to produce a remote-sensing approach that will be used to guide sampling methods that use point-based samplers. These data will be collected over a range of facilities and throughout the day to capture the range of atmospheric stability conditions. Air sampling methods for volatile organic compounds will be accomplished with a range of methods from sorbent tubes and canisters. These will also be coupled with methods to measure the volatile organic compounds attached to particulates. These observations will be collected in different livestock facilities. Greenhouse gas emissions will be quantified using soil chambers for a range of soil management and nitrogen management studies to quantify the emissions throughout a year. Measures of water, nitrogen,carbon accumulation, and light use efficiency will use an integrated approach that blends micrometeorological with physiological measurements. These experiments will be conducted using field-scale environments and will integrate all efficiency factors into a combined assessment. The energy balance approach used in these studies blends the fast response of CO2 and H2O vapor signals with sonic anemometers, net radiation components, soil heat flux, and surface temperature along with remote sensing to obtain growth characteristics of the crop. Studies will be conducted in the rhizotron to assess the impact of rapidly induced temperature changes on crop physiological responses under a range of soil water conditions. Accomplishing these three objectives will result in the development of agricultural practices and mitigation strategies that reduce environmental impact, while maintaining or increasing productivity. Mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions will balance agricultural production efficiency and increased carbon capture and nitrogen use efficiency. Climate change and its impact on cropping systems raise additional concerns regarding resilience of current production practices and plant adaption to those changes. Methods are needed to quantify plant-climate interaction to link field observations with simulation models for corn, soybean, wheat, and native prairie systems. Developing a long-term program to quantify plant response to climate anomalies will also establish a database for developing more resilient crop production systems. This research will enhance scientific knowledge and provide information for producers and policymakers to maintain the viability of agricultural systems."

As part of the LTAR network, and in concert with similar long-term, land-based research infrastructure in Inland Pacific Northwest, use the R.J. Cook Agronomy Farm LTAP (CAF) to improve the observational capabilities and data accessibility of the LTAR network, to support research to sustain or enhance agricultural production and environmental quality in agroecosystems characteristic of the Inland Pacific Northwest, as per the LTAR site responsibilities and other information outlined in the 2012 USDA Long-LTAR Network Request for Information (RFI) to which the location successfully responded, and the LTAR Shared Research Strategy, a living document that serves as a roadmap for LTAR implementation. Participation in the LTAR network includes research and data management in support of the ARS GRACEnet and/or Livestock GRACEnet projects.  Approach: 1a. Sediment and PM10/PM2.5 flux, will be evaluated as a function of soil water content/matric potential & crust type/cover/thickness for five major soil types using a portable wind tunnel. Crust type & morphology will be ascertained by microscopy & PLFA & FAME analyses.  1b. Soil aggregate properties will be assessed under a range of crop & tillage systems being examined to control wind-blown dust. Soil aggregate size classes from different crop & tillage systems will be analyzed to identify microbial community composition (PLFA & FAME analyses), active SOM, C source & crushing strength. 1c. Long-term cropping system studies at Lind, Pullman, & Ritzville will be used to assess impacts on soil quality over time including bulk density, soil pH, electrical conductivity, organic C & N, aggregate size distribution, N movement & soil microbial constituents. 2a. Ongoing research will fingerprint soils & PM10 material from across the PNW using FAME. 2b. Bacteria & fungi containing natural markers will also be evaluated as tracers that can be retrieved from soils due to their unique traits of antibiotic resistance or strain-specific molecular markers to determine point source soil movement. 2c. The FAME & bacterial tracer studies will be used to aid corroboration of the Columbia Plateau regional dust transport model by: (1) determining if modeled emissions are from given fields or grid areas; & (2) characterizing the mode of transport from given regions. 3a. Studies are part of GRACEnet (Greenhouse Gas Reduction through C sequestration & Carbon Enhancement Network) & REAP (Renewable Energy Assessment Project), established to assess management impacts on greenhouse gas emissions & soil C status. We will assess tillage & crop rotation affects on soil C storage across variable soil & terrain attributes of the WSU Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF). 3b. Two studies will assess management & environmental effects on soil C and N cycling & GHG emissions. The first study (CAF) was previously described in sub-objective 3a. The second study was established in 2001 at the USDA Palouse Conservation Field Station & consists of five different farming systems including no-till, perennial biofuels, organic, & native perennials. These two field studies will be used to assess soil gas (CO2, N2O) flux, N mineralization-immobilization-turnover & soil C accumulation. 4a.

A. Identify sources of variation in viscometry-based methodologies (e.g., falling number) that are used to indicate starch soundness, then develop and test alternative procedures to reduce precision error. B. Develop a near-infrared spectroscopy model, or alternatively a Raman spectroscopy model, for ascertaining mixture levels of conventional and waxy hexaploid wheat. 2: Enable new, real-time rapid optical methods to measure defects and vitreousness in commercial wheat kernels. A. Develop hyperspectral imaging procedures for identification of wheat kernels damaged by scab (Fusarium head blight), black point, heat, and frost, as defined by official inspection criteria. B. Develop imaging system for assessing the percentage of vitreous kernels in durum and hard red spring wheat.  Approach: Determine the underlying precision of the falling number procedure under ideal conditions, that is, the test when run with samples for which sampling error has been minimized. Samples of soft white wheat and three samples of club wheat that are representative pre-harvest sprouting will be evaluated. Within each subclass, the three samples are designed to be representative of low ( 375 s) falling number. All thermal conditions of the falling number instrument within a test day will be held constant as practicable, including the starting temperature of the meal-water mixture, the temperature of the instrument’s bath, the volume of water within the bath, and the mass and volume of the meal-water test sample. In addition to the runs that are based on the conventional amount of meal and water (treatment A: 7 g + 25 mL), three alternate preparations will be examined. Treatment (A, B, C, D) and wheat class or subclass (SWW, Club) will be specified as fixed factors. Samples within wheat class, grind, and portions will be specified as random factors. Minimum-width 95% confidence intervals for the variance estimates will be calculated as wil best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) obtained from the mixed model provide estimates of FN averages for each treatment and wheat class sample. Once the precision of the FN method under standard and modified conditions has been established, the research will proceed in two tacks. First, the issue of sampling error will be addressed. Sampling will occur at typical transfer points, such as the truck dump bin at the country elevator, railcar fill sites, and the entry point to the mill. Second, if under standard operation the procedure produces coefficients of variation greater than 3%, modifications to the mixing and heating stage will be explored in an attempt to reduce air bubble entrainment, with rheological measurements (conducted in parallel) performed using a rheometer under constant shear and heating rate conditions.  NIR calibrations for mixture levels of conventional and waxy wheat will be developed with accuracies < 5%. Both Linear and non-linear quantitative modeling will be performed on both whole kernel and ground meal binary mixtures.  In hyperspectral imaging research of wheat kernels for damage or vitreousness, PCA will be examined to identify the wavelengths at local minima and maxima which inherently possess the greatest contrast. The 10 most sensitive wavelengths will be examined in paired combinations exhaustively (45 trials) using reflectance ratios. Linear discriminant analysis will be used to identify the wavelength pair whose image band ratio produces the greatest percentage of correctly classified kernels, and so on for the next pair. Three regions of interest (ROI) on the kernel, namely the endosperm, germ, and entire kernel, will be separately examined. With each ROI, image processing will be done at the pixel level, whereby subregions of damage in the ROI are first identified; then, depending on the size of the subregion, a decision will be made on whether to categorize the ROI and/or the kernel as normal or damaged."

Sub-objective 1A: Extend our understanding of the role(s) of kernel hardness and puroindoline genes in wheat grain quality and utilization.    Sub-objective 1B: Extend our understanding of the role(s) of starch composition and waxy genes on wheat grain quality and utilization.  Objective 2: Increase the value and global competiveness of U.S. commercial wheat by enabling new technologies and methods to accurately assess end-use functionality; and to manipulate wheat fiber and antioxidant components to improve grain and flour quality.   Sub-objective 2A: Develop a model system for identifying putative grain flavor loci/genes in wheat.   Sub-objective 2B: Manipulate grain arabinoxylan content to improve flour quality, nutrition and utilization.   Objective 3: Congressionally designated as a direct mission of service, and non-hypothesis driven, the USDA-ARS Western Wheat Quality Laboratory will identify, evaluate, and screen the intrinsic end-use quality to enhance cultivar development.  Approach: Objective 1A: Puroindoline a, b, and Grain softness protein-1 genes are amplified from genomic DNA via PCR and sequenced, followed by alignments and phylogenetic analyses. Aegilops tauschii accessions are obtained from germplasm banks. Unique haplotypes are identified in synthetic hexaploid wheats and evaluated for kernel texture. Soft durum lines derived from Soft Svevo will be increased and receive complete milling and baking analyses. Kernel texture variation in the RIL population derived from Butte 86 x ND2603 will be mapped. Kernel texture variation referred to as “Super-Soft” will be mapped using an Alpowa Super-Soft derivative. RILs will be developed using single seed descent. Contingencies: Marker density will need to be sufficient to detect linkage disequilibrium. If a particular chromosome or arm has low polymorphsism, then additional markers will be added. Objective 1B: Full waxy and partial waxy lines will be developed in Stephens, Xerpha, and MDM varieties. Waxy progeny are identified with I2/KI. Partial waxy lines are identified using PCR markers. NILs will be developed in a BC7F2 population using marker assisted selection. The 4A-null lines will be evaluated for Japanese Udon noodle. Full waxy lines will be evaluated in twin barrel extrusion.  Objective 2a: A system that uses a common check variety will be developed. Hollis (yummy) and ID703 (yucky) were used to make a DH mapping population. DH line vs. check t-values will be used as the phenotypes for mapping. Mapping will be employed to identify candidate genes/QTLs for consumption preference. Contingencies: Different ‘check’ varieties may be needed depending on the relative preference/avoidance. If the QTLs from one check variety do not fully agree with the QTLs from the second check variety, then a third intermediate preference variety will be evaluated. If LOD scores are not sufficiently large, then a sub-set of lines with contrasting consumption preference will be evaluated with a larger number of mice.  Objective 2b: Yumai 34 and Alpowa have high arabinoxylan (AX) content, whereas Louise has low levels. DH populations from Yumai 34 x Louise, Yumai 34 x Alpowa, and Alpowa x Yumai 34 were produced. These populations will be milled and baked, and evaluated by Solvent Retention Profiles and Bostwick viscosity. Total AX, water extractable AX (WE-AX), and arabinose to xylose ratio will be analyzed via GC-FID. All the DH lines will be genotyped with markers. Lines with contrasting high and low AX contents, high and low ratios of WE-AX vs. water unextractable, and high and low ratios of arabinose substitution will be identified. These traits will be compared with end-use quality phenotypes and will be analyzed via molecular markers. Contingencies: We will identify the ‘best’ choices for full AX analyses based on contrasting end-use quality traits. If there is not a ‘consensus’ among traits, then contrasting phenotypes will be selected for individual traits.   Objective 3: Testing and evaluation of experimental wheat breeding germplasm follows standard testing protocols, including Approved Methods of AACCI and AOAC. Tests include grain, milling, flour and end-products tests."

Enable new commercial sensor-in-system flowing-grain microwave moisture and density meters for precision farming and yield monitoring.   2. Enable a portable, commercial microwave meter to create capacity for rapid grading in-shell almond and peanut by determining moisture content, meat content, and foreign material contents.  3. Enable new commercial microwave sensors for monitoring controlled drying of grain, peanuts and other seeds.  Approach: I:  To enable a new commercial sensor for flowing grain microwave moisture and density, dielectric-based algorithms for bulk density and moisture content determination at microwave frequencies will be tested in flowing situations. In designing a flowing-grain system, the frequency must be higher than 3 GHz, free-space transmission techniques will be used for on-line applications, and measurements will be performed in the near field to keep the system compact. At least three cultivars each of wheat, corn, and soybeans will be obtained from certified seed with some geographic and seasonal diversity. Moisture, density, and temperature will be varied for model development and then validated on flowing grain.  Next, a prototype sensor made with off-the-shelf components will be assembled and tested. Then a user-friendly, step-by-step software programs will be developed to control the measurements with moisture predictions within 0.2% to 0.5%, and bulk density will be within less than 2% relative error.  II:  The above system will next be developed for rapid grading of in-shell almond and peanut by determining moisture content, meat content, and foreign material contents. First dielectric properties data will be collected with laboratory grade instrumentation on un-cleaned and cleaned in-shell almonds and peanuts of different varieties and from different locations and compared to oven-drying moisture and meat content.  Measurements will also be collected on almond and peanut kernels alone.  The data will comprise of dielectric properties corresponding to frequency, temperature, moisture content, bulk density, meat content, and foreign material content. The next step is to develop a microwave prototype for moisture content, meat content, and foreign material content in in-shell almonds and peanuts which will be externally controlled with a laptop computer and ultimately packaged to satisfy grading requirements and withstand working conditions at buying stations.    III: The last approach is to use the microwave moisture sensors developed above to monitor and record moisture content of grain, peanuts and other seeds in real-time during drying while improving efficiency through control of drying and minimizing energy consumption when compared to existing drying controls.  To accomplish this, a microwave moisture meter will be combined with three temperature sensors and a relative humidity sensor to monitor peanut drying in a quarter scale-model drying wagon to optimize the drying process by determining real time in-shell kernel moisture content in different zones of the trailer.  Similar work will be performed with cereal grains and oilseeds stored and dried in large, farm storage bins. Varying temperature and moisture profiles will be evaluated during the drying process. Through feedback control, the system will optimize the drying process to better ensure even drying throughout the trailer (for peanuts) and bin (for grains). Once successful, the microwave moisture meter(s) will then be integrated with all other sensors in one single unit including a microcontroller, an LCD, and mass storage device."

Sub-Objectives: 3.A. Identify and evaluate processing and intrinsic end-use quality traits of experimental hard spring and durum wheat lines. 3.B. Evaluate quality traits of experimental oat lines.  Approach: The Hard Red Spring and Durum Wheat Quality Laboratory will evaluate processing and end-use quality traits of breeders’ experimental lines of wheat relative to physical and biochemical attributes and genetic and environmental influences.  This research is important to identify wheat lines that are of superior milling, baking, and processing quality before they are considered for commercial release.  Ultimately, the value of this research lies in its potential to enhance international trade of U.S. wheat and reduce competition for overseas markets.  Quality evaluation also will be performed for oat lines to increase market value of U.S. oats.   Recently, demand for whole-wheat-based foods has been increasing due to well-known beneficial health effects.  However, poor end-use quality of whole wheat flour is acknowledged as a problem in the baking industry. Research will be conducted to develop laboratory methods to evaluate whole wheat milling and bread-making quality, and will contribute to the rapid assessment of whole wheat bread-making quality. Research will be conducted to evaluate variation in proteins, arabinoxylans, phenolics, and antioxidant potential in hard spring wheat lines and to develop methods to rapidly predict these components.  The role of these components in dough and bread-making properties will also be investigated.  This research is important since these components are present in whole grains, mainly in the bran.  The benefits of this research will be in the production of wheat germplasm that contains high levels of healthy components, as well as improved end-use quality for the production of whole wheat-based products."

Sub-objective 2B: Coordinate and conduct essential hard winter wheat projects of national importance, such as Wheat Quality Council (WQC), Regional Performance Nursery (RPN) and Hard Winter Wheat Crop Quality Survey (HWWCQS) for improvement of U.S wheat quality.  Approach: Cereal grains are the foundation of nutrition worldwide with the United States being a perennial leader in hard winter wheat (HWW) production and quality. Thus, domestic and international customers come to expect high quality wheat from the Great Plains. That said, there continues to be a fierce international competition for the global HWW market.  U.S. wheat breeders, researchers, quality laboratories and producers are under continuous demands to deliver quality HWW just to hold a competitive edge in both domestic and international markets. Genetic and environmental variability are critical factors that affect HWW grain composition (starch and protein) and end-product quality (pre-harvest sprouting).  To meet these challenges this project is composed of a multidisciplinary team that set objectives to determine the effect of HWW protein and starch in response to critical abiotic stress events. The project plan will also include the congressionally-mandated activities of the USDA Hard Winter Wheat Quality Laboratory (HWWQL). Due to recent reductions in funding, this Congressionally mandated laboratory utilizes in excess of 83% of the resources’ dedicated to this project.  The HWWQL provides critical end-use quality data to the HWW growing region, and conducts three annual evaluation projects that include the Wheat Quality Council Evaluations, Regional Performance Nursery Program, and Hard Winter Wheat Crop Quality Survey.  The data from these projects assist breeders, producers, millers, bakers, and other key industry components, in making pivotal decisions regarding breeding, agronomics, processing and marketing of experimental and commercial wheat varieties, as well as vital information regarding the environmental impact on established wheat cultivars."

Changing climates are expected to produce extreme  Approach: United States farmers grow over 77 million metric tons of corn, wheat, soybeans, and other grains, worth over $115 billion annually, to supply the nation and the world with food, animal feed, and biofuels. Our goal is to improve U.S. grain quality and international competitiveness through the application of engineering principles to rapidly measure grain traits, and to maintain grain quality during storage. We propose to develop instruments to rapidly measure quality traits for inspection at the first point of grain delivery, for breeders when selecting traits for new lines, and for processors prior to grain buying or processing. We also propose to develop chemical-free technology to control insects and maintain quality during handling and storage. This research will lead to higher profits for the agriculture sector, higher-quality foods reaching consumers, and more food available for a growing world population."

World population is predicted to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050. Wheat demand is expected to increase also due to a shift from rice to wheat consumption due to an expected increase in wealth around the globe. The increased wheat demand will have to be met under less land area and changing climate. Water use efficiency and increase in wheat yields will be important factors in meeting this demand. The proposed technology is poised to increase wheat yield under abiotic stress conditions. All of these benefits are expected to have a major positive impact on humanity.  The wheat seed business is currently valued at up to $8.3 billion. The proposed technology will provide a competitive advantage to capture a significant market share of the wheat seed industry while contributing positively towards food security during the changing climate.This SBIR phase II project proposes to further develop and test alternative dwarfing genes to improve wheat yield and abiotic stress tolerance around the globe. Responsible for the  green-revolution,  dwarfing genes are required to obtain higher yields, but the two dwarfing genes present in more than 90% of the currently grown wheat varieties have serious ill-effects including abiotic stress sensitivity, reduced root length and biomass, seedling emergence, and vigor. During the Phase I research, four new dwarfing genes were identified and shown to be significantly better than the currently used genes. Phase II will focus on the comparison of the new genes with the old genes to show their true benefits. This research also will generate valuable data required for the development of  release-ready  varieties.  Genetic background effects will be studied by transferring one of the new dwarfing genes into two different backgrounds followed by field and controlled condition evaluation. Future competitive advantage will be maintained by pyramiding the new dwarfing genes with complementary gene action. Closely linked DNA markers will be developed for an efficient transfer of the technology into diverse backgrounds."

The relationship between these two very different types of organisms is called symbiotic because both partners benefit from the association. The plant converts sunlight and carbon dioxide into sugars and other organic compounds that are supplied to the microbes in the roots. The microbes provide phosphate and nitrogen to the plant in forms that the plant can readily ingest. These symbiotic associations permit the growth of some crops without added fertilizer. For example, plants are unable to convert gaseous nitrogen in the atmosphere into a reduced form that can be incorporated into the proteins, vitamins and other critical biomolecules that allow them to germinate, develop and grow. Certain crops, such as the legumes (e.g., beans, peas and alfalfa) harbor nitrogen-converting bacteria within specialized structures in their roots that provide this reduced nitrogen to the plant. Most crops do not have these bacteria and must rely on the application of nitrogen fertilizer for optimal growth. This project seeks to obtain a molecular understanding of this symbiotic association between plant and microbes, with a long-term goal of enabling such an association in non-leguminous crops like corn and wheat, which currently require extensive fertilization to sustain crop yield.  A broader impact of this project is a summer Plant Proteomics Workshop, which provides training in proteomic and genomic profiling to the entire plant research community.Part 2: Technical abstractThis project seeks to profile the early molecular events in the recognition of and response to symbiotic microbes (nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) by the model legume crop, Medicago truncatula and the model monocot, rice. This approach will enable a comparison at the molecular level of the mechanisms by which these two crop groups recognize their beneficial microbes. The analysis of the shared and distinct chemical and genetic factors in these two systems should provide tools and information to enable the engineering of beneficial associations between cereal crops (e.g., rice, corn, wheat) and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. The specific aims are (1) the identification of host proteins modified by phosphorylation, acetylation or ubiquitinylation in first hour following signal reception, and validation of potentially active candidates from this and from the previous project award period, (2) the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic responses into networks that can be compared in the two species, using informatics and computational modeling, and (3) a high-throughput screen for symbiosis factors using a newly developed chemical genomics chip system.

The looming threats to food security demand transformative innovations in agriculture that will drive the second green revolution. Maize is the most economically important crop in the U.S providing food, feed and bioenergy to the global economy. It is also one of the most photosynthetically productive plants on the planet. This productivity is driven by biochemical and anatomical adaptations associated with C4 photosynthesis. One proposed grand challenge is to introduce C4 traits into C3 crops such as rice and many temperate grasses. A major conceptual breakthrough in the understanding of the development of C4 photosynthesis was realized through the discovery that a root endodermal cell fate module was co-opted to drive a leaf specific cellular differentiation program. Importantly, a prediction from this model suggests that a limited number of changes in genes could lead to a major reprogramming of leaf cell fates.  This project will test this prediction and expand on our understanding of the gene regulatory networks that drive both biochemical and anatomical innovations associated with C4 photosynthesis. The results of these studies will not only provide candidate genes for engineering C4 traits into C3 crops, but also provide novel targets for improvement of existing C4 crops such as maize, sugarcane and sorghum. With regard to training and outreach, the project will continue to expand on the MutantMillets outreach program at the DDPSC. MutantMillets provides teaching modules and teaching resources with hands-on activities in the plant sciences to engage high school students in the St. Louis metropolitan region. Importantly, all resources developed through this program will be portable to other school systems through the project website and through the educational networks established by the Education and Outreach Center at the DDPSC. Grasses that utilize C4 photosynthesis include maize, sorghum, sugarcane and Miscanthus.  C4 grasses use two distinct cell types to create a CO2 pump that elevates the levels of CO2 in the vicinity of the enzyme Rubisco, effectively eliminating wasteful photorespiration. Under hot, dry conditions C4 systems display significantly increased productivity relative to C3 crops such as rice and wheat. This project aims to identify the foundational genetic and regulatory networks that control the differentiation of the two photosynthetic cell types in maize - the bundle sheath (BS) and mesophyll (M). This work expands on recent discoveries that has linked the SHR/SCR/IDD regulatory module to the differentiation of the BS and M cells of maize and provides new opportunities to more fully explore the function of this regulatory network in C4 grasses through an integrated systems biology approach. These studies will include the development and implementation of several emerging technologies including cell-type specific proteomics, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technologies, robotics-based yeast one hybrid screens, ChIP-seq, translatomics, X-ray computed tomography, novel informatics/network analysis algorithms, and modeling of both developmental phenotypes and mechanistic regulatory networks. All data and resources generated in this project will be made accessible to the public through the project website and through long-term repositories."

The global population is expected to increase to over 9 billion and food demand will grow by more than 50%.  Currently, there are 2 billion people worldwide living in poverty, mostly relying on subsistence agriculture in developing countries.  While poverty and food insecurity is a complex issue, the development of improved climate-resilient, high yielding and nutritious plant varieties is a critical part of improving food security, increasing income and economic welfare.  To address this challenge, innovative approaches are needed to speed up the development of improved plant varieties.  In plant breeding and genetics, precise measurements of plant characteristics are needed to accurately determine the effect of important genes and to identify and select the most promising candidate plant varieties.  There has been limited technology development in this area, particularly for traits measured in field trials where most measurements are still taken and recorded by hand.  This project will develop mobile applications (apps) for measuring plant traits that can be deployed on inexpensive and readily available mobile devices.  Initial testing and deployment through collaboration with cassava and wheat breeders will enable rapid dissemination and broad usability.  Middle-school and high-school students will also be engaged to test and use the apps to explore plant growth and measure plant traits.  Equipping thousands of plant breeders around the world with tools for rapid measurement and analysis of important plant traits will provide the foundation for accelerated development of improved plant varieties that will ultimately result in increased productivity, food security, nutrition and income of smallholder farmers and their families in developing countries. Over the past decade, the availability of genomic data has exploded while the methods to collect phenotypes have made minimal advancements.  This has led to a dramatic imbalance in data sets connecting genotype to phenotype and highlights phenotyping as the remaining major bottleneck in plant breeding programs.  This project will advance the field of 3D graphics and modeling, data mining and deep learning through integration of simultaneous ground truth phenotypic measurements and imaging with mobile technology.  Building on the success of Field Book (www.wheatgenetics.org/field-book), user-friendly mobile apps for field-based high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) will be developed and deployed.  This project will converge novel advances in image processing and machine vision to deliver mobile apps through established breeder networks.  Novel image analysis algorithms will be developed to model and extract plant phenotypes.  A robust development pipeline will be assisted by 1) real-time field testing through breeding collaborators around the world and 2) middle-school and high-school students using the apps to explore plant growth and quantitative differences under genetic control.  To ensure both immediate, broad deployment and functionality on a diverse set of crops, breeder networks for cassava and wheat will be engaged, providing a diverse set of target plant phenotypes, environments, breeding programs and working cultures. By combining data from research programs with ground truth breeder knowledge, this project will lay the foundation for collecting training sets that can subsequently be used to extract and quantify complex phenotypes using deep learning. Open-source apps for smartphones and tablets will consist of both software and documentation so that users will be able to understand how to use the apps. Apps will be distributed through online app stores (Windows Store, iTunes App Store, Google Play), through project websites, and via collaborative plant breeding networks. The resulting source code will be hosted in a public GitHub repository with a GNU General Public License (GPL) open-source license."

A promising route to renewable liquid fuels is the conversion of various biomass sources by microbial organisms. The goal for this project is to develop a basic understanding of the genes that control biomass accumulation. This will enable our long-term goal of producing ecologically and economically sustainable sources of feedstocks for biofuels. The research specifically addresses the genes that regulate a key aspect of plant growth, which is the creation of cell walls. In specific cells the walls are very thick and it is these that account for the bulk of all plant biomass. Grasses include many of our most important food and forage crops including maize, wheat, rice, ryegrass, and tall fescue. Despite the importance of the plant cell wall for plant growth, our knowledge of the precise regulatory mechanisms that give rise to the coordinated synthesis of the wall polymers is limited. This is especially true of grasses. This project will provide interdisciplinary training in development, genetics, genomics, and biochemistry for at least two University of Massachusetts graduate students and facilitate an internship program with the National Technical Institute for the Deaf.This proposal aims at understanding the transcription networks that regulate secondary cell wall biosynthesis in grasses. The cell wall is a complex composite of polysaccharides, proteins, and lignin. Much of what is currently understood about the transcriptional regulation of cell wall biosynthesis is from the study of Arabidopsis thaliana xylem vessels and fibers, yet this understanding may not be generalizable across land plants. The cell walls of grasses, including domesticated cereals that provide the majority of human calories and the perennials under development as biofuel energy crops, differ significantly in morphology and composition from the eudicot A. thaliana. The research will explore the function of three Brachypodium distachyon transcription factors: GRASS NAC REPRESSOR OF FLOWERING (GNRF), WALL REGULATOR INTERACTING bHLH (WRIB), KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX OF BRACHYPODIUM DISTACHYON7 (KNOB7). The researchers hypothesize that these proteins regulate wall biosynthesis through protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that make-up a system of feed forward and negative feedback loops that are influenced by external cues.  Transcription factors will be characterized by using methods such as chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine the gene promoter targets of the proteins and the effect of binding on cell wall biosynthesis. Protein-protein interactions will be evaluated using co-immunoprecipitation. A possible role for photo and thermocycles in the function of cell wall regulation will be tested by measuring function under varying time course conditions in plants of different mutant backgrounds."

However, their lengthy reaction steps and complex regulation limit yield and production rate of a variety of bioproducts. The objective of this proposal is to apply metabolic engineering techniques to implement a pathway for the direct conversion of sugars into intermediates of the citric acid cycle.  This will improve the carbon yield of a variety of products and improve their manufacturing processes.With higher theoretical carbon yield and shorter reaction routes than the conventional glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways, this new non-phosphorylative metabolism has the potential for efficient biosynthesis of citric acid cycle derivatives. Although this pathway has been known for more than fifty years, the relevant enzymes remain largely unknown and uncharacterized.  To enable the implementation of nonphosphorylative metabolism as a general biosynthetic platform, three specific aims will be pursued: (i) discover and evolve new gene clusters for nonphosphorylative metabolism; (ii) explore biosynthetic applications of non-phosphorylative metabolism; and (iii) co-utilize lignocellulosic feedstocks for biosynthesis. The successful realization of this project is expected to result in the fundamental understanding of a novel catabolic pathway which promises to be more efficient in many practical applications. In addition, this project will enable the processing of non-food agricultural byproducts, such as corn stover, wheat straw and citrus peel, into high-value products. The proposed new pathway will enhance the economic viability of cellulosic biorefineries which would be of significant social, environmental, and economic value.This award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Danelle Seymour is  Exploring the causes and consequences of rapid transposon evolution in grass genomes  The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California, Irvine and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Brandon Gaut.The most economically important crop species, including rice, maize, wheat, and barley are members of the grass family. The genomes of these species are extremely variable in size, and this is largely the result of rapid proliferation of mobile genetic elements, or transposons. While the genomic distribution of transposons in each species has been reported, the evolutionary forces that shape rapid, global changes in their distributions are unknown. This project aims to characterize the evolutionary forces that drive large changes in genome structure in eight grass species and whether such changes also have functional consequences. This project will provide the fellow with an evolutionary perspective important for connecting basic genomics research to plant phenotype, as well as the opportunity to provide long-term mentoring to undergraduates interested in genomics research.Transposons are insertional mutagens and host genomes have evolved mechanisms to mitigate their spread. Transposon silencing can reduce transcription of flanking endogenous genes, but the duration of these changes is unclear due to the rapid evolution of inserted sequences. Exploring the interplay between these two forces, transposon proliferation and host silencing of transposition, is central to understanding how plant genomes evolve. This research aims to characterize the extent that transposon proliferation impacts the evolution of host genomes and ultimately the host phenotype using a comparative phylogenetic approach focusing on eight grass species. First, a unified framework for transposon identification and annotation in all eight species will be developed which will serve as an important community resource. Next, this resource will be used to characterize the role of transposons in the evolution of gene expression. Using a phylogenetic approach, it is possible to characterize the duration of transposon-induced phenotypic changes, in this case gene expression, and the extent that such changes shape the evolution of gene expression networks in this important plant family."

M. oryzae is also emerging as a major pathogen of wheat. During rice infection, dome-shaped fungal cells called appressoria form on the surface of the rice leaf and access the underlying epidermal cells. Remarkably, fungal growth in living rice cells, called biotrophy, occurs for the first days of infection without activating the robust plant defenses that normally work to keep the host plant disease-free. Yet, despite the fundamental importance of this biotrophic growth stage to crop health, little is known about how plant defense suppression and fungal growth is integrated in host cells. To address these knowledge gaps, this proposal asks: How do fungal cells thrive in rice cells? To answer this, research will be directed towards characterizing mutants of M. oryzae that are impaired in their ability to colonize rice cells in order to unlock the fundamental cellular, biochemical, and genetic regulatory mechanisms that govern the rice-fungus interaction. This work could point to much needed robust and sustainable mitigation strategies and shed light on fundamental growth processes in fungi. The proposed work will foster the molecular training of postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds through active participation in tackling the real-world problem of rice blast disease.By addressing the fundamental question  What molecular mechanisms coordinate sustained fungal growth and plant defense suppression in the host cell?  This project aims to resolve substantial issues in plant pathology regarding the processes by which fungal pathogens thrive in plant cells. The stated objectives will use forward and reverse genetics, genome-wide proteomic and metabolic approaches, and live-cell imaging to define key exploitable differences in the metabolism of M. oryzae compared to host rice cells. This could lead to the development of novel crop protection strategies targeting molecular pathways that are critical for the biotrophic growth of the fungus but are not required for the normal function of the host cell, and could shed new light on the basic principles of cell growth. The educational objective will expand scientific education by stimulating undergraduates' science learning, preparing graduate students for scientific life beyond the university, and inspiring scientific interest in minority high school students."

Currently, more than 90 percent of the liquid transportation fuels used in the U.S. are petroleum-based. It is imperative to develop alternative liquid fuels that are domestically produced and environmentally benign. Biofuels, derived from cellulosic biomass such as agricultural and forestry residues and dedicated energy crops, offer one of the best near- to mid-term alternatives. Size reduction of cellulosic biomass is the key step in the manufacturing of biofuels. Size reduction is an energy intensive process, and particle size dictates the energy consumption in this process. This award supports research to understand the relationship between cellulosic biomass particle size and biofuel yield. Successful completion of this research will build a foundation for future biofuel manufacturing technologies. This research will have a significant impact on the overall cost and energy balance of biofuel manufacturing, greatly benefiting the U.S. economy and energy security, as well as the environment and society, in general. This project will have a positive impact on engineering education. A new course accompanied by hands-on lab sessions will be created to strengthen the undergraduate engineering curricula and engage students in participating projects on renewable energy manufacturing. The research objective is to test three hypotheses to explain inconsistency in the relationship between cellulosic biomass particle size and enzymatic hydrolysis sugar yield. In this research, it is hypothesized that the inconsistences are caused by the use of different sugar yield definitions, particle size ranges, and pretreatment methods. The prevailing biofuel manufacturing technology and the three most widely used cellulosic biomass currently in the industry, wheat straw, corn stover, and switchgrass, will be used in the research. Experimental investigations on both lab and pilot scale biofuel conversion facilities will be conducted to test the hypotheses. Additionally, structural features, morphological changes, and chemical compositions of cellulosic biomass will be characterized by using electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis, UV spectrophotometry, high performance liquid chromatography, IR spectroscopy, Simon's stain, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Based on the experimental results, a sugar yield model, incorporating all the significant structural, morphological, and chemical features, will be developed and validated. The outcome of this research will provide insights in the dynamic degradation of sugar compounds during hydrolysis. It will advance the knowledge base needed to make both strategic and operational decisions in biofuel manufacturing."

The cells in the edible parts of corn, beans, rice, wheat, and peas undergo a specialized process called endoreduplication where the cells replicate their DNA many times. Although individual cells undergo different amounts of endoreduplication, the proportion of cells remains constant from plant to plant. When geneticists try to increase endoreduplication, they find that the response of seemingly identical cells is somewhat random: some cells respond strongly, some moderately, and some not at all. This observation raises one of the biggest questions in developmental biology: how do identical cells make different decisions? The proposed research will investigate the counterintuitive hypothesis that individual plant cells make these decisions about how much to endoreduplicate utilizing small, random molecular differences. This hypothesis is surprising: biologists would normally expect randomness to be suppressed, since development is highly reproducible, always creating the same proportion of endoreduplicated cells. Instead, randomness may in fact be required to produce this regular portion of endoreduplicated cells. Testing this hypothesis will require advanced use of computers to examine individual cells over time. University students and middle school girls will simultaneously be involved in this analysis as well as being trained in computational skills.Endoreduplicating cells of crop plants are buried deep within the seed coat where they are experimentally inaccessible. Endoreduplication will thus be studied in Arabidopsis thaliana sepals, whose epidermal cells are accessible for live imaging as they endoreduplicate. The transcription factor Arabidopsis thaliana MERISTEM LAYER1 (ATML1) drives sepal endoreduplication, and may cause it to occur randomly. Since ATML1 is expressed in all epidermal cells, it is unclear how ATML1 causes only a few cells to endoreduplicate. Preliminary data show that ATML1 triggers endoreduplication in a dosage-dependent manner: high ATML1 makes all epidermal cells endoreduplicate, low ATML1 prevents any endoreduplication, and individual sepal cells have varying levels of ATML1. The hypothesis tested here is that randomly fluctuating ATML1 causes different levels of endoreduplication in different cells; a few cells exceed ATML1's threshold, triggering endoreduplication, while other cells remain below the threshold and do not endoreduplicate. In Aim 1, we will determine whether ATML1 fluctuations initiate endoreduplication. The associated education goal will be to work with undergraduate students to analyze images generated in this aim. For Aim 2, we will determine whether ATML1 feedback loops drive endoreduplication by amplifying differences in ATML1 expression and, in an associated educational aim, students will write and publish a computational modeling glossary to better understand the newly generated models. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine the molecular mechanism through which ATML1 induces endoreduplication in a dosage-dependent manner. We will also develop an outreach to middle school students for the analysis of images from Aim 3 in a hands-on, web-based image analysis workshop."

Currently, all silicon used in solar cells and computer chips, and all silicon used in the manufacture of silicon containing chemicals including silicone rubbers, oils, lubricants and fumed silica (paints, paper) etc. is produced in an energy, equipment and CO2-intensive process. Biogenic silica includes diatomaceous earth and many kinds of agricultural waste including rice hull ash, inorganic waste from bioethanol production, corn stover, and wheat chaff. The objectives of this project are to develop economical routes from these silica sources to high purity, high value silica products at significantly lower cost than currently available by using a green and sustainable technology. Key markets include electronic, optical, and photonic applications, specialty chemicals, and consumer products. The technical objectives of this Phase I project are to successfully depolymerize biogenic silicas at temperatures ?? 200??C to produce distillable alkoxysilanes. The primary silica source is rice hull ash (RHA), a sustainable, heavy metal free, silica rich agricultural waste. This process uses catalytic base to dissolved RHA silica in antifreeze at ?? 200??C followed by exchange with alcohol to produce alkoxysilanes. In contrast, traditional alkoxysilanes are made from silicon metal produced by carbothermal reduction of silica with carbon at 1900 ??C in an electric arc furnace; a high energy, capital equipment and CO2 intensive process. A further advantage to this process is that the silica depleted RHA offers direct access to high purity (99.9999 %) photovoltaic grade silicon at multi-kg/day scales. If successful, the proposed project could change how high purity alkoxysilanes, precipitated silica, and fumed silica are produced as multiple RHA sources are available worldwide. The alkoxysilane products can be distilled to very high purity at very low cost compared to the same product made from Silicon metal. The initial goal is to produce tetraethoxysilane to compete against Silicon metal derived product and move thereafter to high purity precipitated silica for electronic and optical products applications."

Objective 2: Extend the applicability of adapted management practices across the central Great Plains region using cropping systems simulation models. Objective 3: Develop and evaluate practices for remediation/restoration of degraded soils of the central Great Plains region.  Approach: There are 27 million acres of cultivated dryland in the Central Great Plains region (CGPR). The primary limitation for cropping in the CGPR is a variable drought dominated climate. Despite system improvements toward more intensive cropping, 58% of the region’s dryland is still winter wheat-summer fallow (WF). Unfortunately, WF is not economically /environmentally sustainable. Our objective is to develop sustainable dryland systems for the CGPR. A central research theme is adapting the region’s cropping systems to the ever-changing semi-arid climate. The unit works to achieve that objective using a long-term “core experiment,” the Alternative Crop Rotation (ACR) study. This field study compares 23 rotations for their economic, agronomic, and drought-mitigating effects and their effects on soil quality. In support of the core experiment, several satellite experiments evaluate the agronomic and economic potential of alternative crop species; quantify crop water use; evaluate changes in soil quality; develop management for remediating degraded soils; and evaluate nutrient use efficiency in these systems. The combined efforts of the “core” and “satellite” experiments will result in sustainable, climate-adaptive cropping systems for the region and will provide a quantitative knowledge of production limitations of the CGPR to climate change. Introducing biological and market diversity with broadleaf bio-diesel/oilseeds will reduce pest pressures inherent to the current grass-dominated rotations. Economic savings from improved cropping systems, reductions in agri-chemical use, and reductions in soil loss resulting from this research are estimated at $6-$35 per acre annually. Assuming 25% adoption of this technology will result in annual regional savings of $40 -$236 million."

The goal of this proposed project is to acquire the knowledge needed to develop innovative, environmentally sound and sustainable management alternatives for control of these pests which currently lack sustainable control measures. To achieve this end, we will pursue research to broaden our ecological foundation, enhance prevention of pest outbreaks, and develop microbial intervention tools. We will develop a sound understanding of pest impacts on rangeland function and determine climatic and biotic drivers that cause these pervasive Great Plains pests to exceed economic thresholds. We will design sustainable habitat and landscape approaches to manage these pests and their natural enemies. We will develop microbial control agents to provide critically needed alternatives to pesticide-based control. Pursuing research along these themes of ecology, prevention and intervention will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of developing ecologically-based and economically practical management strategies that reduce economic impacts and promote food security, while decreasing environmental impacts of control measures. We will communicate our results through on-going relationships with land management agencies, farmers and ranchers, academic societies, industry and state extension services."

Objective 2: Develop practical, mass rearing methods for agriculturally important insects, especially insect pests needed for the production of their natural enemies (such as stink bugs), insect biological control agents (such as predatory pentatomids and coccinellids), and insects potentially important as a food supply for animals and humans (such as mealworms and crickets). Sub-objective 2A: Develop a reliable method for continuous production of the green stink bug Nezara viridula. Sub-objective 2B: Study new methods to produce extracts from the yellow mealworm Tenebrio molitor and the house cricket Acheta domesticus and incorporate them into artificial diets for the predators Podisus maculiventris and Coleomegilla maculata. Sub-objective 2C: Evaluate agricultural by-products as sources of food for the production of Tenebrio molitor and Acheta domesticus.  Objective 3: Develop effective biological control strategies for insect pests of crops grown under cover (e.g. high tunnels and greenhouses).  Approach: Climate matching software will be used to determine the most likely locations of natural enemy adapted populations across native ranges of M. cribraria and B. hilaris. The USDA-ARS European Biological Control Laboratory near Montpellier, France, will play a key role regarding parasitoid introductions of B. hilaris from many regions of Asia and Africa. Scientists at the university in Japan will make additional collections across the geographic range of the host within Japan. Scientists at USDA-ARS-IIRU, Newark, DE, will provide his host specificity expertise and make his Asian contacts available for the Kudzu Bug project.  Development of artificial diets for N. viridula will be approached by detailed chemical analyses of plant foods suitable for development and reproduction of N. viridula approximating their nutritional requirements. Artificial diets will be formulated to replicate the concentration and ratios of major nutritional components of broccoli, green lima beans and raw peanuts, which have been used to rear N. viridula. Diets will be compared to natural food sources broccoli, green snow peas, and raw peanuts plus a nutrient supplement previously developed  (unpublished). Rearing conditions other than diet, such as optimal rearing density and adult reproductive curves, will also be studied.  Extracts of T. molitor larvae and pupae and A. domesticus nymphs will be produced by freeze-drying them at -25ºC and by spray drying of homogenized insects. Dry samples will be ground to particles of at least 30 µm. Extracts produced from dried T. molitor pupae will be used to produce artificial diet formulations for C. maculata. The diet formulations will be compared on their suitability to produce quality predators using life table analysis of C. maculata. The formulations will also be compared to a control consisting of natural food. The same procedure will be used for artificial diet formulations for P. maculiventris.  Four different types of agricultural by products will be tested as viable options to formulate diets for T. molitor and A. domesticus. 1) Peanut shells, 2) corn cobs, 3) discarded cabbage, and 4) residual from corn fermentation for ethanol production. Each by-product will be chemically analyzed to determine the content of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate. Diets will be formulated by mixing ingredients with wheat bran at different ratios depending of their nutrient content based on the chemical analyses. Diets will be evaluated by determining and comparing immature survival, development time and the efficiency of food conversion for each of the two species of insects.  Release and evaluation techniques for lady beetles as predators of strawberry will be develop and evaluated. This study will involve (A) testing the effectiveness of augmentative releases of lady beetles to control aphids in high tunnels, (B) testing the predation potential of larvae in the presence of aphid-tending ants in the laboratory and in high tunnels, and (C) testing the assertion that molecules in wax filaments on the cuticle of S. creperus larvae subdue ant aggression."

Objective 2: Characterize temperature responses of four cereal grain crops using an exceptionally wide range of natural air temperatures that emphasize near-lethal high temperature regimes, and assess quantitative responses simulated by crop models. Objective 3: Develop proximal sensing approaches for field-based, high-throughput phenotyping for drought and heat tolerance, including sensor testing, vehicle design, and software for work flows and data analysis.  Approach: Process-based ecophysiological models are among the best tools for quantifying how crop genetics (G), growing environments (E) and management (M) interact to determine productivity as well as ancillary properties of crop production including net greenhouse gas sequestration or releases, nutrient runoff and leaching, and water use. Crop models are especially useful where climate uncertainty or geospatial variability are of prime concerns and where information is needed for scenarios that are not readily adduced from historical data or field experiments. Modeling analyses are constrained by the accuracy of the responses quantified in the models, and recent modeling intercomparisons have identified numerous weaknesses and areas of high uncertainty in widely-used crop models. Our research seeks to improve model accuracy via three interrelated activities.   Insights from genomics and molecular biology will be used to strengthen how processes are represented in crop models and how parameters are estimated for individual cultivars. We propose to use existing large crop performance datasets and recently available genetic data (e.g., the soybean “SoySNP50K” initiative) to improve models. The two target topics are temperature interactions with water deficits and with nitrogen and representation of genetically controlled differences in phenology.   Because semi-arid desert regions experience wide temperature ranges, intra- and inter-annual variations in ambient temperature provide a cost-effective means to obtain robust data across multiple cereal grain crops simultaneously. To refine modeled thermal responses of crops at higher temperatures, we will conduct a Thermal Regime Agronomic Cereal Experiment (TRACE) using sequential sowing dates that range from the normal, commercial December plantings to very late dates in April and May, with closer intervals between plantings. The genotypes will include hard red and durum wheat, barley and triticale. Sowing the four crop types (with four replicates) over 8 planting dates and 2 years will provide data from 256 genotype x air temperature conditions, with air temperatures ranging from -2 to 42°C. These data will be assembled and formatted in accordance with ICASA Version 2.0 standards and distributed to the AgMIP-wheat team for model intercomparisons and improvement.  Novel proximal sensing methods will be developed, assessed and applied in characterizing crop responses (phenotypes) to effects of G x E x M both in the context of crop genetics and crop management research. These activities include testing promising new sensors, refining data logging procedures, improving cart- and tractor-based vehicles, and promoting their application in field-based phenotyping via collaborations with other research programs."

Sub-objective 3.3: Characterize changes in the aggressiveness and mycotoxin production of FHB species, chemotype groups, and populations in response to different climatic conditions.  Approach: In recent years, the world has experienced an increase in mycotoxin contamination of grains due to climatic and agronomic changes that encourage fungal growth during cultivation. We will isolate and characterize major contributors (yeasts, filamentous fungi, and bacteria) to the microbial community associated with wheat cultivation. Microorganisms isolated from the wheat phyllosphere and rhizosphere will be evaluated both for their efficacy as biocontrol agents of mycotoxigenic Fusarium, and for their ability to detoxify or degrade mycotoxins. We will identify and characterize trichothecene detoxification genes from microbes capable of surviving mycotoxin exposure. As a parallel approach to trichothecene detoxification we will identify resistance mechanisms from diverse fungi that produce trichothecenes and have naturally developed strategies to cope with exposure to these toxins. Plants have evolved complex signaling mechanisms to respond to stress; however, simultaneous challenges by abiotic and biotic stress factors results in the activation of diverse signals that can have synergistic and antagonistic effects on each other. Additive abiotic stress can alter plant health and susceptibility to mycotoxins. We will evaluate the effects of environmental conditions associated with climate change on susceptibility of wheat and corn to Fusarium infection and trichothecene contamination and identify changes in plant physiology or defense that influence mycotoxin contamination. Climate induced physiological changes that occur in the host and influence mycotoxins and/or Fusarium infection will be useful as markers in plant breeding programs aimed at developing climate resilient fungal resistance strategies. Fusarium graminearum and other members of the F. graminearum species complex (FGSC) are the primary cause of Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) and trichothecene contamination of wheat worldwide. Understanding diversity at the level of species, genetic populations, and trichothecene chemotypes is critical to the development of effective disease control and mycotoxin reduction strategies. We will determine the extent, distribution, and significance of genomic diversity among FHB pathogen populations, species, and chemotype groups. Finally, we will test hypotheses regarding species, population, or chemotype-specific differences, in host-pathogen interactions, mycotoxin production, or pathogen fitness under different climatic conditions in order to understand the influence of host and climatic variables on pathogen composition and trichothecene contamination."

Subobjective 3B: Evaluate the survival and efficacy of annual grass weed-suppressive bacteria to reduce annual grass weeds in the field.  Approach: 1.a. A life-cycle assessment of wind erosion and associated losses of PM10 and nutrients will be conducted during each phase of a winter wheat – summer fallow rotation. Standard core methods will be implemented in assessing long-term wind erosion as outlined in “Standard Methods for Wind Erosion Research and Model Development.”  1.b. Effects of conventional and conservation crop and tillage systems on wind erosion and associated emissions of PM10 and nutrients will be quantified using a portable wind tunnel under both irrigated and dryland agricultural conditions.  2.a. Landscape scale, spatiotemporal variability of agroecosystem stocks and flows of C, N, and P following conversion from conventional tillage to no-tillage will be assessed at the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) site at the Cook Agronomy Farm. Understanding the long-term impacts of agroecosystems on stocks and flows of major elements is lacking and key to the development of sustainable agricultural systems.  2.b. Characterize spatiotemporal agroecosystem performance (e.g. productivity, nutrient-use efficiencies) and link to soil health metrics. Linking soil health metrics to agroecosystem performance is currently lacking and if achieved will foster a broader and more complete assessment of agricultural systems as well as provide science-based aids to agricultural management decisions.

Isolate, select, and screen for weed-suppressive bacteria that specifically inhibit annual grass weeds, do not injure crops, native or near native rangeland plants. Select soil microorganisms are expected to reduce specific weeds in the field. Studies are a combination of: isolation of soil bacteria, Agar root bioassays, and growth-chamber plant/soil bioassays.  3.b. Evaluate the survival and efficacy of weed-suppressive bacteria to reduce annual grass weeds in the field. Weed-suppressive bacteria are expected to inhibit specific weed species under variable field conditions.

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial “rhizobacteria”, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or “gaps”, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and f  Approach: Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems. Hypothesis: Dry bean genotypes interact with tillage management to affect yield performance under drought conditions.  Eight pinto bean genotypes with varying drought tolerance will be tested in a field previously sown to wheat. A split, split block with four replications with irrigation level the main plot, tillage level the split plot, and genotypes the split, split plot will be used. Irrigation will be manipulated to impose a terminal drought stress. Conventional tillage and strip tillage will treatments will both include use of a nonselective herbicide. Variables will include plant biomass, soil compaction, soil moisture, measures of plant stress and various yield components.    Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments.   Hypothesis a) Timing of herbicide application when available soil moisture and likelihood of precipitation is greater impacts weed control in chickpea.  Four herbicides will be tested at three application timings; 4 and 2 weeks prior to seeding chickpea, and post-plant, preemergence. Herbicide treatments will be replicated in a randomized complete block. Soil moisture will be monitored gravimetrically for 4 weeks after each application. Weed control and chickpea tolerance will be determined by taking weed counts and visual control ratings at 3 and 6 weeks after planting (WAP) and crop stand counts at 4 WAP, and chickpea seed yield.  Hypothesis b) Roller-packing impacts performance of pre-emergence herbicides in chickpea in dry soil conditions.  Four herbicide combinations applied post-plant, pre-emergence will be tested in chickpea with and without roller-packing. Experiments will be designed as a split block with herbicide as the main treatment and roller packer as the split treatment and each treatment replicated four times. Half of each plot will be roller-packed immediately after herbicide applications. Weed control and chickpea injury will be evaluated and visually compared to a non-treated check. Analysis of variance will be used to statistically separate treatment effects in all experiments.   Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Hypothesis: Rhizobacteria strains, soilborne pathogens and cultivar class significantly impact biological nitrogen fixation and yields of pea and chickpea genotypes.  The interactions between the root rot pathogen Fusarium solani, commercial rhizobacteria inoculants, and foliar applications of phosphorous acid, on nitrogen fixation and rhizobial colonization of the most popular dry pea cultivars grown in Washington and Idaho will be assessed in field and greenhouse trials. Plants will be evaluated for elemental content, plant height, dry shoot/root weight, root disease severity, nodulation and yield."

Objective  Approach: Improved management of dairy farms requires successfully managing its nutrient flows, both to maximize nutrient use by animals and crops to optimize profit, and to minimize nutrient loss to the environment. We will investigate most aspects of nutrient cycling throughout the dairy-farm system with a variety of methods and at different scales, including replicated field plots, field-scale paired watersheds, feeding trials with replicated pens of heifers, and computer modeling. We will also examine pathogen transport and viability at different points in the dairy farm system. Some experiments will investigate only one or two nutrient or pathogen pathways, while others will be more comprehensive, including, for example, surface runoff, gaseous emission, and plant removal. Computer modeling will investigate the whole-farm system. Our research team also has a longer-term goal, which is to integrate information across experiments to more completely describe, quantify, model, and manage the entire dairy-farm for improved efficiency and sustainability. Achieving this goal will help ensure the existence of profitable, environmentally acceptable dairy farming for coming decades."

This is a major plant disease of small grains that has caused devastating crop losses for wheat and barley (~$2.7 billion between 1998-2001), where most of the damage has occurred in the Midwest. At the present time there is no satisfactory way of controlling FHB or inactivating the mycotoxins associated with this plant disease. Thus, there is a compelling need to find new solutions to this agricultural problem.Trichothecenes are remarkably stable to both temperature and changes in pH and as such persist through milling, baking, and brewing. This problem would be resolved in part if enzymes could be identified that irreversibly inactivate the trichothecenes. Excitingly, bacterial isolates have been discovered that contain several unknown activities that lead to destruction of the trichothecenes. The nature of the enzyme(s) responsible for inactivation of trichothecenes in these organisms is unknown, but clearly they have potential to revolutionize the treatment of contaminated grain and the development of new resistance traits in wheat and barley. The goal of this study is to identify enzymes that deepoxidate the trichothecenes implicated in FHB."

Specifically, our project uses state-of-the-art molecular profiling to simultaneously identify field-collected Fusarium fungi to species and to the toxin(s) produced (= chemotype). Fusarium head blight (FHB) affects wheat, barley and other small grain cereal crops. In addition to yield loss from reduced seed weight or failure to set seed altogether, the remaining crop may be downgraded due to mycotoxin production. Both the fungi responsible for FHB in North America, and the toxin produced by these fungi, are changing. Current GIPSA-approved rapid detection methods for Fusarium mycotoxins, used at point of sale, focus on one toxin, deoxynivalenol (DON), and are limited in their ability to detect and quantify related toxins. Therefore, it is crucial to know what toxins are present in which localities, to ensure that detection methods are adequate for the prevalent toxins.As the newly emerging chemotypesare less detectable with current methods, more toxic, increasing in range, and the pathogen isolates producing them cause more disease and produce more mycotoxins than the historically dominant strainongoing surveillance is key to timely deployment of appropriate and location-specific disease and mycotoxin management strategies."

The most important issues facing grain and livestock producers are preventing mycotoxin contamination of food and feed, and reducing the deleterious effects of mycotoxins on livestock. Mycotoxins in grains processed for biofuels becomes concentrated in the solid byproduct known as distillers grain (DG), thus mycotoxin contamination is also a major concern for producers of DG. For grain buyers and food processors, the primary need is a reliable method for rapid assessment of grain quality pertaining to mycotoxins and mycotoxigenic fungi. These stakeholders need cost-effective methods to predict, monitor, and minimize mycotoxin production in the field, and to detoxify mycotoxins. Our research focuses on several of the most important mycotoxins and the fungi that produce them. Fusarium graminearum causes a devastating disease in wheat, barley and corn (Fusarium Head Blight-FHB). The impact of this disease on human and animal health is primarily due to production of mycotoxins by the fungus, which then contaminate grain. Our work focuses on understanding how and why the fungus infects these grains, how it survives through the winter, and how it reinfects in the spring. Barley malt is crucial for the beer industry, so we are studying FHB toxin development especially in barley. We use studies of gene expression and genetic manipulation to determine what factors are important to the fungal life cycle. An assay system using a model plant species has helped define genes that enhance resistance to FHB, which have been selected for introduction into wheat and barley and which will then be tested for improved FHB resistance in the field. In genetically modifiable animal model systems, we are working to define which processes mycotoxins interfere with; this approach can be used to screen for compounds that protect against FHB-related mycotoxins. In the southeastern region of the United States, the infection of maize by A. flavus, producing aflatoxin (AF) is a chronic problem because commercial maize hybrids are generally susceptible. Significant levels of resistance to the fungus have been bred into some inbred maize lines such as Mp313E and Mp715. However, the resistance, controlled by many genes, must be integrated into commercial maize lines to improve corn production. Our research will speed up molecular-marker aided resistance breeding. We are also involved in the identification of corn metabolites inhibiting A. flavus propagation in the rachis (corn cob). We study fungal dispersal and AF production, with a focus on a fungus-specific regulator VelB. This project will test its central role by identifying genes that it controls and defining associated gene networks related to fungal growth and AF production. VelB may be an excellent broad-spectrum anti-fungal target. Another fungal virulence factor we study is LaeA; its signaling pathways are important in fungal pathogenicity and A. flavus receptor targets that impede aflatoxin synthesis are being investigated. Our project&#39;s cooperative efforts are intended to accelerate progress in understanding mycotoxigenic fungal biology to facilitate diminishing fungal hazards to our food supply."

In recent years, the presence of mycotoxins in the solid byproduct of grains processed for biofuels, known as distillers grain (DG), has also become an important issue. The sale of DGs for animal feed has become an important source of supplemental income for biofuel producers. For grain buyers and food processors, the primary need is a reliable method for rapid assessment of grain quality pertaining to mycotoxins and mycotoxigenic fungi. Rapid methods to detect mycotoxins at the first points of sale (elevators), as well as methods to detect mycotoxigenic fungi in the commodity (e.g. DON-producing Fusarium in barley), would prevent these stakeholders from purchasing corn contaminated with unacceptable levels of aflatoxins and fumonisins, or wheat with excessive concentrations of deoxynivalenol (DON), e.g. Additionally, cost-effective methods to predict, monitor, and minimize mycotoxin production in the field, and to detoxify mycotoxins and prevent further deterioration in contaminated feed, are needed by producers of grain and livestock. The lowering of tolerance limits for mycotoxins in overseas markets has increased the burden for grain buyers and food processors; currently, levels of mycotoxins that are acceptable for some US products are unacceptable in European and Asian markets, resulting in non-tariff trade barriers. New methods to monitor and treat contaminated grain would benefit domestic consumers, and would also allow American commodities to compete more effectively in foreign markets. Finally, workers who are responsible for animal and human health need information about the toxicity, carcinogenicity, modes of action, and biomarkers of exposure and disease for all categories of mycotoxins. This information would be used to train health-care providers to identify exposure and treat related disease, as well as to develop accurate risk assessment recommendations.The importance of the work, and consequences if it is not doneMycotoxins are a serious, chronic problem throughout the cereal- and forage- producing regions of the U.S. (e.g., see http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=JEysXbJisf0). If research is not applied broadly to address this problem, serious negative consequences will result. First, the presence of mycotoxins is an important health hazard. Accurate hazard assessments are essential in order to maintain exposures by animal and human consumers within safe limits. We propose basic research to define the toxicity of several important mycotoxins. Without this information, it is impossible to assess the risks associated with these mycotoxins. Additionally, the presence of mycotoxins in grain is an economic concern, especially in the context of global markets. Without an aggressive research program to prevent, treat, and contain outbreaks of mycotoxins in grain, U.S. grain producers suffer the consequences of reduced marketability of their products. Furthermore, the proposed research addresses biosecurity concerns. The natural occurrence of mycotoxins in grain is an important security concern for producers and end-users of the grain; mycotoxins have been used as agents of terrorism, e.g. aflatoxin in Iraq. Without a proactive research program to find innovative ways to monitor, prevent, and treat mycotoxin contamination of grains and forage, US agriculture will be unprepared to deal effectively with a mycotoxin outbreak, regardless of its origin. Finally, the production of mycotoxins by mycotoxigenic fungi in grains and forage represents a continuing problem in agriculture. Improving our understanding of factors relevant to allowing these fungi to colonize their hosts, and how mycotoxin biosynthesis is regulated, will not only lead to novel treatment strategies, but will also advance our understanding of fungal pathogenesis in general."

Because of the rapid development in genetic science, new varieties can be developed very quickly, but performance of these new varieties, including yield, resistance to drought, diseases, and insects, and the effects of environment on the performance need to be checked through direct measurement in field. Unfortunately, currently available in-field measurement technologies are slow and inaccurate. Therefore, new technologies for fast and accurate need to be developed.At Kansas State University, we have developed two phenotypers during the past three years - a vehicle-based and a hand-held platform. The common feature of these platforms is that they can take field data very rapidly. The phenotypes can measure canopy greenness, leaf temperature, and plant height, and all the measurements can be registered to accurate blocks using GPS receivers. The handheld phenotyper ( Phenocorn ) uses only a few inexpensive sensors and allows operators to hand-carry it through the field. Since 2014, this phenotyper has been used in two developing countries, Mexico and India, for phenotyping.With these experiences, we will design and construct a robotic phenotyper that will allow autonomous or semi-autonomous operations. During day time, shade can be pulled down to prevent the effect of sun light on the optical sensors. The robotic phenotyper can also operate overnight. A user-friendly interface will be developed to allow people to use the phenotyper with limited training.The sensors we will test on the robotic phenotyper will include the following: 1) sensors to measure the shape, size, and biomass of the above ground portion of the crop. This includes various types of cameras, lasers, and ultrasonic sensors. 2) Sensors to measure the underground portion of the crop. This is especially important for root crops, such as sweet potato. Electromagnetic sensors and ground penetrating radars may be used for this purpose. 3) Sensors to detect crop stresses due to drought, disease, and insect infestation. The Greenseeker and infrared temperature sensors may be used for this purpose. 4) GPS receivers to determine the locations.Using these sensors, some important features will be detected during various crop growth stages. Using wheat as an example, these may include the time when tillering begins, when first node appears, when the flag leave becomes visible, and when flowering begins. Features detected for different varieties can then be compared and the varieties with the best performance selected.The developed technologies can also be used in site-specific farming, where field measurement can be used to determine rates for water, fertilizer, and pesticide applications."

Milled rice is deficient in almost all important nutrients including protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, and fibers except carbohydrates. The protein, vitamin E, and iron contents are remarkably low compared with other cereal crops. Additionally, milled rice has very little zinc and no vitamin A. Thus, rice generally lacks sufficient nutrients to sustain life, if used as the sole source of food. The poor nutrition, markedly the deficiency in iron and zinc, of milled rice has caused severe malnutrition problems, particularly among children and older populations, in developing countries where the access to other food is limited. Zinc (Zn) deficiency has been estimated to affect 95.4% of the population in South Asia and other areas where people largely consume rice as the staple food. Stunting due to zinc deficiency affects 40% of preschool children (Hotz and Brown 2004), and 82% of pregnant women (Bhutta and Haider 2009). Iron deficiency anaemia is a worldwide public health problem with global prevalence estimated at 24.8%. The highest prevalence is found in Africa, the Middle East, Central, South, and South-East Asia, and areas of Latin America, where two thirds of children under five, and almost 50% of women are anaemic (WHO2008). While nutrient fortification has been widely used for wheat and maize flour and are very successful in improving human diet nutrition worldwide, an effective method for rice fortification is not available thus far as rice is consumed as whole grain. No good method can stably force nutrients such as minerals and vitamins to penetrate into the rice grain and sustain the washing steps before cooking, a traditional practice used by almost all families.In this project, we will develop new methods to allow minerals and vitamins penetrate into rice grains."

A report on contending 21st Century needs for food, water, and energy commissioned by the National Science Foundation15 responds that ... it is impossible to project strategies for meeting these demands without considering two other key factors: energy and water. Society is increasingly forced to choose, for example, between using land and fertilizer for food production or for bio-based or renewable energy production, and between using fresh water for energy production (e.g., hydraulic fracturing or growing corn for biofuels) or for irrigating food crops. Neither wheat nor sorghum is achieving the 2 %/yr rate of yield gain needed to meet the 2050 food goal alone, even for fully watered crops. (Wheat is currently at 0.9 %/yr14.) Meeting this target when less water is available due to competition from other uses makes the problem acute. This is true even for sorghum where use as a bioenergy crop competes with feeding animals. Water uses in feedlots include cattle drinking, suppressing dust, feed processing, cooling and washing animals, managing stock effluents, etc. Stock hydration, alone, takes 50-60 liters/day/head16. Although reducing systemic water needs by feeding wheat rather than sorghum is a Phase 1 priority in the near-final draft of the new Kansas Water Policy17 breeding is needed to make this possible. Yields must be adjusted to incentivize growers to produce the material and the grain must be made visibly distinct from existing varieties to enable appropriate grading and tracking in the marketing chain.An overriding context is climate change. Many previous climate scenarios have assumed a doubling of CO2 to ca. 700 ppm by 2100. However, the recently released IPCC Fifth Assessment report18 places the 2100 level at 1000 ppm unless additional mitigation strategies are implemented beyond those now planned. This suggests levels of 575 ppm by 2050 vs. 496 ppm under older scenarios - an increment equal to the global CO2 increase from 1970-2010.In the past it seemed as if the rates of major systemic changes were slow enough that breeding programs might keep pace. As events have developed, however, this is far from true. For wheat the 35 years between now and 2050 is only five breeding cycles. (For sorghum it is 4.) And yet, currently, it is not even known whether wheat breeders should seek varieties that cope with water stress by maintaining cool canopies or ones that can function despite elevated leaf temperatures.It is therefore now imperative that breeding programs acquire predictive technologies to choose breeding targets in light of impending operating environments in the nexus of food- energy-water tradeoffs and climate. Moreover, increasing weather variability accompanied by more frequent extreme events means that farmers need tools permitting agile, within-season management adjustments.This proposal meets these needs.Physiological models track plant growth and development under conditions that change on hourly, daily, weekly, and yearly time scales but they do not incorporate genetics. Genetic models do but can struggle to predict endpoints resulting from complicated interactions. Both model types can benefit from the intensive sensory data streams coming online for breeders and crop managers. The first project objective melds the two model types of models so their relative strengths can complement each other. It also explicitly links them to data from high throughput platforms. The second objective places the needed computational power directly were it is needed, on the platforms that collect the data and, therefore, in the hands of breeders and crop managers. By doing so, it eliminates what might otherwise be significant delays and/or logistics complications in moving data from sensor to computation sites for conversion to answers."

Consequently, most of the research on durum wheat and cultivar development in the United States occurs in North Dakota. Strong demand for high yielding cultivars that are resistant to diseases and possess excellent quality will persist in the domestic industry and export markets. Pasta manufacturers want strong gluten cultivars to ensure desired quality in the end products.The major yield and quality-limiting factors in durum wheat are pre-harvest sprouting and diseases, especially Fusarium head blight. There is a continuing decline in harvested durum acreage and production in North Dakota because of Fusarium head blight. The decline in harvested acreage and durum production in North Dakota is disastrous to the farm economy and has direct impact on the national pasta industry and the international export market. Fungicides could increase yield and other agronomic traits but the level of improvement is below the margin of the economic return. Although fungicides may reduce disease infections, using genetic resistance is the most environmentally safe and economical way to control diseases.Currently 90% of the durum acreage in North Dakota is planted with cultivars developed by NDSU. The newly developed durum wheat cultivars have higher yield and much better quality and some tolerance to FHB when compared to the older cultivars. The annual durum wheat production in North Dakota from 2012 to 2014 averaged 0.95 million tons having an average annual value of $430 million. The new cultivars Divide, Carpio, and Joppa also have better tolerance to FHB than the older cultivars. If breeding for increasing yield and/or disease resistance would increase production by 2%, it will add approximately 8.6 million dollars to the state economy annually."

Millet production actually doubled between 2012 and 2013 in the US. The interest in using millet as ingredient in food and energy production is based on similarity of these grains to the common ones. Millet possesses characteristics similar to wheat and corn, two important cereals in the US. Millet therefore has the potentials to replace these other cereals in several human food applications and for energy production. Millet is particularly suitable because it is drought resistant, it is less susceptible (8 fold less) to aflatoxin incident than corn, it has comparable nutrient profile as wheat and corn. Some millet varieties have higher protein content than wheat and corn. A major advantage of millet versus grain sorghum is low level of antinutritional factor in millet. Also, about 3 million Americans are gluten intolerant, and millet is gluten free therefore it is an excellent ingredient for production of foods for this category of people where specialty food market attracts sales in billions dollars yearly, and it continues to increase. However, the understanding of millet important constituents, protein, starch and fiber functionality are very important in determining their effectiveness in various food and fuel applications. The need for research at this stage to evaluate the functionality of this grain&#39;s constituents and extensively test the quality attributes of the products produced from them, cannot be greater.

These crops have undergone very strong selection pressure from the time of early domestication through today&#39;s modern plant breeding, resulting in the loss of valuable genetic diversity. Moreover, cultivation of genetically uniform crops over vast acreages has lead to catastrophic losses due to plant disease epidemics, insect outbreaks, and various abiotic stresses such as drought. This lack of crop diversity, coupled with changes in climate, present new and serious constraints for cereal production. To feed the world&#39;s burgeoning population, plant scientists must increase the food supply by at least 50% within the next half century. This increase must come largely from the genetic improvement of food crops since the world&#39;s agricultural land base is shrinking and inputs such as fertilizer and water have become more costly. Biotic (diseases and insects) abiotic (drought, heat, and salinity) stresses are the most important constraints to sustainable cereal production worldwide. Deployment of cultivars with resistance/tolerance to biotic/abiotic stresses is a sound means for ameliorating such production losses. The wild relatives of wheat and barley are known to be rich sources of disease resistance and also many other traits contributing to crop productivity, nutritional value, and adaptation. Thus, our long-term goal is the improvement of small grain cereals with genes derived from wild progenitor species. This research will facilitate the development of cereal cultivars with higher yield, multiple disease resistance, greater stress tolerance and enhanced quality traits, thereby increasing the productivity, profitability and sustainability of small grain production in Minnesota and other parts of the world."

Also, I frequently answer questions from area growers or extension agents about forage and cover crop cultivar selection and production management. The information generated by the research in this project allows me to give growers advice to improve their forage crops performance and quality.The optimization of alfalfa management (fertility, seeding rate, and harvest frequency) greatly impacts the productivity. The studies in alfalfa fall dormancy, fall harvest, and alfalfa-grass mixtures will increase the forage yield on average at least 0.3 ton/acre/year. Pure alfalfa acreage in North Dakota in 2014 was 395,711 acres and alfalfa grass mixtures 1,000,961 acres (USDA FSA, 2014). An increase in forage yield of 0.3 tons/acre x 1,396,672 acres at a price of $100/ton of hay equals an economic impact of $41,900,160/year. Any improvement in alfalfa yield or reduction in cost by management has a tremendous economic impact. Forages are ranked third in value and acreage among all other crops in the USA. North Dakota is the second most important state in alfalfa acreage in the USA (USDA FSA, 2014).My program has additional impact by testing new forage sources and improving the management of the existing traditional forages. The economic impact of sorghums, forage brassicas, and other annual forages is difficult to estimate, because most of their benefits are indirect. North Dakota cover crop acreage in 2013 was 218,000 acres with a potential to increase which merits a need to provide management information to producers of cover crops.My project also includes bioenergy crops and cover crops research. The impact value of these are hard to estimate, but as a reference legume cover crops planted after wheat in one of our studies (Samarappuli et al., 2014) reduced the need of nitrogen fertilization in corn by 100 lbs N/acre/year. With a N credit of only 50 lbs N/acre, the economic value of reducing the fertilization in corn in 2,693,677 acres x 50 lbs N/acre at a saving of $0.3 lb N, is $40,405,169 per year."

Triticale occupies a negligible acreaget present but its potential as a hog and poultry feed warrants research in cultivar development. Three public institutions and two private companies have wheat cultivar development efforts in the southeastern United States, in addition to NCSU. Many southeastern seed retailers are licensing public developed wheat and oat cultivars on an exclusive basis. To better meet these needs, small grains programs at state universities in NC, SC, GA, FL, and LA formed a cooperative effort (SUNGRAINS) to coordinate cultivar development research and share in royalties. The average life of a wheat variety in North Carolina is five seasons. The demise of a typical cultivar results from changes in virulence patterns of the powdery mildew and /or leaf rust fungi. There is a continuous need to provide wheat breeders with new sources of resistance to these pathogens.Two additional pathogens, Fusarium head blight and Stagonospora blotch have threatened, or caused serious economic impact, to wheat production during the past five years. We can provide new and potentially more stable resistances to these fungi by 1) mapping resistance to the pathogens and pyramiding QTL for resistance using molecular marker approaches, and 2) initiate Genomic Selection strategies to improve resistance to these pathogens and generally improve agronomic performance and end-use quality. A major constraint in winter oat production is winterkilling due to extreme temperatures. We can improve winterhardiness in oat by building on recent work whereby we determined the genetics and associate molecular markers with QTL&#39;s for freezing tolerance."

However, dietary changes that will reduce chronic disease risk and are 1) easy to implement and 2) widely accepted remain uncertain. Clearly, dietary changes that involve foods that are already well-accepted by consumers have a greater likelihood of being adopted than uncommon foods or foods normally consumed in small amounts.One well accepted food that may provide protection against the development of certain chronic diseases is, surprisingly, wheat. Although wheat is obviously commonly consumed, relatively little research has been conducted on its potential health benefits. Thus, the overall objective of this project will be to examine the effect of different classes of wheat, as well as different milling fractions of wheat, on reducing the risk of certain chronic diseases, using animal models."

Population growth requires that we continue to increase production of these grains. Some sources and technologies that historically contributed to increased food production have been exhausted. Two such examples are land availability and fertilizer use. We are currently utilizing all of the planets prime cropland for production. Although fertilizer efficiency and environmental stewardship of fertilizer use can be improved, we will not see significant increases in grain productivity through increased fertilizer applications. The technology that still offers great potential to increase food production is genetic improvement. Corn yields in the U.S. have increased 800% in the past 100 years. Genetic improvement is estimated to contribute over 50% of this gain, or an increase of more than one-half bushel per acre per year. This trend is expected to continue for many years into the future. Gains in wheat productivity have not been as spectacular as for corn, but yields have more than tripled since the science of genetics was applied to this crop.We will use proven methods of applied corn and wheat improvement, and add new technologies to the tool kit as they become available. Ultimately the project expects to deliver new wheat and corn cultivars or parent lines to producers that are higher yielding, and have better quality and disease resistant. The producer is anticipated to benefit directly from higher income per acre, and from reduced pesticide use. Grain processors are expected to realize better economies of scale from wheat and corn milling. Grain traders will experience improved demand for wheat and corn. The public will benefit from improved human and livestock nutrition. Plant breeders in industry, USDA, and universities will benefit from access to improved genetic materials to begin the next cycle of genetic gains. Students will benefit from laboratory and field experience as part of their training as the next generation of plant breeders."

This is due largely to an increase in world population, which is anticipated to grow from about 7 billion people today, to well over 9 billion in 2050, but also reflects increasing consumption of meat and dairy products, and the use of biomass in the production of biofuels. Meeting the goal of doubling crop production by 2050 is a major challenge. Indeed, between 1985 and 2005, crop yields per acre increased only about 20%. If this increase alone were to continue until 2050, we would fall well short of demand. Moreover, the increases in yields for the major crops that feed the world--maize, rice, wheat and soybeans--have stagnated in many regions including locations within the U.S. In addition, we are in a period of climate instability (climate change) with an uncertain future, and the potential of having major negative impacts on crop productivity. What is needed is a  Second Green Revolution  that includes what the Royal Society has referred to a  sustainable intensification of global agriculture.  This goal, which will necessitate higher yields with less input of water, will require the development of crops that are more resistant to abiotic and biotic stresses including drought, extremes in temperature, flooding, disease (bacterial, fungal, viral) and insect pests. Our primary research interest is to identify regulatory pathways that contribute to plant freezing tolerance and to use this information to improve the stress tolerance of plants. Our studies have focused on cold acclimation, the process whereby plants increase in freezing tolerance in response to low nonfreezing temperatures. With support from the USDA and other federal agencies, we developed Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter referred to as Arabidopsis) as a model plant to study cold acclimation and cold-regulated gene expression; discovered the CRT/DRE Binding Factor (CBF) regulatory pathway; established--along with many other labs--that the CBF pathway is highly conserved in plants; and have identified regulatory proteins that contribute to regulation of the CBF pathway in response to low temperature, the circadian clock, and photoperiod. In the current proposed research project, we will conduct multiple lines of investigation to identify molecular components of the low temperature  thermometer  that regulate expression of the CBF genes and will use natural genetic variation to identify novel pathways that contribute to cold acclimation."

Crop price increases have led to farming expansion into marginal previously unprofitable areas and recent price fluctuations and climate volatility present further challenges to crop producers. In a February 2015 report to Governor Bentley entitled  Strategic Plan to Grow Alabama&#39;s Agriculture, Agribusiness, Forestry, and Forest Products Industries, 2015-2020 , the Alabama Department of Agriculture &amp; Industries and Alabama Cooperative Extension System identified priorities and strategic goals to respond to the increase in global food demand and economic opportunities in the state. Within the Industry Goals for Cotton, Peanuts, Soybean, Wheat, and Feed Grains, the stated objectives are:  increase wheat and soybean yields, quality, and production acreage [..], and increase the statewide average yield of agronomic crops . The report notes the need to reduce inter-annual output variability to improve profitability and attract food processing plants and the renewal of Alabama Irrigation Initiative.These objectives can be achieved in several ways. One way is to increase and stabilize yields by investing in new technologies including planting genetically engineered crop varieties, investment in irrigation, and using improved production practices. Another way is to improve yield and farm income stability is to use financial risk management tools such as crop insurance and/or forward contracting and futures and options stressed in the new Farm Bill.Consequently, I propose to analyze row crop farming profitability and efficiency under different technological and management practices in Alabama and the Southeast and identify tools and practices to achieve higher yields and farm income stability for the major crops currently available and adopted by producers. This research complements my participation in my primary Multi-State Research Project NC1179: Food, Feed, Fuel, and Fiber: Security under a Changing Climate and in my secondary collaborative group SCC-76: Economics and Management of Risk in Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources. This analysis is distinct from the analysis of field trial data in that it utilizes historical farm-level production and economic data which are more representative of the actual crop profitability. It also includes evaluation of crop insurance emphasized in the 2014 Farm Bill and the new agricultural support payments.The main data source for the proposed research is the Agricultural Recourse Management Survey (ARMS) that contains annual farm-level data which includes production, sales, cost information, farm characteristics, and weights that reflect the actual country- and statewide farming population. The PI, has published on and with current graduate students continues to study crop profitability and yield volatility in the Southeast and the Midwest and the links of yields and profits to climate volatility (Nadolnyak&amp; Vedenov 2013; Nadolnyak &amp;Quaye, 2015).The main methodology is regression analysis and simulations. Regression analysis will be used to estimate production and profit functions conditional on production practices and local weather and land characteristics. Simulation analysis uses these estimates to evaluate the relative productivity and efficiency of alternative production and risk management practices. Related policy analysis will be facilitated by the PI&#39;s experience from his current sabbatical in Brussels, Belgium, where he is learning about the European Union&#39;s environmental policy (changes) and consequent farmers&#39; choice of rick management tools. The PI is also working on a proposal on providing insurance in rural areas to be submitted to the ILO Impact Insurance .The results are expected to have direct policy implications that include, but are not limited to, promotion of irrigation and adoption of GE crop varieties, small farm support polices, and the use of insurance. The results will also facilitate profitability comparisons of crop farming with pasture land and forestry helpful in predicting farmland values and land conversion trends."

The product is intended as a remediation tool for filtering storm water and reducing the toxicity of contaminated soils.In aerobic soils, Fe deficiency is a common problem for plants. For wheat grown in the dryland area of the Pacific Northwest, the solubility of Fe is extremely low and plant yields can suffer under the right conditions. We have been working with a soil bacterium that lives in the interface between soil particles and plant roots and is thought to provide some protection of wheat from fungi by antibiotic production. Phenazine, the antibiotic, has also been found to dissolverelatively insoluble Fe-containing minerals under laboratory conditions. We intend to extend this work to a controlled soil-plant-bacteria system to determine if the same dissolution occurs and supplies Fe to wheat."

This prompted the agricultural industry to look for alternative agronomically feasible and sustainable cropping systems. Diverse no-till continuous cropping systems have since been adopted by growers in the region. However, there is still a need to evaluate alternative crops that can be grown successfully in this dry region. Oilseed crops in SD have traditionally been used as vegetable and industrial oils, spices, and bird feed. Non-food oilseed crops targeted for the semi-arid and arid agro-ecozones of SD have the potential to transform the regional economy and reduce the dependence of the U.S. on foreign oil. Biofuel feedstock crops grown in rotation with cereal crops have potential to increase sustainability of cropping systems and reduce weed and disease problems. Availability of locally grown feedstock will help to expand the oilseed based biofuel industry in SD. Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata), commonly known as carinata, and camelina (Camelina sativa) have been identified as potential non-food biofuel crops suitable for production in the drier environments of central and western SD. However, the best fit for the crops in current cropping systems, best management practices, and environmental impacts remain undetermined. Likewise, flax (Linum usitatissimum) is an annual oilseed crop that has been grown in North and South Dakota for many years with an increase in organic production in recent years. However, best management practices for organically grown flax also remain uncertain. This project will develop best management practices for carinata, camelina, and organically grown flax in South Dakota. The research will also evaluate the impact of including these oilseed crops on soil quality, and fertilizer requirements and yield of winter wheat. Long-term, the proposed studies will increase crop choices for growers in central and western SD. This will result in reduction of land under fallow and hence, reduction of negative environmental effects associated with summer fallow. The introduction of biofuel feedstock crops and organic flax will diversify market options for growers in the region, thus improving the State&#39;s bioeconomy. Production of more diverse crops will also reduce disease and insect pests&#39; carryover from year to year resulting in reduction in pesticide use. The end result is a more sustainable crop production system."

Winter wheat is the primary cash crop even though yields are low reaching 20 to 35 bushels per acre. No-till seems like a viable soil conservation practice, however, it does not have the magnitude of the impact as in other wheat-growing regions. Low adoption of this practice is often associated with even more reduced yields, low surface residue retention due to strong winds, reliance on high inputs for weed control and accumulation of salts beneath the soil surface. On the other hand, there are anecdotal reports of producers successfully using other soil conservation practices, namely cover crops, in western North Dakota, western Nebraska and eastern Colorado to increase soil organic matter content (SOM) and soil health, but published research articles provide limited information. There are some cases of local farmers who have experimented with cover crops and noticed improved benefits to soil health. It is still unknown how the synergistic effect of reducing tillage and using cover crops will work in this region, and whether one or the other practice should be recommended where soils are marginal and precipitation low and sporadic.Our goal is to evaluate whether cover crops, reduction of tillage or a combination of both can be viable practices for dryland crop rotations in the Central High Plains in order to improve soil quality and soil health. Specific objectives include: (1) Evaluate integrated cover crops/tillage scenarios on crop yields and, (2) Evaluate their effects on soil properties and processes that indicate soil quality and soil moisture. The region of interest falls into two distinctive precipitation zones where available soil moisture is either critically low or where slightly greater moisture allows for increased crop productivity and crop rotational diversity. New knowledge on management strategies that incorporate use of cover crops and variable tillage reducing practices are much needed as it is still unclear what are the main principles driving farmers&#39; decisions to help optimize soil building and long-term soil health. This information will help develop recommendations for successful conversion to holistic management to conserve resources, improve profitability and sustainability. Eight participating farms will be located in two Wyoming wheat-production areas: the more arid, low-productivity Slater Bench southeast of Wheatland, and the more mesic, relatively productive Pine Bluffs/Albin area."

Gluten-free foods accounted for 10.5 billion in sales in 2013 and are expected to rise 48 % by 2016. There has also been a shift away from yeast leavened breads due to the rising consumption of ethnic products, where tortillas are the fastest growing wheat product in terms of annual sales.

Along with these trends, the push for  clean labels  has also become a growing trend in the food industry. While the term clean label is not well defined, the concept of clean labels is typically described by consumers as the avoidance of  chemically  sounding ingredient names or ingredients listed as artificial. With the growing shift away from traditional white pan bread to non-traditional baked products and the advent of clean labels, sensory quality and product stability have become major issues that need to be addressed and overcome to further develop the markets. The use of protein sources from non-traditional sources and specialty crops is a promising route to alleviate the quality issues being seen in the changing baked foods industry."

Typically it is available in late fall, winter, and early spring, when other forage sources are low in quality and quantity.Both stocker cattle and mature animals can effectively utilize wheat pastures. Typically, stocker cattle have daily gains of 0.7 to 0.9 kg. Livestock producers use wheat pastures because it is generally a high-quality forage and costs of gain on wheat pasture are often lower than those of a conventional backgrounding program. Wheat producers use wheat as pasture because it may be the most profitable use of wheat.Even though crude protein content of wheat pasture is high. A big proportion of crude protein in wheat pasture is highly soluble and a large amount of nitrogen may be lost in the rumen before reaching the small intestine. The quantity and quality of protein reaching the small intestine is influenced by ruminally undegraded intake protein (UIP) and microbial protein synthesized in the rumen. Approaches to improve the productivity of cattle grazing wheat pasture might include technology that improves the amount of protein reaching the small intestine for absorption by increasing the amount of UIP and/or the synthesis of microbial protein in the rumen. The absorption of more protein will improve the productivity of grazing cattle. This project will investigate the effects of supplementing protein sources of low rumen digestibility on the amount of protein reaching the small intestine. Therefore, identify protein supplementation strategies that will improve productivity of grazing cattle."

Resistance gene-protected wheat cultivars are expected to play an even bigger role in the future, when plant breeders reap the benefits of decades-long progress in molecular biology and genomics.One thing that is lackingis an understanding of how crop species integrate the diverse defense responses they require to survive attack by their many parasites. Every crop species is attacked by a large set of phylogenetically diverse parasites, which differ in how and when they attack, what they take from the plant, and their evolutionary potential for adaptation. As we learn more and more about the sensory and signaling abilities of plants, it only gets harder to understand how plants make sense of all of this information about their parasites and decide what to do. One plant for which we are beginning to understand integrated responses to biotic stress is the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., which has, by far, the best molecular research tools.If we are to feed the 9.6 billion people expected to inhabit the Earth in 2050, research efforts similar to that now occurring for Arabidopsis must begin for major crop species, especially those crops that are not being protected from biotic stress by traits that are genetically modified. In a recently published review in the Journal of Experimental Botany (Harris et al. 2015), we made the argument that wheat is a strong candidate for such a research initiative. Briefly, the argument was that wheat 1) is critical for feeding the world&#39;s current and future populations, 2) is not currently grown as a genetically modified organism and therefore still relies on non-GM traits for protection against biotic stress, 3) has a foundation of knowledge about its immune system, including 479 Resistance (R) genes, and 4) R gene-mediated defense protects against a range of phylogenetically diverse and economically important parasites, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, insects, and mites. Our review papersignaled the launch of a research initiative to understand how wheat integrates its immune responses to biotic stress, beginning with a focus on R gene-mediated defense. Research will focus on two economically important groups of plant parasites:insects and fungal pathogens. The Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say)is a good choicebecause it shares many features with plant pathogens, in particular fungal pathogens.On the plant pathogen side, we chose fungal pathogens because of: 1) their economic importance, 2) extensive local scientific expertise, both at North Dakota State University and the Cereal Research Unit at ARS-USDA, and 3) readily available tools, including near-isogenic lines with resistance to Puccinia triticina Erikss.

Specialty crops are those that are grown in small acreage relative to major crops (apples, canola, corn, cotton, grain sorghum, grapes, rice, oranges, soybean, sunflower, turf, peanuts, potatoes, sugarcane, tomato, tobacco, and wheat). Specialty crops encompass minor use fruits, herbs and spices, tree nuts, ornamentals, and minor use vegetables. Because of their small acreage, and the large expense in registering pesticides, there is hardly no economic incentive for biological or chemical pesticide companies to develop the necessary database required for registration of their products on specialty crops. The need for pesticide registration in specialty crops and minor uses led to the formation of what used to be called the Interregional Project #4, or the IR-4 Project. Today, the Specialty Crops and Minor Use Program has expanded to also include pesticides needed to protect public health such as control of mosquitoes and ticks. Including all secondary impacts, the IR-4 Project is anticipated to support research and industry sales to support 104,650 U.S. jobs and increases annual gross domestic product by $7.3 billion (Miller and Leschewski 2012).The IR-4 project facilitates the examination of pesticide ingredients, crops and locations where pesticides will be used, the manner of use, and potential impact on consumers and nontarget organisms. The project helps ensure that any pesticide registered for specialty crops fall below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) allowed by EPA for food and feed. Recently, the IR-4 Project has provided about 50% of field and residue data for EPA&#39;s annual work plan and new clearances. About 70 - 80% of IR-4 Project&#39;s effort supports the registration of reduced-risk pesticides, thereby reducing the risk to human and environmental health relative to existing, or recently de-registered products (Viray and Hollingworth 2009; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2001a). Reduced risk pesticides are applied at lower rates than the older compounds; thus, volume of chemicals uses in fruit and vegetable production.The IR-4 Project has three programs: 1) Food, 2) Ornamental Horticulture, and 3) Biopesticides and Organic Support. Minor-use food crops (vegetables, melons, fruits, and tree nuts) comprise about 25% of total agricultural food crop production, worth about $33 billion annually. Without available modern pest management tools, losses of food and income are high.This proposed project is under the Food Use Program. The Food Program works with growers to establish minor-use, food crop priorities that instruct the Food Program on which commodity-pesticide registration projects to pursue."

The know-how of irrigation management, i.e., when to turn an irrigation system on and how much water to apply is so far mostly based on experience, and less on actual measurements. Moreover, in our region of interest, soils are known for their pronounced spatial variability. This fact implies, that the amount of irrigation water that may be appropriate in one spot may be completely wrong and insufficient in another spot. In other words, the right amount of water in one zone of the field may cause air-deficiency and therefore yield decrease in another more clayey zone in the field, or even loss of water through rapid deep drainage and leaching of plant nutrients. Each one of these negative consequences cause damage, either economically for the farmer or environmentally or both.Modern technology in irrigation allows site-specific irrigation through GPS-based pivots, and GIS-based soil survey and soil water monitoring. In our region, it is essential to apply irrigation water site-specifically in order to minimize environmental damage and maximize profitability of irrigation.Observations of different soil and crop properties across the field will be taken according to state-of-the-art geospatial and temporal monitoring. One of the benefits of this approach is the fact that it is different from classical agricultural experimentation, but focused on diagnosing spatial and temporal processes, in order to convert research results directly into management decision support.The ultimate goal is effectively surveying soil and biomass production processes and their variability at the field scale in order to incorporate this knowledge in prediction and management. Resources need to be applied site-specifically in order to manage the environment and agro-landscapes in a sustainable manner. The societal benefits are responsible use of resources, minimizing environmental damage of water, air and soils, and less conflicts about resource distribution and management."

Synthetic insecticides are the conventional pest control strategy in large-scale agroecosystems, but growing resistance in insect populations highlights the need for a more sustainable strategy. Trap cropping is an ecologically-based pest management practice using the concept of alternative host plants. If an alternative host is more attractive than the crop, then insects are lured out of crops and concentrated in the trap crop, where they can be efficiently managed through a number of low impact strategies. The wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus) causes $300 million of annual damage in wheat fields throughout the Northern Great Plains of North America. Insecticides are not effective in this pest system, butthecool-seasonforage, smooth brome (Bromus inermis)which was established across the north- and mid-west in the 1880&#39;s as a livestock forage may play a role in managing the wheat stem sawfly.Initial workfound that smooth brome produces the samegreen leaf volatile compounds which attract this insect pest to wheat, but at 4- to 8-fold higher concentrations. Characterizing thechemical attractants from these plantswill help us understand the role that smooth bromeplays in wheat stem sawfly management and helpdetermine if it indeed serves as a trap crop. Understanding the mechanisms of pest insect attraction to this common forage relative to wheat will help usdevelop ecologically-based pest management strategies, to improve the productivity and sustainability of agricultural systems in the future."

The economic benefit of growing wheat varieties developed by the WSU spring wheat program is evidenced by their significant acreage. In total, ~57% of the 2014 Washington spring wheat acres were planted to WSU spring wheat varieties. A single  perfect  wheat variety will never exist. Washington and Pacific Northwest production environments vary considerably across relatively small geographic distances, while four market classes of spring wheat are produced with variable end-use quality characteristics. Changing production systems, disease and insect pest problems, market preferences/end-uses, and variable weather patterns all demand a long-term integrated effort to respond to and improve yield potential/protection and grain quality. Yield limiting biotic (including stripe rust, root diseases, and insect pests) and abiotic (including heat, drought, poor fertility, herbicide carryover) stresses reduce wheat production across the state. Our aim is to provide genetic solutions to these production limitations in the form of new, high-yielding, pest-resistant, high-quality varieties. Variety development and germplasm enhancement are accomplished by conventional plant breeding activities, including cross-pollination, followed by selection of superior lines and yield testing at multiple locations throughout the state. New higher-yielding wheats with pest resistance and superior end-use quality will be released to Pacific Northwest wheat growers and increase spring wheat profitability and sustainability, while decreasing the use of pesticides."

Plant breeding uses a series of proven steps that lead to trait improvement. These include parent selection, crossing to create genetic variation, selfing to create testable progeny, evaluation fo progeny for multple traits over multiple years and environments, and finally selection and increasing the seed of superior cultivars.This approach to plant breeding will be applied to soft red winter wheat to develop new cultivars adapted to Ohio and the Midwest. The Ohio State University wheat breeding program has been in existence since before 1900. The program improves yield at the rate of about 1 bushel/acre/year.

Typically, stocker cattle have daily gains of 0.7 to 0.9 kg.

Approaches to improve the productivity of cattle grazing wheat pasture might include technology that improves the amount of protein reaching the small intestine for absorption by increasing the amount of UIP and/or the synthesis of microbial protein in the rumen. The absorption of more protein will improve the productivity of grazing cattle.

In Michigan, field crops including soybean, corn, seed corn, wheat, and dry bean are planted on a total of 5.6 million acres and represent a value of $2.7 billion dollars. Some recent examples of disease impacts on Michigan field crops include the soybean white mold epidemic of 2014 which significantly impacted production, with an estimated 8% of the crop destroyed, representing $50 million dollars of lost revenue, not including the cost of preventative measures; Goss&#39;s wilt of corn - Michigan produces 20% of the world corn seed supply, the recent movement of the bacterial disease Goss&#39;s wilt into the area has already impacted production as positive seed lots cannot be exported out of the country. If the disease continues to gain a foot hold the impact will increase substantially; Head scab of wheat - Michigan produces a significant quantity of soft white winter wheat used in baked goods which has a 50% lower tolerance to mycotoxins (1 ppm) than other market classes. Fusarium head scab is an annual threat to wheat production, not only in terms of yield loss, but also quality, and in particular the production of mycotoxins.

Although Missouri acreage tends to vary with weather and price, the state ranks as one of the top three soft red winter wheat producing states in the nation. A wheat breeding program within the Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Missouri (MU) which gives priority to the development of improved varieties and enhanced germplasm is essential to the farm economy of Missouri. It enhances profitable wheat production in the state because of two key factors: (1) there has been limited private company involvement in wheat breeding thereby necessitating greater involvement of public institutions in varietal development and (2) production areas within the state vary with respect to climate and soil type and therefore, a Missouri based program is essential to the development of varieties adapted to all wheat growing areas of the state. In addition to its importance to the Missouri farm economy, the wheat breeding program functions as an integral part of the plant breeding and genetics curriculum within the Division of Plant Sciences at MU. There is a shortage of plant breeders nationally and data has shown that there is a growing interest in the discipline in our undergraduate and graduate student population. Modern plant breeders require skills acquired by working in competitive variety development programs coupled with skills in techniques of molecular biology and management of the large data sets they generate. The wheat breeding program provides them with practical examples of the theories and concepts or breeding self-pollinated crops that are taught in the classroom as well as a problem-based learning environment critical to the training of a new generation of plant breeders. Through the employment of high school students attract new students to agricultural sciences.Significant yield losses caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe the pathogen known to cause Fusarium head blight (FHB) or scab in wheat, continue to cause crop losses in Missouri, particularly where FHB resistant varieties are not planted. In addition, losses in the marketability of the crop occur when mycotoxin levels produced by the pathogen exceed threshold levels dictated by the end-use of the grain. In 2015, rainfall occurred almost every week during the entire crop season often persistently and in large quantities resulting in toxin levels accumulating throughout the growing season. Grain was badly damaged and in many parts of the state DON levels exceeded 30 ppm rendering it unmarketable. The need for enhanced resistance in backgrounds that are high yielding so growers will select them for production was never more apparent. Missouri has been on the forefront of developing wheat varieties that have high levels of resistance to FHB. Many unique sources of resistance have been identified in the Missouri program since 1993, including resistances in Ernie, Bess, Truman, and MO 080104 (the latter under proprietary license) released by the University of Missouri since our FHB work began in 1995. Recognition for our work in this area is demonstrated by the fact that these varieties all serve as check varieties for FHB resistance in various regional breeding nurseries. In the variety MO 080104 we have successfully combined high levels of resistance with a superior agronomic package including high grain yield and test weight and extremely broad adaptation that have placed it in demand throughout the soft red winter wheat growing region. We need to examine the resistance in both Truman and MO 080104 to better understand the genetics of the resistance in order to exploit it more effectively in our breeding program. In addition, we need to identify and validate critical regions on the wheat chromosomes (quantitative trait loci; QTL) associated with FHB resistance that will accelerate the development of new varieties combining these two sources of resistance. Broadly then the goals of the research within the wheat breeding program are to continue to study the genetics of different sources of resistance in Missouri wheat, in an effort to effectively and efficiently combine these genes with those discovered and characterized globally in an effort to further improve the level of FHB resistance available to growers in Missouri and beyond. This research should lessen the damaging effect of FHB on the wheat crop thereby directly contributing to a more positive farm economy for the state."

Reuse of residuals as soil amendments offers the potential to substitute beneficial agronomic and environmental uses for disposal costs. Treated liquid wastes, such as wastewater effluent, recycled water and other non-potable waters, also present opportunities for beneficial reuse in lieu of surface water discharge or expensive treatment.There have been many obstacles to optimized use of residuals. These include a lack of research to optimize residual based product development, conflicting regulations or the absence of regulations on residuals use, and lack of public outreach and communication. There is increasing evidence that land application of a variety of residuals may provide agronomic and environmental benefits that were either not previously well understood and/or that are critical to addressing emerging environmental issues associated with climate change (Brown et al., 2011). The W2170 workgroup propose to continue the investigation of biogeochemical cycling of plant nutrients, the movement of trace element and trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) into the food chain, the potential toxicity of trace elements and TOrCs in residuals to the soil and water ecosystems, and their long-term bioavailability in residual-amended soils to develop additional knowledge to help promote residuals recycling practices that are protective of human health and the environment. To this end, laboratory, greenhouse and field research designed to assess the ability of residuals to reduce contaminant bioavailability in Brownfields, Superfund and other contaminated soils will be conducted. Chemical and biological methods used to evaluate reduction in risk from contaminants to human and ecological receptors will be evaluated. Field biosolids-based N research will be conducted to further refine PAN rates and application timing across climatic regions and soil types to optimize N use efficiency and minimize N loss for agronomic (esp., corn, wheat, hay and forages) crops.These results will provide data for continuing risk assessment required by the USEPA Part 503 Rule for land-application of biosolids as well as for developing regulations for land-based recycling of residuals and reclaimed water. Research will also focus on benefits of reuse including field and watershed scale effects on soil quality, plant drought response, soil carbon sequestration, water quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change impacts associated with soil-based reuse of residuals and reclaimed water. We will also explore the potential for residual based products to be used in urban areas including urban agriculture, restoration, and green stormwater infrastructures. W2170 members are conducting research, on both short- and long-term application sites, whose results will enable the development of guidelines for maximizing the beneficial uses of a considerable variety and number of residual by-products."

This will increase the demand for the world food production by approximately 60% of today. In an effort to increase food, forage, fiber and fuel supply to meet the increasing demand of growing population, soil and environmental quality have been considerably compromised. Typical cropping systems in the drylands of western United States use intensive tillage and long fallow period to conserve moisture for crop production (Nielsen et al., 2005). The intensive tillage-based crop-fallow system has depleted 30-60% of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock in the last century (Brown and Huggins, 2012; Norton et al., 2012; Ghimire et al., 2015). This has also caused loss of biodiversity, depletion of soil nutrients, and increased the problem of wind and water erosion (Stewart et al., 1997). The continuous decline in SOC and nutrients reservoir, biodiversity loss, and erosion negatively influenced agronomic, economic, environmental efficiency of cropping systems and threatened the sustainability of agriculture. Global climate change has added challenges on sustainable food production in the arid and semiarid regions (Lal, 2004). Semiarid agroecosystems near the lower limit of rain-fed crop production are especially vulnerable to changes in climate, input costs, and product prices, yet cover vast areas of the western US and the world (Ghimire et al., 2013). The areas under dryland production is increasing in the western United States including New Mexico because of the depletion in surface and groundwater availability for irrigation (NMDA, 2015). Producers transitioning to dryland production lack information on approaches that enhance the long-term viability, competitiveness, and efficiency in the context of changing climate and increasing economic pressure on them.Agricultural management practices that improve nutrients and water use efficiency, increase SOC sequestration and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while maintaining crop yields can increase sustainability and profitability. Fallow has been practiced to store rainfall during the no-crop period, but the water conservation efficiency of fallowing is extremely low (Nielsen et al., 2005). Instead, extended fallow depletes SOC and increases weed infestation (Stewarts et al., 1997; Ghimire et al., 2015). Conservation systems that reduce or eliminate tillage and uses improved crop, soil, and water management strategies can improve the sustainability of dryland production systems and maximize ecosystem services (Nielsen et al., 2005; Palm et al., 2015). It is not very clear how cropping systems can benefit from conservation systems and other management strategies such as cover cropping in dryland production in the prospect of increasing water limitation, SOC loss, and climate change. This is critical in the semiarid western United States and similar dryland regions across the world where crop production and SOC accrual are constrained by low precipitation and high temperature variation. Improving soil, water, and air quality while sustaining crop yields demand more research on crop and soil management strategies to improve agronomic, economic, and environmental efficiencies in semiarid drylands.Previous work and present outlookInterest in conservation practices including reduced-tillage, crop rotation, and cover cropping has increased to restore soil quality and crop productivity lost due to intensive tillage and crop - fallow system. Alternative management strategies that used cover cropping, crop residues, organic amendments, and followed reduced-tillage management increased SOC accumulation, improved nutrient cycling, and sustained crop yields (Ghimire et al., 2012; Idowu and Grover, 2014; Ghimire et al., 2014a,b; Ghimire et al., 2015). Soils under perennial grasses and no soil disturbance (1931-2010) was able to maintain two times more SOC than conventional winter wheat - fallow system (Ghimire et al., 2015). Reduced-tillage improved agroecosystem performance through an increase in labile SOC components, soil microbial proliferation (Ghimire et al., 2014a) and root growth (Ghimire et al., 2014b). Where perennial cropping or year round cropping is not possible, cover cropping increases biomass production and contributes to SOC accumulation and nutrient cycling (Liebig et al., 2004).Our observations of the ongoing studies at Pendleton OR, previous studies at the central High Plains, as well as literature from other regions revealed that conservation practices such as reduced-tillage, crop rotation, and cover cropping can increase crop yields and improve soil environmental quality. Improved soil management, crop rotations and cover cropping also suppress weeds, insect pests, and diseases. Improving soil, water, and air quality while sustaining crop yields in drylands of the eastern New Mexico, however, should be cautiously considered as high variation in temperature and precipitation limits crop production and biomass turnover. It may take several years to see measurable changes in soil environmental quality and crop performance in this dry environment. There is a knowledge gap regarding impact of alternative tillage, crop rotations, and cover cropping in improving agronomic, economic, and environmental efficiency of dryland cropping systems in the eastern New Mexico and needs additional research."

Research has shown that weed competition reduces crop yields by using irrigation water and other resources such as nitrogen and light. This competition occurs in perennial tree (e.g., pecans, pistachios and lemons), shrub (e.g., guayule), vine and annual crops planted in rows (e.g., cotton, chili peppers and corn), and in annual and perennial broadcast planted crops (e.g., alfalfa, lesquerella, wheat and barley). In western rangeland, riparian areas and wild lands, invasive species change fire ecology, displace native species and reduce the productivity of managed landscapes. Buffelgrass invasion of the Sonoran Desert and potential conversion to savanna grassland, Russian knapweed invasion of cropland and pastures leading to abandonmentand invasion of riparian habitats by saltcedar are examples of invasive species impacts in Arizona. Tools that can be used to manage weeds in Arizona&#39;s irrigated crops include cultural practices, biological control, tillage and herbicides but in range, riparian and wild landscapes, herbicides and biological control agents are often the only management tools available. An additional aspect of managing invasive species is the restoration of degraded sites after treatment to control the invasive plants.Arizona crop producers and land managers (e.g., ranchers, National Forest Service, National Park Service, BLM and NRCS) benefit from the development and registration of new herbicides and new uses of older herbicides. They benefit from research that develops new management strategies because weed and invasive species populations change in response to changes in land use patterns, cultural practices and climate variation and change. This project will investigate weed management in cropland, rangeland and wild landscapes using herbicides and other technology and will prioritize projects based on need, available collaborators and availability of funding sources to support research. General themes will be the investigation of new herbicide technology in crops, development of weed management programs including strategies that delay the risk of developing herbicide resistant weed populations and the management of invasive species.The objectives of this project are to evaluate new herbicide technologies to determine their efficacy on target weedy and invasive species under local environmental conditions and determine the herbicide tolerance of crops and other plant species in non-crop landscapes where appropriate. Each year a research decision matrix will be assembled ranking the target species, crops, herbicides, herbicide application methods and uses, potential for funding and potential impact of the research on Arizona&#39;s agricultural and natural resource based economy. Potential projects are discussed with commodity groups, government (e.g., USDA, BLM, and Forest Service) personnel and academic and industry scientists, often at scientific or Extension meetings, and attempts are made to secure funding for the projects. The herbicides and crops investigated change from year to year although most of the projects are multi-year in duration with an annual funding cycle. The general procedure for conducting the research outlined in this project is to establish small and large scale research plots on University of Arizona experiment stations and in commercial pecan, chili pepper, guayule fields and research plots on private, federal and state lands with cooperating ranchers and agency personnel. The experiments will be replicated using standard experimental designs (e.g., completely random in greenhouse experiments and randomized complete block, factorial and split-plot designs in field experiments).The broad goal of this project is to facilitate the development of new crops, improve weed management and increase plant yields thereby directly increasing productivity. Indirect effects include improving the economic status of Arizonan&#39;s involved in various plant production industries in rural Arizona and sustaining rural economies."

Agronomic yield is controlled by many factors with the rate and duration of carbon fixation in leaves a primary factor. End product quality is impacted by genes that influence seed development and determine seed composition and suitability for various end product applications.Total agronomic yield in cereals is a function of the amount of carbon fixed in leaves and ultimately stored and harvested in seeds. Among the important yield limiting processes we propose to study here are leaf and seed starch biosynthesis and the role of dwarfing genes in plant growth and development. Our recent studies examining the role of starch biosynthesis rate limiting genes have indicated that both source and sink starch biosynthetic rates limit plant growth and yield. Our first objective then will be to complete experiments designed to determine how increased leaf and/or seed starch impacts overall plant growth and metabolism using a model plant system. The use of a model plant system will allow us to conduct controlled experiments more efficiently than possible in wheat.Starch and carbon metabolism are not just important to overall plant growth. In fact, much of the world&#39;s population relies on starch from cereals as a source of calories. Starch comprises approximately 70% of the dry weight of cereal seeds and therefore an increased understanding of starch biosynthesis could prove useful in improving cereal end product and nutritional quality. Therefore, our second objective is focused on the role of starch in seed end product quality. Starch in cereals typically consists of 25% amylose and 75% amylopectin. While both amylose and amylopectin consist of glucose chains, the chains of glucose in amylose are relatively straight while those in amylopectin are highly branched. The glucose residues in amylose are also complexed with lipid with the end result being that amylose is less easily digested. Decreased ease of digestion equates to a lower glycemic response or a  low net carb  effect in high amylose wheat based foods. Aside from health effects, high amylose wheat flour would prove useful in improving the end product quality of noodles and pasta and the nutritional properties of bread. Our experiments are designed to create specific levels of amylose in wheat seeds and then to measure the impact of the altered starch upon end product and nutritional properties.Our third objective is to examine the role and potential of induced variation in the major wheat dwarfing gene, termed Reduced height (Rht). Essentially all current spring and winter wheat varieties are semi-dwarf and contain one of two common Rht mutations and Rht is perhaps the most important single yield related gene known. The development and characterization of new Rht alleles will lead to a greater understanding of yield limiting processes and perhaps to greater agronomic yields."

Cruiser &reg; 5FS (thiamethoxam, Syngenta Crop Protection) and Gaucho 600 Flowable (imidacloprid, Bayer CropScience) are neonicotinoid insecticide seed treatments that are registered for use on wheat, corn, and soybeans, though the rate varies by crop and pest targeted. These insecticides move into the soil from treated seed and can be persistent. In the mid-Atlantic, it is common to have a three year rotation of grain crops, starting with full season soybean, which is followed by fall planted wheat, then double-crop soybeans, and finally corn. Because seed treatments are so widely used, neonicotinoid treatments used in consecutive crops in the same field can result in higher soil concentrations than use in a single year alone. Repeated use of neonicotinoid treated seed from year to year can result in pest resistance development as well as potential negative impacts on beneficial organisms. Neonicotinoid drenches have been found to have non-target impacts on soil microorganisms including earthworms, beneficial microbes, and beneficial invertebrates. Not only can neonicotinoids have impacts on soil communities, but they may also impact above ground invertebrate communities including beneficial parasitoids and predators. Neonicotinoid insecticides have systemic properties and are quickly taken up from the soil by growing plant material in both the target crop as well as non-target weedy plants. Winter annual flowers (e.g., yellow rocket, chickweed, and shepard&#39;s purse) may take up neonicotinoids after the planting of winter wheat that has been seed treated. This may be a route for non-target exposure to pollinators. We propose to test the impact of thiamethoxam and imidacloprid treated wheat, soybean, and corn seeds in a back-to-back three year rotation on a wide range of non-target organisms. Specific objectives include determining whether treated seeds have an impact on (1) beneficial and pestiferous soil organisms including invertebrates and microorganisms, and (2) beneficial and pestiferous foliar invertebrates. Additionally, we will (3) determine whether winter annual flowers contain neonicotinoid residue after planting these seed treated grains. This study has the added value of allowing us to measure (4) the effect of repeated use of neonicotinoid seed treatments during the crop rotations that occur in mid-Atlantic grain production."

In the state of Virginia, soybeans are grown on over half a million acres (600,000 acres in 2014) and theworth exceeds $200 million annually.Soybean seeds are a major source of protein and oil, and have been widely used in food production and animal feeding (Barrett 2006). Although the productivity of soybeans has been steadily increasing over the past 30 years, significant challenges remain in the future improvement of the productivity under ever-changing environmental conditions (Deshmukh et al. 2014). The development of new genomic technologies, play akey role in global food security and sustainable agriculture (Michael and VanBuren 2015). In contrast to traditional molecular biology techniques, where a small number of genes, proteins or metabolites are analyzed simultaneously, genomic technologies allow scientists to generate data at the whole genome scale.This has the potential to advance systematic understanding of biological mechanisms and significantly accelerate crop improvement. For example, genome sequencing can provide tens of thousands of genetic markers that enhances the power of marker-assisted breeding (Morrell, Buckler, and Ross-Ibarra 2011; Deshmukh et al. 2014). Transcriptome profiling with RNA sequencing can quantify changes of all genes for a given species, allowing the identification of key genes torespondto stress or other environmental conditions (Huang et al. 2014; Rodrigues et al. 2015; Wakasa et al. 2014).During the past few years, the cost of obtaining genomic information using next generation sequencing technology has reduced dramatically (Edwards, Batley, and Snowdon 2013). Because of this, genomic information such as reference genome sequences, single nucleotide polymorphisms, epigenomic modifications, and transcriptome profiles, have become readily available for many crop species. The challenge is how to translate the  big data  into knowledge of gene functions and genetic variation, and to apply such knowledge to facilitate a mechanical understandingof crop improvement. Bioinformatics and computational biology, play a fundamental role in this process. Using tools of statistical inference and machine learning, bioinformatics is the principled approach for data mining on genomics data to identify genes and genetic variations that underlie traits of economical importance. For example, RNAseq and genome re-sequencing data, have been used to identify genes involved in regulation of seed oil content (Goettel et al. 2014) or seed development (Fan et al. 2013). In the past few decades, most gene functions and molecular mechanisms in plants, have been characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana (Krishnakumar et al. 2015), a model plant species. As compared to Arabidopsis, genetic experiments for crops are typically more time consuming (Edwards, Batley, and Snowdon 2013). Unlike traditional genetic experiments, genomic experiments such as RNA sequencing are fast and can now be routinely performed in a variety of crops species. However, crop genomes are typically more complex than Arabidopsis, thus new bioinformatics tools and databases are needed to help breeders and other plant scientists to analyze and interpret genomic data in order to better understand the information embedded in such data. One of the main functions of these tools will be to compare crop species and Arabidopsis in order to identify key genes and pathways that are conserved and involved in important biological processes, such as seed filling, seed germination, disease resistance, and drought/flood tolerance.In the next five years, my lab will focus on building bioinformatic platforms (Figure 1) that enable scientists to extract information from comparative genomic data and to facilitate crop improvement. We will use soybean (Glycine max) as a model system to build our bioinformatics resources and pipelines. We will focus on three biological processes: seed development, stress tolerance and microbial interactions. Seed development is the key process that is related to the product quality of soybeans. Environmental stresses such as drought and flood are major abiotic factors that negatively impact soybean productivity. As a legume species, soybean-microbial interactions are crucial for the process of nitrogen fixation and determines the protein content of soybean seeds. Many research groups at Virginia Tech as well as in other institutions have studied these biological processes, and have already generated ample amount of sequencing data for soybean and Arabidopsis. We will use these existing data in our research. The bioinformatics platform developed in this project can be easily extended to analyze data from other crop species such as maize, rice and wheat."

While these commodities are grown over a vast area, specific geographic areas face unique challenges to the successful production of these crops. This requires that new varieties be evaluated under local conditions in order to identify which materials are best adapted to a given region.In western Montana, particular attention must be paid to indentify varieties with improved resistance to lodging, and foliar diseases. While these issues are not unique to western Montana, these traits have historically had a significant economic impact on both grain yield and quality in this area. In addition, an insect pest called the orange wheat blossom midge, has recently become a serious production issue in northwestern Montana.The initial outbreak of the orange wheat blossom midge reduced spring wheat yields by more than 90 percent. It is therefore critical that efforts now be directed to identifying spring wheat varieties with resistance against this new insect pest.Winter wheat, spring wheat, and barley nurseries will be established to evaluate promising new materials for adaptability in western Montana, with emphasis on those traits which locally impact grain yield and quality. Special efforts will focus on identifying spring wheat varieties with resistance to the orange wheat blossom midge and in developing ways to improve the expression of the resistant trait. The identification of varieties with improved resistance to the midge, foliar disease, Fusarium head blight, and lodging will improve economic conditions in western Montana. Moreover, the results of these efforts should provide benefits where ever these same production issues occur."

Current summer annual crop rotations often 1) leave soil bare and unprotected from erosion and losses of organic matter and nutrients during fall, winter, and spring and 2) have little biodiversity. The lack of biodiversity leads to issues with pest management, labor distribution through the growing season, and economics and profitability. The purpose of this research project is to increase crop species diversity on the Iowa farming landscape. This will be achieved by developing longer crop rotations that include summer and winter annual species as well as perennial species. Oilseed crops such as canola and cereal grains such as wheat exhibiting summer and winter annual life cycles as well as perennial legumes such as red clover could possibly fit into an Iowa crop rotation, providing growers with alternative options. Additionally, the inclusion of summer and winter annual crop species in rotations increases the potential of economically viable double-cropping scenarios. The inclusion of species with different life cycles such as these can also serve to improve cropping systems by increasing the amount of ground cover throughout the year and help disturb life cycles of problematic weed species. Incorporating multiple species into a crop rotation may also improve yields of other crops such as corn and improve a farmer&#39;s economic stability, while at the same time reduce the ecological footprint as a result historical land cultivation. The potential to reduce the amount of off-farm, synthetic inputs also exists when longer, more diverse crop rotations that include legumes are employed. Before growers can reap the benefits of alternative crop rotations, the ecological and economical viability of &#39;alternative/non-corn/soybean&#39; crops and double-cropping systems must be evaluated with a strong emphasis on making any information as a result of this research readily available to growers. This study investigates the agronomic and economic potential of planting winter canola into full sesaon soybeans with the intent of harvesting high soybeans yields while seeding winter canola at optimum planting dates for Iowa. In order to increase adoption of alternative crops, it is critical that yield trials be established that can identifythe yield potential of winter canola varieties that are most suited to Iowa climate."

Chinese agricultural policies have shifted from farm taxation, typical of developing countries, to farm subsidies and direct payments more typical of developed countries. Because the People&#39;s Republic of China is the world&#39;s largest importer, producer, and consumer of agricultural products, its policy changes have significant impact on world markets, including the United States. This highlights the need to better understand the drivers of policy changes in China. Japan is another important trade partner of the United States. The country was one of the top five U.S. export markets for wheat, soybeans and corn in both 2014 and 2015. It is also one of the largest beef importing countries in the world. Japan currently has Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with fifteen countries. If Japan signs a similar EPA agreement with the United States, there could be substantial gains for the U.S. due to the lower or zero tariff rates on the imports from U.S. The proposed research will quantitatively investigate the determinants of the levels of agricultural subsidies in China as well as the effects of EPAs on Japanese agricultural imports in the last three decades. In addition, we will examine the role of import competition in U.S. food industries with particular attention to their impact on the degree of domestic mark ups."

During 2015 South Dakota was ranked 7th in the U.S. for soybeanproduction (235,520,000 bushels), 6th for wheat production (103,406,000 bushels), and 1st forsunflower production (1,230,040,000 lbs). When the annual production of these crops is compared between 2013 and 2015 there was a 12% increase for soybean, a 9.7% increase for wheat, and a 21% increase for sunflower (NASS 2016). As the harvested acres and observed yields of soybean, wheat, and sunflower continue to increase, there is also an increased need for improved management recommendations for the insect pests of these crops. One strategy that has been employed is the use of insecticide seed treatments, and as a result their use in South Dakota has been steadily increasing (USGS 2016). Soybean, wheat, and sunflower productivity is often negatively affected by early season soil dwelling and also foliar feeding insect pests. Due to a limited selection of products available for management of these insect pests, and the systemic nature and ease of use associated with insecticide seed treatments, they are often used for insectmanagement. The insecticide active ingredients used for seed treatments for soybean, wheat, andsunflower are exclusively neonicotinoids.Insecticide seed treatments are used on approximately 31% of soybean acres across the U.S., however, it is believed that in areas of the Midwest they are used on as much as 73% of the planted soybean acres (Douglas and Tooker 2015). Although these insecticide products are applied to seed that is planted on millions of acres of cropland there are limited use recommendations available, and as a result they are often used prophylactically (Douglas and Tooker 2015). Concerns regarding the value of insecticide seed treatments for soybean in the Midwest have been a topic of discussion since 2014 when a report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was released. The Biological and Economic Analysis Division (BEAD) of the EPA determined that the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments in soybean most likely provided farmers with a $0/acre benefit, and at most $6/acre benefit (EPA 2014). However, an analysis of the same data by AgInformatics, LLC determined that the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments provide a net yield benefit of 2.8%(approximately $10.60/acre) when compared to untreated soybean (Mitchell 2014). In their report, the EPA BEAD also stated that according to surveys of soybean farmers the insect pests that were being managed through the use of insecticide seed treatments included soybean aphids and bean leaf beetles (EPA 2014). Although they are major commodities, there is limited data available regarding the use of insecticide seed treatments for wheat and sunflower production.Identifying early season above-ground insect pests is relatively easy, and relies on observing the insect or signs of defoliation. However, identification of belowground insect pests can be difficult and as a result they are often overlooked and ignored. The early season insect pests associated with soybean include wireworm, seedcorn maggots, white grubs, and bean leaf beetles (Bailey et al. 2015). Early season pests of both spring and winter wheat include bird cherry oat aphid, English grain aphid, greenbug, Hessian fly, and wireworms (Dyer at al. 2012, Hunger et al. 2012). An additional concern, aside from yield losses due to direct feeding is that the three aphid species that feed on wheat are also competent vectors of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). Exploration of the impact of insecticide seed treatments on the incidence of BYDV in wheat is necessary. For sunflower, early season insect pests include wireworms, seedcorn maggots, striped flea beetle, and sunflower beetle (Knodel and Charlet 2007). While this list does account for bean leaf beetles as an early season pest, it does not account for soybean aphids due to their late season arrival in soybean. The contradiction between the EPA&#39;s survey data and the known early season insect pests of soybean are likely due to a lack of extension and outreach from state universities. Also, if this discrepancy exists for one crop such as soybean, it likely exists for other crops including wheat and sunflower. Although insecticide seed treatments are labeled for wheat and sunflower there is limited data available regarding their efficacy and benefit to farmers in the U.S., and especially in South Dakota.Therefore, it is critical that the use of insecticide seed treatments is explored in soybean, wheat and sunflower in South Dakota to determine their benefit for farmers. In addition, for each crop itwill also be imperative to explore factors (e.g., planting date, seeding density, soil type, weatherconditions) to determine when insecticide seed treatments provide the greatest economic benefit to farmers. Through these efforts, management recommendations for insecticideuse on soybean, wheat, and sunflower will be developed."

An estimated 3.5 billion people will live in water-stressed river basins by 2025, and an estimated 40% of the world population currently lives in areas where water demands exceed supply. Worldwide, agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of water use. Finding alternate water sources for irrigation that do not draw directly from groundwater or surface water resources is important to maintain agricultural sustainability. Irrigation with reclaimed wastewater (RWW) is a common practice worldwide. For example, California and Israel use respectively ~46% and 70% of RWW for irrigation. In 2007, 20 million ha of land worldwide were irrigated with RWW, and that area is expected to increase significantly. While RWW reuse helps combat water shortages, contaminants present in RWW may transfer to edible parts of food crops and be consumed. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), which are generally small, polar or ionizable organic compounds, are commonly found contaminants in RWW worldwide, and many are inherently bioactive, raising concerns about human health risks due to exposure via this route.Crop and ornamental plants can be exposed to PPCPs through irrigation water or field-applied biosolids/manure. Uptake of PPCPs has been demonstrated at application rates relevant to RWW irrigation or biosolids application. However, our recent review of the data and that by others indicate that the ability to predict uptake from the chemical properties of PPCPs is currently very limited. For example, in three studies on diclofenac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID) uptake by hydroponically grown lettuce, three different results were obtained. One groupfound uptake into both roots and leaves, while a second group found diclofenac only in the roots in a 2013 study but not at all in a 2012 study. Studies on other NSAIDs as well as on multiple kinds of antibiotics exhibit similar discrepancies. This indicates that small differences between plants and between growing conditions can have large effects on plant uptake of PPCPs, which makes predicting future PPCP uptake difficult.It follows that models for predicting plant uptake of PPCPs are thus far, not capable of yielding reliable results. Modeling plant uptake of PPCPs is essential for risk assessment for human exposure, as it is impossible to test all current and future PPCPs for plant uptake in all possible agricultural conditions. Of the current models, some have been based primarily on the n-octanol-water partitioning coefficient (Kow) of the contaminant or the root lipid content of the plant. While single variable models have been somewhat successful for neutrally charged compounds, multiple groups have confirmed that the same relationships do not exist for ionized organic contaminants, even when changes in lipophilicity due to charge are taken into account. More complicated models account for soil properties, transpiration rates, and ion trapping effects, but still have poor predictive ability and are limited by lack of knowledge about the mechanisms by which PPCPs enter plants. Plants are often modeled as passive organisms, but in reality they have many effects on the surrounding environment and have a lot of control over what molecules are absorbed and transported through tissues.Only the fraction of an organic compound dissolvedin the soil water is considered available for uptake by plant roots. For nonpolar and moderately polar neutral organic contaminants, the amount present in soil water is controlled by sorption to soil organic matter. For example, the uptake of the synthetic polycyclic musks by carrot roots from soils increases as soil organic carbon content, and therefore sorption, decreases. Similarly, root uptake of carbamazepine (a polar but uncharged antiepileptic drug) by cucumber is related to soil organic matter content, with higher uptake in soils with lower organic matter content. In contrast, polar and ionizable PPCPs possess functional groups that allow them to interact with mineral surfaces in addition to organic matter, and the degree of association with soil particles may be strongly influenced by solution chemistry, especially pH. For positively charged compounds, the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of phyllosilicate clay minerals and soil organic matter strongly influence sorption and desorption. A large amount of research has been devoted to understanding the sorption of PPCPs, particularly antibiotics, to soil constituents; however, few studies have examined the impact of soil properties on PPCP uptake by plants.The rhizosphere is the narrow zone of soil around plant roots (~2-3 mm) that is impacted by their presence. Plant roots secrete exudate containing polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, simple sugars, and amino acids into this zone. The amounts and kinds of exudates depend on water and nutrient status. Plants can modulate rhizosphere pH in response to nutrient availability by secreting H+, OH&minus;, and organic acids (e.g., malonic acid, oxalic acid) and can alter pH by up to 2 units as far as 2-3 mm from the root surface. The speciation of ionizable PPCPs and soil constituents in the rhizosphere may therefore differ from that in bulk soil, with concomitant effects on sorption. The importance of nutrient availability and rhizosphere pH on the bioavailability of metals has been demonstrated. For example, rhizosphere alkalinization (due to nitrate being the sole nitrogen source) strongly influences plant uptake of metals like copper due to pH-driven changes in solubility and solution speciation. The effect of nutrient-driven modulation of rhizosphere pH on PPCP uptake by plants has not been studied, but warrants investigation.Root exudates can alter the bioavailability of organic contaminants to plants and have been studied extensively in the context of phytoremediation. For example, citric, oxalic, and malonic acids (commonly found in root exudates) can increase desorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from soil, and sterilized root exudates can decrease naphthalene partitioning to soil and the surface tension in growth media in a manner consistent with the behavior of surface active compounds. Compounds found in root exudates can also increase mineralization of soil organic matter, which may also impact contaminant sorption. Microorganisms in the rhizosphere, including plant symbiont bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi, can also affect contaminant availability by altering the rhizosphere solution chemistry and mineralogy. The effects of root exudates on the availability of PPCPs for root uptake have not been studied.Transformation of organic contaminants may be enhanced in the rhizosphere relative to bulk soil. Plants and rhizosphere-associated microorganisms secrete enzymes (e.g., laccases, peroxidases) that may transform contaminants. Secretion of compounds structurally analogous to contaminants may stimulate co-metabolic processes that enhance contaminant degradation. Carbohydrates in root exudates serve as carbon sources for rhizosphere microorganisms, leading to higher microbial activity in this zone. Transformation of some PPCPs in soil has been investigated, but we are aware of no studies specifically examining degradation in the rhizosphere. We expect rhizosphere processes to influence PPCP persistence in soil and availability to plants.The proposed research focuses on the effects of root-induced changes in rhizosphere pH on the uptake of selected PPCPs by wheat seedlings. Our specific objectives are to (1) determine the effect of pH on the sorption of selected PPCPs to important soil constituents and whole soils; and (2) investigate the effect of nutrient-dependent rhizosphere pH changes on PPCP uptake by wheat seedlings."

In a preliminary survey of Colorado wheat growers, the author found that in most situations when rust was present and no fungicide was applied, yield was reduced by up to 50%. This not only demonstrates the potential damage this pathogen can cause, but also the value of a timely fungicide application, which is most effective when applied no more than one week prior to the presence of the pathogen. While stripe rust has not historically been a problem in Colorado, in nearly half of the growing seasons since 2000, stripe rust has been present in at least some portion of the state and caused reduced yields. In addition, with changing weather patterns as well as adaptation in the pathogen population, Colorado wheat growers may see more frequent stripe rust epidemics in the future. Several recent reports have documented the genetic shift of the stripe rust population in the United States since 2000, which saw the introduction of a new more virulent race and significant adaptation to warmer temperaturesand ability to defeat resistant varieties. This newly adapted Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) population is believed to be the main culprit in the recent epidemics of stripe rust in the central plains, and other wheat growing regions of the U.S. over the last 15 years. With the rise of new races of Pst and changing climate patterns, there is a need for updating our epidemiological knowledge of this pathogen. In fact, researchers in many areas have already begun this task and new predictive models have been developed for wheat growing regions in the pacific northwest of the U.S., and Great Britain. What these new models emphasize is the importance of overwintering survival of the pathogen, in particular mean maximum temperatures in December and February were shown to be the best predictors of stripe rust severity the following growing season. While the winter temperatures in Colorado may be cold enough to prevent the fungus from overwintering in the state, it is possible the fungus is overwintering further north in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas than previously thought. Unfortunately, there is very limited epidemiological or population genetic data available on Pst in the central plains and we therefore have a poor understanding of how the pathogen population migrates on an annual basis, the geographic range of overwintering inoculum, as well as the weather variables that are the most accurate at predicting disease epidemics in the coming season. The overall goal of this project is to fill in these knowledge gaps and develop a better understanding of how Pst populations migrate in the central plains on an annual basis and which weather variables are the best predictors of future epidemics."

However, producing hybrid seed is expensive relative to self or open-pollinated crops. In some crops, such as soybeans and wheat, the biology of the plant is prohibitive to the economical production of hybrid seed, thus disabling the realization of the benefits of hybridity in these crops.

In 1963, the USDA standardized electronic moisture sampling. Today, all U.S. grain terminals/elevators are required to use electronic moisture sampling machines that are calibrated and inspected to USDA standards.Problem: Efficiently obtaining a grain sample for moisture testing. Grain elevators charge dockage fees to farmers for grain that is too wet or too dry. Farmers must use full-sized combines to test moisture. This method requires hours of driving time, depreciation ($120/hr.), fuel, and labor expenses. A 2000-acre wheat farm missing the optimum harvest time loses $1600/day. Urban farmers and University test plots(50,000 head rows and 18,000 test plots in Nebraska alone) lack a cost effective method to harvest grain other than hand harvesting. The proposed miniaturized combine, a handheld, battery-powered device to rapidly harvest, thresh, and test moisture will eliminate the need to use large equipment for sampling.Objective: Collaboration with University of Nebraska Agronomy Department and Innovation Campus will test the accuracy and mechanical design on multiple varieties of grain. Field trials other than UNL plots, in major grain producing states (Texas through Montana) will be carried out simultaneously with test units operated by select farmers and custom grain harvesters. Educational outreach will be accomplished through UNL&#39;s Extension Educators, multiple state tradeshows, field demonstrations, and traditional marketing avenues aimed at grain growers.Anticipated Results: Our device will allow farmers to quickly sample any field, any time, to monitor moisture. University seed breeders will harvest test plots without cross contamination of varieties. Urban farmers will finally harvest backyard or small farm grains mechanically.

Planted acreage is down thirty percent since the 1980s, in large part due to competition from other crops with higher returns. Net returns to farmers from wheat are consistently half or less than that from corn and soy. Further, the rate of growth in wheat yield has stalled and historically has grown at one fourth that of corn (USDA ERS). The Economic Research Service posits that genetic improvement of wheat has been slower due to the complexity of the wheat genome and the lower value capture opportunities for the private sector from investments in research (USDA Wheat Baseline 2012-21). The competitiveness of U.S. wheat will depend upon reversing these trends, including stimulating yield growth rates through private sector investment.With the aim of increasing yield in wheat, we have used TILLING, a reverse genetics tool, to identify novel alleles of candidate wheat yield genes in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. These alleles will be evaluated for the ability to alter wheat architecture and improve yield in the greenhouse and field during the scope of this proposal. Following successful field trials, Arcadia will license these technologies for commercialization through one or more of our current wheat partners. As a non-GM technology, products from TILLING can rapidly advance to commercialization and do not face market or regulatory restrictions. With a conservative 5% increase in yield, the yearly value creation to the U.S. farmer is estimated at over $30/hectare. In addition, the value of higher yielding wheat varieties to a seed company arising from this research in the U.S. alone is more than $40 million annually. In summary, by incorporating favorable alleles of plant architecture genes into a commercial wheat breeding program we believe we can make a significant contribution to improving yield in this vital food crop."

Rather than exporting raw grain farmers and rural communities in Montana (and other states with significant small grains production) would benefit significantly from value added grain based manufacturing. In Montana feed barley is an important rotation crop for wheat especially in dry land cropping systems but production has declined due to lack of markets. Principals with Montana BioAgriculture Inc. (MBAI) developed a patented biological process to produce 60% protein concentrates from barley and working with USDA ARS developed potential markets as a protein ingredient in aquaculture feeds. Commercializing barley protein concentrate (BPC) would create a significant new market for barley and increase employment in rural communities. The process has been scaled up and currently operates at 500 ton/year BPC in a large pilot facility. The BPC process as currently operated produces ethanol as a co-product. However the price of ethanol has been volatile and declined significantly with the drop in oil prices. MBAI sees an opportunity to increase protein production and integrate organic acids and beta glucans as more valuable co-products. Multiple co-products independent of volatile energy prices would make this technology much more economically resilient and ensure long term benefits to farmers and rural communities.In the current process design yeast are used to ferment sugars from carbohydrate hydrolysis to ethanol. In the proposed project, yeast would be replaced with selected fungi to produce both high protein cell mass and organic acids with value as bio-based chemicals. Beta glucans in the barley will also be recovered. Proof of concept for the phase 1 project is to design and test at lab scale an overall process integrating increased protein, organic acids and beta glucan production with the BPC process. Specific objectives and work plan will: 1) Select a fungal strain, design process for increased protein and organic acid production 2) Design beta glucan recovery process 3) Design and test integrated process and determine product yields 4) Evaluate different barley varieties for superior characteristics in the process 5) Assess BPC co-product economics and benefits to the rural economy of North Central Montana. Phase II will scale the process in the existing pilot plant to design process integration in the commercial plant."

There is a recognized need for alternative feed formulations (those including agricultural oils and proteins, such as soybean meal, soy protein concentrate, wheat and corn gluten, canola, poultry and other animal processing by-products, microalgae, etc.), but these top-end predators are often highly averse to eating conventional hard, extruded pellets; and, in aquaculture, are often fed a diet of  trash fish  bycatch or whole fresh/frozen forage fisheries products such as sardines or pilchards. Continued reliance on these limited, price-volatile, wild-caught  wet fish  resources present a critical constraint to the sustainable expansion of high-end marine aquaculture and its ability to produce healthy, efficiently grown, desirable fish for a growing and increasingly prosperous global population. Kampachi Farms has sought to resolve this issue by adapting the USDA-developed  Formulated Sardine  - a fibrous, high-moisture, soft extruded strip of formulated feed which more closely mimics the texture of natural fish - to high-end marine fish such as groupers and tunas. By switching to a formulated diet, sustainable, scalable agricultural oils and proteins can be incorporated into the diets of these high-value fish, rendering their expanded commercial production both more economically attractive to investors, and more environmentally sound.Phase I research thoroughly demonstrated the feasibility of this concept by conducting palatability and grow-out trials to determine if Formulated Sardines would be accepted by high-value marine carnivores and generate acceptable growth rates attractive to commercial culture. Several experimental formulations of Formulated Sardines were developed and manufactured by USDA ARS fish nutritionist Dr. Frederic Barrows, including the early deployment of a 100% fishmeal-free blend, which became the focus of grow-out trials during this study. All experimental diets were formulated to be nutritionally suitable for the two species tested: the relatively sedentary Giant Grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) and the more active kampachi (Seriola rivoliana). Growth, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and feed waste metrics were compared between populations of both species fed wet fish diets, pelleted diets and Formulated Sardines. The results of these trials were promising, with Formulated Sardines accepted by both grouper and yellowtail at comparable rates to their standard feeds, producing no significant differences in growth performance or FCR. The fact that these results were attained with a 0% fishmeal formulation, months to years ahead of when that development was expected, only underscores the Formulated Sardine feed format&#39;s potential for commercial utility in the culture of high-value marine finfish such as grouper and tuna. The apparent palatability of these diets in Grouper and Yellowtail studies also suggests several additional areas across the hatchery production cycles of these species where Formulated Sardine-type diets could provide significant advantages over traditional feeds.Kampachi Farms therefore proposes, through this Phase II research, to bring this novel aquafeed format closer to commercial viability by expanding into trials with Pacific Bluefin and Yellowfin Tunas, assessing its efficacy in specialty formulated broodstock diets, and determining the effectiveness of a derivative soft  crumble  product in accelerating weaning of highly prey-selective, difficult-to-rear marine finfish larvae onto formulated feeds."

Overall, our project will develop new tactics for wireworms that are cost-effective and targeted for specific species and environmental conditions. Our research could have broad applicability beyond cereals as the resurgence of wireworms is a matter of national concern, with over 45 crops affected.

Yields of wheat must be doubled in the next 30 years to avert a major food crisis . Research to enhance wheat photosynthesis may facilitate improvement of potential biomass, but yield benefits may be small unless &#39;useful&#39;, as against &#39;non useful&#39;, biomass can be discriminated and maximized. Harvest index (HI, grain dry matter (DM) yield / aboveground DM) has a hypothetical limit of 65% in wheat and also there has been no significant progress in its maximum expression of HI from post Green Revolution values of ca. 45-51% in spring wheat and 50-55% in winter wheat. Recent yield improvement of CIMMYT spring wheats in the Yaqui Valley (North-West Mexico) has been associated with increased aboveground biomass and grain weight, but also with increased plant height and decreased HI. Furthermore, the expression of HI in this range is unpredictable in both the genetic and environmental context. Stable expression of HI at values of 55% and abovewould deliver a step change (~20%) in yield potential (given that the average expression is closer to 45%), however, a limited understanding of its genetic basis restricts the ability to improve HI. Overwhelming evidence suggests that during grain filling wheat yield potential is sink-limited (grain number per spike and unit area), as carbon accumulation is limited by the storage capacity of the grains Therefore, strategies to improve grain number per unit area are one of the most important avenues in the genetic improvement of HI and yield potential.Our long-term goal is to develop an ideal ideotype with HI &ge; 60% by combining increased spike partitioning, fruiting efficiency, fertile florets per spikelet, and improved spike morphology. The specific objectives are to develop new breeder-friendly molecular markers for grain partitioning traits that permit photosynthetic products to be consistently translated to grain yield, screen genetic resources determining grain partitioning in high biomass backgrounds, identify mechanisms determining grain partitioning traits, and design ideal plant ideotypes for high HI and yield. We will achieve our goals by: 1) characterizing two association panels, CIMMYT spring wheat and US soft wheat, for photosynthetic capacity, HI, grain yield and grain partitioning traits, including spike partitioning fruiting efficiency and their determinants stem internode and lemma partitioning and rachis specific weight, 2) genetic characterization of the panels using genotype by sequence-SNP markers, and validated them in bi-parental populations after converting them into KASP-SNPs 3) screening wider resources for better understanding of the range of potential alleles influencing these grain traits and interactions with environments 4) designing ideotypes and establishing pre-breeding crosses.

Hybrid wheat, which is more climate resilient than pureline wheat, can contribute to achieving this goal. The project objectives are to: (1) screen two large wheat breeding programs for the floral and plant traits needed for efficient hybrid seed production and hybrid performance; (2) create and test hybrids to establish and confirm heterotic pools in wheat; (3) genotype the lines going into the heterotic pools and improve algorithms to separate lines into maximum likelihood pools for future testing and validation; and (4) map restorer genes in T. timopheevi cytoplasm and create a series of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) tester lines, their maintainer lines, and a series of elite restorer lines (R-lines) and begin to determine the efficacy of CMS-based hybrid systems. The project team has made great strides in the U.S. and abroad toward developing the tools to foster hybrid wheat development to maximize wheat yield potential. Using an integrated approach involving in-house germplasm, chemical hybridizing agents, breeding, phenotyping, genomic selection, and quantitative trait loci mapping, this project is expected to help create the scientific and germplasm foundations for successfully launching the hybrid wheat industry in the U.S. and is thus relevant to the NIFA-IWYP program."

Genetic mapping studies in crops, fueled by the availability of whole genome sequences, identified a number of genes controlling major agronomic traits including yield components. The release of the annotated genome sequence and the development of functional genomics tools for wheat now provides the opportunity to easily extrapolate gene mapping information from other crops to wheat.CRISPR/CAS9-based genome editing has emerged as a disruptive technology that can take full advantage of the available genomic information and help to rapidly validate gene candidates identified by the inter-species comparative analyses, or help to transfer traits among wheat cultivars. The technology relies on the ability of short sequence called guiding RNA (gRNA) to guide enzyme CAS9 capable of cutting DNA to a precise location in the genome. The CAS9/gRNA complex then acts as a pair of scissors to cut DNA and introduce changes into the genetic code of specific genes. Our project will explore the capabilities of this novel CAS9-based gene editing technology to unlock the potential of the complex wheat genome, thereby building a foundation for transformative approaches to wheat improvement that can be deployed in both the public and private sectors.We have identified 18 genes that in rice or maize that have a potential to affect yield component traits in wheat. We will use CAS9-based editing technology to modify these genes in wheat cultivars and then assess whether the introduced changes in genes result in positive changes in the yield component traits. This will allow us not only to create wheat lines with the improved yield components but also to optimize the CAS9-based technology for manipulating the wheat genome. This knowledge will be critical for devising future gene editing strategies to improve other agronomic traits in wheat. For the newly developed variants of genes affecting yield components we will initiate the transfer into the adapted cultivars grown in Kansas and Oklahoma. These efforts will help us to assess the value of gene editing for wheat improvement and establish a pipeline for deploying this technology in wheat breeding programs.The project will train a new generation of breeders and geneticists in genome editing technology and the regulatory aspects of crop biotechnology thereby contributing to fulfilling the needs of industry, stakeholders, and academia in a trained workforce and making wheat production more profitable. By pursuing these objectives, the project will address one of the key aims of the NIFA-IWYP to increase the genetic component of wheat yield and achieve sustainable intensification of agricultural production. The project is closely integrated with the Wheat CAP and is a part of overarching International Wheat Yield Partnership program aimed at increasing the genetic yield potential of wheat using innovative approaches."

We will also use Deep Learning to automatically measure important traits from UAV captured images in ways that are consistent with what an expert breeder would do in the field. This approach will provide an &#39;eye-in-the-skies&#39; to give breeders additional information for quickly identifying the best new varieties out of thousands of field plots.These approaches using UAVs for rapid measurement of large field trials in wheat breeding developed through this project will be implemented in powerful and breeder-friendly software. These tools will enable breeders to more effectively and quickly identify superior new varieties and deliver them to farmers. The rapid development and delivery of high-yielding varieties is a critical part of maintaining stable food supplies and obtaining global food security."

Current rates of improvement for wheat grain yield are not sufficient to feed a rapidly growing human population. Further increases in global wheat production will benefit from the identification and characterization of genes controlling wheat yield. The identification of these genes is a necessary first step to understand how these genes work, how they interact with each other and with the environment and how to combine them to accelerate the rates of wheat improvement for grain yield.In our previous Collaborative Agricultural Project (Triticeae CAP), we identified several wheat chromosome regions that have a positive effect on grain yield. However, the genes responsible for these beneficial effects remain unknown. The tools required for the identification and validation of these genes have been recently developed for wheat, including the first genome sequence and the development of sequenced mutant populations for gene validation. The application of these new tools to the well-characterized genetic populations developed in our previous project provides a unique opportunity to identify the genes controlling grain yield. Today, wheat is in a situation similar to that of rice after the release of its genome sequence in 2005, which resulted in an exponential increase in the number of identified genes in rice. In this project we propose to use these new tools to identify 15 genes controlling grain size, grain number, reproductive tiller number and overall grain yield. The chromosome regions controlling these traits have been identified in our previous grant. In this project, we will develop very large mapping populations segregating only for the chromosome region of interest and will use this genetic information to define precisely the candidate gene region. We will then use the recently released wheat genome sequence to identify all the genes present in the targeted region and to identify candidate genes. These candidate genes will be validated using available sequenced mutant populations and transgenic approaches including genome editing.These beneficial gene variants will be incorporated into elite breeding wheat lines to test their effect on grain yield in different environments. Lines differing only in the selected genes will be developed to test precisely the effect of the targeted genes. In addition, we will test the effect of different gene combinations on overall grain yield.A long-term constraint to future increases in wheat production in the USA is the limited number of trained plant breeders. In this project we will train the next generation of plant breeders, providing direct experience in field-based research, experimental design and bioinformatics tools. Our group has access to active breeding programs supported by the Universities, which will provide a perfect environment to train students in plant breeding. In addition, we will provide students online conferences and courses, face-to-face workshops, student seminars, and student discussion workshops. Each student will lead one gene identification and one gene deployment program. Students will see firsthand the challenges and rewards of transferring value from research to commercial varieties. Finally, the interaction with CIMMYT will provide students a global vision of plant breeding. The simultaneous training of a cohort of 15 PhD students will enhance the opportunities for collaboration and teach students the value of team work to solve complex problems. Results from this project will be disseminated in two ways. First, by releasing germplasm and varieties with alleles for increased yield. Growers will be able to see in their fields the benefits of this research. Isogenic lines carrying the selected alleles will be also showcased in field days and demonstration trials to show growers and industry concrete examples of the value generated by this research project. Results from comparative yield trials will be presented in local grower meetings, wheat commissions, and local agronomic journals to directly reach the growers. Second, results will be presented in publications in peer reviewed scientific journals and in national and international scientific conferences. Students will be encouraged to disseminate their work in posters, conferences and field day presentationsThe ultimate goal of this project is to accelerate the rate of wheat improvement for grain yield without jeopardizing its quality and nutritional value."

However, like rice, maize, and sorghum, it is achieving barely 50% of the annual yield progress rate necessary to meet food needs widely forecast for 2050. For over ten years an approach melding ecophysiological and quantitative genetic modeling has been evolving the potential to accelerate breeding rates of gain. This entails a two-step process that first fits crop models to data and then association maps the resulting parameter values to genetic markers. However, technological limits impede collection of the large amounts of needed plant trait data, especially the geometry of dense plant canopies.Targeting Kansas wheat breeding trials, this project is a proof-of-concept test combining microwave radar sensing with a novel, inversion algorithm to ameliorate the situation. The basic rationale is that (1) it is unnecessary to sense the 3D position, angle, and size of every tiller and leaf in a trial plot - rather one desires the genetic markers and effect sizes associated with these quantities&#39; statistical distributions; (2) models interrelating markers and morphology exist; (3) if radar calculations for plant canopies can be accelerated, then the models in (2) can be inverted to yield genetics in a single-step; and (4) an extension of the Analytical Element Method (AEM) from hydrology to electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation can provide such a speed up.Briefly, the AEM exactly solves the field equations for very simple shapes that are then combined to yield machine accurate-answers for complex geometries. Unlike solvers in common use, the AEM only calculates solutions at the specific points of interest, thus hugely reducing computational loads. Prior work has found AEM sollutions for EM waves in two dimensions. This project will extend those solutions to full 3D.Concurrently, an existing wheat model that predicts highly realistic plant shapes will be modified so its outputs are expressed in terms of the AEM basic shapes. A three-layer model will then be built comprising [genetic markers : plant shapes : EM fields] and solved by probablistic methods. This will yield the genetic markers most associated with the plant shapes sensed by radar. The method will be tested by team members with radar expertise using the facilities of the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets. Experiments in a large anechoic chamber will compare AEM predictions to actual radar reflectance data for simplified targets. The EM properties of wheat at radar frequencies will also be measured in the chamber using small, movable plots.Based on these data, a prototype field system will be constructed and used to gather plot data in a field trial conducted as part of the on-going Kansas wheat breeding program. Two tests will be performed. First the radar data will be association mapped directly to detect any responses to genetically determined canopy features. If positive results are found, they will be compared to published phenotypic mapping studies and hypotheses developed as to features to which the radar might be responding. The second test will solve the three layer model described above and also compare the results to literature."

In particular, the increased frequency and severity of drought and high temperature conditions makes it imperative to develop crop plants with Effective Water Use (EWU) that maximize productivity with available soil water. Traditional breeding approaches that focus on selecting for yield within drought-prone or variable environments have been slow to identify superior genotypes and useful genetic markers for EWU. Efforts to identify physiological traits that control EWU have been hindered by insufficient methods to measure phenotypes in a high-throughput manner. In particular, the lack of tools with which to measure plant water status (water potential) in situ presents a critical barrier for the development of appropriate phenotyping methods. This proposal unites a team of experts in materials engineering (Stroock), plant breeding and genetics and high-throughput phenotyping (Gore), and water relations and crop modeling (Riha and Melkonian) to address this challenge. The team hypothesizes that the ability to measure leaf water stress (water potential)within an integrated, high throughput phenotyping strategy will allow for the discovery and quantification of new traits that define EWU in important crops (maize, and later wheat) and lead to the identification of genetic loci that control them. To test this hypothesis, the proposed effort will develop synthetic microparticulate sensors ( aquaDust ) that can be embedded in the leaf mesophyll to provide optical signals that respond to plant water stress. Further, the team will build phenotyping strategies for EWU based on this new capability, conventional measurement tools, and crop models."

While wheat yield isimpacted by climate change, the rate of wheat genetic yield gain, which is mainly driven by increase in grain number (GN) per unit area of land, has slowed down. Under such a backdrop, the International Wheat Yield Partnership (IWYP) was set up with a common goal to increase wheat yields by 50% by 2034. To meet this demand, annual wheat yield increases must grow from the current level of below 1% to at least 1.7%. This quantum increase in genetic yield will require the development of breakthrough approaches for wheat improvement. This project seeks to increase wheat yield potential through precise modification of the genetic factors (genes) controlling wheat grain size (GS) or grain weight (GW), which arebelieved to be major drivers for further yield growth, using the most updated genome-editing technology called CRISPR/Cas9. The research team will first improve the efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in wheat, integrate it into the wheat transformation vector, and develop 30 constructs to knock out 20 GS/GN genes for novel variation. These 30 constructs will be used to generate 150 transgenic wheat lines. Every tiller of the transgenic plants will be screened for desired mutations using sensitive molecular assays, and GS traits will be measured using a computer image-based high throughput approach. Eventually the mutants showing increased GS will be selected, and knowledge of GS genetics will be gained. Compared to traditional genetic engineering, a significant advantage of the genome-editing technologies is that their end products, the knockout mutants, can be non-GMO. Therefore, the useful mutants developed from this project can be used in wheat breeding as novel germplasm. Finally, some of the useful mutations will be transferred into durum wheat to improve its yield potential. Thus, this project is expected to significantly contribute to a more profitable wheat industry, US rural economy and the IWYP&#39;s goal."

However, we don&#39;t yet know the extent to which freezing tolerance is controlled by ICE, and which parts are independent of it. This project aims to identify which genes are controlled by the ICE gene family, to quantify the effects of specific ICE genes on freezing survival. This will be accomplished with mutants that have predicted impairment or loss of function mutations in their ICE genes.By comparing RNA sequencing results from mutant and non-mutant plants under both cold-shocked and constant-warm conditions, we will identify what genes are regulated by the ICE gene family. Furthermore, by freezing the mutant and non-mutant plants, and measuring the amount of damage they sustain, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify how much the ICE gene family contributes to plant survival. Ultimately, accomplishing these objectives will improve our understanding of freezing tolerance regulation in wheat, with implications in other species as well. The project also contributes to our understanding of a key gene family in plants, and will inform future efforts to better control freezing tolerance in plant species."

However, we lack a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the effects of organic amendments on soil water. This Predoctoral Research Proposal aims to quantify the influence of organic amendments on plant available water and crop yield via changes to soil structure. I will leverage existing dryland wheat plots amended with manure, and add trials with biochar and super absorbent polymers, for comparison. We will monitor the soil profile in the field and determine soil aggregate structure and plant available moisture. These impacts on soil structure and hydrology will be paired with crop yield responses to derive an understanding of amendment effects on production. Further, in the laboratory, we will determine effective amendment application rates for different soil textures. Data generated from these studies will inform models to predict effects of organic amendments in agroecosystems, thus, helping farmers making effective management decisions. Overall this project will contribute to better managing soil moisture and dryland yields, addressing the Challenge Area of Agricultural and Natural Resources Science for Climate Variability and Foundational Program Area of Agriculture Systems and Technology."

Traditional breeding increased crop yields by manipulating components of plant architecture including height, branching, and floral organ development. Since the inception of hybrid maize breeding in 1908, yield gains driven by increasing leaf angle allowed higher planting densities and achieved higher nitrogen utilization from nitrogen fertilizer application. In many cereals, such as rice and wheat, the  Green Revolution  utilized dwarf varieties deficient in gibberellin (GA) synthesis or signaling to increase the harvest index. This approach has not yet been successful in maize and I have demonstrated that we lack fundamental understanding of how GA interacts with other determinants of maize plant growth. My research seeks to understand the mutual interdependence of three plant hormones that control maize plant architecture: brassinosteroids (BRs), strigolactones (SLs), and GA. BRs interact with both GA and SLs to regulate plant architecture in Arabidopsis thaliana; however, BR, GA, and SL interactions are unknown in maize. I will profile the expression of maize genes, by RNA-Seq experiments, which will describe transcriptional overlap of these plant hormones and their interactions. GA and BR deficient mutants will be analyzed for differential transcript abundance to comprehensively describe response of every gene in the genome to the absence of these growth regulators. Treatments of a BR deficient mutant with SL, GA, and a GA inhibitor will be analyzed for effects on plant height and branching. All of the genes that change in their expression in response to these hormones will also be identified. This will provide a list of the genes that can control plant development in response to these growth regulators. To further elucidate BR regulation, I will mutagenize BR-deficient mutants to identify genes that can enhance and suppress the dwarfism, altered branching, and abnormal flowers in BR-deficient plants. I will further my computational biology skills by developing a next-generation sequencing approach to identify the mutations responsible for modification of BR phenotypes. Knowledge of the hormonal influences, interactions, and the molecular identities of the genes responsible for maize architecture will permit targeted improvement to increase yields and feed our ever-growing population."

The long-term goal of this project is to understand the molecular basis of disease in cereal grain crops, with a focus on an important fungal disease of barley. A basic understanding of how pathogens cause disease is a critical part of developing crops with enhanced resistance. While many diseases can be controlled through the use of pesticides, genetic resistance remains the safest and most attractive method for pathogen control. However, our current lack of knowledge of how fungal pathogens manipulate plant cells during infection is a major hurdle to developing resistant crops. Ultimately, results from this project can be used in crop breeding programs to improve disease resistance in agriculture. This research is a fundamental step towards making crops able to fight off new and emerging pathogen threats. This is an important part of ensuring our nation&#39;s food security while protecting the environment.Plant pathogens use virulence proteins to manipulate host cells during infection. One goal of this project is to understand how these virulence proteins function by identifying which proteins they interact with once inside the plant cell. Host proteins are likely targeted by the pathogen because they control some aspect of plant resistance or susceptibility. Another goal of this research is to quantify key cellular changes that occur within resistant and susceptible plants during pathogen infection. Changes in protein levels will be incorporated into a global model that can predict key genes that control plant immunity. These models will be validated by testing genes for their role in plant resistance and/or susceptibility. Completion of the project will open a window into the cereal immune system and identify weak points (i.e. proteins targeted by the pathogen) that can be pursued in breeding programs for enhanced disease resistance. This research will lead to improvement of barley genetic stocks and there is high likelihood that knowledge gained will be easily transferred to other important cereals such as wheat."

Over 1B loblolly pine seedlings are planted annually in the US. Fusiform rust galls can directly kill pine trees, or weaken the stem, reducing wood yield and/or wood quality. Annual yield losses likely exceed $100M, with estimates varying by economic assumptions. As a consequence, selection for genetic resistance to fusiform rust is a primary objective of all southern pine breeding programs. Genetic resistance to rust diseases is also a primary breeding objective for many agronomically important crops including wheat (reviewed in [17]). This requirement to continue breeding for host resistance is driven in large part by the rapid adaptation and evolution of biotrophic pathogens to defeat host resistance.Host genetic resistance to fusiform rust has long been recognized, but breeders still lack the tools to track resistance directly. Laborious and expensive phenotypic screening is the only current option to assess rust resistance, which is carried out in large-scale inoculation trials at the Resistance Screening Center, Asheville, NC. There is a critical need to identify markers associated with rust resistance, to guide breeding, selection and deployment of seedlings. To date, Fr (fusiform rust resistance) genes have been mapped with low resolution using anonymous markers. Unfortunately such markers are not consistent across tree strains, and cannot be readily identified in genomic reference sequences. I anticipate Fr genes will be similar to rust resistance genes in other plants, a speculation that is supported by the discovery of a candidate NB-LRR gene for Fr1 in the loblolly pine reference genome. Since there is strong evidence for specific genetic interactions in this pathosystem, my collaborating mentor&#39;s team also screened for and discovered markers linked to the gene for avirulence to Fr1 [Avr1, which I subsequently fine mapped in a controlled cross heterozygous Avr1/avr1]. The convergence of these two data sets, Avr1 in Cqf and Fr1 in loblolly pine, enables me to concurrently fine map genetically interacting loci in the host and pathogen genomes. I hypothesize the two interacting loci in the host and pathogen genomes will influence patterns of variation in one another. Thus, this project accomplishes a foundational area of the Program Area Priorities by supporting research that will improve plant health and production of the loblolly pine.I will use bioinformatics methods to map DNA and RNA sequencing data to the Cqf and loblolly pine genome and identify patterns with selection as we expect for Avr1 and Fr1. These methods will identify regions in the Cqf and loblolly pine genome that contain genes responsible for virulence and disease-resistance in the Cqf and loblolly pin genome respectively.Identification of avirulence genes in the Cqf genome will enable forest managers to determine the presence of virulent Cqf galls in their forest and take appropriate management and containment measures. It will also aid the tracking of virulent strains of Cqf across the southern United States. Identification of resistance genes in the loblolly pine genome will aid tree breeders by allowing them to accurately select for disease resistance in their breeding programs and to deploy resistant seedlings in the field in regions where virulent Cqf is present."

Under low soil moisture, N mineralization (Nmin) is constrained by reduced microbial access to carbon and nutrients required for metabolic processes. Selecting cultivars with certain root exudation traits may alleviate microbial carbon and N constraints such that Nmin can be relatively maintained under drought. The goal of this proposal is to explore cultivar rhizosphere-microbial interactions as a mechanism for enhanced plant-available N under water stress. I will pursue the following objectives:1: Characterize root exudation rates and chemistry across a spectrum of drought-tolerant and -susceptible wheat cultivars.2: Determine how root exudation rate and chemistry mediate microbial N cycling and subsequently wheat N-uptake under drought vs. well-watered conditions.3: Evaluate the functional importance of cultivar rhizosphere interactions related to Nmin at the field-scale. To address these objectives I will use both greenhouse and field experiments, combined with metabolomics to characterize root exudation traits related to drought tolerance. I will use microbial metagenomics, along with other microbial functional assays, to inform how exudate patterns and soil moisture influence Nmin mechanisms. The training I will receive in these methods, increasingly required for understanding plant-microbial interactions, aligns with the science advancement AFRI ELI goal. Experimental outcomes will demonstrate if and how cultivar exudation traits alleviate drought-induced N limitations and improve cropping system drought resiliency. Thus, this Postdoctoral Research proposal addresses the Foundational Area of Bioenergy, natural resources, and environment and the Challenge Area of Agricultural and Natural Resources Science for Climate Variability and Change."

Perennial crop species are central to the overall sustainable intensification of cropping systems for food, feed, fiber, and fuel. Dual-use crops that can serve as a biofuel feedstock in addition to a source of edible grain add additional economic potential to the cropping systems that are needed to meet projected demand for both food and fuel. Historical efforts to create perennial grain species with both vigorous perennial regrowth and high grain yield has remained challenging, leading to efforts to instead domesticate perennial species to improve traits like increased seed size, non-shattering, and free threshing. Intermediate wheatgrass (IWG), or Thinopyrum intermedium, is a strong perennial species with prolific biomass production, relatively large seeds and high grain yield that has been targeted for domestication as a dual-use perennial grain and biomass crop. IWG and related Thinopyrum species have long served as an important gene reservoir for wheat breeding, including attempts to develop perennial wheat through hybridization with a relative of IWG, Thinopyrum elongatum. As a perennial crop, IWG can provide essential ecosystem services to current agricultural practices such as stabilizing soil with its deep (&gt;3 meters) root structure, reducing nutrient runoff, and limiting weed growth. For biofuels, IWG produces biomass quantities similar or greater than switchgrass, with the added potential of &gt;1,000 kg/ha of grain that is comparable to wheat in food products.Significant efforts to improve IWG through traditional breeding have focused on traits such as plant height, biomass production, seed size, free threshing ability, and early maturity. While some progress has been made, accelerating the improvement of IWG is likely possible using modern genomics-based breeding tools. There are limited molecular breeding and genomic tools for IWG due to its large, highly repetitive genome. Ongoing efforts to develop genomic tools for IWG and the high quality reference genomes for species across the Triticeae provide a novel platform for exploring the genomic landscape of plant perenniality using comparative genomic and systems approaches. Currently, there is only a nascent understanding of the complex genetics of perenniality across the plant kingdom, which has limited the development of vigorous perennial crops that produce consistent yields year to year and limited the perennialization of annual crop species.An improved understanding of the genomic landscape of the annual vs. perennial growth habit could enable the development of other robust perennial crop species, like IWG, suitable for wide scale production. An enhanced understanding of the complex suite of genes underlying perenniality will enable the improvement of current perennial biomass and grain crops, along with providing vital resources to address the long-standing goal of &#39;perennializing&#39; annual crops like rice, wheat, and sorghum. Additionally, unraveling the genome evolution within the Thinopyrum genus will improve our basic knowledge regarding the sources of novel traits introgressed from Thinopyrum species into wheat."

Seeds also represent the main laboratory-to-field delivery system for technologies addressing significant agricultural problems such as enhanced crop performance under stressful conditions, disease and insect control, and weed management. Therefore, seeds play numerous, indispensable roles in agricultural systems confronted with current and future challenges related to food security, energy needs, natural resources protection and sustainable agricultural intensification in the face of climate change. Communicating new advances in seed biology research ensures robust agricultural systems primed to confront these problems. However, expansion of new seed-based solutions that enhance U.S. agriculture are at risk due to decreases in research programs and educational opportunities within seed science. Thus, objectives of the 12th International Seed Conference are to: 1) enable exchange of new scientific information that can stimulate innovation needed to generate novel solutions and 2) improve educational experiences and career prospects of future seed scientists. The objectives will be achieved by inviting leading global seed scientists to discuss how seeds function as or within biological systems. Moreover, post-doctoral and graduate researchers will actively particpate in the program by co-hosting oral session, delivering invited presentations and introducing posters via 1-minute talks. Additionally, a workshop will focus on career opportunities and networking for this group of newly trained scientists."

Drought stress is the most important limitation for corn production in the USA and globally, and drought stress is expected to become more severe in coming decades as a result of global climate change. We have observed that corn lines with a large number of small vessels perform better under drought. In this project we will confirm and extend these results, and also identify genes that are responsible for this natural variation.Defining and understanding traits improving the drought tolerance of crops is needed to breed crop varieties with better yield, better drought tolerance, and less reliance on irrigation. Insufficient information exists regarding the value of xylem vessels in crop breeding. Should the importance of xylem vessels for drought tolerance be demonstrated, an entirely new tool will be available for targeted crop improvement. This project will provide validated breeding targets, germplasm sources, molecular markers, and candidate genes that could be used directly in maize breeding. Our close collaboration with maize geneticists will ensure that any useful results will be readily applied in the maize community. While this project focuses on maize, xylem vessels may also be useful breeding targets in wheat, rice, legumes, and other crops.

Hence, the ability to feed the growing human population critically depends on the availability of crop varieties with increasing drought tolerace. Drought induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants, which causes oxidative damage. We hypothesize that crop varieties that more efficiently manage ROS homeostasis may better protect cells from this damage and avoid subsequent yield losses. The complexity of ROS homeostasis, however, has impeded the identification of the contribution of individual genes that could be used in breeding programs. Furthermore, the measurement of ROS is difficult due to their chemical complexity and short life-time. Our group recently developed a technique that overcomes these challenges by quantifiying the peroxisome - an organelle and ROS sink - as a proxy for intracellular ROS. In this study, we will use wheat as a model system to: (1) measure the effect of drought on ROS homeostasis and crop yield in varieties that perform differently under water-limited conditions; and (2) determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of ROS homeostasis in drought-tolerant varieties. The results are expected to inform how the accumulation of ROS influences yield under drought, and what strategies cells use for maintaining ROS homeostasis. This knowledge will contribute to future security of food by improving the theoretical and technological bases for breeding drought-tolerant crops. The goals of this project align with Program Areas  Plant Health and Production and Plant Products  and  Physiology of Agricultural Plants. "

Alien gene transfer has been an effective approach for wheat germplasm enhancement. Sea wheatgrass (SWG) is a distant relative of wheat and a relatively untapped source for wheat improvement. We have identified and developed a large number of SWG-derived populations withhigh tolerance to waterlogging, manganese toxicity, salinity, heat, and low nitrogen levels as well asresistance to wheat streak mosaic virus (temperature-insensitive), Fusarium head blight, and sawflies (due to solid stem). This project seeks to facilitate simultaneous discovery and transfer of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for biotic stress resistance and abiotic stress tolerance more efficiently by combining molecular marker genotyping and molecular cytogenetics. The research team will first develop a draft SWG genome assembly and 140 SWG-specific markers. These SWG-specific markers will be used to screen the common wheat-backcrossed populations for individuals containing one or two SWG chromosomes as putative wheat-SWG addition lines, which will be further validated by genomic in-situ hybridization (GISH) by differentially painting the SWG chromosomes. This is the first and critical step in dissection of the SWG genome foruse of SWG genes to improve wheat sustainability.

Grain legumes are typically grown in rotation with cereal grains, including wheat and corn. This rotation is advantageous for multiple reasons. Studies suggest that it may disrupt the life-cycle of diverse pathogens, while promoting symbiosis with rhizobacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia which benefits legume roots. Grain legumes also complement the nutritional qualities of small cereal grains. U.S. agriculture currently generates 18.2M cwt of dry pea and 2.5M cwt of chickpea annually, with the northern states leading in production volume. Given the increasing global demand for vegetable protein that will be needed in coming years, the U.S. is well-positioned to establish itself as an even larger exporter of these crops with successful breeding programs. In the last two decades, advancements in DNA sequencing and molecular technologies have significantly improved plant breeding. Phenotyping is a key adjunct to these genomics approaches, which allows for thorough evaluation of desirable plant traits and confident se-lection of high-performing breeding lines that can be widely distributed. Unfortunately, the capacity for high-throughput plant phenotyping is non-existent due to the lack of applicable sensing and automation technologies that are well-established and able to be implemented into breeding programs. Therefore, a critical need exists to develop sensor-based approaches for high-throughput crop phenotyping that rapidly and accurately assess breeding materials and bring this important analysis into the 21st century. The overall goal of this research is to develop novel and advanced sensing tools that enable accurate and unbiased plant phenotyping at a rapid pace using grain legume as a target crop. Besides being important for sustainable cereal crop production through efficient rotation, such efforts will ultimately result in improved selection of high yielding legume crop varieties that can be grown in the U.S. In addition, these phenotyping techniques can be easily adapted to other crops."

Phosphorus is mined from natural deposits, but these deposits are diminishing. Contemporary reports indicate that there is a pending phosphorus crisis, as global supplies dwindle and demand for food increases. Currently, the utilization of phosphorus for fertilizer is energy intensive and expensive. Phosphorus supply is limited, and its recovery from food and other wastes and water bodies is virtually non-existent. Traditionally, agricultural production has been optimized with little or no consideration of the losses of phosphorus beyond its use in producing crops. This practice leads to large energy needs for fertilizer production and for treatment of phosphorus waste in agricultural run-off, and food and animal wastes. The other side to this problem is that some phosphorus applied to agricultural fields is lost to lakes and rivers causing considerable environmental damage. These phosphorus issues significantly influence our food, energy, and water (FEW) systems. Two key approaches to achieve sustainable phosphorus management are agriculture fertilization systems that more efficiently use phosphorous for plant growth and systems that recover phosphorus from food and animal wastes and from biowastes in contaminated water. Unfortunately, we do not have suitable recovery systems due to technological limitations and economic and infrastructure constraints. This project aims to develop an integrated and sustainable management structure that can simultaneously address the major technical challenges in biowaste management and agriculture fertilization systems. This management structure will enable recovery of phosphorous, energy, and water, thus increasing resource use efficiency and providing a new source of phosphorus for agricultural food production. This project integrates novel technologies in multiple fields, including hydrothermal treatment, anaerobic digestion, membrane distillation, struvite production, and magnetic nanoparticle separation to collect and recycle more phosphorous as struvite. The various systems are being analyzed and optimized to fit a number of waste-stream settings in order to reduce overall energy input. This approach offers many benefits such as reduced waste volume, decontamination of pathogens, as well as the production of clean water, energy, and slow release fertilizers. The method is also sufficiently flexible to accommodate different biowaste feedstocks and tunable to produce different recycled nutrient, energy, and water products, sustainable with low resource and energy input, and scalable to suit different levels of management needs. This system is being developed and tested at bench scale, up-scaled to prototype level, and optimized through systems modeling. Crop utilization efficiency and soil retention of the produced struvite fertilizers are being evaluated by growing corn, soybean, and wheat in both potted greenhouse experiments and in field trials. In order to identify the costs and benefits of these combined waste and fertilization management techniques, the researchers are performing a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the phosphorous removed from the various waste streams and recycled for agricultural applications.  This analysis includes an evaluation of the phosphorous recovery and recycling efficiency, examination of the overall energy balance of the systems, a cost estimation of the systems, and an environmental assessment of the system. The project is combining student and postdoctoral researcher training with undergraduate education and promoting STEM research in underrepresented groups and K-12 education on integrated approaches to promote sustainable communities. Finally, the project is promoting awareness, knowledge, and practice of  Sustainability at the FEW Nexus  to a broad range of audiences including both academic and public sectors."

The instrument is to be housed at the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center, an established analytical laboratory performing mass spectrometry-based lipid analysis at Kansas State University. The mass spectrometer acquisition will directly impact and advance the training of postdoctoral trainees, graduate students, and undergraduates. Early-career faculty and faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions will benefit from access to state-of-the-art lipid analysis. Undergraduates learning and using mass spectrometry will include students at Kansas State University, including participants in the McNair and other undergraduate scholars? programs, and from historically black Fayetteville State University. Training will include an annual workshop on mass spectrometry-based lipid analysis (lipidomics) for faculty and trainees and a research club focused on analysis and interpretation of lipidomics data on crop species.  Lipidomics has not reached its ultimate potential as an analytical tool, because the methods, materials, and computational resources to effectively carry out lipid profiling, particularly for plant lipids, are not conveniently available. Thus, Kansas Lipidomics Research Center personnel will aid scientists who wish to implement lipidomics analyses at their institutions by providing consultation, protocols for sample preparation, plug-and-play mass spectral methods, internal standards, and data processing systems, resulting in data suitable for upload to and analysis at a publicly available database. Knowledge obtained through use of the acquired mass spectrometer will be applied to improve food, industry, and energy applications in major crops including sorghum, camelina, and wheat.The acquired Sciex 6500+ mass spectrometer with accessories will provide improved definition of lipid structure while maintaining high sample throughput. The ion mobility spectrometry accessory will improve ability to specify lipid structural features without slowing the analytical work flow, compared to current technologies. The improved lipid structural specificity will provide scientists with the ability to unambiguously assign specific lipids to metabolic maps, connecting quantitative and structural information on plant lipids directly with genes and enzymes, thus transforming our understanding of lipid metabolic pathways in model and crop plants. The mass spectrometer acquisition will deliver critical capabilities for the projects of researchers from fifteen laboratories. Additionally, the mass spectrometer will be made available to new users as well as past and current Kansas Lipidomics Research Center analytical users. Projects will use the high structural definition provided by the Sciex 6500+ with ion mobility spectrometry to link the lipidome accurately with plant genomes and phenomes, while investigating the roles of lipids and the functions of lipid metabolizing and signaling gene products in plants. Lipids will be analyzed in genome wide association studies, and other large-scale studies of genetically variant plant populations, identifying candidate genes putatively functioning in lipid metabolism and signaling during plant stress responses. Other projects will biochemically and functionally characterize lipid metabolic events that occur during plant responses to stress and during growth and development. The new instrument also will advance the work of scientists modifying plant seed oil composition for increased yield and quality. Thus, the acquired mass spectrometer will facilitate food, industrial, and energy crop improvement."

Poole (John Innes Centre, Oxford University, UK)Nitrogen is an essential element of biological molecules and life on earth.  Lack of usable nitrogen limits growth of microbes, plants, and animals. Scarcity of nitrogen in agricultural soils limits plant production of food, feed, fiber and fuel.  Nature solved the nitrogen limitation problem via evolution of biological nitrogen fixation in a type of bacteria, diazotrophs, that are able to reduce atmospheric N2 to NH3, which is readily assimilated into biological molecules.  Biological nitrogen fixation is promoted by a complex metal containing enzyme called nitrogenase, whose oxygen-sensitivity may explain its restricted distribution amongst bacteria.  Some plants, including most legumes and a few non-legumes form intimate, nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs that provide the plants with ammonia.  As a consequence, legumes have been an integral part of sustainable agricultural systems for thousands of years.  Unfortunately, many important food species, including the grasses maize/corn, rice, and wheat cannot establish effective nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs, making them dependent on nitrogenous fertilizers for high yield. Large-scale use of industrially-produced nitrogen-fertilizer has doubled the influx of nitrogen into the terrestrial biogeochemical nitrogen-cycle, with serious negative consequences for human health and the natural environment.   Therefore, the long-term sustainability of massive nitrogen-fertilizer inputs in agriculture has come into question. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators from the US and UK to solve the dual nitrogen problems of nitrogen-fertilizer over-use in developed countries and soil nitrogen-paucity in developing countries by developing effective endophytic (bacteria inside the root) and associative (bacteria attached outside the root) nitrogen-fixing symbioses in a model and a crop plant species.  The overarching goal of the project is to develop effective N2-fixing symbioses between the model C4-grass, Setaria viridis, as well as the related crop species, Zea mays, with the endophytic bacterium, Rhizobium sp. IRBG74, as well as the associative bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescenes Pf5.  Successful deployment of biological nitrogen fixation in model or crop grass species will pave the way for a second Green Revolution to increase crop yields for resource-poor farmers and decrease the use and environmental-impact of industrial nitrogen-fertilizers by wealthier farmers. This project will establish a powerful new model system for the study of plant-microbe interactions and demonstrate the power of synthetic biology in engineering new associative relationships and interdependencies that have the potential to be universal for all crop plants.  It will test this potential in the important crop, maize.  The integrated US-UK research partnership will provide a unique training opportunity for students and post-doctoral associates with active exchange of personnel between academic laboratories and research foundations in both countries.  Data and materials generated in the study including plasmid constructs and genetically modified bacterial and plant species will be made available via websites maintained in the US and the UK.  To broaden the impact of the work, traditional and non-traditional outreach strategies will be used to help K-12 teachers, students, and the public understand the fundamentals and benefits of interdisciplinary research and the implications of synthetic biology for the next generation of biotechnological solutions in agriculture."

The project will create the foundational knowledge needed to improve wheat and rice yields under stressful environments. Trends at the global-, regional-, and farm-level point to an increase in minimum night temperatures that is significantly higher than the rate of increase in maximum day temperatures. Increases in night temperatures significantly decrease the grain yield and quality of major crops such as rice and wheat, which together provide over 50% of the caloric intake for humans worldwide. To ensure global food security, there is an urgent need to improve crop resilience to high night temperature stress-induced yield and quality losses. This project will build upon complementary expertise and infrastructure in Nebraska, Kansas, and Arkansas to develop novel research infrastructure and make discoveries that ultimately lead to development of higher yielding and resilient cultivars for the U.S. farmers. This program will create opportunities to collaborate with key industry partners to ensure that promising discoveries are translated into applications with economic benefit for farmers. Planned workforce development activities will focus on mentoring six early career faculty members, training of postdocs and graduate and undergraduate students, and broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities and underserved rural population in STEM fields.Technical DescriptionThis project aims to elucidate the physiological and genetic basis of high night temperature resiliency of rice and wheat, translate these discoveries into genetic and phenotypic markers for public and private breeding programs, and develop a broad continuum for STEM education. To this end, the investigators are taking a multidisciplinary approach involving plant physiologists, quantitative geneticists, computational biologists, biochemists, engineers, informaticians, and precision agronomists. This program is building genome to phenome linkages using automated image-based phenomics approaches in combination with transcriptomics and metabolomics applied to wheat and rice diversity panels. Gene and pathways discovered from this approach will be functionally tested for their role in improving the temperature resilience in rice and wheat. The planned approach integrates across greenhouse and field scales; captures complex interactions between the environment and genome during grain development at high spatiotemporal resolution; and couples genomics and phenomics outcomes within a quantitative, model-based framework. This research will make the integrated dataset more accessible to biologists through a visualization platform.  Six early career faculty will be mentored for professional progress and interactions with international phenomic communities. An Interdisciplinary graduate course will be developed for students in plant sciences, agricultural engineering, computational biology, biochemistry, statistics, and computer sciences. On-line offerings of this course will ensure student participation from all three participating universities."

Copper oxide is a widely-used nanoparticle (a particle with a diameter below 100 nm) in fungicidal and fertilizer applications; however, plant responses to this material span from toxicity to plant health over a very narrow concentration range. The association of roots with beneficial microbes, both as internal, or endophytic, and external, or epiphytic, colonizers, will influence nanoparticle bioactivity in this zone. A systems approach is employed in this research to identify and elucidate key aspects of nanoparticle-microbe-plant-soil component interactions to better predict the environmental and health implications of this broadly used class of nanoparticles. Detailing the interaction and impact of nanoparticles in the plant root zone colonized with defined bacteria commonly associated with field-grown plants will improve the understanding of the important role of the plant microbiome as well as contribute to guidelines for the safe handling, management, and utilization of engineered nanoparticles. While focusing on a plant system, this research project relates to the essential roles that beneficial microbes play in the health and survival of many organisms, thus the research and associated outreach will augment the growing network of microbiome studies. The main objective of this research project is to identify the combined roles of three major factors, the plant, colonizing microbes, and soil components, that interplay to condition the bioactivity of nanoparticles in the rhizosphere, the zone vital to plant health that exists around a plant root. Two model systems that mimic key elements governing this interplay are being employed. The first system uses a solid growth matrix of silica sand amended with characterized soil pore-waters in order to replicate a key feature of the complex soil solution environment, including inorganic and organic components. Wheat grown in this system will be colonized by microbial isolates from field-grown wheat: A bacillus endophyte isolated from seeds, and a pseudomonad root surface colonizer. These microbes are typical of many isolates that induce plant tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress, such as drought and pathogens. The second system is a root-mimetic, hollow fiber membrane on which microbe colonization, metabolite production, and biofilm formation are being investigated in response to defined ?rhizosolutions? delivered through the fiber lumen. Rhizosolutions constructed from characterized root metabolites permit identification of root metabolites and soil components influencing biofilm formation, bacterial resilience to nanoparticle exposure, and metabolite production in response to the copper oxide nanoparticles, contrasted with responses from bulk copper oxide as well as copper salts. This interdisciplinary project, which merges engineering with chemical and biological sciences, is supporting graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, and underrepresented students from the Utah State University regional campuses through the Native American Summer Mentorship Program (NASMP) in place in the investigators? laboratories.

The project will study chromosome ends in the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae - a devastating pathogen of rice and wheat plants. Of the more than 20 known genes that control fungus interactions with the host plants, at least 50% are found close to the telomeres. It has long been a puzzle as to how (and why) these genes find their ways to the chromosome ends. Recent work has shown that the M. oryzae chromosome ends undergo rearrangements at spectacularly high frequencies and this can lead to the capture and duplication of internal sequences at the chromosome ends. This, in turn, causes the formerly subtelomeric sequences to be relegated to the chromosome interior. This project will use DNA sequencing and related data analysis methods to test the hypothesis that telomere dynamics is a major driver of chromosome evolution. This project largely involves DNA sequencing and associated data analysis techniques (bioinformatics). Individuals with the relevant cross-training in biology and computer science are rare and collaborations between individuals from the two domains are challenged by differences in their training and skills. Recognizing a national need for individuals with dual domain expertise, most of the objectives for this project will be completed through research experiences for teams of biology and computer science undergraduates from the partner institutions of the Univ. of Kentucky, Northern Kentucky Univ., Eastern Kentucky Univ. and Western Kentucky Univ., with specific efforts being made to enhance participation for student populations traditionally underrepresented in STEM research.Despite intense interest in telomere biology and the importance of the associated chromosome regions (subtelomeres) in cellular biology, organismal adaptation and evolution, the organization of chromosome ends and their dynamics is poorly understood due to poor representation in genome assemblies. The central hypothesis driving this project is that the telomere regions are the main factories of fungal genome evolution, whereby recurrent bouts of telomere crisis provide the fuel for raw materials recruitment and telomere rescue pathways act to generate novel sequences. It has long been proposed that fungal genomes might evolve through such  Adaptive Telomere Failure  (ATF) but, until now, no examples had been identified. This project will greatly expand knowledge on fungal genome structure and reveal the full impact of ATF on genome organization and evolution. Additionally, it is suspected that enhanced rates of nucleotide substitution/indel polymorphism in the subtelomeric regions may further accelerate the neo-functionalization of terminally captured sequences. This project will test a number of predictions related to these hypotheses, while seeking to gain an improved understanding of subtelomere-internal genome sequence exchange, as it relates to fungal genome structure and host adaptation. Specific objectives include: 1. Generate end-to-end genome assemblies for the main host-specialized forms of M. oryzae and characterize the structural and genic diversity of the subterminal chromosome regions. 2. Assess the impact of telomere dynamics on M. oryzae genome evolution by identifying and characterizing internalized relics of former telomeres; 3. Examine genome reorganization following spontaneous or experimentally-induced telomere crisis events; and 4. Accomplish project objectives through  bite-sized  undergraduate research projects that foster collaboration between biologists and computer scientists."

However, current lithium-ion battery technology suffers from several key limitations, such as, high cost, limited energy storage density, poor durability, and severe environmental impact. These shortcomings limit the viability of many important emerging technologies, such as electric vehicles and off-peak storage for renewable energy generation systems. Batteries based on a lithium-sulphur (Li-S) chemistry can theoretically achieve energy densities six times greater than conventional lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries but have typical lifetimes of only 100 recharge cycles. This award studies new approaches to the manufacture of electrodes for lithium-sulphur batteries that have long lifespan and are affordable.  Preliminary results have demonstrated that a battery cathode can be manufactured by high temperature carbonization of wheat dough creating a porous carbon network. The resulting carbon foam structure is covered with carbon nanotubes, which enables a dense loading of sulphur nanoparticles to increase energy capacity. The porous carbon/carbon nanotube scaffold structure prevents the degradation of the active sulphur material, extending the durability of the battery to over 4000 cycles. The battery components are assembled through a scalable, continuous, and high-throughput process from low-cost precursors, which also contributes to improved environmental sustainability. This research develops new paradigms for design and nanomanufacturing of energy storage devices. These research advances are disseminated to K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as the general public through targeted courses, seminars, and publications.The research objective of the project is to address key technological and engineering barriers to achieving high-throughput manufacturing of batteries with exceptionally high energy and power densities and ultra-long lifespan. The approach is to derive electrode materials from a readily available, low cost, environmentally-benign material, specifically, wheat dough. The project addresses research gaps such as severe capacity degradation, incomplete sulfur utilization, and the severe 'shuttle effect' of dissolvable intermediates during the electrochemical reaction process. Research activities feature a systems-level focus spanning (1) synthesis of the mesoporous activated carbon/carbon nanotube scaffolds, (2) roll-to-roll manufacturing of the developed cathode into Li-S batteries, and (3) structural and mechanical characterization of electrode materials to evaluate the role of structure on battery degradation. The primary contributions of this work are to improve the effective conductivity of the sulphur cathode by embedding sulphur nanoparticles within a highly-conductive activated carbon/carbon nanotube scaffold and to study how the structure impedes electrode degradation by inhibiting the 'shuttle effect' and limiting reaction volume changes. The fundamental mechanism of the one-step synthesis of carbon nanotubes on carbonized yeast from wheat dough is determined. A prototype automated roll-to-roll manufacturing process is devised to produce high-performance Li-S batteries."

Understanding how to manipulate natural components of the plant stress response to provide desirable beneficial traits will potentially lead to reductions in chemical use in agriculture.  This technology provides a novel mechanism to express broad spectrum immune response that would normally stunt plant growth. This novel mechanism has large potential societal and commercial impacts. Currently, agricultural companies express resistance genes using promoter systems that are specific for one strain of pathogen. Each resistance gene included in the plant seed results in a negative fitness cost. The technology developed here can potentially eliminate the need to express multiple resistance genes by replacing them with one broad spectrum resistance gene.This I-Corps project further develops a TBF1-Control Cassette technology (TCC) to regulate translation that is both inducible and specific. Current gene expression methods are primarily based on transcriptional regulation utilizing synthetic or native promoters, which were shown to be insufficient in overcoming negative fitness costs associated with expression of stress response genes. The TCC technology remediates these negative fitness cost by  stalling  the translation of the gene of interest until a trigger is present. This mechanism allows for the accumulation of transcripts without the subsequent translation, and hence no negative fitness costs until the protein is translated. The technology was proven to work in rice and can be applied to other economically important crops, such as wheat or corn."

Cellulosic ethanol is produced from agricultural waste products, like corn stalks, switchgrass, and wheat straw, rather than from corn like traditional ethanol. It is then used largely as a fuel additive, though other industries use ethanol on smaller scales. Improving cellulosic ethanol production is part of the United States' Renewable Fuel Standards Goals set in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. These improvements are vital since the increased demand for ethanol from corn has contributed to rises in food prices.  In addition, cellulosic ethanol produces fewer greenhouse gases than corn ethanol production, and reduces pressure for water use and land change erosion. However, despite these advantages, the vast majority of ethanol produced in the US is from corn, simply because cellulosic ethanol is considerably more expensive to produce. The costs reductions from the process developed here will potentially be of considerable commercial value to existing cellulosic ethanol producers, as well as potentially to corn ethanol producers who may switch production methods if costs become comparable.This I-Corps project further develops a technology that stabilizes genomes of metabolically active yeast. A key step in cellulosic ethanol production, co-metabolism of five- and six-carbon sugars, can be achieved by yeast hybrids consisting of species that ferment one or the other carbon source. But yeast hybrids created by protoplast fusion are genetically unstable, being subject to rapid segregational loss of one or the other parental genome. Preliminary data indicate that genomic instability can be prevented by encapsulating hybrids in calcium alginate and can produce ethanol at near-theoretical yields for weeks on end. This technology has a wide variety of potential applications. It has already been used to study aging, and could be further used to improve plasmid retention in the production of diverse synthetic biology products, including insulin, anti-malarial drugs, and industrially important solvents and lubricants. Current research is focused on optimizing this method for cellulosic ethanol production, with plans in place to subsequently address these other markets."

Flowers are extremely diverse in shape and form, yet flower development is controlled by the same core set of transcription factors (proteins that control gene expression). To resolve this paradox, it has been hypothesized that changes in how genes are controlled by these core transcription factor genes has been critical in the evolution of flowering plant diversity. The goal of this project is to test this hypothesis. This project will uncover the molecular underpinnings of floral diversification, and provide key insight into the molecular biology of floral development in the economically important grass family, which includes corn and wheat. An educational program will be developed for students from high school to graduate levels. High school students, especially women, will learn basic molecular biology by working in the investigator's lab in the summers. Undergraduates will be trained in the theory and techniques of molecular biology and molecular evolution in a lab-based class and independent research. Graduate students will be involved in all aspects of the research and outreach. Trainees at all levels will be involved in all stages of the scientific process, from experimental design to publication. The educational program will provide students with the practical skills and scientific understanding fundamental to success as part of the US workforce.The floral MADS-box transcription factors are critical regulators of flower development across angiosperms. A long-standing hypothesis is that evolutionary change in flower form can be driven by shifting interactions between floral MADS-box transcription factors that go on to affect downstream gene regulation. This project will test this hypothesis using an experimental system developed by the PI, where MADS-box protein-protein interactions can be precisely manipulated to study how they impact downstream gene expression and floral development. In Aim 1, the impact of evolutionary variation in MADS-box dimerization on floral development will be explored using gene editing technology, microscopy, and geometric morphometrics. In an allied education aim, high school interns will assist with genotyping plant lines, and explore the people behind the science in a 'Heroes of Biology' journal club. In Aim 2, the genome-wide gene expression profiles downstream of evolutionary variation in MADS-box dimerization will be determined using RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq. In an allied education aim, undergraduates in the lab will design and perform qRT-PCR experiments to validate next-generation sequencing results. In Aim 3, the protein-protein interaction profiles of MADS-box dimer variants will be determined both in vitro and in planta. Sophomores in the PI's research-based molecular evolution class will test select MADS-box protein-protein interactions. This project will contribute to the understanding of regulatory evolution, to the understanding of floral diversity, and to the understanding of floral development. The mechanistic understanding of grass flower development gained through this work, including in a major crop plant (maize), may facilitate the precise manipulation of floral development for enhanced plant productivity."

Plants adapt to water deprivation in part by fostering root-associated microorganisms that enhance resistance to environmental stresses. The impact of water limitation on molecular communication and the interactions between plants and their associated microbes remains poorly understood. This project will utilize a combination of analytical chemistry, bioinformatics, genetic, and physiological approaches to investigate the mutually beneficial interaction between the root-colonizing bacterium, Pseudomonas synxantha, and wheat under arid conditions. The research will yield new insights into how plants in dry soils recruit, shape, and manipulate their associated microbes to mitigate drought stress. This project will train graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar that will be engaged in all aspects of the research. The analysis of bacterial metabolic pathways will be done by undergraduates via individual research projects and as a part of microbial genetics and ecology classes. The project team will participate in university programs and coordinate outreach activities aimed at recruiting underrepresented groups into the sciences and strengthening science education at the elementary through college levels. This research is crucial for exploitation of beneficial microbial communities to improve crop performance and complement plant breeding efforts.An overarching goal of this application is to understand at the molecular level how root-colonizing (rhizosphere) bacteria maintain physiological activity and tight mutualistic interactions with their plant hosts in dry soils. Plants can be viewed as meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on their microbiome for specific functions and traits. Recent studies have highlighted the essential role of beneficial rhizobacteria in the ability of plants to tolerate abiotic stresses, including drought. However, the effect of water limitation on the plant-microbe communication in the rhizosphere remains virtually unexplored. The approach focuses on Pseudomonas synxantha 2-79, a model biocontrol strain that is naturally adapted to wheat grown in arid parts of the Pacific Northwest. The specific aims are to characterize the changes in wheat root exudates that are associated with water stress and to relate these changes to the physiology of 2-79; to identify transcriptional responses in 2-79 to water-stressed conditions using RNA-seq; and to define the contribution of selected pathways to the ability of 2-79 to persist on roots under conditions of water deficit. The expected results will help to understand how rhizodeposition in arid soils modulates bacterial pathways involved in the mitigation of drought stress and contributes to the selection of specific types of beneficial rhizobacteria. The project will also provide a crucial functional genomics complement to ongoing field studies aimed at deciphering the effect of soil moisture on the rhizosphere microbiome of dryland wheat."

Reductions in soil evaporation rates will lower irrigation demands and overall water consumption for crop production, thereby conserving water worldwide and in the Ogallala Aquifer in the Great Plains. This research project will understand the effects of hydrophobic soil (where water beads up) on evaporation compared to typically hydrophilic soil (where water spreads out) through laboratory studies. Glass beads will be coated to make them hydrophobic and these beads will be used to simulate soil. Evaporation will be studied from a few beads and a tray of beads under weather conditions similar to fields. Next, a type of soil called Ottawa sand will be coated to become hydrophobic and evaporation will be measured from the plain, hydrophilic sand and hydrophobic sand. These experiments will show how soil hydrophobicity affects evaporation from soil. Soil hydrophobicity can occur naturally due to minerals, organic materials, or waxes. Information from these laboratory evaporation studies will be used to determine best agricultural practices to reduce water losses since the Ogallala Aquifer provides water for over 20% of corn, wheat, sorghum, and cattle produced in the United States. Additionally, this research project will attract diverse students due to the importance of the research. The Principal Investigator (PI) and student researchers will use bread baking as an analogy for soil evaporation with groups of female High School students at the EXCITE workshop at Kansas State University (KSU) and the PI and researchers will showcase the research to first year, female undergraduate students at an annual Research Open House. The PI will also teach an interdisciplinary course on heat and mass transfer in the Food, Energy, and Water nexus to graduate students from multiple colleges at KSU.This research will investigate transient evaporative phase change in a three-phase (i.e., soil, water, and air) system. The objectives of this study are to understand the impacts of hydrophobicity on evaporation mechanisms including contact line dynamics, capillary transport, and enhanced water vapor diffusion. Glass and Teflon-coated beads will be used to simulate soil for pore-level experiments. Evaporation will be modeled and experimentally investigated using a high speed and IR camera for a range of surface temperatures and realistic environmental conditions (e.g., air temperature and relative humidity and simulated solar irradiation). Contact lines will be observed for water evaporating from hydrophilic or hydrophobic single pores. Using knowledge obtained from these single pore studies, evaporation fronts and mechanisms such as capillary transport and enhanced water vapor diffusion will be investigated for multiple pores; water will be dyed with fluorescent dye rhodamine B and excited using a Nd:YAG laser. Color shifts will be used to identify evaporation fronts and liquid capillary transport for a given cross section of the porous material. In the final phase of the research, evaporation will be studied from layers of naturally hydrophilic and artificially hydrophobized Ottawa sand to understand the impacts of hydrophobicity on capillary transport and enhanced water vapor diffusion. This study will numerically and experimentally assess the relative impacts of hydrophobicity on these three primary evaporation mechanisms (i.e., contact line dynamics, capillary transport, and enhanced water vapor diffusion) and create a mechanistic map to show the dominant evaporation mechanism for field environmental conditions. As a result, the improved understanding of hydrophobicity on soil evaporation can inform agricultural best practices."

Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Fayetteville State University (FSU) will conduct research aimed at understanding host plant (wheat; Triticum aestivum) and parasite (Hessian fly; Mayetiola destructor) interactions. This project will greatly improve the quality of undergraduate research and education in biological Sciences and the four-year graduation rate at FSU which is currently less than 20%. In addition, results from this study may help wheat breeders develop wheat cultivars to enhance the production of the agriculture industry and benefit the rural community in the U.S. Therefore, this study may have a major impact on society since wheat is an important food crop in the US and the world and the Hessian fly is one of the most destructive pests of wheat in North America and North Africa. The goal of the proposed study is to reveal the molecular mechanism of heat-induced loss of plant resistance using wheat-Hessian fly interaction as a model. The specific objectives of the proposed research are to: 1) determine the impact of heat stress on interactions between different wheat resistance genes (R genes) and Hessian fly biotypes; 2) examine heat-induced genome-wide changes in gene expression in wheat using high throughput molecular technologies, and 3) identify genes and pathways that possibly contribute to the heat-induced loss of wheat resistance. The findings from the research will enhance understanding of the molecular mechanism of the heat-induced loss of resistance in plants and co-evolution between host plants and parasites. This project will be conducted in collaboration with faculty from North Carolina State University."

How is an individual's interaction with linguistic variation influenced by the general cognitive strategies used to resolve competition in the environment? In a dual mechanisms framework, cognitive control -- the mechanisms engaged to resolve conflict and regulate expectations -- is divided into two interrelated strategies: proactive and reactive control. Study 1 examines how those control strategies influence individual adaptation to distributional changes in speech input, using an experiment simulating sound change in the laboratory. Less habitual engagement of proactive and reactive control strategies is hypothesized to facilitate the integration of phonological variation. Study 2 then translates the same behavioral tasks to the field in a community-based study examining language variation on a larger scale: sound changes-in-progress (as when 'wait' sounds more like 'wheat'). This dissertation complements existing knowledge regarding sound change in Philadelphia by collecting sociolinguistic interviews of Puerto Rican Philadelphians, one of the largest communities outside of Puerto Rico. Interviews are collected from two age groups and two neighborhood groups based on demographic makeup (proportion of Black and White Philadelphians) to document how one?s immediate community influences participation in three socially-stratified sound changes-in-progress. The same participants then complete the three behavioral tasks from Study 1 (AX-CPT, a modified Stroop paradigm, and an n-back task with lures), permitting a regression analysis of how control strategies modulate their adoption of changes-in-progress.This is one of the first studies to explicitly link dual mechanisms of cognitive control to language processing. It is unique in applying these strategies both to simulated sound change in the laboratory and real-world sound change in the community, documenting the speech of an understudied population and providing a unified account of how social and cognitive factors interact in language use."

Sustainability science is an emerging field that addresses the challenges of meeting human needs without harm to the environment, and without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. A strong scientific workforce requires individuals educated and trained in interdisciplinary research and thinking, especially in the area of sustainability science. With the SEES Fellowship support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish herself in an independent research career related to sustainability. This project focuses on food sustainability and security on a global scale. The partnerships built into this project will give the Fellow significant inter-disciplinary training (adding the components of randomized controlled trials and crop modeling) beyond the scope of her current expertise. This is particularly important since her goal is to become a sustainability scientist who combines methods and tools from the natural and social sciences to understand how humans are impacted by and adapt to environmental change. Specifically, the Fellow will participate in an interdisciplinary institutes (Center on Food Security and the Environment at Stanford, and Center for Effective Global Action at UC Berkeley). Also, at Stanford University, the Fellow will gain teaching and mentoring experience.Climate change is predicted to negatively impact agricultural communities and food security across the globe, with models estimating up to a 40% reduction in the yield of some crops by the end of the century. This is particularly problematic for wheat, which is a major staple crop (providing 20% of daily calories) that is already facing declining yields due to warming temperatures. Previous studies have shown that autonomous adaptation strategies (e.g. increasing irrigation, shifting planting date) are not enough to mitigate the negative impacts of warming, and planned adaptation strategies that introduce heat-tolerant wheat varieties are needed to sustainably bolster yields and food security in the face of climate change. Interdisciplinary research is necessary to (1) identify the most effective ways to introduce these new technologies to vulnerable communities, and (2) assess whether the predicted yield benefits of these crops are realized in the field where farmers may deviate from ideal management practices. This study uses randomized controlled trials from development economics to evaluate introduction strategies, remote sensing to quantify if new heat-tolerant wheat varieties provide yield benefits in the field, and process-based crop models to assess whether these new varieties provide predicted yield benefits in future warming scenarios. Understanding the effectiveness of information transfer is particularly important for heat-tolerant crops because, unlike high-yielding varieties introduced during the Green Revolution, heat-tolerant crops may not provide immediate benefits and only produce higher yields in unseasonably warm years. Thus, the adoption and diffusion of this technology may depend purely on whether farmers trust and receive accurate information about possible future benefits. This study is one of the first to examine the most effective ways to introduce new crops that mitigate against climate variability and future climate risk, which is necessary to sustainably enhance food security in the face of climate change."

Grasses proliferated rapidly, obscuring their historical relationships.  This project integrates three broad approaches in a study of grass diversification using contemporary methods to reconstruct the genealogy of the grasses.  Next generation DNA sequencing methods will be used to determine complete chloroplast genomes and subregions of the nuclear genome from at least 100 species.  Bioinformatics analyses will explore patterns and rates of DNA sequence evolution.  Studies of development, especially in leaves, will be used to test whether particular adaptations are correlated with historical migrations into new habitats. Grasses are of fundamental economic and ecological importance.  Rice, wheat, maize and other cereals supply half of human dietary calories.  Wild grasses predominate over 25% of Earth's terrestrial landscape.  A better understanding of their relationships is fundamental to predicting the response of grasslands and cereal crops to environmental change.  Analyses of sequence data will clarify relationships and have broad application in evolutionary studies.  Ecological adaptations will be better understood when viewed in a developmental context.  An image-rich web site will be established, with content in English and Spanish, with information on grass structure, classification, and evolution.  The new framework of grass relationships and accompanying web resources will appeal to a broad range of users and promote international collaborations."

Objective 2: Characterize the potential transfer of soil lead, arsenic, and other trace elements by vegetable crops grown on element enriched urban and orchard soils and develop methods to prevent this transfer. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 3: Characterize genetic resources and inheritance of grain Cd to reduce cadmium in durum wheat, flax and soybean. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 4: Evaluate information about the risk from Cd in foods to support public decisions for foods of both plant and animal origin. (C1; PS 1.F). The ultimate goals of this Project Plan are to improve the science about risk of heavy metals in soils and crops in order to obtain improved regulatory limits for Cd in crops under Codex, and the information needed to provide improved advice about the risk of Pb in urban garden soils and crops. Essentially all human Cd disease from soil Cd has resulted from paddy rice grown on fields contaminated by mining or smelter emissions. Garden vegetables and other grains have not been found to induce Cd disease in highly exposed populations who grow crops on highly Cd+Zn contaminated soils. Some Europeans want to set crop Cd limits based on attainable levels rather than on the basis of potential risk to consumers. Such non-risk based standards will harm U.S. growers of durum wheat, sunflower kernels, flax, soybean, and some other crops. If crops must contain lower levels of Cd to win importation by other nations, both soil treatments, selection of soil series which produce lower Cd crops, and improved cultivars which accumulate lower amounts of Cd will contribute to growers needs. Providing a clear technical basis for the bioavailability of Cd in different crops appears to be the central issue which could change the demand for lower limits for crop Cd, and protect growers from unnecessary costs to produce lower Cd crops which may have no benefit. Only animal feeding tests can provide valid information about the bioavailability of crop Cd to animals, and the concentrations fed must represent levels in foods rather than toxic levels fed in most previous research. Because Zn is usually greatly increased in crops (except rice) when Cd is increased, the presence of Zn may substantially reduce the bioavailability of crop Cd, alleviating presumed risk of crop Cd. Because commercial carrots were found with higher than normal Pb concentrations when grown on historic orchard soils, U.S.-FDA requested that ARS examine the basis for carrot Pb accumulation and to learn if agricultural amendments can reduce carrot Pb when they are grown on high Pb soils. Certain root crops have xylem elements growing through the edible storage root, so if Pb is trapped within the xylem during normal growth of the crop, it will be in the edible root. But such Pb might have much lower bioavailability than the Pb-acetate used to establish diet Pb risk; 2-10% of food Pb is absorbed, while 60-80% of soluble Pb in water is absorbed by human volunteers."

Stripe rust of barley can cause significant yield loss in the western U.S. The long-term goal of this project is to reduce losses in wheat and barley yield and quality caused by stripe rust and assure stable, sustainable production while protecting the environment. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding virulence compositions of the pathogen population, identification of new sources of resistance, disease forecasting, and control of the disease using fungicides in recent years. However, more research is needed to monitor dynamic changes of virulent races, obtain better knowledge of resistance genes in elite germplasm, to identify more genes for effective resistance, and to develop molecular markers for use in the efficient incorporation of new genes into wheat and barley cultivars. For the next five years, we will conduct research to achieve the following objectives: 1). Use molecular markers and host plant responses to characterize and differentiate current and emergent virulent races of the stripe rust pathogens of wheat and barley. 2). Determine the distribution, nature, and effectiveness of host plant resistance genes amongst elite wheat and barley germplasm. 3). Identify and determine linkage relationships of new major and minor stripe rust resistance genes, and develop molecular markers for application in wheat and barley breeding efforts. Accomplishment of these objectives will lead to improved knowledge of the disease epidemiology, more resistance genes and germplasm, and more effective technology to achieve sustainable control of stripe rust."

This will be accomplished using a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay which can down-regulate, or knockdown the expression of chosen genes so that their function can be inferred from the phenotypic change.  This functional assay for genes involved in FHB resistance has been validated and a key role for genes in the ethylene-signaling pathway has already been established.  In the next 5 years of work, we will conduct an in depth survey for genes functioning in FHB resistance, and determine if these genes can be used to engineer improved levels of FHB resistance.   Objective 1:  Determine if over-expression of genes involved in the ethylene signaling pathway can confer improved resistance to Fusarium head blight in wheat.   Objective 2: Determine whether pathogen recognition receptors have essential roles in Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat.

The proposed research objectives are central to the mission of the USDA ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory (CDL): to reduce losses in wheat, oat, and barley to major diseases using host resistance. Research is focused on genetic variation in both the host cereals and their rust pathogens that determine the resistance/susceptible phenotype of the interaction. Isolates of rust fungi obtained from annual surveys of the wheat, barley, and oat crops are used to inform the breeding process. Successful control of cereal rusts with host resistance cannot be achieved without knowledge of variation in cereal rust populations. Studies of virulence and molecular variation in cereal rust populations can answer questions that range from the applied, such as which host resistance genes are effective against the current rust population and what resistance genes are in current cereal cultivars, to more basic questions like what are the origins of new races and how do they spread. Discovery of the molecular determinants of pathogenesis and obligate biotrophy in cereal rust fungi via genomic approaches offers intriguing leads in the development of novel resistance mechanisms. Identification, characterization, and introgression of new host resistance to cereal rusts are key to increasing the diversity of resistance genes in our cereals and staying ahead of these   shifty   pathogens."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments. Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A.

Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics."

We have assembled a multidisciplinary advisory team from medicine, public health, and the academic community and supplement our own resources with a consultant experienced with WC First Report of Injury (FROI) claims, and denominator employment data. With this collaboration we expect to gain insight for health improvements at the intersections of public and occupational health. The Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development (TDLWD) Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC) maintains a database of 68 variables (see Appendix A) from 120,000 annual medical and indemnity claims as First Report of Injury (FROI) information. This data is has great potential to supplement existing data sources in occupational health surveillance. After eliminating personally identifiable information and other non-essential variables, we will collect three years of data for the enumeration of injury counts and subsequent calculation of injury rates based on industry and establishment size for the private sector. By linking this data with the state's Unemployment Insurance (UI) database through the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN), reliable data can be obtained on injury counts for NAICS industries and establishment size strata. Going further, we can use the NAICS linkage to determine industry employment through the use of databases such as the QCEW, CPS, and ACS. We will combine the state count data and publically accessible employment determinants to calculate injury rates and create prioritization indices as part of a final report document. This report can provide immediate returns by identifying focus areas for targeted intervention in critical industries (e.g.fall protection in construction) or injury prevention for common maladies across industries (e.g. musculoskeletal injuries). Longer term benefits are expected to result from a database containing the key industry, event, and illness/injury information. The database will enable subsequent research and inform industry educational efforts. Most importantly, we expect this project to be the impetus for destroying the silos currently existing between the various state agencies and the academic community within the state. ]"

The European Union Scientific Panel onContaminants in the Food Chain concluded that a consistent relationship between the alkaloidconcentration in the sclerotia and total ergot alkaloid concentration could not be established(EFSA 2005). No country has limits for individual ergot alkaloids in food or feed. Several recentfactors have increased ergot invasion in crops, including no-till farming practices leaving thevegetation and ergot sclerotia on the soil surface for increased infection rates, the move toorganic farming and avoiding fungicides, and the dramatic weather patterns with huge rainfallsthat enhance increased Claviceps purpurea invasion of cereals and grasses in thespring/summer.No US veterinary diagnostic laboratory is providing a validated ergot alkaloid analysis of cerealgrains and grasses by LC/MS/MS for the main Claviceps ergot alkaloids, the ergopeptines (-ines, biologically active) include ergotamine, ergosine, ergocristine, ergocryptine, andergocornine, and their diastereomers the ergopeptinines (-inines, biologically inactive). Innature, ergopeptinines always accompany ergopeptines, and during storage of raw materialsover time or improper storage, more ergopeptinines may form. The conversion of -ines to -ininescan be rapid under certain laboratory conditions and -inines can be reactivated to -ines undercertain conditions. Therefore, both epimers have to be determined for ergot alkaloidcontamination of foods and feeds (Krska and Crews).This proposal is to develop and validate a sensitive LC/MS/MS method for ergpopeptines,ergotamine, ergosine, ergocristine, ergocryptine and ergocornine, and their -inines in cerealgrains of wheat, barley, rye and grasses. The inclusion of a grass matrix for ergot alkaloidanalysis by LC/MS/MS is not commonly addressed in any method but is extremely important forveterinary livestock exposures. The analytical range of detection chosen for the assay, 20 to8000 ug/kg, represents veterinary toxicological important data for interpretation of animal feedand food contamination.RELEVANCEThe LC/MS/MS analytical method for ergopeptines and ergopeptinines in small cereals andgrasses will provide chemical analysis of potentially contaminated feed to be used for foodanimals or sold into the food chain. The current US Official Grain Standards of determiningpercentage contamination by ergot sclerotia in cereal grains is often inaccurate and ignores thegreat variation of alkaloid content in individual sclerotia. The increased use of no-till farmingand leaving vegetation and sclerotia on the soil surface for the successive crops, consumerdesire to utilize organic foods without chemicals, and dramatic weather events will tend toincrease the incidence of Claviceps purpurea in cereal crops and grasses and exposure to ergotalkaloids."

This project brings together researchers from the Kansas State University, Oklahoma State University, and Langston University (a Historically Black University), to develop a new way to model and predict important crop production traits in wheat. One of the greatest challenges of current crop trait prediction is that it falls in an underpopulated borderland between plant physiology, biological engineering, genetics, computational biology, mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Therefore, to bridge this gap, mathematical models will be produced that combine both observational data using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and robots, and genetics data. These new models are expected to simplify crop modeling for farmers, and will aid in farm management, and can easily be applied to other crops and in other environments. Many additional benefits will also accrue. First, commonalities between these mathematical models will mean that results will readily transfer to many other crops. Moreover, the benefits of combining genetic and observational data in this way to predict crop traits will aid on-farm crop management, enhancing food security. Educational programs for undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty in these disciplines will enlarge a globally competitive workforce. Involvement of key corporate partners will also speed research transfer to the private sector both directly and by creating a market for project trainees. Finally, the sensing/measuring devices to be bought or built will enhance the ability of partners to conduct a wide range of related, data-intensive research. Technical Description:It is widely agreed that agricultural crop production is not on track to meet the production doubling needed by 2050 for humanity to avoid major food security disruption. Farmers need genetically-informed analytics to predict the outcomes of management options amongst which they may choose and apply in their unique field environments. This project brings together researchers from the sity of Kansas State University, Oklahoma State University, and Langston University (a Historically Black University), and presents new genetically- and physiologically-informed proof-of-concept wheat physiologically-based crop models (CMs). These CMs will link to state-of-the-art field monitoring technologies with genomic data, thus rebalancing direct monitoring vs. indirect model calculation. The data will include: (1) airborne imagery to extract morphological features, canopy temperatures, and light interception. (2) Multivariate soil profile data will be collected by robots at 2-30 cm (horizontal/vertical) and three-day temporal resolution. (3) Gene expression data on selected double haploid lines over 64 combinations of locations, dates, and years will aid in model building. (4) CM and quantitative genetics integration will also be aided by expanding the number of genotyped wheat lines within the Kansas and Oklahoma breeding programs. Such large data sets ordinarily pose computational challenges for models as complex as CMs. In contrast to extant CMs, the new models will efficiently combine differential equation solvers, maximum entropy and Bayesian methods, and high-performance computing. The results will be methods able to predict the traits of novel genotypes in novel environments not used to construct the models. Many additional benefits will also accrue. First, commonalities between CMs will mean that results will readily transfer to many other crops. Moreover, increased genome to phenome prediction accuracy will aid on-farm crop management, enhancing food security. Educational programs for undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty in these disciplines will create and enlarge a globally competitive workforce. Involving key corporate partners will also speed research transfer directly and by creating a market for project trainees. Finally, the sensing/measuring devices to be bought or built will enhance partner ability to conduct a wide range of related, data-intensive research.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

HMF is a critical, versatile and renewable immediate that can be used to produce fuels and a variety of other products such as polymers including polyesters, polyurethanes, polyamides and poly(ethylene-furanoate); binders, adhesives, coatings and foams, some of which have market size in the range of billion lb/yr. The worldwide HMF industrial production is 30 tons/year. It is not produced in any industrial scale because it is not yet an economic viable product. The proposed technology is designed to change that. The catalytic process proposed in this project will be significant avoiding the food-or-fuel dilemma. The solvent used in the process is green and environmental friendly. The polymeric solid acid catalyst is non-toxic and reusable. The project will also train skilled workers for the emerging biorefinary industry. The technology if successful and commercialized could benefit the state of Arkansas in effective utilization of crop residues. This project involves close collaboration with a minority and women-owned industrial partner for commercialization. The proposed project aims to develop cost effective production of HMF using a paradigm shift catalytic membrane reactor to hydrolyze agricultural residues including rice and wheat straws and directly dehydrate hydrolyzed sugars to HMF with high yield and selectivity. HMF will be simultaneously separated from the product stream using size-based customized membranes. One of the keys to success lies in optimizing the polymeric solid acid catalyst that is capable of catalyzing both hydrolysis and dehydration reactions efficiently. The catalytic activity is shown to be tunable by varying the chain length and chain density of the grafted polymers on substrates. The catalyst and its activity are found to be stable over repeated runs. This green technology replaces the currently used highly corrosive sulfuric acid and expensive cellulase enzymes for biomass hydrolysis, as well as becoming a promising catalyst to replace the toxic metal chloride for glucose dehydration to HMF. Another key to success is the design of a catalytic membrane reactor for simultaneous HMF production and separation leading to process intensification and significant cost reduction. The ultimate goal of this project is to convert lignocellulosic biomass to HMF with high yield and high selectivity in an economical and environmental friendly manner.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Improving cotton production will help provide U.S. jobs, sustainable agriculture, and adaptation to a changing climate. Traditional breeding efforts have given rise to several types of economically valuable cotton strains such as American and Egyptian cotton. These two strains of cotton were independently formed by the combination of two wild species, yielding cotton strains with four sets of chromosomes (two from each parent). This doubling of chromosomes is known as polyploidy, and this project is focused on understanding how polyploidy shapes how genes are used to generate improved strains of cotton. This project leverages and develops cutting edge technologies in DNA sequencing to understand polyploidy. In addition, this project produces new biological materials for cotton breeding and improvement. The research goals are augmented by promoting Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education in the Mississippi Delta through active collaborations with two Historically Black Colleges and Universities. These educational activities train college students and K-12 teachers in cutting-edge plant biotechnology techniques, knowledge, and skills to advance their careers and use in their classrooms.Cotton is an excellent model system not only for understanding cell differentiation, elongation, and cellulose biosynthesis, but also for elucidating polyploid genome evolution and crop domestication. Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and Pima cotton (Gossypium barbadense L.) were independently domesticated from two of five or more allotetraploid species that arose from interspecific hybridization between diploid cotton species. It is important to understand how polyploidy-induced changes in genome structure and organization, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression have enabled selection and domestication of wild allotetraploids for worldwide cotton production. The project goal is to develop high-quality genomic and epigenomic resources for cotton improvement. Comparative analyses of sequence features and gene expression diversity among domesticated and wild tetraploid and diploid relatives will reveal genomic signatures for selection and domestication of agronomic traits, including fiber yield and quality and adaptation to the environments. Laser-capture microdissection and single-cell approaches will be used to reveal genomic and epigenomic networks during the transition from protodermal to fiber cells. Functions of the selected candidate genes for fiber development and epigenetic pathways will be determined using virus-induced gene silencing and CRISPR/cas9 gene-editing tools. Genomic sequences and epigenetic resources will be released to public data depositories, including National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Phytozome, and CottonGen. Plant materials including chromosome substitution lines and transgenic cotton will be available for the cotton breeding community. The methods, principles and resources being developed from this project will also advance the research on other polyploid crops such as wheat and canola.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polyploidy is known to influence a wide range of genetic and physiological features of plants, including physiological traits related to water use and photosynthesis. Polyploid plants can be more vigorous than diploids, have broader ecological niches, wider geographic distributions, and increased ability to invade new habitats, all driven by novel genetic combinations or gene expression patterns that can produce extensive changes in many traits. This project will investigate how polyploidy affects plants' ability to respond to increases in temperature and decreases in available water (i.e., drought).

This phenomenon is particularly common in plants, and recent estimates suggest that 15-30% of plants are polyploid. Polyploid species include a vast number of crop and other plants with economic and agricultural uses (e.g., cotton, wheat, potato, soybean). Polyploidy is known to influence a wide range of genetic and physiological features of plants, including physiological traits related to water use and photosynthesis. Polyploid plants can be more vigorous than diploids, have broader ecological niches, wider geographic distributions, and increased ability to invade new habitats, all driven by novel genetic combinations or gene expression patterns that can produce extensive changes in many traits. This project will investigate how polyploidy affects plants' ability to respond to increases in temperature and decreases in available water (i.e., drought). Gene expression and physiological responses to drought and temperature will be measured for a set of fern species at different ploidal levels (amounts of polyploidy). Knowing whether and how ploidal level impacts these important components of the eastern forests of the United States will allow better prediction of how changes in temperature and water availability will influence community structure in natural ecosystems and will inform conservation efforts. Information on gene expression changes involved in tolerance of drought and increased temperatures has potential to assist crop breeding programs. An integral part of the project is to train postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students.This project focuses on a set of fern species found in forests throughout the eastern United States. This is a naturally occurring plant system where polyploidy is prevalent, and whose members are ecologically important in the ecosystems where they occur. Gametophytes of six Dryopteris species, including two pairs of a polyploid and its parent taxa, will be grown in a multifactorial experiment with drought and temperature treatments. Data will be collected on reproductive and physiological ecology to determine how changes in temperature and water availability influence demographics and sporophyte recruitment from gametophytes as well as ability to recover from environmental stress. RNASeq will be used to generate gene expression profiles to evaluate differences between unstressed, dehydrated, and rehydrated gametophytes in different temperature treatments. Data will be analyzed using new methods for performing differential gene expression analyses on per-cell, per-biomass, and per-transcriptome bases. Results will be informative in quantifying the effects of experimental treatment on gene expression in organisms at different ploidy levels, including in crop plants and non-plant systems.

The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Cynthia Holland is  Evolution of Secondary Herbivore Defense Metabolite Biosynthesis from Primary Metabolism in the non-model Crucifer Erysimum (wallflower).  The host institution for the fellowship is the Boyce Thompson Institute and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Georg Jander and Lukas Mueller.To protect themselves against insect herbivores, plants have evolved a wide variety of chemical defenses. One class of plant defensive metabolites, known as cardiac glycosides, is found in at least twelve plant families and works by slowing the contractions and increasing the pumping force of the predator's heart. Despite the therapeutic use of these compounds in treating arrhythmias and congestive heart failure, a complete pathway for cardiac glycoside biosynthesis is not known for any plant species. This project will use the cardiac glycoside-producing wormseed wallflower (Erysimum cheiranthoides) to identify the biosynthetic pathway genes for these compounds. These results will contribute to the understanding of the evolution of defensive chemicals in other plant species, including important crops such as maize, soybean, and wheat. Training objectives include metabolomics, genetics, gene expression technologies and bioinformatics. Broader impacts include introducing underrepresented students to genomics and chemical ecology research via mentoring through an NSF-funded REU program, outreach to high school students at an urban high school in Yonkers (NY) and the development of laboratory kits for middle- and high-school teachers in rural New York.As a rapidly-growing, self-pollinating annual, E. cheiranthoides is an excellent model system for investigating the evolution of a new metabolic pathway for the production of cardenolides, a class of cardiac glycosides involved in herbivore defense. Modification of ubiquitous biosynthetic pathways of endogenous plant steroids, e.g. brassinosteroids, has likely been repeatedly selected for in the course of evolution to generate similar anti-herbivore toxins. This research will identify expansion and neofunctionalization of the enzyme families in E. cheiranthoides that normally contribute to primary metabolism in other crucifer species. Erysimum homologs of known cardenolide biosynthetic genes from other species will be identified using genome assemblies and characterized using structure-function-sequence analysis. Missing genes in the cardenolide pathway will be discovered through comparative metabolomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and forward genetic screens. Finally, the ecological  escape from herbivory  hypothesis will be tested by examining the role of cardenolides in host-insect interactions. Results from this research will be shared through publications, presentations at conferences, and inclusion in www.erysimum.org, a wallflower-specific website which will serve as a publicly accessible repository for all data related to this project.Keywords: biosynthesis biochemistry, plant biotic stress, comparative genomicsThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Rebecca Povilus is  Identifying Deeply Conserved Patterns of Epigenetic Modification and Imprinting during Seed Development . The host institution for the fellowship is the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Mary Gehring.Seeds are important for humans; seeds make up most of our diets and are a key part of the ecosystems that we depend on. Understanding what factors influence seed development is necessary to improve seed crops (such as wheat, corn, rice, and soybean), as well as to ensure the production of viable offspring when re-introducing genetic diversity into inbred crop varieties. Only recently have technologies and systems been available to elucidate the role that epigenetic modifications (chemical changes to DNA bases and to associated DNA-packaging proteins) play during plant reproduction. While epigenetic modifications have been shown to be important for seed development in a small number of distantly related plant species, the actual patterns and effects of epigenetic modification appear to vary substantially between species. To predict how broadly epigenome-based technologies for crop improvement and plant breeding can be applied, the patterns of epigenetic modifications that are fundamental to all flowering plants, or are specific to particular lineages must be determined. This project will provide an otherwise lacking foundation for understanding how the role that epigenetic processes play during reproduction has evolved across flowering plants. To do so, epigenetic modifications and their association with gene expression during seed development will be identified in the emerging model system Nymphaea thermarum, a member of one of the most ancient flowering plant lineages. Training objectives include genomics, epigenomics and bioinformatics. Broader impacts include outreach to local school teachers through the Whitehead Partner program and the development and distribution of a module for early-science education that explores the importance of biodiversity and basic research to agriculture and food security. This module will be presented as part of the Arnold Arboretum Summer Institute, and will be available at https://nthermarum.weebly.com/.The goal of this project is to understand epigenetic modification and its impact on gene expression during seed development. Specific objectives include 1) determining the dynamics of epigenetic modification during reproductive development in N. thermarum through immunolocalization of methylated DNA and histone marks, methylation-sensitive DNA sequencing and chromatin profiling and 2) identifying genes that are maternally- or paternally-imprinted during early embryo and endosperm development using hybrid crosses and tissue specific gene expression analysis. By comparing results from Nymphaea to information from model species, deeply conserved patterns of epigenetic modifications and imprinted gene expression will be distinguished from those that are derived within either monocots (such cereal crops) or eudicots (such as Arabidopsis). Results of this project will be published on open-access pre-print servers and peer-reviewed journals, and information will be available on the website https://nthermarum.weebly.com/.Keywords: seed development, embryo, endosperm, epigenetics, Nymphaea, comparative genomics and epigenomicsThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wheat production faces the combined challenges of increasingly variable and unfavorable climates, including new disease and insect pest pressures. In this context, new climate resilient varieties with a broadened genetic base must be developed. As a raw ingredient to the success of new wheat varieties, novel genetic diversity from wild relatives is needed to improve performance and resilience to stress. The Wheat Genetics Resource Center (WGRC) Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) at Kansas State University has the primary focus of effectively and efficiently mining these genetic resources and accelerating delivery of improved diverse germplasm to industry partners with cross-cutting training of the next generation of wheat industry scientists. The delivery of novel genetic resources and high-caliber scientists to industry partners is the ground work for future advancements and success in the wheat industry. The resulting improvement of yield potential and nutritional quality in wheat contributes toward resilience of the agriculture sector and the accessibility of affordable and nutritious wheat-based foods to society.The complex wheat genome, more than five times larger than the human genome, and the narrow genetic base of bread wheat, present formable challenges in breeding and to address problems facing the wheat industry. Managing wheat genetic diversity to improve crop performance and training of new scientists are major functions of the WGRC IUCRC-and are critical success factors for the wheat research enterprise. The center is advancing full genetic characterization and curation of thousands of accessions of wheat wild relatives across all genomes and ploidy levels while leveraging this information to develop improved germplasm for delivery to industry partners. With targeted understanding of the genetic diversity, accessing and delivering novel alleles in improved germplasm through allele mining can be greatly expedited. Technical innovations for efficiently accessing and transferring genes and chromosomes from wild relatives will allow rapid transfer of useful traits to elite germplasm through targeted chromosome engineering, increased recombination, marker assisted breeding and genomic prediction. Through collaborative industry testing networks, the center delivers improved germplasm including chromosome introgression stocks and diverse populations with 1) abiotic stress tolerance, 2) resistance to disease and insects, 3) yield potential and stability and 4) end-use nutrition and grain quality.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Altered GA production or responses in cereal crops, e.g., the dwarf cultivars of wheat and rice, greatly increased the grain yields during the  Green Revolution  in the 1960s-1970s. These examples illustrate the importance of this hormone in regulating plant development and in agriculture. GA-promoted plant development is modulated by DELLA proteins, which are master growth repressors that integrate multiple cellular pathways in response to environmental cues (such as light conditions, pathogens, cold and drought stresses). Although DELLA plays such a central role in regulating diverse plant growth processes, very little is known about how DELLA controls multiple pathways and how DELLA activity is dynamically regulated. This project will focus on these two important aspects and elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. This research will facilitate more effective strategies to manipulate plant growth and stress responses for agricultural improvements since DELLAs are highly conserved in plants. This research project will also have a broad impact in training young scientists, including a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student and four undergraduate students.Recent studies indicate that DELLAs function as central regulators of multiple signaling pathways by direct protein-protein interactions with key transcription factors (TFs). DELLAs do not contain a DNA-binding domain, and are likely to repress expression of target genes by sequestering their interacting TFs. DELLAs can also activate transcription by binding to specific TFs. However, the molecular mechanism of how DELLAs regulate target chromatin and gene expression remains unclear. Preliminary results from the principal investigator's laboratory showed that two missense mutations in a specific subdomain of RGA (an Arabidopsis thaliana DELLA) did not affect interaction with TFs. Instead, they were impaired in binding histone and an epigenetic regulator. These results raise an exciting possibility that histone binding may enhance DELLA association with the target chromatin, and DELLA may recruit epigenetic regulators to induce chromatin structural changes. This working model will be tested in Specific Aim 1. The roles of different subdomains in RGA will be defined by analyzing the effects of additional missense rga alleles on binding to TFs, histone, and epigenetic regulators using yeast two-hybrid and pulldown assays, and association with target chromatin by ChIP-qPCR. DELLA activity needs to be strictly modulated in response to internal and external cues, and it is known that GA induces DELLA degradation. Recent studies also indicated that DELLA activity is dynamically modulated by post-translational modifications. Preliminary data indicate that DELLA phosphorylation is altered under GA-deficient conditions, although the role of this modification remains unclear. Specific Aim 2 will identify phosphosites in RGA by MS analysis, and characterize functions of potential protein kinases for these modifications by genetic and biochemical analyses. This research project will shed new light on the molecular mechanism of how DELLAs regulate target chromatin and gene expression, and elucidate the role of phosphorylation in fine-tuning DELLA activity.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most crops grow from true seeds, potatoes are vegetatively propagated and multiplied for several years in the field. Without proper management, disease incidence in potato can rise to devastating levels within a few years. PVX and PVY are significant viruses that gravely impact potato yield and marketability, and economically impact producers. The global spread of necrotic PVY strains has created new challenges for producers. There is an urgent need to advance the knowledge of genes in potato responding to virus disease. The overarching, long- term goal is to improve potato resistance to PVX and PVY infection. This research will uncover the mechanisms of how plants can respond to virus stress and adapt to challenging environments. This research will investigate a key set of stress response genes that protect plants against drought and virus infection. This research will also explore how a set of proteins known as BiPs suppress disease and determine how these can be used to provide protection against virus infection. We will use this information to improve potato production strategies and effective breeding practices. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central hub for responses to adverse environmental challenges in plants such as virus infection, heat, chemical, osmotic, and salt stress. The physiological consequences of prolonged low-level ER stress include constrained plant development and productivity, whereas chronic stress can result in death and crop losses. Three well known monitoring/sensing pathway use the transcription factors bZIP60, bZIP28 and/or bZIP17 to activate cellular adaptive responses. They coordinate the transcription of molecular chaperones, including the ER lumen binding protein (BiP). It is well known that Arabidopsis plants overexpressing certain BiP isoforms display greater tolerance to virus infections and heat and osmotic stresses. The central hypothesis motivating the project is that bZIP60, bZIP28, and bZIP17 differentially up-regulate expression of BiP isoforms that ameliorates ER stress and cell death regulation in solanaceous plants, such as potato and tobacco. The research team will test a model in which ER stress sensors and BiP isoforms are engaged in N. benthamiana and potato to provide cellular protection against virus infection.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Patterns of gene expression that dictate plant responses to the environment and changes during development are directed by DNA sequences called transcriptional enhancers. In plants, fewer than 20 plant enhancers have ever been characterized yet understanding them is crucial for crop engineering and breeding. Using novel, genome-scale technology, this team will discover large numbers of transcriptional enhancers in the cereal crops maize, sorghum, rice and wheat, particularly those driving gene expression in response to heat and cold stress. The team will then compare heat- or cold-specific enhancers among these species and among different varieties of each species, determine what differences among them are associated with differences in plant performance under heat and cold stress, and identify the protein factors that bind to these enhancers to influence gene expression. After validating the function of these enhancer sequences in heat and cold tolerance, beneficial natural variants of them will be identified for crop improvement efforts. In addition, the team will introduce mutations into these candidates to try and improve them and carry out massively parallel functional assays of enhancer fragments to develop a toolkit of synthetic enhancers with defined strengths and specificities for future crop engineering. This project broadly impacts plant research, crop engineering and breeding; it also impacts the education of future plant genome scholars through targeted outreach efforts, including summer research internships for undergraduate students.This project will apply a novel combination of ATAC- and STARR-seq to discover large numbers of regulatory elements that actively drive transcription in maize and sorghum. Limited studies in rice and wheat will allow for species-level comparisons. The team will focus on transcriptional enhancers, in particular enhancers that drive gene regulation in response to heat and cold stress. With enhancer sequences in hand, the team will characterize condition-specific enhancers that are conserved or diverged between maize and sorghum, determine phenotype-associated enhancer variation, and identify the transcription factors binding these enhancers through motif searches. In-depth comparisons of sorghum and maize enhancers will yield insights into genome evolution after genome duplication in addition to insights into sorghum's greater stress tolerance. The team will also carry out mutagenesis and massively parallel functional assays of enhancer fragments in order to computationally derive synthetic enhancers of defined strength and specificity for crop engineering. Securing food supplies through crop engineering holds immense public interest and the pursuit of this goal enables this team to effectively reach out to diverse groups and students.

Granular materials are everywhere. They are used in a multitude of applications from handling ores, coal and wheat to pellets used for forming many manufactured plastic products. However, the basic understanding of the way that granular materials respond when they are strained or when they flow is very limited. This lack of knowledge causes significant problems for industry that must handle massive amounts of granular materials. There are two reasons that make it difficult to understand granular materials that are in dense fluid-like and solid-like states. The first is the difficulty of looking inside these materials with tools that can probe key quantities, such as the forces that act between grains. The second is that particles carry forces in very unequal ways. Only a small subset of grains, the so-called force chains, carry the majority of the forces that arise from applied strains or stresses, and the rest are  spectators , bearing almost no force. Understanding the formation and evolution of the force chains is the key challenge for dense granular materials. This project addresses this challenge through experiments using special photoelastic particles that allow precise experimental determination of forces between particles, and hence throughout a granular material. Photoelastic materials, including many plastics, transmit polarized light differently when they are subject to forces. By making grains from photoelastic materials, and placing everything between crossed polarizers, the force chain particles become immediately obvious. With this technique, it is possible to track how the force chains form and change, particularly when they are sheared. Shear occurs when a layer of grains is pushed one way on its top, and in the opposite way on the bottom. Shear is one of the most important ways to change the state of a granular material, and creates long force chains. When shear is continuous in time, the force chains form and break, leading to average forces on the opposite sides of the sheared material. Recent work has shown that the average forces for steady shear depend in a very predictable way on how fast the shearing is carried out. The present project involves experiments to understand how the evolution of the force chains, which change rapidly, lead to the average forces reported earlier. The answers to how force chains form, and how they respond to shear have the potential to answer fundamental questions about the behavior of granular materials. The experimental work involves students at all levels, from high school through Ph.D. candidates. Particular care will be given to involve women and minorities in all aspects. The project will involve outreach to industry, in terms of applications, and to elementary and secondary school students through science demonstrations and visits. The PI is also involved in a number of professional activities that benefit the field, including being editor in chief of the journal Granular Matter, and organizing parts of national and international meetings. All aspects of STEM, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are present in this project. Technical Abstract:This project addresses two key intertwined questions for dense granular materials through a series of novel experiments. The experiments involve quasi-two dimensional photoelastic particles, enabling powerful methods to measure forces and other quantities at the particle scale. The key questions are: What are the microscopic processes that lead to the evolution of granular force networks? and What are the physical origins of stresses for steadily sheared granular materials, sometimes referred to as rheology? Key question 1 concerns self-organization of grain scale structures in response to applied protocols, for example stresses or strains. Granular materials form complex networks, force chains, whose evolution, starting at the microscale, is basic to the origin of jammed granular states and granular dynamics in flowing systems. Collective granular response is both surprising and poorly understood at microscopic scale. How can a stress-free state become jammed under shear, with no change in area? What microscopic processes enable memory effects under cyclic strains, or the Janssen effect? What determines the lowest packing fraction for a random loose packing? Force networks self-organize to create the observed responses, but little if anything is known about the processes that generate the networks. Key question 2 is: What are the physical origins of rheology? More precisely, what relates the effective friction, which is the ratio of shear stress and pressure, to a dimensionless shear rate, the inertial number, involving the pressure, density, and particle size? Empirical  local  models describe relatively simple flows, but are inadequate for more complex cases. Recent non-local models extend the local ones. But, in the past, there are few experiments that probe inside materials, determining local properties, to definitively test these models. Experiments in this project use high speed imaging of photoelastic particles in several shear-dominated flows to test these models to determine all properties of the shear flow, including the full stress tensor. For both questions 1 and 2, the experiments use a range of different quasi-2D photoelastic particles having different friction, shape and stiffness. This project involves: 1) determining local granular structures that self-organize in response to a range of protocols, and 2) relating the evolution of these structures to large scale response. The interconnection of macroscopic and specific collective microscopic processes in dry granular materials, specifically to understand how force networks form and evolve, has not been achieved previously to the principal investigator's knowledge. This understanding has the potential to explain many complex processes that are usually treated at a macroscopic phenomenological level. For shear flows, this work provides experimental tests and comparisons to recently proposed models of rheology. A key goal is understanding multi-scale dynamical processes that underlie these models. This project involves continued efforts to transfer knowledge derived from DMR- supported research to industrial applications through connections to the International Fine Particle Research Institute (IFPRI). In particular, flows in hoppers are an industrially relevant flow involving rheology. The principal investigator and other project participants regularly involve undergraduates and high school students in the lab. The project involves outreach to students in elementary and secondary schools through science activities, and demonstrations. The project involves lab members at all stages of intellectual development, with special attention to the recruitment of under-represented groups, in particular, women and minorities. The PI is involved in a number of activities including editorship of Granular Matter and conference organization that support research and foster collaboration in the granular and complex fluids communities.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All genes in an organism use a simple, four-letter alphabet (A, C, G, T) to make three-letter words (codons) to specify each amino acid of a protein. There is redundancy in this genetic code with multiple, similar codons often coding for the same amino acid. In the DNA, the overall G+C content of genes within any given species is often very similar. However, in grass species there are high-GC and low-GC genes, and there is evidence that high-GC and low-GC genes may be transcribed from DNA into RNA and translated from RNA into protein differently. This project will test whether proteins from high-GC and low-GC genes are transcribed and translated with equal efficiency and, specifically, whether that differential regulation is used when responding to heat, cold and drought stress. This work will also discover rules about codon usage and protein synthesis that can be used to design transgenes for efficient protein production. Finally, current gene prediction software does not account for the high-GC and low-GC genes found in grasses. This project will create a new gene prediction program that will more accurately predict genes in grasses. Better gene prediction will benefit the larger community of plant researchers, including those who work with economically important grasses such as maize, rice, wheat, oats and barley.Grass genes have a bimodal GC distribution and a significant 5' to 3' GC gradient. Little is known about the consequence of such variation on gene and protein expression. High gene GC content and strong negative 5' to 3' gradients in grasses strongly affect codon usage bias. It is possible that both GC biased gene conversion and codon usage bias are important in shaping the unusual GC features that are found in grass genes. GC biased gene conversion may help to move gene mutation towards a particular codon usage program, and then selection on that codon bias may maintain a gene's GC content and gradient. GC biased gene conversion in rice will be examined. Transcriptional and translational characteristics of native and transgenes that differ only in their GC content will also be studied in rice. Translational efficiency may also be affected by regulation of tRNAs in a tissue or condition-specific manner. Therefore, regulation of tRNAs will be examined to determine if changes in tRNA abundances affect protein translational efficiency. Recent published data indicate that due to the variation of GC content in grass genes, a notable number of genes in grasses have been missed or mis-annotated by existing gene finders. A new gene prediction tool that accounts for grass bimodal GC distribution will be designed to improve gene annotation in grasses. The results from this project will provide novel insights into gene evolution in grasses as well as important guidance for crop improvement via genetic modification.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many plant species, particularly those adapted to temperate climates, flowering occurs at a particular time of year in response to the sensing of seasonal cues such as changes in day-length and temperature. The objective of the research is to further the understanding of the genes and biochemical pathways that control the timing of flowering in response to seasonal cues in grasses, a group of plants that includes many important crops such as wheat, oats, rice, and corn. Much of the research will utilize the model grass Brachypodium distachyon because working in this species facilitates identifying the genes underlying flowering in response to seasonal cues. The data generated will help to lay the groundwork for tailoring the flowering of crop species, and will advance the basic understanding of how organisms have evolved systems to perceive environmental cues and translate those cues into developmental programs such as the initiation of flowering. This project will result in the training of graduate students and postdocs, and provide undergraduates with an opportunity to learn about research in genetics, molecular biology, and plant development while exploring their interests in a STEM career. The project will also involve development of a classroom module to provide K-12 students with an opportunity to explore how plants grow and develop and respond to seasonal signals such as the cold of winter.A major goal is to advance the understanding of how perception of winter cold as well as the short days of winter are translated into stable, epigenetic changes in gene expression that enable grasses that are adapted to temperate climates to become competent to flower in the spring when conditions are most favorable for reproduction. The process is known as vernalization. The project will involve studying certain recently discovered key genes involved in both cold-mediated and short-day-mediated flowering in grasses. These genes had not previously been known to play a role in flowering. One group of genes encodes proteins that may be part of a novel, plant-specific gene regulatory complex; another represents a new role for a member of the florigen gene family. A combination of genetics and biochemistry will be employed to explore the role of the proteins encoded by these genes with the goal of better understanding the molecular basis of how flowering is regulated in response to seasonal cues in grasses. The flowering pathways under study evolved independently in different groups of plants; thus, this research is also a model for studying how convergent evolutionary pathways can lead to a solution to the common problem of ensuring that flowering only occurs after winter has ended.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Objective 2: Characterize the potential transfer of soil lead, arsenic, and other trace elements by vegetable crops grown on element enriched urban and orchard soils and develop methods to prevent this transfer. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 3: Characterize genetic resources and inheritance of grain Cd to reduce cadmium in durum wheat, flax and soybean. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 4: Evaluate information about the risk from Cd in foods to support public decisions for foods of both plant and animal origin. (C1; PS 1.F). The ultimate goals of this Project Plan are to improve the science about risk of heavy metals in soils and crops in order to obtain improved regulatory limits for Cd in crops under Codex, and the information needed to provide improved advice about the risk of Pb in urban garden soils and crops. Essentially all human Cd disease from soil Cd has resulted from paddy rice grown on fields contaminated by mining or smelter emissions. Garden vegetables and other grains have not been found to induce Cd disease in highly exposed populations who grow crops on highly Cd+Zn contaminated soils. Some Europeans want to set crop Cd limits based on attainable levels rather than on the basis of potential risk to consumers. Such non-risk based standards will harm U.S. growers of durum wheat, sunflower kernels, flax, soybean, and some other crops. If crops must contain lower levels of Cd to win importation by other nations, both soil treatments, selection of soil series which produce lower Cd crops, and improved cultivars which accumulate lower amounts of Cd will contribute to growers needs. Providing a clear technical basis for the bioavailability of Cd in different crops appears to be the central issue which could change the demand for lower limits for crop Cd, and protect growers from unnecessary costs to produce lower Cd crops which may have no benefit. Only animal feeding tests can provide valid information about the bioavailability of crop Cd to animals, and the concentrations fed must represent levels in foods rather than toxic levels fed in most previous research. Because Zn is usually greatly increased in crops (except rice) when Cd is increased, the presence of Zn may substantially reduce the bioavailability of crop Cd, alleviating presumed risk of crop Cd. Because commercial carrots were found with higher than normal Pb concentrations when grown on historic orchard soils, U.S.-FDA requested that ARS examine the basis for carrot Pb accumulation and to learn if agricultural amendments can reduce carrot Pb when they are grown on high Pb soils. Certain root crops have xylem elements growing through the edible storage root, so if Pb is trapped within the xylem during normal growth of the crop, it will be in the edible root. But such Pb might have much lower bioavailability than the Pb-acetate used to establish diet Pb risk; 2-10% of food Pb is absorbed, while 60-80% of soluble Pb in water is absorbed by human volunteers."

Stripe rust of barley can cause significant yield loss in the western U.S. The long-term goal of this project is to reduce losses in wheat and barley yield and quality caused by stripe rust and assure stable, sustainable production while protecting the environment. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding virulence compositions of the pathogen population, identification of new sources of resistance, disease forecasting, and control of the disease using fungicides in recent years. However, more research is needed to monitor dynamic changes of virulent races, obtain better knowledge of resistance genes in elite germplasm, to identify more genes for effective resistance, and to develop molecular markers for use in the efficient incorporation of new genes into wheat and barley cultivars. For the next five years, we will conduct research to achieve the following objectives: 1). Use molecular markers and host plant responses to characterize and differentiate current and emergent virulent races of the stripe rust pathogens of wheat and barley. 2). Determine the distribution, nature, and effectiveness of host plant resistance genes amongst elite wheat and barley germplasm. 3). Identify and determine linkage relationships of new major and minor stripe rust resistance genes, and develop molecular markers for application in wheat and barley breeding efforts. Accomplishment of these objectives will lead to improved knowledge of the disease epidemiology, more resistance genes and germplasm, and more effective technology to achieve sustainable control of stripe rust."

Fusarium head blight (FHB) has been ranked as one of the greatest threats to the production of wheat and barley.  This project is focused on identifying the wheat genes with essential functions in FHB resistance.  This will be accomplished using a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay which can down-regulate, or knockdown the expression of chosen genes so that their function can be inferred from the phenotypic change.  This functional assay for genes involved in FHB resistance has been validated and a key role for genes in the ethylene-signaling pathway has already been established.  In the next 5 years of work, we will conduct an in depth survey for genes functioning in FHB resistance, and determine if these genes can be used to engineer improved levels of FHB resistance.

Employ VIGS to test if the candidate genes identified in the RNA-seq survey encode proteins with functions that are critical for FHB resistance in wheat.  B.  If new genes encoding functions essential for FHB resistance are identified initiate transgenic studies to test if they can be used to improve FHB resistance."

Research is focused on genetic variation in both the host cereals and their rust pathogens that determine the resistance/susceptible phenotype of the interaction. Isolates of rust fungi obtained from annual surveys of the wheat, barley, and oat crops are used to inform the breeding process. Successful control of cereal rusts with host resistance cannot be achieved without knowledge of variation in cereal rust populations. Studies of virulence and molecular variation in cereal rust populations can answer questions that range from the applied, such as which host resistance genes are effective against the current rust population and what resistance genes are in current cereal cultivars, to more basic questions like what are the origins of new races and how do they spread. Discovery of the molecular determinants of pathogenesis and obligate biotrophy in cereal rust fungi via genomic approaches offers intriguing leads in the development of novel resistance mechanisms. Identification, characterization, and introgression of new host resistance to cereal rusts are key to increasing the diversity of resistance genes in our cereals and staying ahead of these   shifty   pathogens."

PAUL,MN,55108,UNITED STATES,,,10.001,2018,,," Objective(s): Wheat improvement is a balancing act requiring simultaneous selection for multiple diverse traits, including resistance to a range of diseases, to develop superior new cultivars. One of the diseases that is a subject of investigation here (Fusarium head blight, FHB) continues to cause significant economic losses to the U.S. wheat crop, while the other (stem rust) has the potential to do so. The overall goal of this project is to identify and characterize genes that will improve resistance to these diseases in wheat. The proposed approaches for improving wheat disease resistance will generate novel strategies, tools, and knowledge for protecting wheat against both FHB and stem rust that complement current breeding efforts for both diseases. These research activities will be coupled with the coordination of a service activity that permits wheat breeders to evaluate advanced germplasm for agronomic quality and disease resistance. Combining basic and applied research in this manner will ensure that new wheat cultivars continue to retain high yield and quality while also being protected from current and potential disease threats.

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments. Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics."

A tank system is available to collect feces both by sedimentation and stripping. The effect of strain and size on protein and amino acid retention will be conducted to determine the need for strain or life stage specific diets.

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B.

Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.

PAUL,MN,55108,UNITED STATES,,,10.001,2018,408671.0,," Objective(s): Crop improvement is a balancing act requiring simultaneous selection for multiple diverse traits, including resistance to a range of diseases, to develop superior new cultivars. One of the diseases that is a subject of investigation here (Fusarium head blight) continues to cause significant economic losses to the U.S. wheat crop, while another (stem rust) has the potential to do so. Similarly, crown rust continues to be a significant disease of oat. The overall goal of this project is to use genetic engineering technologies to develop novel molecular variants of specific genes and validate that they, as well as a previously identified spontaneous mutation, improve resistance to these particular diseases in wheat and oat. The approaches for improving disease resistance will generate novel resources and knowledge for protecting wheat against both FHB and stem rust, and oat against crown rust, in a manner that complements current breeding efforts for both diseases. These research activities will be coupled with the coordination of a service activity that provides a conduit for Midwestern hard red spring wheat breeders to evaluate jointly their advanced germplasm for agronomic quality and disease resistance at multiple locations. Combining basic and applied research in this manner will ensure that new wheat and oat cultivars retain high yield and quality while also being protected from current and potential disease threats. To achieve project goals, three objectives will be pursued:  Objective 1:  Evaluate a novel wheat genome deletion that improves Fusarium head blight resistance in adapted hard red spring wheat under field conditions. Sub-Objective 1.A. Evaluate the effect of genetic background on Fusarium head blight resistance conferred by a novel genome deletion. Sub-Objective 1.B. Evaluate the effect of pyramiding the deletion and the partial FHB resistance gene Fhb1 on suppression of FHB. Sub-Objective 1.C. Evaluate the effect of the deletion on agronomic performance in contemporary hard red spring wheat. Objective 2:  Establish efficient transformation systems in parallel for wheat and oats, and improve disease resistance by endogenous gene disruption and foreign gene addition. Sub-Objective 2.A. Validate candidate rust susceptibility genes in the model grass Brachypodium. Sub-Objective 2.B. Disrupt stem rust susceptibility genes in wheat. Sub-Objective 2.C. Disrupt crown rust susceptibility genes in oat. Objective 3:  Coordinate the Hard Red Spring Wheat Uniform Regional Performance Nursery Program."

We will evaluate germplasm obtained through the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) project, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), and from other sources using methodologies developed in the research unit. Although we have developed effective procedures for inoculating plants with A. flavus and measuring aflatoxin, we will continue to evaluate other methods of quantifying resistance to increase efficiency and reduce costs.  2.

We will continue to screen germplasm from the GEM project, CIMMYT, and other sources to identify new sources of resistance to leaf feeding. We will also screen germplasm to identify sources of resistance to ear damage by fall armyworm, southwestern corn borer, and corn earworm.

We have genotyped and phenotyped populations of F2:3 families to identify quantitative trait loci associated with resistance to aflatoxin accumulation and insect feeding, and additional populations are currently being developed. We have created near-isogenic lines (NILs) to validate the QTLs. We evaluated a 300-line association mapping panel for aflatoxin accumulation and ear damage by caused by insect feeding. From these studies we will identify and confirm additional QTL and candidate genes associated with resistance. We will investigate expression and function of these and other genes or groups of genes using a variety of techniques.  4. Develop and release maize germplasm with resistance to A. flavus infection, aflatoxin accumulation, and insect damage.  Germplasm identified in Objectives 1 and 2 will be used in developing germplasm lines with resistance to aflatoxin accumulation and insect damage using conventional phenotypic selection.

These crops form symbiotic associations with rhizobacteria that results in biological nitrogen fixation that contributes to productivity and profitability of cropping systems. Peas, lentils, and chickpeas are typically sown in the spring, and the development of autumn sown legumes may provide alternatives to winter wheat. Diseases cause considerable losses in these crops every year and are primarily managed by the use of resistant varieties. However, resistance is lacking to several important diseases, including root rots caused by Aphanomyces and Fusarium, Ascochyta blight, Pythium seed rot, and Sclerotinia white mold. Improved understanding of fungicide resistance and mechanisms of pathogenicity and virulence will accelerate the development of effective and efficient practices for managing diseases of these crops. Over the next five years this research project has the following objectives.  Objective 1: Develop and release improved germplasm and cultivars of peas, lentils, and chickpeas that have desirable agronomic traits coupled with enhancements in nutritional characteristics and the ability to form symbiotic effective relationships with nitrogen-fixing rhizobacteria.

One of the diseases that is a subject of investigation here (Fusarium head blight) continues to cause significant economic losses to the U.S. wheat crop, while another (stem rust) has the potential to do so. Similarly, crown rust continues to be a significant disease of oat. The overall goal of this project is to use genetic engineering technologies to develop novel molecular variants of specific genes and validate that they, as well as a previously identified spontaneous mutation, improve resistance to these particular diseases in wheat and oat. The approaches for improving disease resistance will generate novel resources and knowledge for protecting wheat against both FHB and stem rust, and oat against crown rust, in a manner that complements current breeding efforts for both diseases. These research activities will be coupled with the coordination of a service activity that provides a conduit for Midwestern hard red spring wheat breeders to evaluate jointly their advanced germplasm for agronomic quality and disease resistance at multiple locations. Combining basic and applied research in this manner will ensure that new wheat and oat cultivars retain high yield and quality while also being protected from current and potential disease threats.

These crops form symbiotic associations with rhizobacteria that results in biological nitrogen fixation that contributes to productivity and profitability of cropping systems. Peas, lentils, and chickpeas are typically sown in the spring, and the development of autumn sown legumes may provide alternatives to winter wheat. Diseases cause considerable losses in these crops every year and are primarily managed by the use of resistant varieties. However, resistance is lacking to several important diseases, including root rots caused by Aphanomyces and Fusarium, Ascochyta blight, Pythium seed rot, and Sclerotinia white mold. Improved understanding of fungicide resistance and mechanisms of pathogenicity and virulence will accelerate the development of effective and efficient practices for managing diseases of these crops. Over the next five years this research project has the following objectives.  Objective 1: Develop and release improved germplasm and cultivars of peas, lentils, and chickpeas that have desirable agronomic traits coupled with enhancements in nutritional characteristics and the ability to form symbiotic effective relationships with nitrogen-fixing rhizobacteria.

Fusarium head blight (FHB) has been ranked as one of the greatest threats to the production of wheat and barley.  This project is focused on identifying the wheat genes with essential functions in FHB resistance.  This will be accomplished using a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay which can down-regulate, or knockdown the expression of chosen genes so that their function can be inferred from the phenotypic change.  This functional assay for genes involved in FHB resistance has been validated and a key role for genes in the ethylene-signaling pathway has already been established.  In the next 5 years of work, we will conduct an in depth survey for genes functioning in FHB resistance, and determine if these genes can be used to engineer improved levels of FHB resistance.   Objective 1:  Determine if over-expression of genes involved in the ethylene signaling pathway can confer improved resistance to Fusarium head blight in wheat.   Objective 2: Determine whether pathogen recognition receptors have essential roles in Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat.    Objective 3: Test if elevated expression of pathogen recognition receptors can be used to improve resistance to Fusarium head blight and other fungal pathogens of wheat.

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A.

Identify new sources of maize germplasm with resistance to Aspergillus (A.) flavus infection and aflatoxin accumulation. We have developed and released maize germplasm lines with resistance to A. flavus infection and aflatoxin accumulation; however, germplasm with higher levels of resistance and different mechanisms of resistance are needed. We will evaluate germplasm obtained through the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) project, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), and from other sources using methodologies developed in the research unit. Although we have developed effective procedures for inoculating plants with A. flavus and measuring aflatoxin, we will continue to evaluate other methods of quantifying resistance to increase efficiency and reduce costs.  2. Identify new sources of maize germplasm with resistance to fall armyworm, southwestern corn borer, and corn earworm. We have developed and released germplasm lines with excellent resistance to fall armyworm and southwestern corn borer leaf feeding damage using methodology for screening developed in the research unit. We will continue to screen germplasm from the GEM project, CIMMYT, and other sources to identify new sources of resistance to leaf feeding. We will also screen germplasm to identify sources of resistance to ear damage by fall armyworm, southwestern corn borer, and corn earworm. Because insect feeding provides a site for fungi to enter the developing ears of maize, resistance to ear-feeding insects should be reduced.   3. Develop and characterize genetic mapping populations, identify and elucidate functions of genes associated with resistance, and develop molecular markers for enhancing maize germplasm resistance to A. flavus/aflatoxin and insects. We have genotyped and phenotyped populations of F2:3 families to identify quantitative trait loci associated with resistance to aflatoxin accumulation and insect feeding, and additional populations are currently being developed. We have created near-isogenic lines (NILs) to validate the QTLs. We evaluated a 300-line association mapping panel for aflatoxin accumulation and ear damage by caused by insect feeding. From these studies we will identify and confirm additional QTL and candidate genes associated with resistance. We will investigate expression and function of these and other genes or groups of genes using a variety of techniques.  4. Develop and release maize germplasm with resistance to A. flavus infection, aflatoxin accumulation, and insect damage.  Germplasm identified in Objectives 1 and 2 will be used in developing germplasm lines with resistance to aflatoxin accumulation and insect damage using conventional phenotypic selection. We will use information on molecular markers associated with resistance obtained from Objective 3 to enhance our efforts to produce better adapted lines with higher levels of pest resistance."

Stripe rust of barley can cause significant yield loss in the western U.S. The long-term goal of this project is to reduce losses in wheat and barley yield and quality caused by stripe rust and assure stable, sustainable production while protecting the environment. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding virulence compositions of the pathogen population, identification of new sources of resistance, disease forecasting, and control of the disease using fungicides in recent years. However, more research is needed to monitor dynamic changes of virulent races, obtain better knowledge of resistance genes in elite germplasm, to identify more genes for effective resistance, and to develop molecular markers for use in the efficient incorporation of new genes into wheat and barley cultivars. For the next five years, we will conduct research to achieve the following objectives: 1). Use molecular markers and host plant responses to characterize and differentiate current and emergent virulent races of the stripe rust pathogens of wheat and barley. 2). Determine the distribution, nature, and effectiveness of host plant resistance genes amongst elite wheat and barley germplasm. 3). Identify and determine linkage relationships of new major and minor stripe rust resistance genes, and develop molecular markers for application in wheat and barley breeding efforts. Accomplishment of these objectives will lead to improved knowledge of the disease epidemiology, more resistance genes and germplasm, and more effective technology to achieve sustainable control of stripe rust."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A.

Over the past five crop seasons (2007-2012), these crops have been grown on an average of 1,260,000 acres in the US with an average harvest value of over $320 million. These crops also contribute to the success of the US wheat and barley industry by serving as useful rotation crops in small grain production systems.   This research project has three objectives that focus on developing new and improved varieties of cool season food legumes (peas, lentils, and chickpeas) and effective integrated disease control strategies for these crops.   1) Develop and release new varieties and germplasm of peas, lentils, and chickpea that have higher seed mineral concentrations; improved host-plant resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, Sclerotinia wilt and Ascochyta blight; and higher yields than existing commercial varieties.   2) Identify genetic markers closely associated with superior yield, optimal plant height for harvest, seed mineral concentration, resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, and improved cold tolerance for autumn-sown peas, and validate their utility for marker-assisted plant breeding. Sub-objective 2A:  Identify molecular markers in adapted pea populations that are associated with important traits including concentrations of minerals in seed, resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, and winter hardiness.  Sub-objective 2B:  Identify molecular markers in adapted chickpea populations that are associated with seed size and early maturity.   3) Develop efficient techniques to screen peas, lentils, and chickpeas for host-plant resistance to Ascochyta blight and Sclerotinia wilt, and characterize genetic and physiological factors responsible for the virulence of these pathogens.  Sub-objective 3A:  Develop efficient techniques to screen peas, lentils and chickpeas for resistance to Ascochyta blight and Sclerotinia white mold. Sub-objective 3B:  Determine genetic factors responsible for pathogenicity of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum using a variety of genetic and genomic tools.  Sub-objective 3C:  Determine the role of solanapyrone phytotoxins produced by A. rabiei during the development of Ascochyta blight disease in chickpea.   This research will result in several products, including new varieties of peas, lentils, and chickpeas along with improved methods for controlling diseases of these crops."

Objective 2: Characterize the potential transfer of soil lead, arsenic, and other trace elements by vegetable crops grown on element enriched urban and orchard soils and develop methods to prevent this transfer. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 3: Characterize genetic resources and inheritance of grain Cd to reduce cadmium in durum wheat, flax and soybean. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 4: Evaluate information about the risk from Cd in foods to support public decisions for foods of both plant and animal origin. (C1; PS 1.F). The ultimate goals of this Project Plan are to improve the science about risk of heavy metals in soils and crops in order to obtain improved regulatory limits for Cd in crops under Codex, and the information needed to provide improved advice about the risk of Pb in urban garden soils and crops. Essentially all human Cd disease from soil Cd has resulted from paddy rice grown on fields contaminated by mining or smelter emissions. Garden vegetables and other grains have not been found to induce Cd disease in highly exposed populations who grow crops on highly Cd+Zn contaminated soils. Some Europeans want to set crop Cd limits based on attainable levels rather than on the basis of potential risk to consumers. Such non-risk based standards will harm U.S. growers of durum wheat, sunflower kernels, flax, soybean, and some other crops. If crops must contain lower levels of Cd to win importation by other nations, both soil treatments, selection of soil series which produce lower Cd crops, and improved cultivars which accumulate lower amounts of Cd will contribute to growers needs. Providing a clear technical basis for the bioavailability of Cd in different crops appears to be the central issue which could change the demand for lower limits for crop Cd, and protect growers from unnecessary costs to produce lower Cd crops which may have no benefit. Only animal feeding tests can provide valid information about the bioavailability of crop Cd to animals, and the concentrations fed must represent levels in foods rather than toxic levels fed in most previous research. Because Zn is usually greatly increased in crops (except rice) when Cd is increased, the presence of Zn may substantially reduce the bioavailability of crop Cd, alleviating presumed risk of crop Cd. Because commercial carrots were found with higher than normal Pb concentrations when grown on historic orchard soils, U.S.-FDA requested that ARS examine the basis for carrot Pb accumulation and to learn if agricultural amendments can reduce carrot Pb when they are grown on high Pb soils. Certain root crops have xylem elements growing through the edible storage root, so if Pb is trapped within the xylem during normal growth of the crop, it will be in the edible root. But such Pb might have much lower bioavailability than the Pb-acetate used to establish diet Pb risk; 2-10% of food Pb is absorbed, while 60-80% of soluble Pb in water is absorbed by human volunteers."

The proposed research objectives are central to the mission of the USDA ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory (CDL): to reduce losses in wheat, oat, and barley to major diseases using host resistance. Research is focused on genetic variation in both the host cereals and their rust pathogens that determine the resistance/susceptible phenotype of the interaction. Isolates of rust fungi obtained from annual surveys of the wheat, barley, and oat crops are used to inform the breeding process. Successful control of cereal rusts with host resistance cannot be achieved without knowledge of variation in cereal rust populations. Studies of virulence and molecular variation in cereal rust populations can answer questions that range from the applied, such as which host resistance genes are effective against the current rust population and what resistance genes are in current cereal cultivars, to more basic questions like what are the origins of new races and how do they spread. Discovery of the molecular determinants of pathogenesis and obligate biotrophy in cereal rust fungi via genomic approaches offers intriguing leads in the development of novel resistance mechanisms. Identification, characterization, and introgression of new host resistance to cereal rusts are key to increasing the diversity of resistance genes in our cereals and staying ahead of these   shifty   pathogens."

One of the diseases that is a subject of investigation here (Fusarium head blight, FHB) continues to cause significant economic losses to the U.S. wheat crop, while the other (stem rust) has the potential to do so. The overall goal of this project is to identify and characterize genes that will improve resistance to these diseases in wheat. The proposed approaches for improving wheat disease resistance will generate novel strategies, tools, and knowledge for protecting wheat against both FHB and stem rust that complement current breeding efforts for both diseases. These research activities will be coupled with the coordination of a service activity that permits wheat breeders to evaluate advanced germplasm for agronomic quality and disease resistance. Combining basic and applied research in this manner will ensure that new wheat cultivars continue to retain high yield and quality while also being protected from current and potential disease threats. To achieve project goals, three objectives will be pursued:  Objective 1: Develop and evaluate hard red spring wheat with improved Fusarium head blight resistance by mapping and introgressing both a new resistance QTL and a novel genome deletion that increases resistance.
