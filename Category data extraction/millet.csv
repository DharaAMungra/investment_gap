The objectives will address the need to develop new strategies that include more efficient use of herbicides combined with increased use of alternative, biologically based weed management for agroecosystems.Approach:Processes that regulate weed population density will be investigated, with particular focus on spatiotemporal variation in demographic parameters and population growth rates at multiple levels of scale.  As a means of unifying observations, whole life cycles of weeds will be the unit of study whenever possible.  Important microbial seed bank relationships will be identified along with the underlying mechanisms of interactions between microbes and weed seeds.  Factors that control these interactions and natural plant defenses will be examined.  Long-term rates of weed seed loss due to predation will be measured and used to validate mathematical models that predict long-term predation rates from point measurements of seed predation.  Attention will be paid to cropping system effects on seed predation rates, with the goal of understanding how crop habitat affects the seed-feeding activity of different seed predator taxa.   Mechanisms underlying synergistic effects of combinations of weed management tactics on weeds will be examined within the context of both vegetable and agronomic production systems. Options for managing weeds in vegetables are limited, thus focused efforts using sweet corn as a model, along with application of the larger knowledge base gained from field corn and soybean studies, will be beneficial for minor crop systems.  A long-term goal of this work is to develop practical guidelines, supported by ecological understanding, for creating multi-tactic weed management systems that are effective, perform consistently, and use herbicides to tune, rather than drive the system.  Initially, the weed species of focus are giant ragweed, velvetleaf, giant foxtail, and wild proso millet.  This research will improve our understanding of fundamental factors associated with multi-trophic processes and interactions regulating weeds throughout their life cycles.  These data will contribute to systematic prediction of the impact of weeds on agronomic and vegetable crops, leading to more effective synergistic combinations of weed management tactics."

Most plant genomes characterized to date are a complex collection of linear and circular interconverting molecules that display evidence of recombination, foreign DNA integration and changes in relative copy number.  These genomic activities are controlled by nuclear genes that can be manipulated in their expression to cause mitochondrial genome instability.  Using this approach in tomato, tobacco, millet, sorghum, soybean and Arabidopsis allows for cross-species comparison of mitochondrial genome disruption.  This project exploits this system to identify cellular and developmental pathways that are directly influenced by mitochondrial genome status, conserved across plant species, and evidenced by changes in plant phenotypes.  The central hypothesis of the project states that mitochondrial status in plants is integrated into discrete pathways for plastid development, pollen development, cell cycle control and particular plant stress responses.  The project provides unique entry to these pathway integration points by combining Arabidopsis mutant analysis and cross-species comparisons with mitochondrial and gene expression analysis.  While it has long been known that plant mitochondria play distinct roles in metabolism, growth and development, direct mitochondrial manipulations prior to this study were largely restricted to inhibitor studies with limited opportunity for extrapolation to whole plant phenotype.  Broader impacts of the study.  Plant mitochondrial genome rearrangement can lead to altered plant phenotypes of agricultural importance.  For example, these studies have already produced evidence of cytoplasmic male sterility, a trait useful in hybrid seed production and transgene containment, and of enhanced crop thermotolerance.  Both valuable traits are difficult to attain using conventional crop breeding approaches. With regard to training opportunities, the Center for Plant Science Innovation (PSI) at University of Nebraska sponsors an undergraduate summer internship program that integrates to the proposed project; through this program, four minority students have already been recruited into graduate programs in the past two years.  The PSI also directs the Nebraska Molecular Plant Breeding Graduate Program; this project sponsors at least two plant breeding students on the proposed project.  Currently, the US faces a critical shortage of plant breeders with cross-cutting expertise in field management of transgenic crops, DNA marker-based selection, statistics, and comparative genomics.  This project provides fertile ground for such training, in cooperation with plant breeders on campus and in industry.Project data will be accessible via http://psiweb.unl.edu/mackenzie/ and gene expression data released to ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/ae/)."

One of these is a process of asymmetric (non-reciprocal) recombination that appears to directly influence plant reproduction.  Until now, our understanding of these processes has been hindered, in part, by the unavailability of effective model systems for investigating nuclear gene influence on the process.  The effects of three nuclear genes, MSH1, OSB1 and RECA3, have recently been analyzed on mitochondrial genome stability. RECA3 and MSH1 function in distinct but overlapping pathways, while OSB1 cooperates with MSH1, to regulate the appearance of specific recombination products in Arabidopsis mitochondria.  The principal investigators have recently shown that MSH1 functions similarly in tobacco, tomato, soybean and millet, but MSH1 RNAi knockdowns in these species also condition cytoplasmic male sterility. The principal investigators are now in a position to analyze the mitochondrial genome changes that occur when mutations in these nuclear genes permit normally rare recombination activity to occur at high frequency, and to compare the consequences of this recombination in multiple plant species. The central hypothesis is that MSH1, OSB1, and RECA3, together with specific breakage sites in the genome, represent components of an interacting network that operates in plant mitochondrial recombination-dependent replication initiation. The principal investigators propose that double-strand DNA breaks occur at specific locations within the mitochondrial genome to initiate recombination and replication, and that MSH1, OSB1 and RECA3 are involved in preventing recombination between repeats that are shorter than a few hundred bases. The principal investigators test these hypotheses by identifying double-strand breaks in repeated sequences, and in the Atp9, Atp6, CoxII and Rpl16 genes, in which there is evidence of recombination activity. This analysis is complemented by studies of inducible changes in tobacco, tomato, soybean and millet mitochondrial genomes that occur with MSH1 suppression and male sterility induction. This project will develop a unifying model for recombination-dependent replication of plant mitochondrial genomes, and provide insights into the mechanisms for the induction and suppression of cytoplasmic male sterility, a phenomenon of agricultural importance that leads, in nature, to the gynodioecious reproductive strategies of approximately 5% of world plant species. The minority student training opportunities associated with this proposal will involve alignment with the Young Nebraska Scientist (YNS) Program, in which an undergraduate YNS student will participate in this research each summer."

Worldwide, this disease results in major epidemics and yield losses of rice. The utility of two historically important strategies for defeating the rice blast fungus, chemical pesticides and naturally occurring resistance in rice, is severely limited by the fungus' ability to overcome these strategies, rendering them ineffective. If we can pinpoint exactly how the fungus infects, grows within, and reproduces in its host plants, we can more accurately design novel disease control strategies. The ultimate goal of our project is to contribute knowledge towards understanding how the rice blast fungus infects its host plants. A successful infection of the host results from the fungus moving smoothly from one infective life cycle stage to the next, which can only be accomplished by careful control over the expression of its genes. There are several levels of gene control in many organisms ranging from humans to fruit flies. We will specifically target one of these levels, called small RNAs, in the rice blast fungus. Small RNAs are short stretches of nucleic acids that can `match' the sequence of specific genes within a genome. Extensive research on small RNAs has revealed that, along with other jobs, these tiny molecules can control whether a gene will be turned on or off; small RNAs represent a sort of `fine-tuning' mechanism for gene regulation. Thus far, little is known about small RNAs in filamentous fungi, particularly plant parasites; our study aims to fill in these gaps. To do this, we are using several approaches that complement each other; the first approach is genetic and involves `breaking' genes in the fungus that, based on their DNA sequences, might be involved in producing small RNAs. Once we have generated these mutants, we can see whether the small RNAs have disappeared, and what effect this has on growth of the fungus and its ability to infect host plants. Because small RNAs can control gene expression, we will look at expression of all fungal genes when small RNAs are gone (i.e. the mutants). What effect will a lack of small RNAs have on gene expression? What types of genes will be most effected? We can achieve this goal by using microarray technology; microarrays are microscope slides that contain every gene from our fungus. We will put the genetic complement from several of the mutants onto these slides, read the slides using a special scanner, and analyze the data; this data will tell us how genes change when small RNAs are no longer present. Finally, we will sequence small RNAs from the fungus under different environmental conditions, including wild type growth conditions, nutrient starvation, and while infecting the host plant. This will tell us quantity and type of small RNAs produced under different conditions. Together, these three approaches will provide a comprehensive survey into the roles of small RNAs- we will be able to see how they impact gene regulation of the fungus, and how this ties into growth and virulence."

Diverse (exotic and temperate) germplasm will be screened under field conditions for resistance to aflatoxin and insect pests (i.e., corn earworm, fall armyworm, maize weevil, and stink bugs).  Field-proven germplasm entries will be further evaluated for key unique phenotypic traits in relation to resistance mechanisms and underlying genetics using both conventional and molecular techniques.  Following rigorous field and laboratory screenings, selected germplasm will be further examined for biochemical and physiological bases that confer resistance to multiple insect pests and aflatoxin.  Insect resistance mechanisms in the selected corn and pearl millet germplasm will be categorized and the biochemical and physiological processes that confer certain insect resistance will be identified.  Segregating populations with resistance to aflatoxin contamination and multiple insect damage will be developed.

Over the past two decades, the privatization of crop varieties through intellectual property rights law under the World Trade Organization has sparked a number of debates concerning Farmers' Rights, access to plant resources, benefit sharing, and cross-cultural concepts of property in plants and associated knowledge.  To investigate how farmers conceptualize property rights in plants, Chapman will undertake research in the Lower River Division of The Gambia, where farmers cultivate rice and millet for household subsistence and commercial sale.  The study draws on a wide range of historic and ethnographic methods including archival research, semi-structured and life history interviews, seed network analysis, and focus groups to determine how farmers conceive of property in seeds and how farmers access different crop varieties.  In particular, this research explores the concepts of value, exchange and access as they relate to farmers' management of crop resources in The Gambia.  These three concepts are central to studies in property theory and common resource management research.  Understanding how these concepts relate to seed systems will enable a more nuanced investigation of ideas such as private ownership, public goods, and open access concerning seeds and associated knowledge.This study will contribute to social science theory on traditional legal processes that are not articulated through conflict resolution.  In this sense, the project enables greater understanding of the relationships between customary and codified legal systems common in many parts of the world today. A better understanding of farmers' own systems for owning, accessing, valuing and exchanging crop varieties will also contribute to improving state and international law for intellectual property rights. Funding this research also supports the education of a graduate student."

Apomictic hybrids are true-breeding because seed-derived progeny of an apomictic plant are genetically identical to the maternal parent, i.e., they are clonal in origin. Our long-term goal is to discover the molecular basis for apomixis in a plant species where the reproductive process has naturally evolved and to utilize this discovery to facilitate the stabilization of superior gene combinations in crop plants. A candidate gene for one component of apomixis, parthenogenesis, has been identified from apomictic species closely related to the crop pearl millet. The candidate, ASGR-BABY BOOM-LIKE (ASGR-BBML), has sequence similarity to BABY BOOM genes from Brassica and Arabidopsis that are known to be involved in embryo development. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that ASGR-BBML plays a role in parthenogenesis. Specific objectives are to (1) characterize the pattern of ASGR-BBML expression, especially during early embryo development, using a promoter-reporter gene fusion; (2) investigate the function of ASGR-BBML using a silencing strategy to reduce/eliminate expression of ASGR-BBML in an apomictic backcross line of Pennisetum; (3) test the versatility of a two-component conditional gene expression system for reproductive tissues of grasses using a semi-constitutive promoter for the transcriptional activator and a reporter gene; and (4) determine the role of ASGR-BBML in embryo development by conditional overexpression in reproductive tissues of sexual and apomictic lines. The proposed research is expected to further define the roles of BBM-genes in reproductive development."

Soil, plant and remotely sensed data are quantified in irrigated corn-cotton-peanut rotations at Camilla and Tifton, GA with U of GA scientists to evaluate variable tillage, residue, and irrigation regimes. Ground based and remotely sensed data provide instantaneous and non-destructive spatial measures of crop response. Treatments are: conventional tillage (CT) no cover crop and strip-till (ST) with rye, and irrigation treatments: (1) no-irrigation; (2) full irrigation, maintaining soil water tension above 30 mb; (3) irrigation beginning at V10; and (4) irrigation beginning at V14.Hypothesis 1.B ûPasture management strategies designed to maintain nutrients (N and P) in the rooting zone and/or remove nutrients through harvested products will increase profitability and decrease N and P losses to streams in Piedmont systems.  Systems are evaluated on-farm using eight Piedmont stream-side fields. Historical baseline data (1999 û 2003) from unimproved hayfields and pastures are compared to data following establishment of improved management (2005 to 2008): no-till pearl millet/with rye grazed, alfalfa hay, bermudagrass/ryegrassûhay,  and over-seeded pastureûgrazed in winter.  Soil chemical (C, N, and P) and physical properties, water quality data (N & P) upstream, downstream, and surface runoff, are combined with agronomic costs to estimate environmental impact.Hypothesis 2 û Grazing winter cover crops in a conservation system will impact cotton production and economic return, and negatively affect soil properties influencing water quality and water and nutrient availability.  the winter rye cover crop is grazed in the spring and compared to fields that are not grazed. Cotton is planted in May and spatially delineated areas are sampled for biomass, plant height, and nutrient status at first bloom and mid-bloom to determine grazing and landscape effects. Soil water availability is measured using TDR. A picker equipped with yield monitor and GPS is used for harvest. Cotton for fiber analysis is collected from zones in each field. Water conservation and water quality are evaluated from runoff and water use. Objective 3: National Program Staff and Office of Technology Transfer are supporting this NP216 effort to develop tools for customer-based assessment of effectiveness of technology transfer. Scientists from Watkinsville, Auburn, and Mandan working with K.S.U. Jayaratne, Extension Program Evaluator, NCSU, will design and conduct the following studies: 1. Baseline determination of current awareness of NP216 research and technology transfer by customers. Identify preferred technology delivery methods and barriers and challenges in transferring technology to end users.  2. Annual evaluations at 2, 3, and 4 years to facilitate improvements in technology transfer. 3. Comprehensive end of cycle (5 yrs) evaluation to assess economic, environmental, or social impact of new technologies generated and disseminated in NP216."

Small-holder farmers in Africa and South America are responsible for more than 95% of cacao production, providing economic benefits to millions of cacao farmers and their dependents, as well as important ecological benefits such as rain-forest preservation. Fungal and oomycete diseases have devastated cacao production in South America and West Africa, dislocating populations of farmers and resulting in destruction of the rain-forest sheltering the cacao trees in favor of large-scale open farmland. This project will test two novel approaches to protecting developing country crops against a broad-spectrum of oomycete and fungal pathogens, using cacao as the initial target. The first involves targeting anti-microbial proteins to pathogen feeding structures called haustoria, using RPW8, an Arabidopsis protein that has a natural affinity for these feeding sites. The second approach involves blocking the entry of virulence proteins (effector proteins) that pathogens secrete into host cells to suppress the plant host's immune system. The most effective strategies will be identified first using fast growing Arabidopsis and tomato plants before being tested in cacao.Broader Impacts: The novel technologies that will be tested in this project are potentially applicable to an extremely broad array of crop diseases important to the developing world. The most destructive diseases of broad acreage staples such as rice and wheat are potentially amenable to this approach, as are many of the most limiting fungal and oomycete diseases of crops of importance to smallholders, such as yams, cassava, groundnuts, pearl millet, finger millet, sorghum, maize, potato, bean and cowpea. The project includes visits from scientists from developing countries, a colloquium in Ecuador, and regular communication with scientists from cacao-producing countries.  Project outcomes as well as access to biological resources that include DNA constructs and germplasm will be disseminated through a project website (accessible via https://www.vbi.vt.edu/faculty/research_groups/brett_tyler) and through publications."

A second component will involve animal scientist that will explore the potential use of diverse crops for livestock feed. These projects will specifically consider peas as feed for dairy and range cattle, pea forage for growing beef cattle, and cold-pressed oilseed (camelina) meal as a source of protein and energy in swine diets. Utilizing the products of these crops locally or on the farm minimizes transportation costs. The last component will consider the potential of optimizing the inter-crop fallow periods. Treatments will evaluate the potential of using inter-crop fallow periods to grow cover-crops that utilize the excess water to compete with weeds, sequester or fix nitrogen, enhance microbial activity, and encourage beneficial insects. The potential of using these crops as a forage resource will also be examined. These systems will be evaluated across the moisture gradient of the humid and arid parts of the Northern Great Plains.

A study conducted at five locations across the state that included irrigated and non-irrigated sites found that tall wheatgrass and grass mixtures that contained tall wheatgrass provided superior quality for ethanol production compared to several other species evaluated including switchgrass. Tall wheatgrass also contained higher cellulose and had lower lignin amounts which would increase ethanol production efficiency. In a separate study, grass plots harvested every other year produced approximately 25% less biomass yield than grasses harvested annually. Several experiments were seeded in spring 2009 to evaluate the potential biomass yield of kenaf, sunnhemp, sorghums, and millets. Initial results found sorghum and kenaf have the potential to produce above 10 ton/acre of dry matter in one season and could be used as annual feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol production in ND. A study to evaluate production potential of 22 varieties of sorghum that included BMR (Brown Mid Rib) hybrids was conducted at two locations in ND. The BMR character confers reduced lignin content which increases digestibility with a resulting increase in ethanol production. Unfortunately, varieties that contained the BMR character had less biomass production than the same variety without BMR. Studies are in progress to evaluate to yield potential of grass and grass legume mixtures compared to grasses grown alone. The long-term goal is to produce more biomass and thus more ethanol per acre with reduced inputs. Examples of mixtures include intermediate and tall wheatgrass, wheatgrass, alfalfa and sweet clover, or basin and alti wildrye. Sugarbeet pulp is used as a feedstock for ethanol production. A solids fed batch approach has shown that loadings up to 12% solids allowed near maximum yields with increased sugar concentrations for subsequent ethanol conversion compared to higher or lower percentages. Invasion of cool season perennial grasses into established switchgrass fields has become a serious problem and decreases potential ethanol production. A total of four pre-emergent and 23 post-applied herbicides have been evaluated for efficacy on switchgrass, quackgrass, and smooth bromegrass. Of these nine were chosen for further evaluation for weed control in an established switchgrass field. Pyroxulam, sulfosulfuron, and aminocyclopyrachlor provided the best smooth bromegrass control while sulfometuron and propoxycarbazone were most effective for quackgrass control. None of these herbicides injured switchgrass. An empirical model based on a mathematical programming algorithm was developed to determine the optimal number, location, and size of cellulose ethanol plants in North Dakota to maximize the use of biomass produced in the state. The goal is to minimize transportation costs of biomass to the plant and of ethanol from the plant to blending facilities."

In addition, there are over 300,000 horses in Florida with an associated cash flow of $1.25 billion per year. Forage is a major component of the diet of all livestock in the state. Planted pastures occupy approximately 3.5 million acres and native grasslands (includes forestland that is grazed) another 6 million acres. In spite of their large contributions to the state?s economy, limitations remain among forages currently utilized in Florida. Bahiagrass, which is grown on approximately 2.5 million acres for forage, produces 85% of its yield during the period from April through September. Lack of cool-season production results in greater need for supplement feeds and increased cost to livestock producers. Bahiagrass also is relatively low in digestibility and this limits performance of animals consuming bahiagrass herbage. Bermudagrass, though highly desirable for hay production, requires high inputs and may not tolerate close, repeated grazing by horses. More persistent types would benefit horse owners. Warm-season annual grasses like sorghum and pearl millet are quite high in nutritive value, but they must be reseeded every year and they are difficult to manage under grazing. An alternative forage that is better suited for grazing yet also has high nutritive value would be an important advance, particularly if it was a perennial. Limpograss is becoming very important to beef cattle producers in South Florida, but new genotypes with greater persistence and increased digestibility would benefit livestock operations. Thus, there is a need for continued evaluation of potential new forage species and genotypes for Florida forage-livestock systems. This project will assess digestibility and grazing tolerance of bahiagrasses selected for greater cool-season production, measure yield and nutritive value of seeded bermudagrass compared to traditional hybrids, test Mulato brachiariagrass for adaptation and performance in North Florida, and assess grazing tolerance and digestibility of new breeder?s lines of limpograss."

K.",,,555456995,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,LINCOLN,NE,68588,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2011,,,"Semi-arid climate of western Central Great Plains of the USA (western Nebraska and Kansas; eastern Colorado and Wyoming; and south-western South Dakota) is one of the most challenging environments for profitable crop production in the USA because of short growing season, dry climate, limited precipitation, high elevation, and occasionally severe hail. Majority of cropland is dryland and winter wheat is the major crop in this area. Diversifying crops in the farm can enhance the economic viability of producers and provide new market alternatives. Therefore, alternative crops that are suitable for dryland and limited irrigation production are important for sustainable farming in the region. Proso millet is the best alternative crop in the region due to its less water requirement and well adaptability. However, proso acreage is limited due to its primary use as birdseed and extreme price volatility in the market. Alternative use of proso millet (e.g. fuel, food) would increase its value and acreage. Because of narrow germplasm base of proso millet cultivars, genetic improvement of existing varieties and development of new proso millet variety with novel traits for new use will be critical. Camelina is an old oilseed crop newly introduced to the semiarid west of the United States and it is a promising spring-sown rotation crop in the region due to its excellent seedling frost tolerance and short-duration. A number of unique traits (e.g. low input crop, improved drought tolerance and water use efficiency, high oils ~35% content, limited culinary uses etc.) make camelina as a high-potential oilseed crops for biodiesel feedstock compared to other oilseed crops. There is limited research on developing improved camelina varieties well adapted to the western Nebraska. Annual forages are well adapted to the semiarid Northern Great Plains environments. Replacing summer fallow with annual forages may be an effective cropping system for improving soil quality and increasing economic returns. Annual legume with forage potential is desirable because it can be used as forage as well as to improve soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation but currently no such annual legume is available that is well adapted in the region. Outcomes/Impacts: It is anticipated that several new cultivars will be released from this program with improved adaptation and value for regional producers. Progress related to growth in alternative crop production in the region will be monitored by Nebraska Department of Agriculture Statistics. An ethanol-based market of proso millet has the potential to enhance the regional economy, to minimize its market volatility, and to increase wheat yield. Production of large acreage of oil-seed in the region will encourage development of local bio-diesel plant. All these efforts will help making agriculture in northern High Plains sustainable, which indirectly will sustain rural economy in Nebraska."

Examples of unmodified polysaccharides are starch of corn, wheat, gum arabica, gum tragcanth and gum guar. Modified products may be carboxymethylated polysaccharides or polysaccharides hydrolyzed by acids, alkalis or enzymes. In addition to being renewable and sustainable, agriculturally sourced bio-based polysaccharides and modified products obtained from them have the potential and properties to satisfy all requirements for good polymeric textile printing thickening agents. Because they are also widely available, they are economical as well. By 2015, worldwide production of printed textiles is projected to be more than 30 billion square meters. Traditional textile printing methods such as direct printing, resist printing and discharge printing account for more than 90% of the global market for printed textiles. Therefore, the potential market and hence economic impact of agricultural products as polymeric bio-based thickening agents is immense. The proposed project will study agriculture products for their potential to be used as natural polymeric thickeners in textile printing applications. For the two year duration of this project, focus will be aimed towards polysaccharide sources that are abundant in Colorado and the western region of the country. These include wheat, corn, sorghum and proso millet. Additionally, literature survey indicated little or no research on sorghum and proso millet as potential sources for bio-based polymers in textile processing and therefore particular attention will be directed towards these agriculture products. Nationally, Colorado ranks 1st in production of the proso millet crop. The most common market for proso millet is bird seed and animal feed. Finding alternative additional markets for such agriculture products will be potentially more profitable than current uses such as animal feed and bird seed."

L. Bennetzen (University of Georgia)Plants containing engineered chromosome breakage constructs will be used as a study system to investigate the nature of inaccurate repair of double strand DNA breaks (DSB), and the genetic or environmental factors that affect the nature of inaccurate repair. DSB repair, in all organisms from bacteria to plants and animals, is highly accurate.  This accuracy is necessary to allow chromosomes to be replicated and passed on to subsequent generations of progeny because these breaks are so frequent and are lethal if unrepaired.  However, inaccurate repair of DSB does occur, leading to small deletions, insertions or other outcomes at the break site.  Some previous studies have suggested that the relative sizes and frequencies of the inaccurate DSB repair events may vary from species to species, and that this variance might be responsible for differences in the rate at which genomes change size and for differences in their rate of sequence change.  This project will use a regulated DSB system, involving the enzyme I-SceI expressed off a transgenic construct in plants that are then crossed to other plants that have a cutting site for I-SceI.  The progeny of this cross have been shown, in preliminary experiments, to undergo DSB at the I-SceI site, and to sometimes have inaccurate repair at that site.  The I-SceI site in many of these progeny plants will be DNA sequenced by the investigators to see what kind of deletions, insertions, et cetera, are found at the cleavage site.  This work is being done in four grass species (maize, pearl millet, rice, and sorghum), with very different genomic sizes and genomic stability, to see if this influences the nature or frequency of inaccurate DSB repair.  The I-SceI sites are also integrated at various different chromosomal locations in different plants, so one can investigate chromosome position effects on repair outcomes.  Finally, the investigators will determine the nature of inaccurate DSB repair at different times in development, under different environmental stresses (e.g., high UV light intensity or high ozone levels) and in genetic backgrounds that have known mutations in DNA repair processes or chromatin structure.  Taken together, these studies will provide insights into how plant genomes evolve, and particularly how DSB repair participates in this process, to generate the natural diversity on which natural selection acts. This research will provide a powerful approach, and numerous novel insights, for understanding how genomes change.  This will lead to a better understanding of how genetic diversity can be interpreted and influenced by biologists.  The many direct participants in the project, especially the postdoctoral fellow, graduate student and undergraduate students, will receive direct training in a multi-disciplinary approach to a core question in modern genetics:  how do genomes change, and what effect does that change have on current and future function of genes in that genome.  The description of the project and of the results will be available at a web site that will be created for this project, with a presentation style that makes the information digestible for all levels of interested parties, from K-12 students, to the general public, to active research scientists.  Raw data and the most advanced results will also be provided in public-accessible databases (e.g., GenBank for sequence information and peer-reviewed publications for detailed analysis), including the project web site.    Biological materials (seeds of transgenic plants, constructs for the I-SceI approach, etc.) will be available from the PI's lab until the time that some more permanent maintenance resource can be identified.   Understanding DNA variation, particularly the mechanisms and rates/outcomes, is vital for any mature understanding of genetics or genomes, and is shared by animal, human, plant, fungal, viral and microbial researchers, so it is expected that the training, outreach and data enrichment components of this project will benefit the broadest scientific community and general public."

The  witchweeds , members of the genus Striga, are particularly devastating since their primary hosts include the major cereals (maize, sorghum, rice and millet) and grain legumes that are dietary staples worldwide. How parasitic weeds and Striga species in particular recognize their potential hosts and overcome the innate defense systems are not known. Using the interaction of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), an important food and forage legume, with Striga gesnerioides, this project seeks to identify parasite-derived effectors and virulence proteins that enter host cells, specifically altering their structure and function and suppressing the defense response mechanism at various levels, enabling infection and parasite ingress to occur. Novel, in planta functional screens will be used to identify candidate effectors from Striga that are directly or indirectly recognized by race-specific resistance proteins in cowpea leading to activation of a hypersensitive response at the point of infection and associated downstream defense responses. These functional screens are complemented by comparative transcriptome sequencing in compatible and incompatible host-parasite association and in silico analysis aimed at identifying candidate virulence effectors through race-specific gene expression signatures. The outcomes of this project will provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which parasitic angiosperms identify and parasitize their hosts and how hosts block such attack. The negative impact of parasitic plants on crop productivity increases globally each year and their potential for affecting domestic agriculture looms larger as the movement of seed resources expands globally. The outcomes of this work will contribute directly to the development of strategies to improve crop security by providing targets for manipulating pest resistance responses of crop plants. In addition these studies provide new educational, research, and training opportunities for US students on the African continent."

Kowalewski, Yanxi Wang will conduct an archaeological survey in the Middle Guan River valley in Nanyang, China. This study will map, describe, collect and date artifacts from the earliest human occupation, at least 8000 years ago, up to historic time. The ground surface of the Guan River valley is stable and free of vegetation in the winter months, which allows the project to find and date most of the ancient cities, towns, villages, and temporary camps occupied during its long history. The goal is to reconstruct the settlement and population history. Ms. Wang wishes to understand how China''s agricultural system and rural and urban life developed. This is relevant for understanding the origins and later development of agriculture, urbanization, and land-use and landscape history in the regionThe study area is situated at the geographical transition of millet-growing North China and rice-growing South China. The Middle Guan River valley has received little archaeological attention, considering its rich cultural heritage and its geopolitically strategic location in the development of Chinese history. In contrast to some of the archaeologically better-known parts of China, with loess plains and broad river valleys, the Guan River and its nearby upland hills has a more diverse natural environment, which probably played an important role especially in the early development of the Neolithic way of life - the first villages and the development of an economy based on domesticated plants and animals. The project will use full-coverage pedestrian survey as the major data collection method to achieve the research goal. Regional survey, which is much less costly and more protective of cultural heritage compared to excavation, will help record archaeological sites and environmental conditions, and produce collections of ceramics, stone tools, and other artifact types. This information will be used to create settlement pattern maps by time period. Combined with documentation of historic and modern population, agriculture, and other land-use practices, the survey will provide data measuring prehistoric population size, and assess the temporal changes in the relationship between community, environment, and agricultural economy. The survey will provide information at the appropriate long-term and broad spatial scale necessary to address how human societies responded to the impacts generated by agriculture and maintained agricultural systems from incipient to more intensive and developed stages. Results will be published as a report in Chinese and English, and then a more detailed report in the form of doctoral dissertation. The project will provide valuable but unfamiliar Chinese archaeological data to Western audiences. It will bridge the gap between the research methods and theories in Chinese archaeology and North American archaeology and enhance communication between research institutions. More importantly, it will also help the Chinese and English public learn about the diversity and complexity of ancient China and the past of human society."

Develop maize germplasm with desirable agronomic traits and reduced aflatoxinaccumulation and increased resistance to ear-feeding insects for use in the Coastal Plain region.Approach: In comparison with molecular (gene to trait, or top-down) approach, a trait to gene (bottom-up) approach will be taken for this project. Diverse (exotic and temperate) germplasm will be screened under field conditions for resistance to aflatoxin and insect pests (i.e., corn earworm, fall armyworm, maize weevil, and stink bugs). Field-proven germplasm entries will be further evaluated for key unique phenotypic traits in relation to resistance mechanisms and underlying genetics using both conventional and molecular techniques. Following rigorous field and laboratory screenings, selected germplasm will be further examined for biochemical and physiological bases that confer resistance to multiple insect pests and aflatoxin. Insect resistance mechanisms in the selected corn and pearl millet germplasm will be categorized and the biochemical and physiological processes that confer certain insect resistance will be identified. Segregating populations with resistance to aflatoxin contamination and multiple insect damage will be developed. These new populations will serve as the sources of favorable alleles for ultimately developing aflatoxin- and insect-resistant corn inbred lines with elite agronomic traits, which will improve corn production under biotic and abiotic stresses in our region."

Although annual warm-season grasses require production cost from annual planting, crops such as sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), sweet millet (Pennisetum glaucum), photoperiod sensitive sweet sorghum, and low lignin type summer annuals may retain different aspects of advantage recognizable from perennial type grasses for biomass production. Sorghum and pearl millet species are productive over a wide expanse of the US with considerable differences in growing conditions. This creates a broad range of management options such that optimum planting date, harvest maturity, selection of cultivars, and development of cropping systems, etc. Several interrelated studies are proposed in this proposal to assess management options targeting sustainable biomass production for emerging biofuel industry and also alternatively for livestock operations. Development of nutrient management enhancing biomass production which sustains soil nutrient pools would provide a long term benefit. The high demand on feedstock in the future will require strategies for maintaining soil nutrients to provide consistent biofuel feedstock production. Diversity of feedstock production, especially cultivating crops not sharing a growing season, may expand annual biofuel feedstock availability. As an emerging oil seed producing crop in the US, canola cultivation may become a valuable winter crop component in a double cropping system along with warm-season annual grasses. Although major canola cultivation has been limited to Canada and the northern U.S.A., field trials in Florida and Alabama have indicated greater yield potential because of the longer growing season. In every year since 2007, warm season annual grass cultivations have experienced a certain degree of lodging in LA when a severe weather event occurs particularly during the hurricane season. Probably, lodging will be one of the major problems degrading economic gains from sweet sorghum cultivation, which has not been only seen in LA but also appeared in research from other inland states. Sorghums lodged by heavy rain and strong wind are often under stress from dehydration due to broken stems and exposed roots in the aftermath of severe weather. In winter, warm-season perennial grass harvest can be often delayed because of continuous rain and wet soil conditions. Delayed harvest could result in substantial loss of biomass through broken stems, losing tillers and leaves, and eventually affect the recovery of the biomass and quality. It would be advantageous to assess potential yield and quality loss from various field conditions."

There is little Federal and no foundation or industry research funds available for proso millet and the UNL&#39;s Panhandle Research and Extension Center is the only proso millet breeding center in the country. Proso millet production in the region is solely dependent on six varieties with narrow genetic base, which imposes high production risk. Overall goal of this project is to develop regionally adapted high yielding proso millet varieties through plant breeding and genetic research. Conventional breeding method will be followed for developing varieties. Proso millet germplasm will be characterized for important agronomic traits. Modern genetic tools (DNA markers, genetic map, etc.) will be developed following standard molecular methods. Successful completion of this project will result in development of improved varieties, germplasm, large number of DNA markers, genetic linkage map and DNA markers linked to important traits for future molecular breeding. New improved proso millet varieties will make proso millet industry in Nebraska more resilient. The genomic resources developed during this project will potentially make proso millet breeding method more efficient for developing varieties.

Brutnell (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center)This project will use genetic and genomic approaches to develop  a genome to systems-level understanding of plant-environmental interactions  by exploring how regulated translation contributes to the differentiation of the dimorphic chloroplasts in C4 plants and to maintaining photosynthetic homeostasis under shifting light conditions that compromise photosynthetic efficiency. The focus on maize, a C4 crop plant, is especially pertinent, as C4 photosynthesis likely evolved to reduce photorespiration, resulting in plants that use nitrogen and water more efficiently. Thus a deeper understanding of the regulatory networks driving C4 differentiation will aid in the enhancement of native C4 plants and in engineering C4 traits into C3 crops. With regard to outreach and training, the project will offer educational opportunities for high school, undergraduate and postgraduate students.  A laboratory course for University of Oregon undergraduates will be integrated with the large-scale identification of mutations underlying defects in chloroplast biogenesis. A program in St. Louis will engage secondary school students in hands-on analysis of photosynthetic mutants in foxtail millet. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students will gain mentored research experience involving cutting-edge genetic, genomic, and molecular approaches.  Finally, the project will develop tools and resources for the broader plant genomics research community that include (1) ~6000 new sequence-indexed Mu insertions which can be accessed via MaizeGDB and an in-house search interface (http://teosinte.uoregon.edu/mu-illumina/); (2) a gene identification service for putative Mu-tagged alleles; (3) functional annotations and associated mutant stocks for ~100 maize genes that are essential for photosynthesis; (4) improved genome annotations to be made available through community browsers; and (5) large-scale translatome and transcriptome datasets for the elucidation of coexpression modules and associated functional inferences. Chloroplasts are subcellular organelles in plants that house the machinery for photosynthesis and numerous other essential metabolic processes. Chloroplasts acquire different forms and functions in different cell types, as exemplified by the dimorphic chloroplasts in the bundle sheath and mesophyll cells of C4 plants.  They are dynamic organelles that adapt rapidly to changes in the external environment in a manner that optimizes photosynthetic performance while minimizing photo-oxidative damage. This project will elucidate the biogenesis, differentiation, and environmental adaptation of chloroplasts by employing state-of-the-art methods and an extensive collection of non-photosynthetic mutants. Maize is chosen as the experimental organism because it is a C4 plant with dimorphic chloroplasts, it offers a rich collection of chloroplast biogenesis mutants, and the maize leaf blade is an excellent experimental system for describing the developmental progression through which meristematic cells differentiate into photosynthetically-competent leaf cells.  The specific objectives of the project are to (1) use a large-scale forward genetic strategy to assign molecular and physiological functions to ~100 genes in maize that are required for photosynthesis; (2) use a state-of-the-art ribosome profiling strategy to define the translatome dynamics underlying the installation of the photosynthetic apparatus and the distinct proteomes in bundle sheath and mesophyll cells; (3) provide a comprehensive description of the progression of mitochondrial and plastid gene expression during the differentiation of photosynthetic leaf tissue; and (4) discover how regulated translation in the cytosol and chloroplast contribute to maintaining photosynthetic homeostasis under shifting light conditions."

They play important roles in grain yield and biomass accumulation, and understanding the genetic signals that regulate the number, size and fertility of tillers is of critical importance for optimizing yield potential in the world's major food, animal feed and biofuel grass crops. In addition, the initiation of tillers is important for perenniality in many grasses, and as such, full knowledge of the tillering pathway will contribute to the development of perennial biofuel and grain crops. The panicoid grasses are immensely important for all of these uses, and the full suite of genes that comprise the tillering pathway and the components that have been selected during domestication are largely unknown.  This project exploits evolutionary variation and changes during domestication in three panicoid cereals (maize, sorghum and foxtail millet) and their wild, highly tillered ancestors to uncover the genetic regulation and evolutionary modification of tillering.  Forward and reverse genetic approaches and transcriptomic analysis in both ancestral and domesticated backgrounds will provide insight into the gene networks necessary for growth and development of tillers in panicoid grasses. It is anticipated that the results from this comparative project will extend to and inform experiments across a wide range of agronomically important taxa.In addition to training postdoctoral associates and graduate and undergraduate students, this project aims to immerse high school science teachers from rural schools and from areas serving high proportions of underrepresented student populations in a research environment that will be combined with professional development activities. This immersion experience will help educators gain an explicit view of how scientific knowledge is generated and will assist with their own curriculum development.  They will implement this new content knowledge and pedagogical skills into their existing curriculum, mentoring students and preservice teachers in student research projects, and coaching students in science fair competitions.  Scientific findings and educational outreach experiences will be shared at science and education conferences and through publication in scientific and practitioner journals.

Such policies have historically had to contend on the one hand with anxieties about declining crop yields and population growth, and on the other hand with concerns about a reliance on plant biotechnology and rainfed grains impacts ecology and biodiversity. The research will be situated in the Himalayan foothills and on millet production. This is an ideal area for investigating such issues, given the enormous size of the population served by this agricultural sector, the government's 20-year engagement with economic liberalization practices, and the recent implementation of a national food security strategy designed to address the problems of expanding population growth and stifled grain yields through the intensification of high yield millet production. The researcher will analyze the symbolic, cultural, and political economic dimensions of competing projects for food security/sovereignty, biodiversity, and development and how they impact and utilize local knowledge systems. Her findings will contribute an ethnographic, case-based understanding to regional, national, and transnational debates about food, agriculture, and rural livelihoods.The project will involve ethnographic fieldwork across local, national, and transnational settings.  To gather data on the agroecological labor and livelihoods of farmers, the researcher will spend 9 months in two villages of differing altitude in Uttarakhand, north India where she will use participatory methods and conduct participant observation and interviews. To understand how rainfed grains and farmers are implicated in concerns about food security/sovereignty, biodiversity, and plant biotechnology, the researcher will conduct interviews, archival research, and participant observation for 4 months at key research, governing, corporate, and NGO sites in India and Switzerland. She will also analyze news articles, publications, and media sources, and attend conferences and events concerning food, agriculture, hill ecologies, and women in development.

Continue our work to identify compounds that promote or inhibit Fe bioavailability in staple food crops.   2.  Evaluate a surgical duodenal loop model in poultry as a tool to measure bioavailability of health promoting phytochemicals.   2.A. Determine if absorption of selected phytochemicals can be measured in the poultry duodenal loop model.  2.B. Define bioavailability of specific phytochemicals from select foods using the validated duodenal loop model.  Approach: This project has two major objectives.  The first is to develop lines of staple food crops with improved bioavailability and content of iron (Fe).  To do so we will employ our established screening tools of an iron bioavailability bioassay and an animal model.  In conjunction with these tools, we will make use of mass spectroscopy and marker assisted molecular breeding techniques.  With these approaches, we will be able to identify and utilize regions of the plant genome that harbor genes associated with the enhanced food crop nutritional quality for Fe. To further complement the above approaches, we will continue our work on the identification of agricultural and food processing practices that enhance the bioavailability and content of Fe and Zn in staple food crops.   The second major objective of this project is to develop a method to measure and evaluate the bioavailability of functional phytochemicals from plant foods.  To do so, we will assess the use of a surgical model utilizing the unique intestinal anatomy of the broiler chicken to measure absorption of compounds from the duodenal segment of the intestine.  This approach uses an established surgical preparation involving anesthetized animals.  Our initial efforts with this model will focus on compounds that are common to many staple food crops, fruits and vegetables.  These phytochemicals will include the flavonoids epicatechin, quercitin, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and kaempferol. Enhancing our knowledge of bioavailability of health promoting phytochemicals will significantly improve efforts to develop more nutritious plant foods."

C4 photosynthesis has evolved independently in at least sixty different plant lineages including over 20 times in the economically important grass family, Poaceae.  Transitions from C3 to C4 are particularly common within the grass tribe Paniceae, which contains the crop plants pearl millet and foxtail millet, and the potential biofuel source, switchgrass.  This research will use a variety of complementary approaches to better understand the systematics of Paniceae grasses and the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. One doctoral student will be trained in diverse phylogenetic, molecular and computational modeling skills, and high school students from diverse backgrounds will learn about photosynthesis at a one-day workshop at the University of Missouri. A better understanding of C4 photosynthesis could eventually lead to the development of higher yielding crops. The multiple independent derivations of C4 photosynthesis has resulted in a diverse group of photosynthetic subtypes, many of which are poorly understood.  Paniceae is an ideal system for remedying this deficit because there are multiple origins of C4 phenotypes among its species.  Using a novel integration of comparative phylogenomics, metabolic network modeling, and cell-type-specific gene expression data, this research will lead to a better understanding of the relationships among Paniceae grasses, and the evolution and function of C4 photosynthesis.  Specific key questions that will be addressed include: Is C4 photosynthesis an example of convergent evolution on genomic and metabolomic levels or only phenotypically convergent? Have the three C4 photosynthesis biochemical sub-types evolved from one another or has each originated independently? To what extent do two or more C4 photosynthesis biochemical sub-types operate together within a single organism, and what are the evolutionary implications of sub-type mixing? A better understanding of C4 photosynthesis will facilitate future research on crop improvements that could lead to less waste and fewer environmental impacts, and increased profitability of agricultural and bioenergy systems. In addition to providing new insights into the evolution of C4 photosynthesis this research also provides a foundation for further work on the evolution of other complex traits."

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) notes that, while maize has the largest acreage of all field crops in Africa, the average yield (1.6 t/hectare) is less than 1/3 of that achieved per unit area elsewhere in the world. The situation is further exacerbated by widespread dispersal of Striga seeds that intermix with maize kernels and ears going to market.  This EAGER project will test a potentially novel strategy for dealing with Striga infestation using a newly identified transposon-induced (non-transgenic) mutant of maize.  This plant carries a mutation in a gene that encodes a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 (ccd8) and has been shown to produce little to no precursors for strigolactone (SL), a maize hormone that is sensed by the Striga parasite and is required as a chemo-signal for host location and germination of its own seeds. The non-transgenic nature of this new maize mutant also enhances prospects for its acceptance and use by peoples with diverse cultures. This project will test the extent to which actual interactions between maize and Striga are affected by the partially-understood roles of strigolactone in plant biology. The specific objectives are to: 1) determine the degree of resistance to Striga seed germination and host attraction offered by the ccd8 mutation, and 2) test the concept that a relatively modest yield penalty in ccd8 maize can be countered without losing Striga resistance, by breeding strategies based on hybrid vigor and naturally-occurring genetic modifiers.  If successful, this EAGER project will provide for a new strategy that could counter Striga-based yield losses that extend from 15% to 100%, thereby making maize production sustainable in Striga infested regions."

Most plant virology research thus far has concentrated on avirulent (incompatible) interactions using dicot host:virus systems. We have observed that a compatible host:virus interaction of Panicum mosaic virus (PMV) in Brachypodium during the early stages of infection results in outcomes that are in contrast with those in avirulent and known virulent interactions of dicots--in particular, the suppression of ROS levels/signaling. Because ROS is crucial for plant basal and acquired immunity, its suppression by PMV could enable systemic infection. We recently determined the gross alterations in the transcriptome and the metabolome of Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium, a C3 grass) infected with Panicum mosaic virus (PMV). Of particular interest is our finding that the levels of key defense hormones and expression of several transcription factors and stress signal transduction components are modulated during the progression of disease. From these data, we have established the research aims: 1) Characterize how modulation of ROS homeostasis promotes PMV virulence; 2) Identify PMV-encoded effectors that target ROS defenses; and, 3) Determine if diverse grass-infecting viruses suppress ROS defenses in C3 and C4 grasses. Extending the findings of our studies with PMV to other economically important virus infections is a logical extension of our long-term interest in deciphering the basis of systemic (virulent, compatible) disease in grasses. The outcomes of this research will advance our fundamental knowledge of grass antiviral defense mechanisms and reveal strategies used by viruses to cause disease. Such knowledge will enable designing field resistance strategies to mitigate crop losses caused by viruses and associated stresses in millets, cereals, and bioenergy grasses."

One group of important but under-investigated pathogens specifically infects floral tissues (non-pathogenic on leaves or stems) (Ngugi &amp; Scherm, 2006). Some of them can mimic pollen tubes to invade and grow inside floral tissues (Ngugi &amp; Scherm, 2004). Because it is too late for disease control when symptoms become visible, crop diseases caused by floral pathogens such as wheat head blight, rice false smut, and ergots often result in significant yield losses and mycotoxin contaminations. Fusarium graminearum is the causal agent of wheat head blight or scab, which is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat in the US. On adult plants, this pathogen specifically infects flowering wheat heads and produces a trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which is an important virulence factor (Proctor et al., 2002). The expression of TRI genes responsible for DON biosynthesis, including the TRI5 trichodiene synthase gene was detectable at early infection stages and infection cushions, which is likely trigged by plant factors. Earlier studies have indicated that certain compounds in floral tissues could stimulate fungal growth and virulence (Ngugi &amp; Scherm, 2006). Floral pathogens must be able to recognize these compounds as signals for the expression of infection-related genes. To date, no such factors that predispose floral tissues to fungal infection have been identified and confirmed by molecular studies. The proposed study aims to take advantages of recent advances in analytical technologies and molecular biology studies to identify wheat compounds in anthers that stimulate virulence in F. graminearum and fungal genes involved in the recognition and responses to these compounds. Identification of the compounds in wheat anthers that stimulate virulence and DON production will have a broader impact because F. graminearum also infects other small grains, such as barley and millets. Results from proposed experiments will provide much needed information for understanding the recognition of floral tissues by pathogens. Characterizing their biosynthesis pathoways in plants and molecular mechanisms involved in its recognition by F. graminearum can be developed in to future fundable research projects. In addition, reducing or disrupting its biosynthesis in wheat anthers can be developed as a novel disease control strategy, which is a likely practical application out of this study."

In Louisiana, the cattle industry had a value of $663 million in 2013, up 18% over 2012 (LSU AgCenter, 2014). Cattle and calves rank second only to poultry which is the largest animal industry in the state. Cow-calf producers in the United States typically market calves at weaning; most of these calves are born during the late-winter and or spring and consequently weaned in the fall. In general, producers have small numbers of cows (less than 100) and 90% of the calves weigh below 230 kg at weaning, leaving them with very little marketing opportunities for those calves. Only some producers have enough calves to market in a truck load (21,800 kg). Marketing alliances between small and medium size producers have had some success. For several weather-related reasons (drought, excessive cold/snowfall) in different areas of the country, cattle prices have been at an all-time high in recent years and have made a fresh weaned calf a valuable commodity, although analysts indicate that these times are not going to last and the cattle cycle will go back to  normal  by 2016. Regardless of the actual conditions, large economic benefits exist for beef cow-calf producers to retain ownership after weaning by growing calves to a heavier sale weight prior to finishing. Over the past two decades more cattle producers have been retaining ownership of their calves through the stocker phase, and in some cases, through the finishing phase as well (McKinnon, 2001; Rathwell, 2000). In addition, an increased number of summer row crop farmers are grazing stockers on winter cover crops, which include annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) and small grains. Each year, several million calves graze cool-season pastures in the Southeastern United States to add valuable weight as stocker calves. Utilization of cool-season annual forages is one of the primary venues for growing these calves in this region of the country.In Louisiana there is the chance to grow abundant forage resources. Warm season perennial grasses primarily bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) and bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) sometimes associated with dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum) are the  core  of perennial forages. Annual (sorghum-sudan hybrids [Sorghum sp.], pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum]) summer grasses can complement these resources. In winter, cool season annual grasses (rye [Secale cereale], annual ryegrass) or legumes especially Trifolium sp such as ball (T. nigrescens L.), crimson (T. incarnatum), berseem (T. alexandrium), and white (T. repens) clover among others can be successfully planted. Even though these many species can fit into the different ecoregions of the SE, they are the warm season perennial grasses that have been traditionally the forage base for beef cattle systems. Around them and depending on production objectives there are more (or less) intensive systems. The intensive use of greater nutritive value pastures are usually pursued with classes of cattle that demand them such as stockers (steers and heifers) and forage-fed finishing programs. In spring-calving systems having cool season pastures is a major advantage providing nutritive value to the diet of highly demanding cows around parturition and through the first few months of lactation when nutrient demands are at their peak (NRC, 2000). The use of mixed swards (grasses and legumes) is an attractive alternative for producers because: 1) ruminants show preference for a rich (more than one component) diet (Scaglia and Boland, 2014a), and 2) legumes can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, hence reducing the need for fertilizer.All these pastures, however, do not provide adequate year round supply of feed or an adequate nutritive composition. There are a few alternatives to extend the grazing season and try to reduce hay feeding periods, also called  transition periods  or  gap periods . These periods (usually May-June and October-December) of the year with these limitations are usually complemented with stockpiled or conserved forages, which, depending on the nutrient requirements of the animal, may or may not need to be supplemented. Forage brassica crops such as turnip, swede, rape, and kale can be spring seeded to supplement pastures in August and September or summer seeded to extend the grazing season in November and December. Due to the increase use of cover crops in the Northeast, Midwest and upper Midwest of the US, producers in the SE became familiar with other forage alternatives that can be used for grazing. Forage brassica crops such as turnip, swede, rape, and kale are annual crops that are highly productive and digestible and can be grazed 80 to 150 days after seeding, depending on the species. In addition, crude protein levels are high, varying from 15 to 25 percent in the herbage and 8 to 15 percent in the roots, depending on the level of nitrogen fertilization and weather conditions. Despite these advantages these forages require appropriate management not only for their own productivity but also for the grazing animals. Brassica crops can cause health disorders in grazing animals if not managed properly. The main disorders are bloat, atypical pneumonia, nitrate poisoning, hemolytic anemia (mainly with kale), hypothyroidism, and polioencephalomalacia (Hall and Jung, 2008).All around the US and Louisiana is no exception, there is a trend showing that consumers demand for  organic  or  natural  foods is increasing sharply. In recent years (up to 2012), there was annual growth in sales of 24 and 39% for natural and organic meats, respectively. Grass-fed beef is within these niche markets and its relevance has been noted by the USDA. In September 2013, The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#39;s (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) announced a new Market News report that covers grass fed beef (USDA-AMS, 2013). Furthermore, on April 2014 the USDA Grass Fed Program for Small and Very Small (SVS) Producers was presented as a verification tool for SVS producers to certify that animals meet the requirements of the AMS Grass (Forage) Fed Marketing Claim Standard. For this program, USDA is targeting producers that market 49 cattle or less each year (USDA-AMS, 2014). Adding to this trend, consumers are more inclined to support locally produced products, commercialized in farmers markets, favoring localized economies which by end result will strengthen the community&#39;s economy. From 1994 to 2013, the national count of farmer markets directory listings (which is voluntary and self-reported) increased from 1,775 to 8,144 with a 3.6% increase from 2012 (7864) to 2013. In Louisiana there are more than 120 farmer markets (LDAF, 2013).The present proposal plans to contribute to an already developing stocker and forage-fed beef industry in Louisiana and to improve the efficiency of utilization of the forage resources available in the Gulf Coast region."

The grain has high nutritional value, can grow in arid environments and thus is important to the livelihood of smallholder farmers.  A major agricultural goal in the region is to develop higher yielding varieties of finger millet through reducing or eliminating diseases that impact growth of the plant.  Blast fungus is a pathogen that reduces yield up to 80% and is one of the main diseases affecting finger millet. To understand how to control disease outbreaks, this project uses genomic sequencing as a powerful approach to identify precise strains of the fungus and to study how the fungus causes disease symptoms in the plant. Sequence analyses of blast strains collected in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia will provide information on the genetic diversity of the pathogen in Eastern Africa, and provide a resource to identify the factors that are responsible for infection of finger millet. The knowledge from this approach is essential to develop efficient disease management strategies. Furthermore, sequence analyses of the finger millet host will clarify why some cultivars are more resistant to blast than others. The generated resources will also be used as a vehicle to train undergraduate and graduate students in Eastern Africa in bioinformatics, an expertise that is essential to translate the information to improve breeding strategies.  The specific aims of the project are to (1) Generate 80X PacBio sequence for the allotetraploid finger millet genome (1C=1.8 Gb) to generate a high quality genome assembly (1C=1.8 Gb); (2) Resequence 200 Eastern African isolates of the finger millet blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, including 24 that were collected 10 years ago, to determine the diversity and evolution of this finger millet pathogen both over time and across geographic regions. The blast genome sequences will be mined to identify candidate effector genes using an effector prediction pipeline that incorporates common characteristics of known effectors (secretion and high polymorphism levels;(3) Analyze the blast-finger millet interaction transcriptome using RNA-Seq to identify genes that are induced at early stages of infection. Genes encoding secreted proteins will be identified from the RNA-Seq experiment and cross-referenced to those identified using the effector prediction pipeline. Host genes that are differentially expressed will be compared between compatible and incompatible interactions, and with genes that are differentially expressed during early stages of blast infection in rice, and(4) Develop a nested association mapping panel of some 4000 RILs derived from 21 diverse parents using a double round robin design. This population will represent the first mapping resource that captures substantial diversity present in finger millet germplasm and has a high quantitative trait loci detection power."

These investigations will test the hypothesis that some aspects of AZ development are shared among the three species but that many aspects differ because the AZ forms in a different position in each. The investigation will then be expanded to many other grasses, some of which are similar to millet, rice and Brachypodium, and some of which show distinct patterns of seed shedding. The results will define the extent of parallel and convergent evolution in an ecologically and economically critical pathway."

US government in the last two years has increased research funding to small grains like sorghum and millet, and an evidence is the establishment of a  Feed the future Innovation lab  at Kansas State University, dedicated specifically to research the genetic diversity, value-addition and economic aspect of grain sorghum and millet. Millet production actually doubled between 2012 and 2013 in the US. The interest in using millet as ingredient in food and energy production is based on similarity of these grains to the common ones. Millet possesses characteristics similar to wheat and corn, two important cereals in the US. Millet therefore has the potentials to replace these other cereals in several human food applications and for energy production. Millet is particularly suitable because it is drought resistant, it is less susceptible (8 fold less) to aflatoxin incident than corn, it has comparable nutrient profile as wheat and corn. Some millet varieties have higher protein content than wheat and corn. A major advantage of millet versus grain sorghum is low level of antinutritional factor in millet. Also, about 3 million Americans are gluten intolerant, and millet is gluten free therefore it is an excellent ingredient for production of foods for this category of people where specialty food market attracts sales in billions dollars yearly, and it continues to increase. However, the understanding of millet important constituents, protein, starch and fiber functionality are very important in determining their effectiveness in various food and fuel applications. The need for research at this stage to evaluate the functionality of this grain&#39;s constituents and extensively test the quality attributes of the products produced from them, cannot be greater. There is significant opportunity for farmers in Kentucky to tap into the potential for profit available in the production of millet, considering the projected increase in demand for millet in the US, especially for production of gluten free foods and sport nutrition industry. Our goal in this project is to study the functionality of the important macronutrients available in proso millet cultivars, produce and study the quality characteristics of extruded products made from millet."

Cyst and root-knot nematodes are among the most damaging of these parasites, and reduce crop yield and quality both directly and indirectly. Direct losses result from delayed and uneven crop growth, resulting in lower yields and lower quality characteristics, while in-direct losses involve increased crop damage due to the nematode and other soil pathogens working together to kill plants. Farmers often apply soil fumigants, insecticide-nematicides or other products, here called,  Nematode Management Agents  or  NMAs , to prevent this damage. Whilemany of these NMAs are very effective, they are also often expensive and highly toxic, posing health risks to those who apply them, as well as risks to the environment. This project involves research and extension activities to identify and communicate new crop production practices and products that will enable farmers to more effectively manage the plant-parasitic nematode populations in their fields, while at the same time lower potential risks to human health and increase environmental and economic sustainability. The primary focus of the research projects will be to identify crop varieties possessing resistance to cyst and root-knot nematodes, enabling growers to often eliminate or significantly reduce their use of NMAs. In some cases, how this resistance operates is unknown, and the questions involved need to be answered for farmers to use this resistance effectively. Graduate student greenhouse and laboratory research willbe conducted to clarify resistance mechanisms so that plant breeders can integrate these genetic traits more effectively, and growers will be able to focus their use more appropriately. Additional research will be conducted to compare potential new NMAs to standard products and practices, with special emphasis on finding and evaluating products that involve less risk of potential harm. Annual field experiments will compare the effects of a biofumigant, a new and safer nematicide, and potential biocontrol products to those resulting from application of a traditional soil fumigant. Several cover crop species (sunnhemp, pearl millet, and Brassica juncea, for example) will also be evaluated for their impact on plant-parasitic nematode populations and crop growth, yield and value. Combinations of nematode-resistant cover crops and cultivars should enable farmers to significantly reduce their need to apply NMAs, and the availability of effective but more environmentally sustainable NMAs should further reduce potential risks to agricultural workers and to the environment, while simultaneously improving crop productivity and profitability."

These technologies will contribute to enhanced labor productivity and increased land productivity, thus sustainably reducing poverty among smallholders. The overall objective ofthis project is to intensify smallholder farmers&#39; cropping systems and on-farm operations through mechanization in a sustainable manner. Sustainable intensification will integrate social,economic and environmental impacts with a specific focus on easing the burden on women. The ASMC includes members with substantial institutional capacity and expertise, and active collaborations with institutions and entry point organizations in four designated countries in South Asia, East Africa and West Africa: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso.The ASMC will utilize a three-tier approach that accounts for the required farming tasks, associated mechanization priorities and an operational strategy for achieving appropriate and scalable mechanization for crop and livestock production on smallholder farms. The operational strategy includes the following six key functions: 1) engage entry point organizations to establish Innovation Hubs, 2) assess country specific mechanization challenges, opportunities, and priorities, 3) implement country specific activities utilizing participatory research methods, 4) build human capacity with gender emphasis, 5) monitor and evaluate impact of activities, and 6) share knowledge with in-country stakeholders.To address the barriers to adoption, the ASMC will facilitate the creation of unique Appropriate- Scale Mechanization Innovation Hubs in each country that will identify specific needs, leverage ASMC resources to attract additional support and funding, and implement innovative solutionsto address current challenges and opportunities for mechanization. Innovation Hubs will create an ecosystem of innovation by engaging various stakeholders including smallholder farmers, faculty, students, and business professionals in identifying needs, seeking solutions and resources, promoting/adopting/scaling technology and business development. To ensuresustained and long-term impacts, the Innovation Hubs will focus on capacity building efforts that span mechanization-specific training/educational programs and curricula development to extension activities targeting smallholder farmers and especially women farmers.The work in South Asia will focus on rice and vegetable value chains and the development of technologies and tools that can be used especially by women to sustainably intensify land preparation and water management, transplanting, cultivation and weeding, crop harvesting, handling and on-farm processing. The work in Ethiopia and Burkina Faso will develop and refine sustainable mechanization practices with draft animals and small 2-WD tractors with an emphasis on zone tillage, seeding, weeding, and shelling technologies for maize that will be readily transferrable to other cropping systems, such as sorghum and millet production, as well as for use in other Feed the Future countries such as Tanzania and Senegal where two of SIIL&#39;s regional representatives are located. The scope of activities will include prototype testing and evaluation, train-the-trainer sessions for local extension and technical service providers, on-farm evaluation and artisan training for local manufacturing and marketing of technologies, tools and custom services. Special consideration will be given to designs suitable for up-scaling. Finally, the ASMC intends to make the Innovation Hubs self-sustaining so that they will succeed in facilitating the development, adoption and dissemination of technologies after the end of this project."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The host institution for the fellowship is Pennsylvania State University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Jesse Lasky. Agronomic weeds pose a serious threat to agricultural productivity, and weed infestations may intensify under changing climates. To better understand interactions between biotic and abiotic stressors, this project investigates mechanisms of specialization to different host crops and abiotic environments in purple witchweed (Striga hermonthica).  Parasitic witchweeds constitute the greatest biotic constraint to food production in sub-Saharan Africa and devastate yields of economically important cereals such as maize, sorghum, millet, and rice.  Broader impacts include generation of new genomic and phenotypic resources to enhance development of resistant crop varieties, training of undergraduate students, and workshops in witchweed bioinformatics targeted to African scientists.  Training objectives include statistical evolutionary genomics, ancient DNA sequencing, quantitative genetics, and experimental plant-parasite interactions.The main goal of this project is to better understand evolution of crop-parasite interactions across diverse abiotic environments. First, genomic signatures of host-specialization and local adaptation will be identified, using targeted exome sequencing of 200 herbarium specimens collected within the past 150 years from different hosts of origin across East and West Africa. Loci will be identified that exhibit statistical associations with environment and host of origin, with allelic variation that tracks change in regional host crop production over time. For the second aim, effects of abiotic stress on host range will be experimentally evaluated. Seed germination, early host-seeking behavior, and host resistance will be quantified under nitrogen- and water-limitation for 20 parasite populations across 60 genotypes of three agriculturally important host crops: sorghum, millet, and maize.  Genomic and phenotypic resources generated during the project will be publicly accessible through online databases (NCBI; Project Unity, http://phenome-networks.com) and a dedicated project website including instructional materials, code, and molecular protocols."

This method is based on advances in 'genome editing', a revolutionary technology that promises the ability to introduce genetic improvements or novel functionality to genomes where genetic resources are currently limited. Applications in plants that require replacing an endogenous piece of DNA with another DNA sequence are possible but are very inefficient due to very low rates of HR. The technology developed in this project is designed to overcome this bottleneck, with the aim to advance organismal biology by greatly facilitating the testing of gene function through direct modification of a broad range of genes of interest. Such advances will contribute to improvements in the understanding of the genomes-to-phenomes relationship. This could, for example, accelerate the development of plants with improved resistance to pathogens, or enhanced crop yields. The project will carry out experiments to further develop, test, validate and improve this technology and its application, first testing the components of the system, then applying what is learned to single and multiple targets. The work will test the system in cassava and foxtail millet, as well as in model flowering plants. Broader impacts of the project include the wide dissemination of the method for the improvement of crop plants and other species, plus the training of students via integration with long-running and successful undergraduate internship program. The project will focus specifically on techniques to facilitate and accelerate the identification of successful products of HR by reporter-based methods using transcriptional activation. The approach combines insertion of a repair template (containing the desired genome edit and a selectable marker) with methods to rapidly find a desirable, rare HR event - the proverbial  needle in a haystack . Data from cassava demonstrates that this is an effective method for developing molecular and genomic tools for orphan crops and those lacking robust genomic resources. The work will be done in cassava, Arabidopsis, and Setaria as the primary species for analysis, because a demonstration in these species would support broad utility in eudicot and monocot species, including most crops. The questions to be addressed by this project include: 1) whether the efficiency of HR can be improved by focusing on selection of the products; 2) whether HR-based approaches be used to successfully tag non-coding RNAs such as microRNA and tasiRNA precursors; and, 3) whether it is possible to develop efficient processes for high-throughput, library-based knock-ins. The project will develop an approach for a key functional genomic tool (improved selection of products of HR) to enable direct tests of hypotheses about gene function in diverse organisms. Project members will be trained broadly in plant biology and genomics, gene function and functional genomics, and computational methods. All resources generated in this project will be made available for use. Specifically, constructs will be deposited in nonprofit global plasmid repositories and web-based tools will be designed to enable users unfamiliar with genome editing to successfully design custom components of SureFire for application to their organism(s) of study.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project considers two of the ecologically hardiest of cereal crops: broomcorn (Panicum miliaceum) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica). Today, these two minor cereals are consumed less frequently, thereby attracting little scientific attention, however they were once among the most expansive food crops in geographical terms, with a center of origin in northern China and spreading to India and Europe in prehistory. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we seek answers to two questions: (1) when did millet first become a staple food for human consumption? and (2) when and how did millet cultivation expand from its place of origin in north China to Central and South Asia? The ecological merits of the two millets under investigation make them particularly important in the context of food security in modern systems in their capacity to grow in marginal areas. Understanding the history of these two drought hardy species can also raise awareness of their capacity for future utility.In order to test hypotheses about the consumption and spread of millet, Dr Liu and the research team will undertake three types of analyses: (1) bulk carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of archaeological animal bone collagen and plant materials; (2) compound specific carbon isotope analyses of archaeological human and animal bone collagen; and (3) direct radiocarbon measurements of archaeological millet grains from across Central and South Asia. These data are built on significant improvements in sample preparation and methodological refinements in the recent decade. In taking a multidisciplinary approach, this project provides insight into not only the two specific crops, but the communities who utilize them. Why were these crops chosen as primary targets of food production? Why are communities situated in a recurrent landscape (foothills / edges of the mountains) seemingly always interested in these plants? Why do people seemingly consume a lot of crops but not a lot of meat? Early discussions on East-West contacts have primarily focused on the inter-continental exchange of material goods. This project will however shift the focus to emphasize the role played by the primary agents of agricultural production, the ordinary farming communities themselves, who do not always own much material goods, but pioneered the globalization process in the ancient world.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
