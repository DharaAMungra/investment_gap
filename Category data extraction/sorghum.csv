We have recently cloned the major sorghum Al tolerance gene, AltSB, and found it is a novel solute transporter. The function of AltSB will be studied using a multifaceted approach including the effect of increased/decreased AltSB expression on the physiology of Al tolerance, association analysis correlating sequence and phenotypic variation of multiple AltSB alleles, and analysis of AltSB transporter properties when expressed in heterologous systems. 2) Maize represents a  plant species where Al tolerance is a complex, quantitative trait. We have identified a number of Al tolerance QTL in maize, and will work towards cloning these QTL via a combination of gene and protein expression analysis, high resolution mapping, and analysis of candidate tolerance genes based on homology to Al tolerance genes recently cloned in sorghum and wheat. 3) An investigation of the role of hyperexpression of a suite of micronutrient and heavy metal-related genes in heavy metal hyperaccumulation in Thlaspi caerulescens will involve investigation of cis and trans factors that control micronutrient (Zn) homeostasis in the related non-accumulator, Arabidopsis thaliana, and how these elements are altered in T. caerulescens to contribute to the enhanced metal accumulation and tolerance. 4) We have recently identified several genes that play important roles in the hyperaccumulation phenotype in T. caerulescens, including a heavy metal ATPase and a protein kinase, and the functioning of these genes in heavy metal hyperaccumulation, as well as in micronutrient nutrition will be studied."

The large number of genetic mutants, in combination with the ease of obtaining and mapping additional mutants, makes maize an excellent system for determining the function of genes. We propose to identify genes that regulate maize leaf development and shoot architecture. We will carry out mutagenesis with defined inbreds using the chemical mutagen EMS. Mutants will be characterized genetically and histologically. The genes will be mapped to position and cloned. The functions will be determined by expression analysis and further genetics. We already have two mutants at different stages of analysis. The dominant Liguleless narrow mutant has been mapped to position and beginning characterization is under way. The dominant Wavy auricle in blade1 (Wab1) mutant has been localized to a BAC contig. Once we clone Wab1, we will determine the function of the wild-type gene product.

Adapt, refine, develop, and implement soil water and crop simulation models to evaluate alternative agronomic and water management strategies, specifically for a semi-arid, advective environment for dryland and deficit irrigated lands.Approach:Tillage practices that retain residue on the soil surface typically improve water availability to crops by increasing infiltration and/or ameliorating micrometeorological factors that drive the evaporation process.  Because of limitations in sensor technology, past research studying water storage and use by crops has not elucidated the tillage induced changes in short-term processes that govern water infiltration, redistribution, and evaporation.  Knowledge of the relative importance of each of these processes during a growing season will facilitate refinement of models to simulate seasonal water balance and assist in assessing the merits of alternative management practices.  In addition, long-term studies used to quantify cumulative benefits of reduced tillage to increase crop yield, water use efficiency, and soil conservation for established wheat-sorghum-fallow crop rotations will be modified for comparisons of tillage benefits on annual sorghum-cotton crop rotations.  Therefore, several experiments focusing on different hydrological aspects and time scales will investigate management effects on soil water and availability to crops."

The in-house research program addresses issues related to soil and water management practices in cropping and integrated crop-livestock systems, and irrigation management and automation for increased water use efficiency (WUE). Knowledge of the processes affecting soil water content during a growing season will facilitate refinement of models to simulate water balance and assist in assessing the merits of alternative practices. Longer-term studies will be used to quantify effects of reduced tillage on crop yield, WUE, and soil physical characteristics for wheat-sorghum-fallow crop rotations and alternative cropping sequences.  Several experiments focusing on different hydrological aspects and time scales will investigate management effects on soil water and availability to crops utilizing watershed, remote sensing, and meteorological networks. Research approaches related to irrigation management include determinations of crop water use by weighing lysimeters, neutron scattering methods, etc. Experiments include variations in irrigation methods, irrigation amount, tillage, and/or crop and crop rotation. Automatic irrigation systems based on sensing of crop water status are being engineered and tested. Remote sensing approaches to water use prediction are expected to improve their utility in decision making by farm managers, irrigation projects or water districts, and policy makers.Support from cooperating university is evaluated annually. Work plans are developed for each project objective describing research to be conducted during  1- or 2-year period. Yearly workshops are held with stakeholders and cooperating scientists; these workshops are used to review progress, re-define or clarify research priorities, and inform stakeholders, project leaders and administrators. Annual and final reports are used to document progress of the research."

The core collection represents a random selection of the base collection.  The Sudan and Mali working collections are accessions that breeders have selected based on agronomic performance and yield potential.  Selected resistance sources will be screened over locations in different years to assess their horizontal disease resistance. 2) Two hundred fifty C. sublineolum single spore isolates collected over the past four years from various locations of the United States and Puerto Rico and are currently in long-term storage in the laboratory will be used.  Host plant evaluations in the greenhouse will be conducted to establish the pathotypes of C. sublineolum.  3) Two closely related pathotypes of P. sorghi, P1 and P3, will be used to identify the differentially expressed unique sequences using standard AFLP technology as well as SSH.  4) A total of six cultivars, B1, BTx7078 and SC170-6-17 (susceptible lines), BTx635 (resistant line), SC140 and SC64 (their reaction to head smut is unknown), will be included in this study.  Four inoculation methods--seed treatment, soil treatment, media placement, and syringe injection--will be employed.  Four Texas isolates collected from College Station, Corpus Christi, Weslaco, and Beeville will be evaluated, with three replications for all four inoculation methods and all six cultivars simultaneously.  In each replication, disease incidence (i.e., whether the inflorescence is replaced with sori or not) will be recorded."

This project was applied to two regions. The first was the region surrounding the Federal University of Viçosa (UFV) in the state of Minas Gerais (Brazil) as an approach to achieve energy independence and sustainable development in the region. The second region was in central Iowa. Two similar small-scale ethanol production systems were investigated using sugarcane feedstock in Brazil and sweet sorghum in Iowa. Economic and life-cycle models of the systems were developed as a means for evaluating the feasibility and potential success of different system configurations as well as for uncovering technical innovations required to develop small scale, low-input and reliable systems for bioenergy conversion. Specifically, the project had four objectives:    1.To innovatively design and build low-cost, small scale biomass combustion, fermentation and distillation systems for low-income agricultural producers. 2. To use systems-level economic and life-cycle models to analyze the effects of such technologies on regional sustainability factors such as land use, producer income, and carbon emissions. 3. To investigate the applicability of small-scale ethanol production technology to the developed world as well as the developing world. 4. Integration of P3 concepts as an educational tool through providing hands-on learning experiences in which students can learn how to make informed decisions and engineering judgments about the sustainability of biorenewable production systems. This project benefits people since local farmers, the majority of which are small, low-income agricultural producers, may be engaged as suppliers of ethanol. Prosperity is addressed because a local, renewable source of fuel benefits both the local community and the university through creation of jobs and reallocation of resources. Displacement of petroleum based sources of transportation fuel benefits the planet through reduction of CO2 emissions. The technology developed through this project will be demonstrated at both UFV and Iowa State University and be integrated into sustainable engineering and biorenewables course modules. The technology developed through the project is expected to promote regional development through job creation and increased utilization of locally produced agricultural commodities. Project evaluation will be based on the adoption of the technology developed."

A major aim will therefore be to enable students and post docs to take advantage of emerging genomics data in the cereals. Specific problems and unique challenges exist in cereal genomics. Many of the genomes (for example, maize, wheat, barley) are large and complex, and it is unlikely that we will have completely mapped and sequenced genomes for these species in the foreseeable future. The cereals also provide the primary source of nourishment to the world's human and domesticated animal populations. This workshop will provide young students and scientists with the tools and skills they need to exploit the emerging genome data in all cereal crops including complete genome sequences (rice, maize, sorghum) and extensive EST and genome survey sequence from wheat and other grasses.  The broader impacts of this workshop will be in exposing young students to the excitement of cereal genomics, as well as enabling more senior researchers to develop cutting edge research and curricular activities. It will also foster development of collaborations and cooperation among the participants."

Most plant genomes characterized to date are a complex collection of linear and circular interconverting molecules that display evidence of recombination, foreign DNA integration and changes in relative copy number.  These genomic activities are controlled by nuclear genes that can be manipulated in their expression to cause mitochondrial genome instability.  Using this approach in tomato, tobacco, millet, sorghum, soybean and Arabidopsis allows for cross-species comparison of mitochondrial genome disruption.  This project exploits this system to identify cellular and developmental pathways that are directly influenced by mitochondrial genome status, conserved across plant species, and evidenced by changes in plant phenotypes.  The central hypothesis of the project states that mitochondrial status in plants is integrated into discrete pathways for plastid development, pollen development, cell cycle control and particular plant stress responses.  The project provides unique entry to these pathway integration points by combining Arabidopsis mutant analysis and cross-species comparisons with mitochondrial and gene expression analysis.  While it has long been known that plant mitochondria play distinct roles in metabolism, growth and development, direct mitochondrial manipulations prior to this study were largely restricted to inhibitor studies with limited opportunity for extrapolation to whole plant phenotype.  Broader impacts of the study.  Plant mitochondrial genome rearrangement can lead to altered plant phenotypes of agricultural importance.  For example, these studies have already produced evidence of cytoplasmic male sterility, a trait useful in hybrid seed production and transgene containment, and of enhanced crop thermotolerance.  Both valuable traits are difficult to attain using conventional crop breeding approaches. With regard to training opportunities, the Center for Plant Science Innovation (PSI) at University of Nebraska sponsors an undergraduate summer internship program that integrates to the proposed project; through this program, four minority students have already been recruited into graduate programs in the past two years.  The PSI also directs the Nebraska Molecular Plant Breeding Graduate Program; this project sponsors at least two plant breeding students on the proposed project.  Currently, the US faces a critical shortage of plant breeders with cross-cutting expertise in field management of transgenic crops, DNA marker-based selection, statistics, and comparative genomics.  This project provides fertile ground for such training, in cooperation with plant breeders on campus and in industry.Project data will be accessible via http://psiweb.unl.edu/mackenzie/ and gene expression data released to ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/ae/)."

In prior BRAG-supported research we showed nearly all members of Johnsongrass populations near long-term sorghum production fields to contain alleles introgressed from sorghum. However, some regions of the genome never showed introgression. We will try to identify PCR-based DNA markers that are potentially diagnostic of introgression from cultivated sorghum into Johnson grass. This will provide a foundation for future exploration of the efficacy of using domestication QTLs and chromosomal rearrangements to suppress transgene flow."

Our project supports this overall effort by evaluating promising crops for Florida for both sugar and lignocellulosic (biomass) conversion to ethanol. Currently, corn grain from Midwestern states is the major source of ethanol in the U.S. However, since Florida is at a comparative disadvantage for corn production, it currently contributes little to U.S. ethanol production even though climatically it is favorably positioned to contribute to the national need for bioenergy crops and renewable fuels. Factors inhibiting ethanol production in Florida are numerous and include lack of agronomic and environmental information on crops and cropping systems throughout the state, lack of refining facilities, and economic uncertainty. This project will determine the potential for sustainable sugar and biomass production across a climatic gradient in Florida so that bioenergy crop production will be an alternative for farmers who currently have limited profitable land-use options. Over two growing seasons, we will evaluate replicated field plots of sweet sorghum, sugarcane, and elephantgrass at locations in North, Central and South Florida. At time of harvest, total green biomass weight and dry weight will be measured. For sorghum and sugarcane, several stalks will be pressed for juice and analyzed for sugar (`brix') by hand held refractive index monitor. Juice and plant tissue samples will be further analyzed for sugar composition, water insoluble fiber and nitrogen and phosphorus. This project will identify promising species/varieties for biofuel production and lead to improved knowledge of production practices for optimizing biomass and/or sugar production of potential bioenergy grasses in Florida. Expected outputs from the project include statewide presentations, extension publications and peer-reviewed scientific publications. These summary outputs are expected to reduce barriers between processing plants and producers to stimulate investment in biofuel production. Furthermore, these results will support informed decisions regarding the roles of sugarcane, sweet sorghum and elephantgrass as bioenergy species in the U.S. Gulf Coast Region."

For these biofuel feedstock species, there are variable amounts of genome sequence resources available, ranging from complete genome sequences (e.g. sorghum, poplar) to transcriptome data sets (e.g. switchgrass, pine). These data sets are not only dispersed in location but also disparate in content.

Since MRB was introduced from Mexico in 1980, it has spread northward through the Texas Rice Belt and now threatens the Louisiana sugarcane and rice industries. MRB and SCB have become the key pest complex of Texas Gulf coast rice, with insecticide use approaching three applications, annually. Sugarcane and rice generate over $2.5 billion annually for Texas and Louisiana stakeholders, but these commodities are at risk from this new pest complex and usage restrictions, mandated by FQPA, on organophosphate (OP) insecticides. Eventual annual losses of $220 million in sugarcane and $45 million in rice due to MRB invasion would be expected based on current production practices. We propose to solve the problems of our stakeholders by developing and implementing a diversified, proactive stalk borer IPM program which will be expected to mitigate sugarcane/rice potential FQPA-related constraints and reduce stalk borer populations. Within season management progress emphasizes cultivar resistance, minimizing plant stress, and timely use of insecticides. This proposal mandates more of a landscape approach to IPM focusing on selected non-crop hosts (at least during certain times of the year), and late season cultural practices combined with a more creative use of new environmentally-friendly insecticides to reduce area-wide pest populations. The significance to bioenergy, including corn and sorghum, is also noted. An integral component of the proposal is stakeholder input and direct involvement in the performance and evaluation of the research objectives."

Experiments have revealed that enhanced UVB light has adverse impacts on growth, yield, and quality of crops such as soybean, wheat, rice, sorghum, cotton, and corn. On-going experiments in growth chambers at Mississippi State University study the effects of enhanced UVB radiation and high temperature on cowpeas. The effects of UVB radiation and soil moisture on leaf litter decomposition were investigated through experiments in a greenhouse at CSU, and the results are currently being analyzed. Experiments were carried out to evaluate and quantify the effects of UV radiation on the early development of soybean. Two cotton growth simulation models were incorporated into a regional climate model in order to quantify the impact on cotton yields of enhanced UVB radiation combined with drought stress. These effects are being specified and quantified by our research group and incorporated into crop models. We are also working with other scientists to couple the crop models with a regional climate model as well as other models to develop an integrated assessment system to evaluate the risks of climate change and variation in the national agriculture and the international food security. A study of preliminary results of UVB trends across the continental US has recently been submitted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research. Other publications describe the algorithms to derive new products from our datasets and new methods to retrieve column ozone and other atmospheric variables from our measurements. Some of these publications describe the development of climatology products while others compare our datasets with satellite observations or various networks.

Many of these concepts need to be explored from a quantitative system perspective in order for us to measure the effectiveness of our system design effort.

We are proposing to use simple generic models of material transformation, transport and storage processes to represent the components of industrial systems and focus on how these processes are linked together to create an industrial ecology. An important component in the development of this approach is the creation of a database of  technology coefficients  and capital, operating, and energy cost functions that capture the non-linear behavior of capacity. Energy and monetary flows are explicitly identified; new processes can be easily introduced into the system network and their impact on overall system performance can be assessed. The information generated can easily be used for different types of economic, environmental and life cycle analyses. Each Sun Grant Regional Center will be generating a subset of the technology coefficients database, and capital, operating, and energy cost functions. The Western Regional Sun Grant Center at Oregon State University will focus their efforts on the production and pre-treatment processing of grass and cereal grain straws. The South-Central Regional Sun Grant Center at Oklahoma State University will be provide data on production, handling logistics, and conversion of the four feedstocks indentified in their Regional Feedstock Workshop of which sorghum and switchgrass were the top candidates. The Southeastern Regional Sun Grant Center at the University of Tennessee will collect data on the conversion of 750 acres of land from its current use to switchgrass biomass production. The data set will include production inputs and a detailed account of carbon. The North Central Regional Sun Grant Center at South Dakota State University will manage the overall project and focus its research efforts on the feedstock conversion subsystem and the impacts of the end use of biochar on the carbon status of biofuels and bioproducts. The Northeast Regional Sun Grant Center at Cornell University will develop the simulation framework and input/output modeling. They will also collect data for technology coefficients and energy/monetary cost functions associated with aqueous pretreatments."

Decreasing our dependence on petroleum imports by developing a renewable and sustainable, domestic biofuels industry will stimulate the economy, increase energy security, improve air quality, and decrease emissions of fossil CO2 and other greenhouse gases. The conversion of cellulosic feedstocks into ethanol has been recognized as an essential component of the overall biofuel strategy in the U.S. A key factor in meeting the U.S. government's  20 in 10  goals is the development of feedstock crops that can be grown at high biomass yield densities and at the same time exhibit superior characteristics for conversion to fuels and valuable chemicals. Another important factor for consideration of meeting these nearer term goals (like 20 in 10) is the availability of a cellulosic dedicated energy crop where cultivation, production, and harvesting practices have already been established. Sorghum fits these near-term needs because seed production, agronomic practices, harvesting and planting equipment, and other infrastructure have been developed for this crop by virtue of its use in both the forage and grain industries. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is an attractive dedicated energy crop because of its high productivity, drought tolerance, well established production systems, its genetic diversity, and the availability of a genetic system that greatly facilitates a breeding program. In addition the genetic structure and plant biology of sorghum allows for application of relatively simple genetic analysis compared to the genetic structure of other bioenergy crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus. Because the sorghum genome is relatively small and closely related to many of the other potential bioenergy species, the genomic analysis described herein should be applicable to other bioenergy crop, such as Saccharum, Miscanthus and Panicum species. The goal of the proposed program is to enhance our understanding of crop composition on bioenergy conversion, using sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) as a model dedicated energy crop. Understanding the composition of this crop and its effect on conversion efficiency is crucial to the development of alternative energy sources. This will be accomplished by the agronomic evaluation of different sorghum types in several different production environments; biomass samples from each sorghum type will be collected from each location for composition analysis and conversion using state of the art conversion technology. From this research, we expect to identify optimum sorghum genotypes for conversion."

To do so, we will use atomic force microscopy (AFM) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) to investigate differences in cellulose microfibril arrangements in cell walls of mechanically isolated mesophyll and vascular tissue cells in species within the agronomically important genus Eragrostis that exhibit varying levels of survival to dehydration. Eragrostis serves as an ideal model system for developing drought tolerant grains and grasses because individual species within this genus are either drought sensitive, moderately drought tolerant, very drought tolerant, or fully desiccation tolerant. We will build upon prior work in which the microfibril architecture in the  resurrection fern  Polypodium polypodioides was found to demonstrate a nanoscale deformation of the cell wall sufficient to allow it to survive 5% relative water content. We hypothesize that similar mechanisms may be present in the most dehydration tolerant species of Eragrostis. To test this hypothesis we will subject four species of Eragrostis to at least four levels of dehydration while examining nanoscale cellulose architecture and detecting dehydrin expression profiles. 2) Once this has been achieved we expect to see a change in actions. Since we expect to observe differing levels of tolerance to dehydration at several specific levels of hydration, we expect a change in the types of plants that are cultivated. These will be established based upon survival rates. This mode of investigation will inform further lines of inquiry into highly relevant C4 crops such as corn, sorghum, and sugar cane. 3) The only way to avoid the prediction that  drought will be the number one cause of crop loss and delimiter of productivity in the 21st century especially for C4 crops such as corn, sorghum, and sugar cane,  is to bring about a change in conditions. Specifically, by understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which plant structures are able to withstand drought will enable us to select or modify existing crops critical to both global ecology and to United States agriculture. By determining the mechanisms that make plants drought tolerant, we are directly addressing goal #1 of the NRI and CSREES strategic planning by enhancing economic opportunities for agricultural producers. The goal of our work is to enhance agricultural yields in regions likely to experience drought in the upcoming decades. If successful, this preliminary grant will enable the investigators to pursue a larger, more comprehensive study under the USDA funding mechanism."

Ethanol production is a key part of reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil sources. However, current systems for producing ethanol have a small net energy gain. This is primarily due to the large energy inputs for steam cooking to convert grain starch to sugar and distillation of the ethanol. We propose to develop sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) as a bioenergy crop. Sweet sorghum provides high yields of sugar in a manner similar to sugar cane, and similarly requires local processing to avoid transporting large wet biomass bulk. Local processing provides the unique opportunity to produce large amounts of sugar with low input for conversion to ethanol, while also providing plant residues as the fuel for distillation; this system would add considerable value to the local farm economy. As an integrated production system it has the potential for efficient processing of bioenergy ideally suited to the Nebraska farm system, especially for the drought susceptible central and western parts of the state. In areas typically affected by drought, sweet sorghum out-produces corn in carbohydrate production; Nebraska must incorporate into its strategic plan for bioenergy the inevitability of future water limits. To address these challenges, our objectives are: 1. Develop management practices that achieve high water and nitrogen use efficiency while maintaining high sugar yields in sweet sorghum. 2. Conduct a process and chemical analysis of sweet sorghum sap fermentation for maximum bioethanol production. 3. Perform life-cycle analysis of sweet sorghum-ethanol: Energy yield, efficiency, and GHG reduction. However, certain barriers currently limit the attractiveness of sweet sorghum, a resilient crop, as biomass resource for bioenergy in the U.S. Most of these barriers center on optimizing performance of the crop on marginal lands, developing avenues to permit efficient conversion of the remaining biomass to ethanol, and developing better technologies for harvesting and separating sap from fiber."

Completion of a genome map of sorghum will permit direct cross-referencing of the genomes of sorghum, rice, and maize, thereby permitting a unified Poaceae genome map to be assembled.  This map and associated technology platforms will enhance gene discovery and expedite germplasm development via marker-assisted selection of key agronomic traits.Objective 2:  Utilize the sorghum genome map and genetic resources to clone key genes, including those controlling pollen fertility and drought tolerance.  As the products of Objective 1 are developed and released, positional cloning of genes will be simplified when complemented with high-quality linkage analyses.Sub-objective 2.A:  Elucidate the genetic basis of drought tolerance by positional cloning of a major stay-green QTL in sorghum.  Utilizing genetic stocks that are isogenic for a given stay-green QTL, high resolution maps have been constructed and continued refinement of each QTL will be achieved.  The further refinement of the QTL, coupled with detailed genetic, physiological, and molecular analyses of gene candidates will ultimately permit the gene(s) conditioning the stay-green phenotype to be cloned.Sub-objective 2.B:  Elucidate the genetic basis of pollen fertility restoration in sorghum by positional cloning of the Rf2 fertility gene.  Armed with fine mapping populations, genomic technology platforms for sorghum, and having cloned the first major sorghum fertility gene, positional cloning of Rf2 fertility restoration gene is achievable.Objective 3:  Map genome regions controlling photoperiodism and plant height in sorghum and identify robust molecular markers linked to these traits.  Completion of the genome map flanking these trait loci will expedite high-resolution mapping by revealing sequences representing potential markers for additional fine mapping, while also revealing candidate genes conditioning photoperiodic-insensitivity and reduced plant height.Objective 4:  Conduct proof-of-concept study, utilizing molecular markers, to expedite the conversion of tropical sorghum to temperate adaptation.  We will utilize the genome map and molecular markers discovered under Objective 3 to evaluate the introgression of recessive alleles conditioning photoperiod insensitivity, plus reduced plant height, into tropical germplasm.  This molecular evaluation will supplant the additional selfing generations and associated phenotypic evaluation normally required to track the introgression of recessive alleles into exotic germplasm during their conversion to photoperiod-insensitive, short-stature cultivars suitable for production in the U.S.Approach:The long-term goal of this project is to develop and utilize appropriate approaches and techniques in genomics and biotechnology to discover genes that control key agronomic traits, and to utilize these to augment breeding strategies that will facilitate the development of improved sorghum cultivars.  At present, positional cloning in sorghum is a daunting task, but the further refinement of a sequenced-based sorghum genome map will greatly simplify gene discovery.  We have targeted several agronomically critical genes for positional cloning, including the stay-green gene(s) conditioning sorghumÆs exceptional tolerance to post-anthesis drought.  In ongoing collaboration with scientists at Texas A&M University and the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, Queensland, Australia, an integrated approach that includes the plant disciplines of physiology, breeding, molecular genetics, and genomics is being employed to clone stay-green genes.  This information, and markers linked to these genes, will be exploited to introgress post-anthesis drought tolerance into elite sorghum cultivars.  Additionally, the molecular tools developed under Objective 1 and Sub-objective 2.A will facilitate our ongoing efforts to clone pollen fertility restoration genes.  Work with our Queensland collaborator will target cloning of Rf2 because of its importance in hybrid seed production, and the need for informative markers tightly linked to Rf2 for germplasm evaluation.  We also seek to map, at high resolution, the height and photoperiod-insensitive genes required to convert tropical sorghums to photoperiod-insensitive, short-stature cultivars suitable for production in the U.S.  Objectives 1-3 are complementary, and the knowledge gained under one objective will facilitate success in all.  Continued map resolution of photoperiodic and height trait loci obtained under Objective 3 will provide the foundation for identification of additional robust molecular markers and potential candidate genes, which will positively impact achievement of Objective 4."

Approach:Maize is an important crop as well as a model organism for other cereals such as sorghum, barley, rice and wheat. Our long term goal is to identify and characterize the activity of maize genes involved in plant production including tolerance to stressful growth conditions and regulation of flowering time. Recent work in model systems demonstrates that the circadian regulation of physiological activities is required for optimal plant growth and for tuning of responses to environmental cues. A comprehensive understanding of the circadian system in cereals is lacking; therefore, this proposal seeks to define the maize circadian system and assess the circadian oscillatorÆs contribution to important agronomic traits. Known circadian mutants will be tested for their response to salt and osmotic stress. Genes under circadian regulation in cereals will be identified by expression profiling, and this information used to computationally predict regulatory DNA elements that contribute to circadian gene expression. Reverse genetic approaches will evaluate the role of candidate photoperiodism genes in determining the timing of maize flowering. Maize inbreds and recombinant inbred lines will be analyzed for natural variation in overt circadian rhythms. DNA sequences, genes, mutants, and inbred lines identified here provide two types of tools: a better understanding of fundamental processes in environmental responses and targets that can be used to improve crop productivity.

Some minor crops such as alfalfa, sesame, and guar appear to be increasing in this region as effective alternatives in a cotton rotation system. Water is the key limiting factor in crop production and dryland production is dependent on the timeliness and total amount of rainfall. Record cotton yields have been recorded over the last three years in part due to favorable environmental conditions (temperature and water), crop genetics, and improved crop protection. A key limiting factor to crop production is pests. At least 12 billion dollars annually are lost due to weeds growing with crops in the United States.

Cotton is the main crop in this area, followed by sorghum (Texas Agricultural Statistics Service, 2001). Organic matter levels in the soils of the Southern High Plains have declined drastically in cultivated soil the last 50 yr (Unger, 1968), especially in conventionally tilled soils (Unger, 1991). Cotton, which does not return much residue to the soil (Varco et al., 1999), has contributed to this trend. Soil organic matter is important in supplying nutrients such as nitrogen (N), and it also protects the soil against wind and water erosion. A large volume of soil fertility research results exists for cotton and sorghum in the Southern High Plains of Texas (Valentine et al., 1968; Walker and Onken, 1969; Onken and Sunderman, 1972; Welch et al., 1980; Onken et al, 1977; Pennington et al., 1981; Stoecker and Onken, 1989; Segarra et al., 1989). However, much of this information is decades old, and production practices, such as center-pivot irrigation replacing furrow-irrigation, have changed. There are also doubts that soil fertility and nutrient management research generated in small plots can extrapolate to farmers' field-scale. There is a pressing need, therefore, for research on nutrient management practices for the important crops in the region, based on research involving soil testing and yield monitoring on field-scale. The outcome of this project will be sustainable nutrient management practices that are profitable to producers, and protect and enhance regional soil quality, and groundwater quality."

Production of ethanol from corn and grain are well developed technologies. However, corn ethanol can meet only a limited amount of liquid fuel demands due to competing markets for food and feed. As petroleum costs rise, alternative transportation fuels will become increasingly cost competitive with gasoline and essential to the survival of modern society. By-products of grain and corn production, namely straw and corn stover, can also provide feedstocks for fuel ethanol production and for direct combustion or gasification to provide heat and or power. In addition, diverse agricultural crops and industries can provide other lignocellulosic feedstocks for energy production. These include: hardwood sawdust, food production byproducts, paper waste, root crops, corn cobs, sorghum waste, sunflower residues, soybean residues and switchgrass. However the potentials of these feedstocks for ethanol production using currently developed biomass pretreatment and fermentation technologies have not been closely evaluated. The goals of this project are to survey the availability of Ohio biomass feedstocks for ethanol production, develop compositional analysis capabilities that allow the quantification of energy content, biomass carbohydrates, proteins and lignin, evaluate pretreatment and bioconversion process yields from selected feedstocks and ultimately determine the process conditions necessary to economically utilize them for bioethanol production or for the generation of heat and/or power through fluidized bed combustion or gasification. Expected outcomes of this research are information about efficient methods for the pretreatment of biomass feedstocks that have the potential to yield substantial amounts of ethanol fuel, especially in Ohio. Another outcome will be to identify the properties of agri-fuels that reduce the cost of heat energy and can improve the profitability of small industrial operations. Information developed from this program will benefit farmers, biomass producers, ethanol producers, and industries with high energy costs."

For Texas and the Southern and Central U.S. region, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is a logical choice due to its high productivity, drought tolerance, established production systems, and genetic diversity. Sorghum is a versatile feedstock for conversion to renewable fuels utilizing three crop component approaches. Starch in the sorghum grain is already utilized since it is easily converted to ethanol with similar efficiency using the same methodologies as corn. Sweet sorghum stalks, traditionally used to produce sorghum syrup, can be milled and sugar from extracted juice can be fermented to ethanol using the same methods as in sugarcane processing. Finally, as cellulosic conversion technologies progress, newly developed high-biomass sorghum hybrids have the potential to become an ideal lignocellulosic feedstock, because of their ability to produce high tonnage with a higher water-use efficiency that conventional forage sorghum. Very little data are available about performance and management of sorghum grown for biomass in central and eastern Texas. These regions-and, moreover, the whole southeastern U.S.-show in our assessment the highest potential for successful, economical bioenergy production, because high rainfall amounts enable the production of high biomass. Several considerations for high-biomass sorghum production systems need to be evaluated: Commercially available forage hybrids have varying yield potential for humid Texas, varying quality for bioenergy processing, and varying harvesting characteristics such as plant lodging. We propose to evaluate available forage hybrids for yield potential, bioenergy processing characteristics, and harvesting characteristics. Preliminary data suggest that lodging is potentially a severe problem for successfully harvesting a biomass sorghum crop in our area. Lodging is affected to a large degree by the number of plants grown per unit of land. We propose to determine the optimal plant population for obtaining high yield while preserving optimal standability of the crop. While the crop will grow until first frost in fall, whether this crop can be stockpiled in the field is unknown. We propose to stockpile the crop in the field and determine if this is a potential way of extending harvest and providing just-in-time delivery to processing plants."

Currently, the bulk of a crop's stored solar energy remains locked in the rest of the plant and is not converted to ethanol. Therefore a potentially more lucrative source of bioethanol is through the fermentation of sugars locked in plant cell walls in the form of cellulose (the most abundant polymer on Earth) and hemicellulose polymers. This form of ethanol is referred to as cellulosic ethanol. Cellulose and hemicellulose are chemically protected by a complex, amorphous polymer called lignin, which must be circumvented prior to enzymatic release of fermentable sugars. The strong chemical bonds of lignin must be at least partially degraded with natural enzymes and/or chemical processes (pretreatment strategies) before fermentation can occur. Therefore, creative biochemical and industrial techniques which break down lignin and cellulose will be required to convert the chemical energy into cellulose-derived bioethanol. Furthermore, through the testing of an efficient pretreatment strategy on genetically diverse members of a cellulosic ethanol feedstock crop, it is theoretically possible to identify and manipulate genes that enhance the ethanol yield potential (EYP) for that crop through classical breeding and transgenic techniques. This project aims to evaluate sorghum varieties grown on the Coastal Plain of South Carolina as a possible cellulosic ethanol crop. Sorghum, already the #2 non-cellulosic ethanol crop in the US, is amenable to perenniality (important to minimizing the environmental impact of expanded biofeedstock production), and is relatively stress-tolerant (so can be grown on marginal land with low inputs). Sorghum utilizes the C4 photosynthetic pathway to assimilate more fixed carbon with less input than many other crops. In this project, multiple sorghum varieties (a large gene pool) will be evaluated for the efficacy of various pretreatment strategies including enzymes purified from wood-degrading fungi. The best `pretreatment method - sorghum variety' marriage will be determined and an effort will be made to move this combination into the emerging South Carolina biofuels industry. The PI then intends to use the EYP of this combination as a baseline for the improvement of yield through the identification and evaluation of sorghum genes through an efficient blend of advanced computational, molecular, genetic, and engineering techniques independently and through collaboration with key players at Clemson and beyond."

Attributes which could be improved include early maturity, resistance to red stalk rot and maize dwarf mosaic virus, higher sugar concentration in the stalk juice, and standability. Different sweet sorghum genetic types will be crossed to each other, and the progeny of the crosses will be analyzed for a combination of qualities not available in current varieties. Brix, a measure of sugar concentration, will be used to select sweet sorghum genetic types with new levels of sugar concentration. I anticipate identifying sweet sorghum types with higher levels of sugar and releasing a sweet sorghum variety which will reduce production constraints for sorghum syrup producers."

Genome sequencing is a process that determines the identity and order of an organism's DNA; thus providing a blueprint for the genetic code underlying all of the processes of life.   This has been highlighted by the recently completed draft sequence of the human genome, a notable technical achievement made possible by the development of powerful computational hardware and software.  The availability of complete genome sequences is providing the foundation for understanding how organisms (from microbes to humans) function, develop, evolve and interact with pathogens and assorted environmental cues.  This has led to a transformational change in the field of biology stemming from the development of next-generation ultra high-throughput, ultra low-cost DNA sequencing technology ( e.g. Roche 454), which serves as the basis for this proposal. What used to take several months, can now be done in several hours. The Roche 454 FLX will be used by more than 60 faculty members and their research staff, including post-doctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students at Texas A&M University.  Applications and research programs include:  dissection of sorghum drought tolerance, functional and metagenomic analysis of biological communities for cattle and rumen  bacteria, disease resistance  and  an analysis of microflora in ocean drilling programs, among others.  Dissemination of data and project outcomes will be available on the Institute for Plant Genomics and Biotechnology website (http://ipgb.tamu.edu), research publications, relevant scientific meetings and during our scheduled campus-wide annual meeting."

This research is being conducted at the University of California-Berkeley under the sponsorships of Drs. Chelsea Specht and Rasmus Nielsen. Biology is moving into the post-genomics era.  In the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of genome data pubicly available; however, this has led to a bottleneck in terms of analyses. Over 100 land plant plastid (chloroplast) genomes are currently available on GenBank, and this is largely due to their relatively small size, conserved nature, and the development of inexpensive, high-throughput sequencing methods. Crop plants, especially members of the plant order Poales (including the grasses, i.e. wheat, maize, rice, oats, sorghum, sugarcane, and barley), have received particular attention. Several plant nuclear genomes have been sequenced, including rice, and projects are in progress to sequence six additional grass nuclear genomes. Ongoing genome sequencing projects promise to provide an avalanche of data available for researchers. This project is creating tools to automate the examination of rates and patterns of genome evolution using the Poales as a model system. Plastid genome data provide a densely sampled and phylogenetically resolved framework for developing and testing these new methods.

Between control costs and crops losses, ECB has caused nearly $2 billion in losses each year. It is well known that the ECB consists of multiple population types that vary in a suite of fitness-related characters that determine patterns of gene exchange and outbreak dynamics in field populations. The work that we propose builds on our previous efforts to define the genetic structure of the ECB, and to map the genes that encode these ecologically-relevant phenotypes. Our immediate goal is to characterize the transcriptome of the ECB and to quantify gene transcript abundance. To accomplish this goal, we will use next-generation technology to sequence ECB transcriptomes derived from multiple tissues, developmental stages, and individuals differing in trait values. With respect to the stated priorities of the program we will utilize  newer-generation sequencing technologies for transcriptome analysis in order to address.key biological function[s] of.specific tissue[s] or life stage[s] relevant to future pest control.  At the same time, we will also provide the framework to  enable future studies on genome organization,  including mapping of genes, further characterization of gene families in Lepidoptera, and identification of targets of selection in the ECB genome."

Al toxicity is the primary limitation to crop production on approximately 50% of the world's potentially arable lands, including ~20% of North America as well as in many developing countries, where food security is most tenuous. Rice is a staple crop for half the world's population and is a major U.S. agricultural export. Rice is significantly more Al tolerant than other grasses, including maize, wheat and sorghum, but our understanding of the genetic, molecular and physiological mechanisms of rice Al tolerance is still limited. With higher levels of Al tolerance and abundant genetic and genomic resources, rice is a good model to investigate cereal Al tolerance. The goal of this research is to identify the major genes involved in Al resistance in rice and provide a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms of Al resistance. The activities outlined in this proposal will allow us to: 1) Identify, clone, and characterize the gene(s) underlying a major and novel rice Al tolerance QTL we have recently identified. 2) Develop near isogenic lines (NILs) containing the major Al tolerance QTL for use in breeding and physiological studies. 3) Conduct full-genome association mapping using 500 O. sativa and O. rufipogon genotypes to identify novel chromosomal regions (50-500kb) conferring Al tolerance in rice. 4) Determine and characterize the physiological mechanism(s) underlying rice Al tolerance. The findings from the proposed research on the elucidation of the molecular and physiological basis of the very high Al tolerance expressed in rice, will allow for more efficient breeding of acid soil-tolerant rice varieties and also provide important new molecular and genetic resources for improving acid soil tolerance of cereal crops in general."

The Poaceae inhabit a wide range of environmental niches and possess a number of unique morphological, physiological, and developmental processes of agricultural relevance involving floral/fruit development, drought tolerance, and C4 photosynthesis. Diversification of plant morphology and biological function is apparent between taxonomic groups and lineage specific genes are strong candidates underpinning this diversity. We have identified a set of highly conserved lineage specific genes within the Poaceae, termed Conserved Poaceae Specific Genes (CPSGs). The majority of CPSGs lack a known function and we will augment their annotation by determining their expression pattern across four Poaceae species with genome sequence, rice, sorghum, maize and Brachypodium. We will test the function of a subset of CPSGs using experimental approaches with a standardized set of metrics for floral/seed development and yield. As the CPSGs are restricted to the Poaceae, understanding their function would provide a powerful resource to identify genes that distinguish Poaceae from other plant taxa and have the potential to provide seminal insight into the molecular mechanisms that are critical to the unique morphology, development, and physiological capabilities of the Poaceae, phenotypes important to agriculture."

Many of Kentucky's family farms have been highly dependent upon tobacco as a primary source of income. But the number of farms growing tobacco in Kentucky declined 72% from nearly 30,000 in 2002 to 8,112 in 2007. The market value of tobacco sold in Kentucky in 2008 was $382 million, down from $674 million in 2000. Many of Kentucky's farms are small, averaging 164 acres, compared to the U.S. average of 418 acres. There were 85,300 farms in the state in 2008. According to the 2007 census, 67 percent of all Kentucky farms sold less than $10,000 worth of agricultural products. Interest in alternative crops, including horticultural enterprises, has risen dramatically. This interest continues to increase because of the tobacco quota buyout. Horticultural crops offer Kentucky growers potential alternatives. A number of farms have successfully initiated commercial vegetable enterprises. Other farms are seeing the potential success of horticultural crops, but many lack the technical knowledge and management skills for immediate success with these production/marketing systems. Kentucky's grain producers are searching for ways to improve the market value of the crops they grow. Examples of potential specialty grain types include edamame (green vegetable soybean) and soft white winter wheat. An emphasis on bioenergy has increased the need for research on a variety of crops that have potential for energy production, including hulless barley, sweet sorghum, and biomass crops such as switchgrass. Growth in the organic food industry has led to a need for research on organic production of both horticultural and grains crops. This project is designed to develop and deliver Kentucky farmers the knowledge they need to assess new crop opportunities. Eleven horticulture and specialty grains projects will be conducted by researchers at the University of Kentucky as part of this overall New Crop Opportunities, KY, project. The New Crop Opportunities Center will feature a Web site for 24-hour access to information on new crops for Kentucky, including the horticultural and specialty grains crops that are the focus of the Center's research. Center staff will answer questions from Extension agents and farmers, and will distribute new crop information at field days and conferences. The Center will facilitate the packaging of information from its research and other sources for dissemination. The expected outcomes/impacts of this project will be an increase in knowledge among Kentucky farmers and county extension agents about production and marketing systems for a variety of new crops. This increase in knowledge should allow farmers to make informed decisions about which new crops to try, and how to market those crops, based on information available on the Center's research projects, as well as through its crop and marketing profiles. Anticipated benefits include greater profitability for Kentucky's farmers as they successfully transition to a variety of crops that are new to them."

Decreasing our dependence on petroleum imports by developing a renewable and sustainable, domestic biofuels industry will stimulate the economy, increase energy security, improve air quality, and decrease emissions of fossil CO2 and other greenhouse gases. The conversion of cellulosic feedstocks into ethanol has been recognized as an essential component of the overall biofuel strategy in the U.S. A key factor in meeting the U.S. government's  20 in 10  goals is the development of feedstock crops that can be grown at high biomass yield densities and at the same time exhibit superior characteristics for conversion to fuels and valuable chemicals. Another important factor for consideration of meeting these nearer term goals (like 20 in 10) is the availability of a cellulosic dedicated energy crop where cultivation, production, and harvesting practices have already been established. Sorghum fits these near-term needs because seed production, agronomic practices, harvesting and planting equipment, and other infrastructure have been developed for this crop by virtue of its use in both the forage and grain industries. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is an attractive dedicated energy crop because of its high productivity, drought tolerance, well established production systems, its genetic diversity, and the availability of a genetic system that greatly facilitates a breeding program. In addition the genetic structure and plant biology of sorghum allows for application of relatively simple genetic analysis compared to the genetic structure of other bioenergy crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus. Because the sorghum genome is relatively small and closely related to many of the other potential bioenergy species, the genomic analysis described herein should be applicable to other bioenergy crop, such as Saccharum, Miscanthus and Panicum species. The goal of the proposed program is to enhance our understanding of crop composition on bioenergy conversion, using sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) as a model dedicated energy crop. Understanding the composition of this crop and its effect on conversion efficiency is crucial to the development of alternative energy sources. This will be accomplished by the agronomic evaluation of different sorghum types in several different production environments; biomass samples from each sorghum type will be collected from each location for composition analysis and conversion using state of the art conversion technology. From this research, we expect to identify optimum sorghum genotypes for conversion."

Sweet sorghum is a potential crop for producing ethanol in the Midwest. The advantage of sweet sorghum compared with corn is that it requires less fertilizer, water, and pesticides and is cheaper to grow. It also does not have the aflatoxin problem that corn for grain does., It has several advantages over sugarcane, such as the ability to withstand dry conditions, require less fertilizer, rapid growth rate, ease of planting, and lower cost of total fermentable sugars. The juice pressed from the stem contains fermentable sugars and thus, the step of breaking down the starch to sugar required in corn and other grains is bypassed. An ideal bioenery crop possesses several characteristics, including the cropping system's productivity, its competition for food, and the environmental impact of expanding acreage of the plant. Ethanol production is a key part of reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil sources. However, current systems for producing ethanol have a small net energy gain. This is primarily due to the large energy inputs for steam cooking to convert grain starch to sugar and distillation of the ethanol. We propose to develop sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) as a bioenergy crop. It has the potential for efficient processing of bioenergy ideally suited to the Nebraska farm system, especially for the drought susceptible central and western parts of the state. In areas typically affected by drought, sweet sorghum out-produces corn in carbohydrate production; Nebraska must incorporate into its strategic plan for bioenergy the inevitability of future water limits. To address these challenges, our objectives are: . 1. To compare the yield and production efficiency of SS to corn or grain sorghum for ethanol production across a range of dryland environments and to develop N management and planting guidelines for SS production in Nebraska. 2. To determine total biomass production and ethanol potential from sweet sorghum However, certain barriers currently limit the attractiveness of sweet sorghum, a resilient crop, as biomass resource for bioenergy in the U.S. Most of these barriers center on optimizing performance of the crop on marginal lands, developing avenues to permit efficient conversion of the remaining biomass to ethanol, and developing better technologies for harvesting and separating sap from fiber."

The US is currently positioned as the number one producer and exporter of sorghum on the world market. Despite the importance of this crop for producers in drought prone environments and the many new opportunities for sorghum utilization in the bioenergy, bioproducts and food industries, particularly gluten-free foods, relatively little public or private resources are being invested in research on genetic improvement, production, or innovative use of the various types of sorghum. The trend towards less research and technology transfer efforts on sorghum threatens the economic stability of sorghum producers and fails to capitalize on the unique opportunities of this crop. Currently, a comprehensive regional program does not exist to address the genetic, agronomic, processing, policy/trade, marketing, and educational issues as they relate specifically to the sorghum industry.

This program integrates systems approaches from genetics through policy and strategic marketing of high-quality feed, food or industrial products to increase profitability and maintain viability of all segments of the US sorghum industry in an increasingly competitive international market. The program will provide research and policy/industry outreach on sorghum (feed, food, and renewable fuel) that have direct implications for US industries and consumers. Currently, GPSIUC has groups of scientists addressing basic genetics, breeding and crop improvement, new weed control options, drought tolerance, water use efficiency, nitrogen use efficiency, pests and diseases, bioenergy production systems, utilization for new food products, and marketing policy development. The GPSIUC has also established network of scientists both nationally and internationally to undertake collaborative research programs on sorghum.

High productivity sorghum as an ethanol feedstock will benefit the environment by reducing greenhouse gases and will benefit rural areas of the U.S. by stimulating local production of a high-value crop and associated ethanol refineries. Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. has identified rice genes that adapted during rice domestication. We have shown that these genes have multiple effects on yield and other commercially important traits in rice lines and hybrids. We have identified equivalents of these rice genes native to other Grass family species (corn and barley), and have shown that these genes control yield and other traits in these species as well. Sorghum is a member of the Grass family, so we hypothesize the equivalent genes native to sorghum may control commercially important traits in sorghum, such as yield of grain, sugar, and biomass. We will evaluate the sorghum candidate genes for association with these traits. We will sequence the sorghum candidate genes in a panel of 200 sorghum lines, and perform allelic association analysis to detect trait associations. If successful, these genes should be excellent tools for breeding higher yielding sorghum and for genetically engineering sorghum using natural or derived alleles of genes that are native to sorghum, which should be more environmentally acceptable than genetically modified plants involving foreign genes."

This exposure will place our research and Extension program on the national scale. With the future development of cellulosic biorefineries in the western U.S. our work will become more important than ever. I do think we will see these grasses grown under irrigation in the mid-west where they are native and only grown dryland in the past. Reliability of feedstocks and quality of biomass will require consistent yields and quality for those biorefineries. These efforts do not hamper traditional cellulosic producers but enhance more options for those successful growers in the future. The sorghum research is cutting edge and provides traditional row crop producers with a lower cost, higher WUE annual crop that could produce similar or more biofuel per acre than corn. Depending upon markets and trends, the high energy grain from corn can then be more affordable and available to the primary livestock industries in the state that need this commodity for high animal performance. The residue after sorghum biofuel processing could be used through cellulosic biofuel processes, could be ensiled and substituted for other silages in rations or returned to the soil to enhance soil structure. Sorghum could play a major role in both the biofuel and livestock industries in the future."

Improving the nutritional and processing characteristics of cereals, and their individual components, through process manipulations of molecular structure or matrix or through genetics is important to expanding markets and finding new uses for grains and ingredients. Moreover, interest in the relationship between foods and health is growing. Cereal-based foods that are high in starch and dietary fibers, as well as contain bioactive components, provide a main source of energy to the body and substrate for colonic fermentation. It is necessary to understand and improve cereals and their components to meet consumer and health policymaker demands. Additionally, adding value to corn, sorghum, and other cereals, and food ingredients made from them, increases their marketability at home and overseas - whether it is through improvement in nutritional quality, processing properties, or finding new ways to use the whole grain or component parts. The objectives of this project will be accomplished through a better understanding of the chemical and physical bases or mechanisms that determine cereal component and whole grain properties. With such understanding, nutritional and quality characteristics can be manipulated as desired.

PRR is a widespread disease in much of the cotton production areas of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Symptoms are usually visible when cotton plants have extensive vegetative growth and may be flowering. Infected plants wilt and quickly die. There may be large areas of dead plants within a field and there can be a significant yield loss if plants die before boll maturation. The fungus survives as seed-like resting structures, which can be found at different depths in soil. These structures germinate to infect roots of susceptible plants. Disease is favored by high soil moisture, for example, following a rain or an irrigation. There is currently no long-term, effective, economical control of this disease. Host plant resistance has not been identified in cotton. Crop rotation is not effective because the fungus has a wide host range of dicotyledonous plants and cropping to resistant monocots such as corn or sorghum does not eliminate inoculum from the soil. Organic amendments such as manures can alleviate disease severity, but the effect is limited to that growing season. Additionally, the availability and expense of application limits the utility of organic amendments. Deep tillage can be effective in removing much of the inoculum from the root zone, but is generally not practical. Altering planting dates, usually to a later date, so that plants mature in the early fall, as soil temperatures decline, is practiced with some success by some growers, but is generally not practical. Soil fumigants will kill the fungus in soil only if high, uneconomical rates are used. Fungicides currently on the market have not been evaluated for their efficacy."

Many factors impact rice profitability. Domestic farm prices for rice are strongly related to world prices and reflect strong competition in a global market. Government payments play a major role in farm revenues and strongly impact the way rice producers manage their farm operations. Rice production costs are also large relative to other field crops like soybeans or corn and are greatly impacted by prices paid for fuel and fertilizer. The high costs of production for rice reduce producer profit margins and make rice producers largely dependent on government payments to achieve profitability. Rice has the largest water requirement of any row crop in eastern Arkansas. Most irrigation water is supplied by wells tapping into the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer, which underlies nearly all of eastern Arkansas. Large water withdrawals are placing strong downward pressure on this groundwater source. Water quality is also likely to impact Arkansas rice production decisions in the near future. Surface soils contain little organic matter and are comprised of silt and clay particles that are readily transported by runoff from tilled fields during heavy rainfall events. Sediment is the primary pollutant identified for most eastern Arkansas waterways, and practices like no-till are commonly recommended as remedial mechanisms. Producers have a wide range of management options to choose from, including using new rice varieties that are higher yielding or earlier maturing; using conservation tillage practices in place of conventional tillage; changing the rotation cropping sequence to include alternative crops like corn, wheat, or sorghum; improving irrigation efficiency with new irrigation technologies or land forming techniques; or investing in tail-water recovery pits and on-farm reservoirs to supplement groundwater with surface water. Arkansas rice producers have little information about the long-term profitability of management practices that preserve critical resources like land and water. The objective of this research project is to evaluate the long-term economic feasibility of alternative management practices to provide producers with viable options and insure the sustainability of rice and other agronomic crops grown in Arkansas. The results of the project should provide Arkansas farmers and farmland owners with relevant economic information for making better farm management decisions when important production resources like land and water are limiting. The results should also help guide research and extension professionals in the development of better crop management recommendations and should help policy makers better understand the impacts that alternative or competing government policies have on farm economic survival."

Crop production represents 28% of KS's agricultural product revenue, and the other 72% is derived primarily from livestock sales. KS produces the most wheat and grain sorghum of all other states, is the fifth leading state for forage production, is tenth for corn production, and eleventh for soybean production (USDA, 2007a). Crop production plays a significant role in KSAEs economy and our national food security. Crop production must remain economically and environmentally sustainable to maintain this important industry. Cropping systems research is required for meeting the increasing demand for agricultural commodities, increasing input costs coupled with historically stagnant commodity prices, and declining rural populations. It is inevitable that large regions of KS and the US will have to transition from full irrigation to limited irrigation or dryland production in the future, yet maintain or increase crop production to meet the ever increasing food, fiber, and bio-fuel demand (KS v. CO, 2001; Schneekloth et al. 1995). In order to maintain the viability of agriculture production, sustainable limited irrigation and dryland cropping systems must be developed. Dryland cropping systems in the semi-arid Great Plains rely on fallow for storing soil moisture for following crop (Anderson et al. 1999). Fallow efficiency has increased from about 19% in 1916 to 33% in 1975 to 40% currently (Greb 1979; Peterson et al. 1996). Fallow efficiency was increased by many factors including improved pest management, particularly effective and timely weed control; increased chemical fallow and no-till production; increasing stubble amount and height; and reduced fallow period length (Peterson et al. 1996; Tanaka and Aase, 1987). Of these factors, reducing the fallow period duration has had the greatest impact on increasing fallow efficiency (Peterson et al. 1996). Fallow efficiency is currently limited in the Great Plains by the amount of residue remaining on the soil after harvest, which averages approximately 3 ton/A for the region (Peterson et al. 1996). Since 2006 the price of many commodities including corn, wheat, and barley increased almost 100% due to a current short world supply and increased bio-fuel production. This has increased the demand for corn and at least in the short term has resulted in a large increase in price. There is a concern that the increase in corn price will result in feed costs that are too high for livestock producers and feedlots to remain economically profitable (Swanson, 2007). If feed costs remain high, forage crops and alternative feed crops will be needed in feedlot rations and cow-calf operations. This is particularly important since 72% of KSAEs agricultural economy is derived from livestock sales (USDA, 2007a). Ultimately finding methods of sustainable dryland crop production that maximize fallow efficiency, meet the demands for food, fiber, and bio-fuel, and support KSAEs livestock industry will help sustain the viability of producers, local rural communities, natural resources, and the viability of the surrounding region."

A 2006 survey of sorghum producers in the United States by Kansas State University Sorghum Improvement Center showed that new technologies for controlling weeds was thought to be one of the highest priorities for research. In addition, producers repeatedly noted the need to develop better and more economical weed management strategies for sorghum. Currently, many grain sorghum producers use preplant herbicides such metolachlor and alachlor to control grasses. These herbicides generally work well for managing weeds given adequate precipitation; however, erratic rainfall and poor soil moisture are common in most sorghum producing regions. Under dry conditions, preplant herbicides often fail or perform poorly and weeds can become a problem. Acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase)-inhibiting herbicide are widely used to control grass weeds. These herbicides control several troublesome grass weeds that are common in sorghum fields. Unfortunately, these herbicides cannot be used on sorghum because sorghum is susceptible to these herbicides. A project was initiated in 2005 to develop and ultimately commercialize sorghum varieties with tolerance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides. The development of this technology would allow for more effective postemergence grass control for sorghum producers and also improve crop rotation. A natural sorghum mutant with high levels of tolerance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides was identified. Genetic crossing and backcrossing was used to transfer this trait into elite grain sorghum varieties and sorghum hybrids with resistance to ACCase are now available. The project will study the potential to utilize and maximize the efficacy of ACCase-inhibiting herbicide in ACCase-resistant grain sorghum. Field and greenhouse studies will be conducted to evaluate the quizalofop efficacy to control common grasses in grain sorghum, study the effect of adjuvants on quizalofop efficacy, and to integrate ACCase-inhibiting herbicide in a cost effective one pass postemergence weed control program that provide general weed control in ACCase-resistant grain sorghum."

R.",,,002236250,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,FL,32611-0110,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2009,,,"Nematodes are very important pathogens of most agronomic and horticultural crops produced in Florida. The state has both an ideal environment and suitable hosts for most of the major plant-pathogenic nematodes. Nematode life cycles are short thereby enabling them to generate multiple generations within a cropping season resulting in large population densities in a short period of time. Without doubt, some of the most severe crop damage that occurs in Florida is a result of plant-pathogenic nematodes. Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are among the most important soilborne pathogens in Florida. There are currently 14 species of Meloidogyne known to be present in the state. Many crops are subjected to parasitism by more than one species including most , e.g. solanaceous, cucurbits, and crucifer vegetable crops, as well as cotton, peanut, soybean, tobacco, field corn, and many leguminous forages and cover crops. The sting nematode (Belonolaimus longicaudatus)is a very damaging pathogen of cole crops, strawberry, soybean, cotton, field corn, sorghum, sesbania, turf grasses, and many other grasses including digitgrass, Bermudagrass, and limpograss. Other important nematodes with wide host ranges include stubby root (Paratrichodorus and Trichodorus spp.), lesion (Pratylenchus spp.), lance (Hoplolaimus spp.), awl (Dolichodorus spp.), and ring (Criconemella spp.). In cotton, the reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis) has become a widespread problem in Florida. Estimated statewide losses from nematodes include: vegetables (strawberry, snap bean, sweet corn) 10%; soybean 9%; sugarcane 4%; potato 10%; field corn 15%; peanut 15%; tobacco 4%; and cotton 7%. In local situations, nematode damage can be completely devastating in individual grower plantings of many crops, e. g., squash, cucumber, eggplant, pepper, strawberry, okra, and peanut. Crop losses from nematodes are further compounded by nematode and soilborne disease complexes such as Verticillium wilt, Fusarium wilt, and bacterial wilt. It must be emphasized that losses on most agricultural crops would be many-fold higher if it were not for nematode management programs already in existence. For example, nearly 100% of tomato, pepper, eggplant, melon and strawberry plantings are treated annually with multipurpose-soil fumigants. Almost all soybean cultivars grown in Florida are root-knot and cyst nematode resistant. Production costs for most agricultural crops are rapidly rising. This has become particularly important recently since many agricultural inputs are petroleum-based. Hence, there is a continuing need to maximize crop production by reducing the influence of factors that limit yields. Also, greater emphasis is being placed on environmental issues regarding agricultural production. This has encouraged widespread support for developing agricultural practices designed to preserve and enhance environmentally-sound and sustainable methods for managing plant-pathogenic nematodes."

A food-grade grain sorghum, e.g., the Macia variety, will serve as the basis to determine the fate of select lipids. The Macia variety will be used for this project as it can be cultivated in the great plains of the United States and is of economic importance in developing regions of Africa and Asia. Macia also provides a platform from which numerous comparisons can be made as it is currently used in a growing number of non-GMO, non-gluten food products including porridges, beers, unleavened breads, cookies, cakes, and couscous. After the various processes have been completed and the lipids have been characterized, animal studies will be initiated to 1) examine the impact of grain processing on several parameters of cardiovascular health in hamsters fed sorghum; and 2) investigate the specific components of grain sorghum that elicit the cholesterol-lowering response. When the proposed program is fully established, the expected outcomes include 1) physiochemical and metabolic methods required to fully characterize bioactive components in grain sorghum systems will be assembled, 2) key issues related to processing effects on grain sorghum bioactive compounds will be identified, 3) specific classes of lipid compounds of grain sorghum that exert health benefits will be determined, 4) fundamental understanding of the relationship between the chemical structure and the biological (nutritional) function of bioactive compounds from grain sorghum as affected by selected unit operations will be provided collectively through the studies, 5) information needed to develop a food system or supplement comprised of natural bioactive compounds as a dietary source for lowering cholesterol or providing other health benefits will be available, and 6) relevant information about grain sorghum lipids will be available for dissemination through web sites, curriculum materials and other approaches."

Our desert clientele see dairy and beef as alternatives that allow them to diversify and maintain profitability. However, hot summers induce alfalfa to suffer a  summer slump  that slows growth and reduces forage quality. The most common annual summer crops to supplement forage demand, sudangrass and maize, produce lower quality forage, require more fertilizer, and often have adverse effects on subsequent rotational crops. Growers have asked that we find potential solutions that would sustain forage production and improve crop diversity and productivity. We will investigate the potential of several legume crops as forage, their fit in current production systems, and intercropping these legumes with maize in Arizona. Alternative legume forage crops, such as lablab (Lablab purpureus), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) will be planted in early summer and regularly harvested to evaluate quality and yield. A bare ground treatment will also be included in the study as a control, and all treatments will be followed by a fall planting of wheat. Pre- and post-plant soil nitrogen will be measured, as well as the nutrient status of the wheat crop. Field experiments at research stations in the 1st and 2nd year will quantify yield and quality of these forage crops and their effects on the following rotational crop. We will work with participating growers to conduct an economic analysis to help choose the best alternatives for farms typical of the region. After legumes with high quality and yield are identified in the environment of Arizona and southern California, on-farm trials will be conducted in the 2nd and 3rd year with participating growers to investigate the potential of the legumes crops alone and intercropping these legumes with maize to improve the quality of grass forages. Research findings will be disseminated to growers and other agricultural professionals by field days, presentations at grower meetings, one to one communications, and extension publications. Growers will participate by providing fields for trials, helping develop experimental plans and give feedback on results, and advise research scientists on the future direction of the project. We expect that growers will adopt more annual legume forage crops into their current cropping system to increase sustainability of by improving soil fertility, increasing growers&#39; profitability, and increasing system diversification in the region."

This project will use comparative and experimental studies, in both field and laboratory, to build on our existing base of coccinellid research and explore various aspects of the life history and ecology of these species that relate directly to their efficacy in biological control of cereal aphids. 2) Mitigation of Yield Losses to Dectes texanus in Cultivated Sunflowers. Among the management tactics to be explored in field experiments are: (1) reduced plant spacing to increase stalk girth and 'standability' while delaying stalk desiccation (and hence onset of girdling), (2) use of a late-season irrigation pulse to delay stalk desiccation relative to seed desiccation, (3) use of 'soft' desiccants such as glyphosate to accelerate seed desiccation relative to stalk desiccation, (4) use of the 'stay-green' stalk trait to delay stalk desiccation relative to seed desiccation, and (5) characterization of resistance factors in wild sunflower. 3) Integrated Management of Multiple Insects Attacking Late Season Soybeans in Kansas. A series of on-farm yield-response experiments will address a complex of key insect pests impacting late-season soybeans. We will monitor densities of key insect pests (e.g., bean leaf beetle, corn earworm, stink bugs, soybean looper, soybean aphid, etc.) and generate a range of insect infestation levels using insecticides and exclusion cages. We will then measure yield responses and calculate damage thresholds for these pests alone and in combination. 4) Adapting a Mechanistic Growth Model to Generate Field-Specific Economic Thresholds for Soybean Aphid. We will adapt a mechanistic growth model to describe soybean aphid population dynamics, improve our ability to forecast population growth rates, and increase the effectiveness of econmic thresholds. 5) Evaluating Biocontrol and Host Plant Resistance Strategies for Managing Soybean Aphid in the North Central U.S. Using field experiments, we will assess chemical control/resistant variety interactions in the context of controlling soybean aphid and evaluate resistant soybean varieties and their interactions with biological control agents. 6) Integrated Pest Management of Multiple Insects Attacking Sorghum in Kansas. We will re-evaluate long-standing treatment recommendations for key sorghum pests with a focus on caterpillars attacking whorls and seed heads. We will delineate yield-loss relationships for economically relevant sorghum pests using exclusion cages in commercial production fields and small-plot experiments, and also identify key parasitoids of economically important species. 7) Evaluation of Pesticides for Managing Arthropod Pests in Kansas Field Crops. Field spray trials will be used to test efficacy of existing and novel materials against three major arthropod pest groups that threaten corn production in this Southwest Kansas, corn borers, rootworms and spider mites. In addition, small plot trials will be used to identify insecticides with activity against D. texanus in soybeans."

T.",,,555456995,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,LINCOLN,NE,68588,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2009,,,"Distillers grains with solubles (DGS), byproducts produced by ethanol plants, have considerable value as a feedlot cattle feed. Beef cattle feedlots are increasingly concentrating next to ethanol plants so that the distillers grains can be fed directly to cattle, which is much more energy efficient than drying and transporting the byproducts. The primary grain coproducts used by feedlot nutritionists are wet DGS and dry DGS (corn, sorghum, or both). With the continuous expansion of the ethanol industry, the development of further research on the use of these byproducts and evaluation of their interactions with other feeding ingredients is still needed. Therefore, different feeding systems including distillers grains will be evaluated in the present project. In addition, very limited data has been available on the optimal level of urea in diets containing DGS. An initial study in our laboratory will evaluate the effects of different levels of degraded intake protein (DIP) as urea on performance and carcass characteristics of finishing cattle fed dry-rolled corn-based diets containing wet distillers grains with solubles (WDGS). Another initial study will evaluate the effect of feeding a dietary antioxidant (ethoxyquin and tertiary-butyl-hydroquinone; ETBH) in beef cattle finishing diets containing 0 or 30% WDGS. Antioxidants are postulated to improve antioxidant status, and attenuate the negative effects of some fats in the animal, improving growth performance and carcass traits of feedlot cattle. Additional experiments will also evaluate the effects of feeding different levels of a different ethanol byproduct (condensed corn distillers solubles [CCDS]) and the use of microorganisms known as direct-fed microbials (DFM; viable cultures of fungi and bacteria) in finishing diets containing WDGS. There have been a growing number of conflicts over water management in Nebraska, prompted by increased demand for water at the same time supplies in some areas dwindle. Water demand is expected to increase in the next years, as result of the development of the ethanol industry and greater demand of water for irrigation purposes. With increasing conflicts over water use, decreasing water usage to produce adequate feedstock supply is important to conserve water resources. Because feedstuffs contain some water, it has been suggested that not all water consumed by feedlot cattle must be provided by drinking. Oldr data suggest that the moisture in the feed should be subtracted from the estimated cattle total water intake in order to estimate cattle's need for drinking water, but no data are available to justify this assumption. The use of wet distillers grains (approximately 65% water) in feedlot diets adds moisture to the feed. However, whether the extra diet moisture would reduce drinking requirements deserves investigation. Any management strategies which reduce demand for water are useful, particularly at times when water demands are large and in regions where water is limited and/or becoming more costly. Therefore, the effects of feeding different levels of ethanol byproducts on water intake of feedlot cattle deserves further investigation."

The PIs have been involved in proprietary research on natural based plastics made from sorghum.  It was shown that a powder made from certain sorghum varieties can be used effectively as an absorbent to remove organic based materials (e.g., car oils).  The core of the proposed research is to combine the absorption properties of this natural based material with existing technology to shape it into a porous sponge-like material to be used to remove crude oil spilled in a seawater environment.  The goal of the proposed work is to develop an economically-viable, natural-based absorbent to clean up oil spills.  The objective of proposed RAPID study is to identify and quantify the key parameters of the proposed natural based absorbent such that quick implementation can be realized to the current Gulf oil spill.  The method to achieve the objective is to apply basic bench scale design of experiments that compare different parameters (loadings, size and structure, etc.) in a simulated system of crude oil and seawater.  The experimental data will be used to assess the economic commercial viability of the method.  Intellectual Merit Preliminary tests of the sorghum-based material in the shape of a foamy (sponge-like) absorbent have shown that it can absorb simulated crude oil as much as 12 to 20 times its own weight.  By optimizing certain key parameters, the PIs  can enhance this natural based absorbent potential to provide rapid and cost effective oil absorption levels.  The material can be made at the site of the spill, thus eliminating storage and transportation cost associated with light weight substances.  Moreover, there is the potential to recover a relative large portion (up to 80%) of the absorbed oil from the absorbent (not included in this study).  Preliminary calculations show that the value of the recovered oil may be higher than the cost of the absorbent and the recovery operation.  Broader Impact Without a doubt, an oil spill of the current magnitude threatens not only the human, animal and plant but also can cause irreparable damage to the environment.  If the key parameters that affect the absorbent potential of the proposed natural-based, cost-effective solution can be identified and optimized, the resulting technique can be applied in other environments, for example, marshlands.  This is because the absorbent material can be engineered in different sizes and physical structures (planar, cylindrical, etc.) and processing may provide for certain attractive properties for the application conditions.  Both PIs have a track record of working with graduate and undergraduate students in their research programs.  They also are active in the student chapter of several engineering professional societies and participate in high school programs that recruit underrepresented students to TTU.  The outcomes of this study will be transmitted to the public in various forms including: peer-reviewed publication, to BP officials, DOE, and other appropriate forums."

At a basic level, there is a serious challenge: with a growing population, and persistent malnutrition in the developing world, a more than doubling of world production is required by 2050. For some this leads to a policy discourse of doom for the poorest countries in the world: with persistently low yields, and the threat of global warming, population growth and its resulting land pressure will simply make any economic progress there impossible. Currently, many of these countries are agricultural-based, but nevertheless fail to provide sufficient food and nutrition for their populations. The World Development Report (WDR) 2008 team echoed this view but with a positive agenda: investing in agriculture is a necessary condition for development in the poorest countries. At a global level, this must be correct, as current high food prices may well push millions of (especially Asian) recent escapees from poverty back under the poverty line, putting pressure on a model of growth based on investment in relatively cheap manufacturing jobs. The emergence of biofuels as a realistic alternative for fossil fuels adds further pressure, and even if they are currently largely fuelled by trade distortions in the US and Europe, their role is likely to grow in the long-run. The WDR 2008 argued that for countries that are currently agricultural-based (i.e. most of the poorest countries in the world), agricultural progress, including via a  green revolution for Africa , are then necessary for any meaningful growth. The African Economic Research Consortium (AERC), the International Growth Center, and the US National Science Foundation jointly will sponsor a workshop devoted to research on the economics of agriculture in Africa. In particular how can agricultural productivity be improved, rural poverty be reduced, and productive interactions between agriculture and the rest of the economy be generated and strengthened? A priority focus for this conference will be on the economics of technological innovation and adoption. Despite much study, it remains striking that, despite the available off-the-shelf technology, yields and yield growth in Africa continue to lag behind the rest of the world, while adoption of new technologies is slow. A study of the interaction of different existing market failures (including in credit, insurance) as well as the behavioural foundations of technology adoption (the role risk and ambiguity, and the process learning) will remain crucial, as well as its institutional foundations, such as the nature of land rights and other constraints on accumulation. There are several innovations that could lead to increases in agricultural growth and will be the focus of research under this theme. The first would be a move into higher-value, or cash, crops - e.g., from maize/sorghum/basic staple or cereal crops into vegetables/horticulture (e.g. French beans, snow peas). Such crops are often export crops. The second is changes in physical inputs - in particular water/irrigation, but also fertilizer, seed, pesticides, etc. (see above). For example, in Kenya only 6% of plots use any irrigation at all (most plots are rain fed). Third are changes in the organization of production and land ownership - from small, uncoordinated single-family holdings to larger farms, or cooperatives of small farms. Fourth is the opening up and expansion of domestic and foreign markets for the outputs of agriculture, either through improvements in road and air networks and other infrastructure, or through the development of links between producers and traders (contract farming mentioned above). Fifth is the reduction of financial market imperfections, including opportunities for saving and improvements in formal insurance as well as improved access to credit markets. Sixth is the more rapid commercialization of agriculture. While there are unlikely to be relevant increasing returns to scale in production, there are likely to be increasing returns in marketing, storage, transport, input provision, retailing (supermarkets), etc. The organizing theme of the collaboration is to build relationships for collaborative research on agriculture in Africa. This is why the participants will remain for the following three days of the associated AERC conference, to build in time and space for developing the research collaborations. The discussants from the US will be paired with likely papers from Africa-based researchers based on the declared interests in potential joint work by both parties.  Further, early career scientists from the US will be participating in the conference.The Social, Behavioral, and Economics Directorate's Social and Economic Sciences Division and by the Office of International Science and Engineering's Africa, Near East and South Asia program are providing funding for this award."

Gloer of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa. With his collaborators, Patrick F. Dowd and Donald T. Wicklow of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Professor Gloer is isolating new natural organic compounds from fungi. The project will continue this distinctive research program in fungal natural products chemistry. Primary focus will be placed on chemical studies of mycoparasitic/fungicolous fungi, and on fungal endophytes that occur in cereal crop plants. Mycoparasitic/fungicolous fungi attack and colonize other fungi in nature. Invasion by these colonists often involves antibiosis toward the host, and therefore, such colonists may be valuable, underexplored sources of natural antifungal agents. Results from prior NSF support provide strong evidence for the validity of this hypothesis. Efforts during the proposed grant period will focus on completion of the studies of a collection of nearly 800 diverse fungal colonists obtained from varied microclimates found on the island of Hawaii. A second direction follows from the discovery that isolates of widespread corn endophytes produce natural products of various types that show antagonistic activity against other, competing fungi encountered in corn plants, including important disease-causing and mycotoxin-producing species. Studies of the occurrence and significance of these metabolites will continue, and will be expanded to include fungi from other crop plants (rye, wheat, barley, sorghum), and a limited number of prairie grasses, in search of further metabolites that show similar biological effects and potential significance. In both projects, the search for new chemistry is guided by assays for activity against two important fungal species and/or an agriculturally important insect pest. An assay for Hsp90 activity will also be included based on a discovery in the most recent grant period that a common corn endophyte produces a potent inhibitor of Hsp90 function. Many new bioactive natural products have been discovered through these hypothesis-guided studies, and further success is expected because of the relatively unexplored nature of these fungal groups. Antifungal and antiinsectan agents are of potential practical value to society in agriculture and medicine, and can also be valuable as tools to assist in discovery of new modes of action. Findings from this project are also expected to contribute to fundamental scientific knowledge in other disciplines, including fungal ecology, taxonomy, biodiversity, crop/food science, and evolutionary biology."

Gupta (Meerut University, India), and Madhu Meeta Jindal (Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India)Genes influencing plant height have revolutionized agriculture by doubling the wheat and rice production. Under conditions of environmental stress, the most predominantly used wheat semi-dwarf mutants rht1 and rht2 exhibit adverse effects on agronomic traits including coleoptile and first leaf length, root length and biomass, as well as drought tolerance. These adverse effects limit wheat yields under abiotic stress conditions that regularly affect more than 85% of the US and about 50% of the world wheat production area. The main goal of the project is to identify and characterize an alternative dwarfing gene system for wheat and other cereals in order to alleviate adverse effects of the currently used dwarfing genes.  Currently used dwarfing gene systems in wheat reduce plant height by interrupting production or signaling of plant growth hormone gibberellins that are particularly important for plants to deal with stressful conditions.  Previous studies have shown that mutations in the maize brachytic2 (br2) and the sorghum dwarf3 (dw3) genes that encode P-glycoproteins (PGPs) involved in polar transport of auxin, result in a reduction in plant height without any of the adverse phenotypic effects usually associated with the currently used wheat dwarfing mutants.  Based on these observations, this project will test whether the wheat ortholog (TaBr2) of the maize Br2 gene can be used as an alternative dwarfing gene system in wheat.  Specific objectives are to clone TaBr2 and to study its expression and function in wheat using various reverse genetics tools including virus-induced gene silencing and RNAi.  In addition, mutations in TaBr2 will be isolated using phenotypic as well as by TILLING screens in order to identify the ideal dwarfing mutant.  The benefit of the project, especially to farmers with small land holdings, will come from the introgression of value-added genes, including stripe rust resistance genes as well as newly-developed dwarfing gene mutants, into popular varieties of India, Pakistan, and the US.  In addition, the project will provide new insight into the process of auxin signaling and transport in crop plants.  The project will provide highly interdisciplinary and international research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as for research associates/visiting scientists.   The PIs are actively involved in outreach activities including farmers' Field Days, talking to grower groups and organizing lab demonstrations and displays to grower groups and the public at large. The project information and findings will be communicated with the public via these efforts as well as through electronic means.   A project website will be developed that will serve as a  one-stop  location for access to all resources generated in this project.  Links will be provided to this project webpage from each of the investigator's web pages as well.   Expression and sequence data will be immediately submitted to GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), according to the currently accepted community standard (e.g. Bermuda/Ft. Lauderdale agreement). Real-time expression data of selected genes on various wheat lines will be made freely available first via publications and then by hosting on the project webpage and on Gramene (http://www.gramene.org/). Mapping data will be available at GrainGenes database (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml).  All VIGS and RNAi constructs and germplasm generated in this project will be maintained in the PIs' lab and will be available to the public.

Small-holder farmers in Africa and South America are responsible for more than 95% of cacao production, providing economic benefits to millions of cacao farmers and their dependents, as well as important ecological benefits such as rain-forest preservation. Fungal and oomycete diseases have devastated cacao production in South America and West Africa, dislocating populations of farmers and resulting in destruction of the rain-forest sheltering the cacao trees in favor of large-scale open farmland. This project will test two novel approaches to protecting developing country crops against a broad-spectrum of oomycete and fungal pathogens, using cacao as the initial target. The first involves targeting anti-microbial proteins to pathogen feeding structures called haustoria, using RPW8, an Arabidopsis protein that has a natural affinity for these feeding sites. The second approach involves blocking the entry of virulence proteins (effector proteins) that pathogens secrete into host cells to suppress the plant host's immune system. The most effective strategies will be identified first using fast growing Arabidopsis and tomato plants before being tested in cacao.Broader Impacts: The novel technologies that will be tested in this project are potentially applicable to an extremely broad array of crop diseases important to the developing world. The most destructive diseases of broad acreage staples such as rice and wheat are potentially amenable to this approach, as are many of the most limiting fungal and oomycete diseases of crops of importance to smallholders, such as yams, cassava, groundnuts, pearl millet, finger millet, sorghum, maize, potato, bean and cowpea.

Thomas Hash (ICRISAT-Patancheru, Hyderabad, India), Stephen Kresovich (University of South Carolina, USA), Sharon Mitchell (Cornell University, USA), and Kassa Semagn (CIMMYT-Nairobi, Kenya)Senior Personnel: Theresa Fulton (Cornell University, USA)Advanced strategies of plant breeding are rapidly evolving from molecular breeding methods that manipulate a few major genes or genomic regions to complex, coordinated methods that incorporate simultaneous selection across many genomic regions (genome-wide or genomic selection). The future of plant molecular breeding (from conservation of key landraces to targeted hybrid deployment) must integrate and mine huge data sets and employ mathematical models that can predict which genotypes will perform well in specific environments. This information will then be used to help breeders and farmers identify the optimal parental combinations and select progeny genotypes (for a particular target environment) that most efficiently maximize agricultural output (yield and quality) with minimal use of constrained resources. This unique opportunity is founded on the pillars of inexpensive high marker density genotyping, high quality phenotyping, and appropriate mathematical models for prediction and experimental design. This research effort is planned to solve the technical problems associated with applying high-throughput high density genotyping and developing an operational  model  for a wide range of crops. The project will exploit and optimize next generation sequencing technologies as high-throughput genotyping assays for maize and sorghum varieties important to farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other semi-arid, tropical regions of the world. Using next generation sequencing technologies combined with high levels of multiplexing and very inexpensive sample preparation methods, the project will establish a platform to provide 100,000-1 million markers per individual for a cost substantially below current field and laboratory costs. This platform will produce robust protocols for the entire pipeline, from DNA preparation to bioinformatic analyses, which are essential for genomic selection. Moreover, these approaches will be generalized so in the future any large number of individuals of any species can be genotyped with equal ease. Reducing the genotyping costs and increasing its applicability to all crops will enable plant breeders to employ genomic selection to facilitate crop improvement.Genomic selection has the potential to significantly increase the rate of gain in agricultural productivity per year in the developing world. In this coordinated project, efforts focus on solving key technology components necessary to give half the world's population access to advanced approaches for making better crop varieties specifically tailored to challenging environments and production systems. This project will make protocols available through the project website, sequencing reads through NCBI Short Read Archive, and diversity data through the Panzea and Gramene websites. Additionally, the project will provide training to researchers at Cornell and through two symposia and training modules held in Kenya and India."

A subset of plants utilize a more efficient photosynthetic process termed C4 photosynthesis (i.e., C4 plants). In open sunny environments the rate of CO2 fixation, biomass accumulation, and grain yield in C4 plants is nearly twice that of C3 plants. The increased photosynthetic performance of C4 versus C3 plants is due in part to the evolution of an additional set of photosynthetic CO2 fixation enzymes referred to as the C4 pathway. Despite the inherently higher productivity of C4 versus C3 plants, there are only four agronomically important C4 crop species: maize, Sorghum, sugar cane, and switch grass. All other crop species (e.g., rice, soybean, wheat) are C3 plants. Thus an ongoing research goal of plant scientists is to breed or engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop plants for improving yields. Efforts to date have fallen short in part because of the lack of understanding on how the C4 pathway is controlled in leaves for optimizing use of available sunlight. The ultimate aim of this project is to elucidate how such regulation works. A first step in this endeavor, and the goal of this one-year project, is to develop maize plants that are deficient in two interrelated light-responsive C4 pathway enzymes, pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) and the PPDK regulatory protein (RP). It is hypothesized that these enzymes control the rate of the CO2 fixation by the C4 pathway in response to sunlight. Using RNA interference, a genetic engineering method, stable lines of maize plants will be isolated with reduced levels of PPDK or RP enzyme. These plants will be subsequently assessed for photosynthetic performance. From these analyses, an accurate picture of how PPDK and RP confer sunlight-responsive C4 pathway regulation is expected to emerge. This knowledge will be critical for projects now underway that seek to introduce a functional C4 pathway into leaves of C3 crop species.  A major education and training component of the project is the participation of undergraduate Biochemistry/Biotechnology degree students in fulfillment of their senior thesis research requirement."

Specific reasons for this alarming rise in food allergies are not completely understood at present. Whether genetically engineered (GE) foods contribute to this problem is largely unknown. Assessment of allergenic potential of GE foods is a major challenge facing the international and national regulatory agencies and the agro-biotech industry (Selgrade et al. 2009). Although expert panels suggest the use of animal models as one of the methods for assessment of allergenic potential of GE foods, widely accepted and validated animal models are not available at present (Ladics and Selgrade 2009).This project was conducted during the period September 15, 2010, to September 14, 2014. Currently, validated animal models to assess the allergenicity of novel dietary proteins, such as those present in GE foods, are not available. We previously published a novel mouse model of near-fatal food allergy that involves transdermal allergen sensitization followed by oral elicitation (TS/OE) of systemic anaphylaxis (Birmingham et al. 2005, 2007; Navuluri et al. 2006; Parvataneni et al. 2009; Gonipeta et al. 2010). The data collected during a previously funded U.S. EPA project (R833133) demonstrated that: (1) the allergenicity readouts in this mouse model are dependent on the number of exposures to the allergenic protein; (2) seven human allergenic proteins (hazelnut, cashew nut, sesame seed, milk, shellfish, egg, fish) produce all three readouts of allergenicity in this mouse model (Birmingham et al. 2005, 2007; Navuluri et al. 2006; Parvataneni et al. 2009; Gonipeta et al. 2010); (3) six human non-allergenic proteins (kidney bean, Pinto bean, blueberry, sorghum, pigeon pea, mung bean) were non-allergenic in this model based on clinical scores and hypothermia readouts; (4) amaranth seed protein, which has no history of human allergenicity and is therefore presumed to be non-allergenic, tested positive for all three readouts of allergenicity (Fig. 1); (5) hazelnut allergy in this mouse model once established is long-lasting similar to human hazelnut allergy (Gonipeta et al. 2010); and (6) food allergy is genetically controlled in this model similar to human food allergy (Parvataneni et al. 2009).<img alt=   src= data:image/png;base64,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"

Biofuel production from the juice of sugarcane and sweet sorghums, two crops that grow well in the southern United States, is straightforward: microbes can directly ferment the soluble sugars in the juice to fuels or chemicals. The volume of water necessary to produce bioenergy crops has, however, raised serious concerns about long-term sustainability. Sorghum is among the most water-efficient crops known, and as part of this project we will investigate the genetic basis for sorghum's water use efficiency so that this knowledge can be exploited for the further improvement of sorghum and related crops. The crushed stems that remain are also rich sources of fermentable sugars, but these sugars are present in the form of cell wall polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose) that resist degradation. In order to obtain sugars from these polymers, harsh chemical treatments and expensive cell wall degrading enzymes are typically required. This project will focus on the development of sweet sorghums with stems that are more amenable to degradation in the processing plant, in conjunction with the development of enzymes and microbial strains that are more effective. The ultimate goal is to develop microbes that can break down the bagasse and then convert the fermentable sugars to fuels and chemical building blocks for plastics. This project is expected to contribute towards the development of such an integrated process and the associated lower operating cost. Biofuels will only be competitive if they can be produced at low cost. As a complement to reducing the costs associated with biofuel production, generation of co-products with a high market value can off-set some of the processing costs. This project will focus on three different co-products: 1) succinic acid produced from the CO2 released during fermentation of sugars can be used as a building block for plastics; 2) lactic acid produced by microbes from fermentable sugars can be used for the production of bio-based plastics, and the properties of these plastics can be modified and enhanced by blending them with residues from the waste stream of the biorefinery, and 3) lignin, a component of the bagasse that ends up in the waste stream, can be used for the synthesis of nanotubes, tiny tubular structures that can be used, among other applications, for the delivery of therapeutics in ways that reduce side effects. The project involves a collaboration between researchers at the University of Florida, the Highlands EnviroFuels biorefinery, two consulting firms and two industrial collaborators. We plan to develop a fully integrated sweet sorghum-based process whereby the entire crop is used to the maximum extent. Successful completion of the project will benefit the rural economy of the area surrounding the biorefinery and can serve as a model for similar areas in the Southeastern U.S."

The two most destructive crop pests in the region are Mexican rice borer and sugarcane borer, which also attack graminaceous bioenergy crops. Other threatening pests include root knot and lesion nematodes, and the sugarcane aphid, which transmits sugarcane yellow leaf virus. The expected large-scale production of bioenergy crops will significantly impact the abundance of different plant inhabiting insects and diseases, and will require modification of existing pest management programs. The overall goal of this research is to build a landscape-wide pest management program that will mitigate insect pest and disease pressures and damage to bioenergy crops in interaction with conventional crops in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. Critical data on the biological, ecological, and economic impact of major pests and diseases will be obtained through the proposed research. Program activities include landscape-wide plant and pest phenological surveys, multi-crop field and greenhouse bionomics experiments, and pest density/yield response studies. The results will be integrated into an analysis and forecast system that provides the capability to identify optimal pest management strategies. By enhancing bioenergy and conventional cropping system compatibility, the program will help achieve goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.

Lignin is the compound present in nearly all plant cell walls; it makes cell walls rigid and hard. Thus, modifying the amount of lignin in biomass crop such as sorghum is a major target for improving these crops for bioenergy uses. For thermal conversion processes, increasing lignin content is desired, because lignin has higher energy content than other biomass components. For cellulosic ethanol, reducing lignin content is desired, because lignin blocks the breakdown of biomass components used to make biofuels. Lignin has long been thought to play a critical role in protecting plants from both fungal pathogens and insects. However, there is little known about how lignin modifications in sorghum or other bioenergy feedstocks will affect the plant protection against fungi and insects. brown midrib (bmr) sorghum lines will be used to reduce lignin content. Biotechnology will be used to increase lignin content. Surprisingly, our findings indicated bmr6 and bmr12 plants have increased resistance to some fungal pathogens. The research outlined herein will address to what extent modifying lignin content in sorghum will affect whether plant are susceptible to fungal or insect pests. We will determine the effects these modifications have on three insects: a sucking insect greenbugs, an aphid species, and chewing insects fall armyworms and corn earworms. Likewise, we will determine whether lignin modification affects the susceptibility of sorghum to three fungal pathogens that cause sorghum stalk rot, charcoal rot and anthracnose, which important and economically significant disease in sorghum. We will determine how plant which are significant more or less susceptible than normal sorghum changed in there chemical composition in order to improve bioenergy crops. The overall goal is to link steps in lignin metabolism to molecular changes and increased or decreased susceptible to these fungal pathogens or insects."

As more area comes under sorghum cultivation, maize and sorghum will be increasingly grown in close proximity or in fields previously sown with the other crop. This would result in both novel and increased disease pressures. The use of no-till farming methods would exacerbate the problem since these fungi are better able to survive on exposed debris. It is thus important that we evaluate the abilities of the native strains to colonize the non-host species and cause disease in immediate and surrounding areas. Colletotrichum graminicola and Colletotrichum sublineolum are able to infect and colonize sorghum and maize tissue sufficiently to increase disease pressure in the following season. Our goal is to have a better understanding of this process and to utilize the naturally occurring antifungal compounds in the sorghum plant body to minimize this impact. The project will develop sorghum lines that are less amenable to fungal colonization and survival."

To help meet these goals, conversion of high biomass sorghum into biofuels shows great promise. A negative outcome of biofuel production, however, would be to address near-term problems (over reliance on imported fossil fuels), while creating or aggravating longer-term problems (reduction in the productive capacity of soils). Field experiments, studies under laboratory conditions, and computer modeling will be used to accomplish our overall goal of developing advanced crop production systems utilizing improved nutrient management, crop rotation, and decreased soil tillage, among other practices, to increase carbon sequestration, mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and improve the sustainability of biomass sorghum feedstock production in the south central region. The integration of field and laboratory experiments and modeling will allow us to identify the relative importance of the different factors that influence biomass sorghum yield and quality, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, GHG emissions, and economic viability. The proposed research will accomplish these objectives and allow us to determine the carbon footprint of biomass sorghum production through a life cycle (cradle to grave) analysis."

Relative to conventional agricultural crops used for biofuel production, switchgrass and cottonwood have low nutrient and agricultural chemical requirements, which foster minimal fossil fuel expenditures associated with farm equipment. Additionally, switchgrass and cottonwood have high annual biomass growth rates, which promote C sequestration in biomass. Due to the deep, dense rooting habit of switchgrass and expansive rooting of cottonwood, these species may also foster long-term C storage in soils. For a comprehensive understanding of the potential of switchgrass and cottonwood management systems to sequester C, fluxes of C associated with these cropping/management systems need to be monitored throughout multiple harvesting cycles on a variety of sites. Monitoring of C sequestration and fluxes necessitates monitoring of : (1) above- and below-ground biomass C, (2) long-term storage forms of C in soil, (3) greenhouse gas emissions, and (4)  carbon costs  of feedstock production associated with fossil fuel emissions of equipment used in management and harvest activities. The objective of this proposed project is to monitor these phenomena throughout several harvesting cycles of switchgrass and the first harvesting cycle of cottonwood grown as monocultures and agroforests. We will also compare C sequestration and greenhouse gas emission of switchgrass and cottonwood cropping systems to that associated with a soybean-grain sorghum rotation in order to elucidate the potential impacts of the conversion of conventional cropping systems to biofuel feedstock production systems on C sequestration. This study would likely provide needed information for the development of agricultural policies associated with biofuel feedstock production in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV). This project has the potential to yield several improvements in the long-term sustainability of U.S. agriculture and food systems. Development of viable management systems for growing cottonwood and switchgrass crops for biofuel production on marginal soils of the LMAV will allow productive soils to remain in conventional agriculture to sustain food production capability of the region. Producing switchgrass and cottonwood in the LMAV could reduce nutrient transport in surface and subsurface waters due to the relatively low fertilizer needs of these crops and the lack of annual tillage and reestablishment that occurs with the annual crops currently grown on these soils. Adding switchgrass and cottonwood to the landscape of the LMAV can also contribute to improving C sequestration capacity of the region because switchgrass and cottonwood have higher C sequestration potential than conventional agricultural crops."

The reduced digestibility of sorghum seed relative to other grains makes it a less efficient resource, even though it is highly adapted to growth in semiarid environments common to Africa, India, and the Southern and Western Great Plains of the USA. There has been considerable interest in modifying the quality traits of grain sorghum using transgenic technology to enhance its nutritional value to both humans and animals raised for human consumption. Development of sorghums with improved digestibility traits is highly desirable, but using transgenic technology to accomplish this is implicitly risky because there are several related species capable of interbreeding with sorghum, and it is not clear whether those traits will make weedy relatives even weedier. There has been no research conducted to determine how likely these traits will be transferred (gene flow) to the weedy relative called shattercane, or if they were transferred, how they would affect subsequent generations of the weed (potential weediness). Lack of such knowledge is an important problem because it limits our fundamental understanding of gene transfer and potential hybridization between grain sorghum and shattercane. This limits our ability to assess the potential risks of introducing genetically modified grain sorghum into US agroecosystems. The proposed research will provide regulators the information needed to make science based decisions about several issues that may arise as a result of deploying genetically modified sorghum. Specifically, the proposed research will provide the baseline research to predict the probability of pollen-mediated gene flow from grain sorghum to shattercane and the potential for sorghum genes (traits) to become stable in the wild population. Our pollen-mediated gene flow results also will provide valuable information for identifying the appropriate isolation distance for managing the genetic purity of hybrid and elite inbred lines of grain sorghum. Finally, our results will be useful for developing good stewardship practices to minimize the escape of herbicide tolerant sorghums currently being developed using non-transgenic technologies."

The USDA and DOE are assessing and implementing technologies that will increase production of energy/fuel from biomass. To accomplish this goal, it will be necessary to produce, harvest, and process up to 1 billion tons of biomass from a range of sources including crop and forest residues and dedicated bioenergy crops such as switchgrass, Miscanthus and energy sorghum. Therefore, the proposed research is focused on the need to generate a large and sustainable supply of biomass at a sufficiently low cost to make biofuels generation from lignocellulose sustainable and profitable. The development of high yielding bioenergy crops such as energy sorghum will decrease the acreage required for biomass production, minimize food vs. biofuels land use trade-offs, reduce feedstock transportation costs and the cost of biomass per dry ton, while increasing biofuels carbon balance and sustainability. The specific goals of this project are to identify genes, QTL and biochemical pathways that modulate biomass yield and composition traits in energy sorghum, a promising drought tolerant bioenergy crop."

Each of these traits are impacted by the rate and timing of shoot maturation, the developmental process that controls the progression from the seedling to vegetative and then reproductive phases of growth. Increased expression of one key shoot maturation gene in maize, the Glossy15 gene, delays flowering and reduces grain yields, but also leads to greater accumulation of total biomass and stalk sugars relative to current commercial corn grain hybrids. Furthermore, the nitrogen requirements to maximize total biomass are much less for the hybrids with higher Glossy15 expression. The Glossy15 transgene can thus convert corn grain hybrids to a bioenergy crop similar to sweet or forage sorghums. Sorghum is a crop of global importance and is especially attractive as a versatile bioenergy feedstock, due to its high biomass yields and drought tolerance. In addition, because Sorghum is an annual with an existing agronomic infrastructure and seed industry, it could be readily scaled to flexibly meet market demands. The Sorghum genome sequence has recently become available, enabling the transfer of information developed in related species such as maize to Sorghum improvement. The specific goal of this project is to determine if changes in the Glossy15 gene system of Sorghum might contribute to current physiological differences among grain, sweet and biomass Sorghums, and whether the Sorghum Glossy15 gene can be used to convert superior Sorghum grain hybrids to cultivars enhanced for bioenergy production. Collectively, our results may lead to improved sorghum cultivars optimized for sustainable, low-cost production of biomass for lignocellulosic processing. Because Sorghum is a seeded annual crop that is already widely grown in the U.S. and world, it should be possible for any improved Sorghum genotypes produced in this project to be readily deployed as a sustainable bioenergy feedstock."

A study conducted at five locations across the state that included irrigated and non-irrigated sites found that tall wheatgrass and grass mixtures that contained tall wheatgrass provided superior quality for ethanol production compared to several other species evaluated including switchgrass. Tall wheatgrass also contained higher cellulose and had lower lignin amounts which would increase ethanol production efficiency. In a separate study, grass plots harvested every other year produced approximately 25% less biomass yield than grasses harvested annually. Several experiments were seeded in spring 2009 to evaluate the potential biomass yield of kenaf, sunnhemp, sorghums, and millets. Initial results found sorghum and kenaf have the potential to produce above 10 ton/acre of dry matter in one season and could be used as annual feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol production in ND. A study to evaluate production potential of 22 varieties of sorghum that included BMR (Brown Mid Rib) hybrids was conducted at two locations in ND. The BMR character confers reduced lignin content which increases digestibility with a resulting increase in ethanol production. Unfortunately, varieties that contained the BMR character had less biomass production than the same variety without BMR. Studies are in progress to evaluate to yield potential of grass and grass legume mixtures compared to grasses grown alone. The long-term goal is to produce more biomass and thus more ethanol per acre with reduced inputs. Examples of mixtures include intermediate and tall wheatgrass, wheatgrass, alfalfa and sweet clover, or basin and alti wildrye. Sugarbeet pulp is used as a feedstock for ethanol production. A solids fed batch approach has shown that loadings up to 12% solids allowed near maximum yields with increased sugar concentrations for subsequent ethanol conversion compared to higher or lower percentages. Invasion of cool season perennial grasses into established switchgrass fields has become a serious problem and decreases potential ethanol production. A total of four pre-emergent and 23 post-applied herbicides have been evaluated for efficacy on switchgrass, quackgrass, and smooth bromegrass. Of these nine were chosen for further evaluation for weed control in an established switchgrass field. Pyroxulam, sulfosulfuron, and aminocyclopyrachlor provided the best smooth bromegrass control while sulfometuron and propoxycarbazone were most effective for quackgrass control. None of these herbicides injured switchgrass. An empirical model based on a mathematical programming algorithm was developed to determine the optimal number, location, and size of cellulose ethanol plants in North Dakota to maximize the use of biomass produced in the state. The goal is to minimize transportation costs of biomass to the plant and of ethanol from the plant to blending facilities."

Decreasing our dependence on petroleum imports by developing a renewable and sustainable, domestic biofuels industry will stimulate the economy, increase energy security, improve air quality, and decrease emissions of fossil CO2 and other greenhouse gases. The conversion of cellulosic feedstocks into ethanol has been recognized as an essential component of the overall biofuel strategy in the U.S. A key factor in meeting the U.S. government's  20 in 10  goals is the development of feedstock crops that can be grown at high biomass yield densities and at the same time exhibit superior characteristics for conversion to fuels and valuable chemicals. Another important factor for consideration of meeting these nearer term goals (like 20 in 10) is the availability of a cellulosic dedicated energy crop where cultivation, production, and harvesting practices have already been established. Sorghum fits these near-term needs because the agronomic production infrastructure already exists and producers in much of the U.S. are already familiar with the crop. In addition, an annual crop will be critical as insurance to fill short-term gaps in production for biofuel processing plants. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is an attractive dedicated energy crop because of its high productivity, drought tolerance, well established production systems, its genetic diversity, and the availability of a genetic system that greatly facilitates a breeding program. In addition the genetic structure and plant biology of sorghum allows for application of relatively simple genetic analysis compared to the genetic structure of other bioenergy crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus. Because the sorghum genome is relatively small and closely related to many of the other potential bioenergy species, the genomic analysis described herein should be applicable to other bioenergy crops, such as Saccharum, Miscanthus and Panicum species. The goal of the proposed program is to enhance our understanding of crop composition on bioenergy conversion, using sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) as a model dedicated energy crop. Understanding the composition of this crop and its effect on conversion efficiency is crucial to the development of alternative energy sources. This will be accomplished by the agronomic evaluation of different sorghum types in several different production environments; biomass samples from each sorghum type will be collected from each location for compositional analysis and conversion using state of the art technologies. From this research, we expect to identify optimum sorghum genotypes for conversion."

Ecosystem services of primary interest are plant biomass production and soil C storage, and their responses to precipitation variability and invasive plant species (Sorghum halapense, Johnsongrass). The central hypothesis is that in the variable climate of the Southern Plains, low input multispecies grasslands will exhibit greater long-term mean plant biomass production, greater C storage, greater temporal stability in plant biomass production, and greater resistance to establishment of exotic invasive plant species than monocultures of switchgrass or coastal Bermuda managed for biomass production. The research will yield quantitative evaluations of ecosystem service provisions from these three perennial systems and will support development of predictive models of the future sustainability of ecosystem service provision. The results of this research will inform land managers, and ultimately improve environmental quality and human health by promoting multispecies perennial biomass production systems with long life cycles that provide multiple ecosystem services, reduced anthropogenic nitrogen use, and increased local and landscape scale biodiversity."

Plant ecosystems represent an important sink of carbon dioxide, helping to reduce the effects of carbon dioxide emissions from human activities. The degree to which plant ecosystems absorb carbon dioxide and use water is another related critical topic. Our studies are involved with examining the carbon dioxide exchange and water use from a variety of plant ecosystems, ranging from crops such as sorghum, to wildland riparian vegetation, to a 500 year old forest with towering trees. These studies show that careful attention must be paid to how carbon dioxide exchange and water use is measured, and yields guidelines about improving measurements of these important variables while also providing data on the exchange of carbon dioxide and water use of these ecosystems.

In addition, there are over 300,000 horses in Florida with an associated cash flow of $1.25 billion per year. Forage is a major component of the diet of all livestock in the state. Planted pastures occupy approximately 3.5 million acres and native grasslands (includes forestland that is grazed) another 6 million acres. In spite of their large contributions to the state?s economy, limitations remain among forages currently utilized in Florida. Bahiagrass, which is grown on approximately 2.5 million acres for forage, produces 85% of its yield during the period from April through September. Lack of cool-season production results in greater need for supplement feeds and increased cost to livestock producers. Bahiagrass also is relatively low in digestibility and this limits performance of animals consuming bahiagrass herbage. Bermudagrass, though highly desirable for hay production, requires high inputs and may not tolerate close, repeated grazing by horses. More persistent types would benefit horse owners. Warm-season annual grasses like sorghum and pearl millet are quite high in nutritive value, but they must be reseeded every year and they are difficult to manage under grazing. An alternative forage that is better suited for grazing yet also has high nutritive value would be an important advance, particularly if it was a perennial. Limpograss is becoming very important to beef cattle producers in South Florida, but new genotypes with greater persistence and increased digestibility would benefit livestock operations. Thus, there is a need for continued evaluation of potential new forage species and genotypes for Florida forage-livestock systems. This project will assess digestibility and grazing tolerance of bahiagrasses selected for greater cool-season production, measure yield and nutritive value of seeded bermudagrass compared to traditional hybrids, test Mulato brachiariagrass for adaptation and performance in North Florida, and assess grazing tolerance and digestibility of new breeder?s lines of limpograss."

Capture and retention of soil water plus supplemental irrigation can maximize limited irrigation resources. This research quantifies the water use and irrigation requirements of corn, winter wheat, grain sorghum and sunflower crops grown with optimum water management using all water conservation techniques available. The outcome is the potential reduction of irrigation requirements for more fully irrigated crops and increasing grain yields for limited irrigated crops. To make reductions in water use, irrigators are considering shifts in cropping patterns that earn better net economic returns. A decision planning tool, the Crop Water Allocator (CWA) finds optimum net returns from combinations of crops, irrigation amounts, and land allocations (crop rotations) that program users choose to examine. The model uses yield-irrigation relationships as a basis to estimate yields for particular rainfall zones. The user can customize the program with localized crop production costs or rely on default values from typical western Kansas farming operations. Determining the relative importance of the factors that influence the outcome of limited-irrigation management decisions can become complex. Commodity prices and government programs can fluctuate and change advantages for one crop relative to another. Water availability, determined by governmental policy or by irrigation system capacity, may also change with time. Precipitation probabilities influence the level of risk the producer is willing to assume. Production costs give competitive advantage or disadvantage to the crops under consideration. Producers with limited water supplies need to make decisions about pre-season irrigation, growing season irrigation start-ups, and end-of-season shut-off. These decisions, which have been called macro-management, potentially can affect irrigation water use to a greater extent than daily irrigation scheduling. Currently producers have little information for limited irrigation management guidance. The Crop Yield Predictor (CYP) integrates crop response, cost input, and economic consequences into decisions for limited irrigation. These macro-management decisions are complex, but the crop simulation process that provided the foundation for CWA can be used directly to aid these decisions. Simulations will be based on possible rainfall probabilities and patterns and user defined irrigation management. Inputs would define the users circumstances. Decisions could be based not only on crop yield results but also on net returns. Escalating energy costs and declining groundwater supplies have accelerated the need for irrigators to practice deficit irrigation management. Irrigators need guidance to select the combination of crops that provide the best economic return with optimum allocations of irrigation to each crop. Feedback sessions will be conducted for selected irrigators, crop consultants, and extension agents to evaluate the CWA and CYP decision aids."

While the majority of the produce is destined for use in cattle feed lot and poultry industry, a smaller portion is used as feedstock for ethanol production. The crop is better adapted to marginal growing conditions than most cereals and hence considered a good fit for Kansas. However, because it is grown mainly as rain fed crop, sorghum suffers from severe drought stress especially in the south western and central part of the State. Other a-biotic and biotic stresses such as cold temperature, grain and stalk rotting pathogens, competition by grass weeds and limited utilization of the crop are some of the barriers to increased productivity and competitiveness of the sorghum industry. Deployment of improved technologies that enhance crop performance under dry land condition and improve its utilization would enhance profitability and competitiveness of sorghum. Being one of the most genetically diverse species, there is high potential for genetic improvement of the crop through breeding. Key traits associated with post flowering drought tolerance have been identified. Genetic variants for high grain quality and enhanced protein and starch digestibility are well recognized. These sources can be utilized to develop parent lines and germplasm with superior grain quality, enhanced protein and starch digestibility, high carbohydrate fermentation efficiency and improved end-use quality to enhance the value of sorghum as food and feed grain. Moreover, in recent years sorghum has gained a growing popularity as potential gluten free food. These and the prospect for deployment of high biomass, sweet stalk and low lignin sorghum hybrids have boosted confidence for further enhancing the importance of the crop as food and feed grain. Modest investment in the genetic improvement of sorghum as food, feed and bio-energy crop and development of value added products are thought to accelerate the realization of these potentials and enhance profitability of the sorghum enterprise. In the next five years, we shall dedicate much of our efforts on improving the yielding potential of sorghum and enhancing its utilization as feed and food grain as well as bio-fuel feedstock. We shall focus on utilization of the existing genetic information and also identifying new genetic sources to develop new parent lines that are tolerant to drought and cold temperature stresses and also have enhanced resistance to grass weed herbicides and major diseases. The parent lines, germplasm and scientific information generated from this project will positively impact the sorghum industry by providing fresh raw materials for use by the industry for development of next generation hybrids. It will also impact the sorghum research community by providing grounds for future research to address production and utilization issues that are not fully addressed yet. Information on grain quality characteristics may serve as basis for consideration of sorghum for wider applications including gluten free foods and potential feedstock for brewery."

Recent increases in fertilizer prices have drawn attention to the use of manure as a nutrient source. Use of manure nutrients has potential to decrease fertilizer costs while maintaining productivity. Manure from Kansas livestock industries contains nearly 100 million lbs of recoverable nitrogen (N) and 65 million lbs of recoverable P2O5. Although the use of these nutrients could decrease input costs for producers, there are several road-blocks to the efficient use of manure-based nutrients. Not all of the N present in manure is available for crop uptake in the first year of application. The methods for estimating N availability are rough approximations. Furthermore, the nutrient content of manures is highly variable. The nitrogen content can change with feeding regimes, weather, collection methods, and storage methods. Manure application across a field can also be highly variable. All of these factors add to uncertainty in the manure N contribution to growing crops. Producers could supplement manure amended soils with fertilizer N, but determination of the in-season N rate is difficult due to the many factors affecting manure N availability. Plant sensors and optical remote sensors offer promising methods of adjusting in-season N rates. The objectives of this study are to i) calibrate an active remote sensor and chlorophyll meter for in-season adjustment of N recommendations for winter wheat and grain sorghum on soils receiving pre-plant manure applications, ii) evaluate manure-N availability determined according K-State extension publications to field measured data, and iii) determine the expected economic value of manure to grain producers in Kansas."

The agricultural industry diverts the largest amount of water on a worldwide basis, so it must take a leading role in achieving sustainable water use that will provide for both the growing need for food and the need for clean and safe water supplies. Most water planners and resource managers recognize that there will be no magic bullet that will remove all of the world?s or nation?s water problems. Instead there is a growing realization that it will take many tools working together to help avoid the significant disruption in the economies and societies grown accustomed to widespread irrigation use. Microirrigation is just one of the many irrigation and water management technology tools, but it is a tool that has several advantages. Microirrigation can reduce the waste of water to a negligible amount and the transport of contaminants to surface water and groundwater. Irrigation events can be fine-tuned to spoon feed water and nutrients just in time to avoid plant stress. It can optimize crop production (more crop per drop) and in many cases increase the quality of agricultural products. Some scientists, water planners, and resource managers have been disappointed with the rate of adoption in microirrigation. The U.S. land area that is microirrigated varies on an annual basis but during the last 10 years has hovered in the range of 3 to 4% of the total irrigated area. It is recognized that some crops and locations are not physically or economically suitable for microirrigation, but this is probably the exception rather than a common situation. Although microirrigation is expensive, there is a growing realization that leaders in the farming community can and will adopt and adapt cutting-edge technologies when given the knowledge and incentives to do so. This is evidenced in the tag line of the recent USDA-NRCS Conservation Security Program (CSP) which is ?reward the best and motivate the rest.? In this project, the Kansas effort will be a combination of new field and laboratory research, synthesis of existing results into publications and website material suitable for public use and educational efforts in the form of workshops, conferences and in-service trainings related to subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) for the typical irrigated crops (corn, soybean, sunflower, alfalfa and grain sorghum) grown in the region. The expected impacts of the project are that Kansas and regional producers will have an increased familiarity with SDI and the techniques needed to ensure its success, that improved design and water and nutrient management procedures for SDI will allow broader penetration of microirrigation into non-traditional microirrigation regions of the country, that economic losses associated with microirrigation system failures due to maintenance issues will be reduced. Comparisons of alternative irrigation systems will allow growers to make the best system choice for their operations and will allow them to optimize performance of existing systems"

This research project is to refine three technological advances (transgenic crops, host plant resistance, and chemical insecticides) for managing major insect pests of corn and small grains to ensure sustainable production of these crops in Louisiana. Sugarcane borer (SCB) is the dominant corn borer pest in many areas of the mid-south region. Information that can support the use of Bt corn for controlling SCB is limited. This study will validate two key prerequisites of the high dose and refuge insect resistance management (IRM) strategy for SCB. Selected Bt-corn hybrids will be evaluated to determine if commercial Bt-corn qualify as high dose against SCB. Bt resistance frequency in SCB will be estimated with novel screening methods to validate if the frequency is sufficiently low to meet the requirements for the IRM strategy. Susceptibility of Bt-susceptible and -resistant SCB to novel Bt proteins will be determined to identify new Bt toxins that can overcome the known Bt resistance. This study will provide information necessary to support and improve the Bt-corn IRM and ensure the long-term success of Bt corn in the mid-southern region. A new pest, Moodna bisinuella, was recently discovered in Louisiana corn fields. It could represent a potential threat to corn and grain sorghum in the state. In this project, growth, development, and reproduction of M. bisinuella will be studied in the laboratory. In addition, crop damage and yield losses caused by this pest will be determined in the field. Results from these studies will generate essential information needed for managing this invasive pest. In recent years, significant SCB damage on sorghum was reported in Louisiana. Effective insecticides are not available for controlling sorghum insect pests in the state. In this project, occurrence and damage of SCB on different sorghum varieties will be evaluated to identify tolerant varieties for managing SCB. The widespread adoption of reduced tillage practices has increased the probability and severity of soil and seeding insect problems of corn and sorghum in Louisiana. In this study, novel chemical insecticides will be evaluated in south Louisiana to develop effective chemical control strategies for managing soil and insect pests in early plant stages of corn and grain sorghum in this area. Recently, Hessian fly seriously damaged wheat in some areas in Louisiana. Little research has been conducted in Louisiana on management strategies. In addition, the species and occurrence of aphids on wheat in Louisiana have not been fully investigated. In this study, resistance of common wheat varieties and several chemical control technologies will be evaluated in field trials. Data generated from this study will be used to develop effective strategies for managing Hessian fly and aphids for Louisiana wheat growers to support sustainable wheat production systems."

California leads the nation in the production of orchids, both as cut flowers and potted flowering plants. It is important to maintain this leadership through research on flower senescence, the molecular biology basis of flower through seed development, and disease resistance that benefits the floriculture industry, as well as indirectly other commercially important flower crops. The California floriculture industry is a $ billion USD industry. California leads the nation in the sale of potted flowering plants, including orchids as the number one commodity. In addition, California employment is boosted by the production of orchids, especially in the leading producing counties of San Diego, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Luis Obispo, and others (CDFA Report 2008-2009, Agricultural Statistics Review). Other public sectors that will benefit include allied suppliers, equipment and greenhouse manufacturers, orchid-related businesses, families of commercial orchid grower employees, researchers, students that receive fellowships to work on orchids, orchid organizations, and the consumers. In short, the proposed project will provide fundamental and practical knowledge to benefit the public welfare in an integrated manner. This will support the production of orchids with lasting quality and by overall supporting the floriculture industry. In the larger context, scientific knowledge will be advanced that could result in improvement of a broader range of commodity crops, including other floral crops, and food crops such as rice, wheat, sorghum, barley and maize (all monocots)."

Insect management is highly relevant and dynamic in these systems, both in terms of current pest challenges and the evolving strategies used in insect management. The objectives and expected outcomes/impacts are addressed in a step-wise fashion. Objective A (Improve understanding of plant - insect interactions) forms the foundation for determining the research path for development and refinement of management strategies. Work will include developing insect sampling methods, and obtaining data on distribution, abundance, and damage potential of insects in current and experimental crop technologies and management systems. Specific research will be guided by local issues and developing strategies from companion disciplines, current status of research, and early assessment on the likely path for developing insect management strategies for a particular pest management question. The next two objectives represent a branching of research activities in which findings from objective one will guide work along one or both paths. One branch, Objective B (Develop and integrate pest management decision support into crop management systems), aims to establish best use practices for management tools that are typically applied seasonally. Work on this objective will involve development of decision support aids (i.e., rules for use of insecticide and other in-season management tools) that can be integrated into crop management systems and delivered through innovative educational approaches in partnership with AgriLife Extension and industry. The other research branch, Objective C (Contribute to area-wide approaches to insect management), focuses more in evaluating the associations of land and agricultural features to insect species composition, distribution, and abundance. These data will be used to propose landscape-oriented work that can distinguish region-scale and farm-scale contributions to pest risk assessment and mitigation. The aim is to contribute to area-wide methods to measure risk in current and emerging systems, and to advise local (farmers) and regional (agencies) land managers how land management approaches can affect and reduce pest risk. Overall, the project works under the premise that a variable pest pressure situation is best addressed by strategic inputs well suited to the local agricultural community when pest pressure is high, as identified by local and regional pest risk assessment systems. When justified through understanding of plant-insect interactions, area-wide pest management approaches based on vegetation management (i.e., composition and structure of current and evolving crop management systems) are an excellent companion to local approaches and often improve the sustainability and longevity of pest management systems."

Current biomass production needs to be increased by a significant margin to relieve pressure off the cultivated land. This project aims to contribute to the molecular understanding of biomass production by dissecting the genetic pathways that lead to higher total biomass accumulation in C4 grasses of biofuel importance primarily sorghum and switchgrass. The overall objective of the research is to understand genetic networks of key developmental programs that significantly contribute to total biomass production, and subsequently manipulate biomass for biofuel feedstock improvement. The program will focus on C4 grasses using sorghum as a model and switchgrass as the main target species, but molecular genetic information will be integrated from other well studied species including Arabidopsis, Medicago, rice, and maize. We aim to uncover major genetic control points and identify key transcription factors that invoke a systems level response in C4 grass developmental programs. We are targeting four major but interconnected plant developmental programs; leaf development, flowering time, plant height, and tiller number, which are all critically important for understanding total biomass accumulation. We also plan to develop a functional genomics tool in sorghum which will help us to discover key biomass regulatory genes and genetic networks in both sorghum and switchgrass and other C4 grasses. We will employ transformation, biochemical, cellular, genetic, and genomic approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of these developmental programs and their interactions with the environment thereby to manipulate biomass for increased feedstock productivity. When these projects are successfully completed, we expect to have: 1) a better understanding of the genes and genetic pathways that control total biomass production in sorghum and switchgrass, 2) a comprehensive understanding of the leaf lamina expansion pathway in plants, 3) molecular markers that can be used for biomass in switchgrass breeding programs, 4) optimized transformation procedure for switchgrass and a potentially higher biomass producing transgenic switchgrass, and 5) a deletion population derived comprehensive forward and reverse genetics tool in sorghum for functional genomics studies in C4 grasses."

Among them, hemipterans are responsible for transmitting 55% of vectored viruses. Often, the vector insect is also a plant pest causing yield damage. In many cases, the only strategy available to control the spread of the disease is the avoidance of vector populations by the use of insecticides. This strategy poses problems such as the risk of development of resistance in insect populations, the pollution generated by pesticides and the cost associated with their use. Novel economically and environmentally friendly control strategies are possible but their development needs a deep understanding of the biology of the vector and the relationship between the plant pathogen and its vector. To develop these strategies the vector components involved in pathogen transmission, the effect of the pathogen on the vector fitness and biology or the route used by the pathogen through the vector need to be known. The development of these new strategies will result in the reduction of the use of pesticides with consequences on the environment, on farmers' economy and farmers' quality of life. These new strategies will contribute in the long term to the control of the spread of plant diseases; however, in the meantime adapted approaches to control the vector populations can be developed. We propose to aid in the development of these new adapted control strategies in vector insects causing damages to crops. Specifically, we will concentrate our initial efforts studying potato psyllids (Bactericera cockerelli) and greenbugs (Schizaphis graminum). The potato psyllid is responsible for the transmission of the causative agent of Zebra Chip, a disease affecting solanaceous. Plants infected with the causative agent of Zebra Chip show reduced yield and/or unmarketable potatoes. Questions as basic as the pathway of the pathogen within the vector body remain unanswered. In the mean time, this disease is costing millions of dollars annually. Similarly, the greenbug aphid is a severe cereal pest damaging crops worldwide. The annual cost this pest generates in crop losses and chemical control is estimated to be $250 million for wheat farmers and $125 million for sorghum farmers. Greenbugs are responsible for the transmission of several viruses, among them members of the Luteoviridae family causing Barley yellow disease. Arthropod-resistant plant cultivars exist but new aphid biotypes capable of overcoming plant resistance threatens their use. The research on the transmission of luteovirids by aphids has advanced rapidly these last years however, the involvement of any aphid proteins in virus transmission has not been identified yet. Today, genomic databases for different hemipterans exist or are being created. The use of these databases will prove essential tools for the development of new control strategies and improved diagnostic abilities. We propose to use genomic tools to identify competence factors in the two previously described systems: potato psyllid- Candidatus liberibacter and greenbug- luteovirids."

The major producers of tropical and subtropical crops are in developing countries and hundreds of millions of people depend on these plants for their livelihood. Compared with temperate crops, tropical and subtropical crops were underexploited due to limited resources available for tropical and subtropical crop research. Genomic approaches have been proven effective in understanding the genetic base of productivity and quality that are needed to solve the major problems that limit agricultural productivity. Due to its mild climate, over 40 crops are produced in the Rio Grand Valley, primarily tropical and subtropical crops, such as sugarcane, grain sorghum, and citrus. About one third of the Valley population depends on employment in Agriculture. However, the agricultural production in the Valley has been threatened by drought, unusual cold winter, and newly emerging diseases. Developing diversified, disease-resistant, and stress-tolerant crops became the top priorities. We proposed to use genetic and genomic tools to understand the genetic base of productivity and quality of tropical and subtropical crops, such as sugarcane, papaya, and pineapple. Specifically, we are going to characterize sugarcane genome structure and develop molecular markers associate with biomass and drought tolerance; identify and characterize candidate genes modifying flesh understand the evolutionary forces governing the formation and divergence of sex chromosomes in papaya and Caricaceae family; construct a high density genetic map of pineapple for genome sequencing and marker-assisted selection. The outcomes will significantly facilitate tropical and subtropical crop improvement."

Riethoven, collaborator, University of NebraskaMitochondria and chloroplasts serve as bioenergetic focal points of the cell, compartmenting the metabolic underpinnings of cellular function. Likewise, they act as key environmental stress sensors, and are vital to processing plant defense responses.  Yet, their integration to a systems model for the plant cell has been complicated by inability to perturb their functions with adequate specificity.  This research team has implemented an elegant approach to alter mitochondrial and chloroplast properties that focuses on manipulation of a single nuclear gene, MSH1 (MutS homolog 1).  Loss of MSH1 function produces organelle changes to condition distinct plant growth phenotypes without altering genotype of the plant.   These include dramatic changes in growth rate, flowering time, reproduction, chloroplast development, and biotic and abiotic stress responses.  it is postulated, as the central hypothesis to this research, that the msh1-associated organelle alterations cause heritable, programmed changes to the plant epigenome.  The planned investigations capitalize on recent key observations involving MSH1, and implement cross-species comparative analysis in transcript profile-based dissection of emergent phenotypes.  The project tests for msh1 effects on small RNA and DNA methylation changes, using Arabidopsis as an initial model for future tests in sorghum and soybean.  The collaboration combines expertise in organelle biology, quantitative genetics, epigenetics and next-gen sequence technologies to investigate the influence of organelle signals on the plant epigenome.  These studies address major unanswered questions in biology regarding the mode of trans-generational transmission of stress signals and the role of organelles as stress sensing components of the plant cell.Broader impacts.  Since Darwin's time, geneticists have speculated about the underlying basis of hybrid vigor and trans-generational adaptations to stress.  While more recent evidence has suggested an epigenetic nature to these phenomena, direct investigation of the process linking bioenergetic or environmental sensing with epigenetic programs in the cell has generally been intractable.  The system we investigate may prove invaluable in addressing these processes.  Consequently, this research could have important implications for the plant breeding process and for our understanding of plant defense and adaptation.  These studies will incorporate high school and undergraduate students in summer research activities, as part of our program to encourage careers in science research."

However, we know little about how this R gene diversity is generated, and agriculture might benefit enormously if we can learn from the natural diversity-generation process how to more rapidly create R genes with specificities to newly problematic plant diseases. This project investigates the recombinational instability of NBS-LRR genes in sorghum, in a situation where a novel form of site-specific recombination appears to be generating high levels of functional R gene diversity. The project proposes to identify the environmental and genetic factors that determine the specificity and rate of this unequal recombination. Once these studies are completed, the resultant knowledge and biological materials will allow a much better understanding and more efficient generation of R gene diversity that can be used in overcoming plant diseases in both agricultural and natural environments."

Research in plant feedstock genomics is well positioned to contribute to bioenergy production by combining the merits of established plant breeding and germplasm improvement approaches with cutting-edge genomics strategies. Two essential components of accelerated biomass crop improvement are the understanding and exploitation of genetic diversity and of the genotype-phenotype relationship. Assessment of genetic diversity provides germplasm and information on an array of trait characteristics for systematic integration and exploitation. A robust genotype-phenotype relationship allows predictive approaches for efficient and cost-effective breeding, superior allele mining, and introgression on a gene/genomic region basis. The proposed research integrates several key genomics-assisted strategies into biomass sorghum research (i.e., selective phenotyping, genomic selection, and association mapping) and combines these genetic strategies with a high-throughput phenotyping method (i.e., near infrared spectroscopy for biomass composition) and traditional field-based phenotyping experiments. With available genome sequence and other genetic resources, much less complex genome than many other biomass crops, diploid inheritance, established cultural practices, and plant breeding history, sorghum is well positioned to be a model species for genomics-assisted biomass crop improvement. Specifically, the proposed research will address five important questions in plant feedstock genomics and sorghum biomass improvement research: 1. How do we tap into the vast plant germplasm collections for biomass crop improvement 2. How do we narrow down the list of potential germplasm to be evaluated 3. How do we increase the information contained in genotypic and phenotypic data for the selected germplasm so that this information can generate maximum knowledge to enrich our understanding of the germplasm and genotype-phenotype relationship 4. How do we leverage a high-throughput phenotyping method such as NIR to facilitate plant breeding and genetics studies 5.

The lesser grain borer (LGB) is a devastating, long-lived pest of stored wheat, corn and other cereal grains in the US and other parts of the world. Adults and larvae are voracious feeders causing damaged kernels, insect fragments in milled products, powdery residues (frass), a characteristic pungent odor, price discounts, and possible rejection of commodity. The LGB can penetrate many types of packaging material including seed sacks in addition to sound grain. Grain production, storage, and processing are important industries. More than 12 billion bushels of corn and wheat are grown in the US each year with a value exceeding $25 billion. Additionally, over a billion bushels of barley, oats, rice, rye, and sorghum are grown each year with a value over $3 billion. It has been estimated that 5-10% of stored grain in developed countries and 35% of stored grain in developing countries is lost to insect damage. Because of the extensive reach of this insect, there is also very broad societal benefit in achieving widespread use of effective sensors for detecting the insects early. Estimates of the cost of grain loss due to insect, mold, and mycotoxin damage to the 15 billion bushels of grain stored in the US each year have ranged from $500 million to more than $1 billion. Domestic flour millers have a low tolerance for live insects: their presence signs of insect feeding can result in grain rejection. Rejection produces additional fumigation and transportation expenses, as much as 10-20% of the grain value. The foundation of a successful integrated pest management (IPM) program is an effective monitoring system. SDC declares that it can provide that foundation with its sensor device. SDC has two objectives in this proposal: 1) Modify the preliminary prototype device for LGB detection, using basic and applied knowledge, and compare its performance and efficacy with current methods in a field test and 2) Demonstrate uniqueness and the concentration levels of marker pheromones associated with infestations of the LGB. SDC's hypothesis is that specific organic volatiles can be good markers to differentiate insects infesting stored crops from other harmless emanations, e.g. gases associated with normal crop odor, or other MVOCs. Marker biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from this insect, the aggregation pheromones dominicalene 1 and dominicalene 2, are found in sufficient concentrations in the headspace in enclosures containing these insects to permit detection with SDC's highly sensitive and selective sensor device. SDC is confident that this work will result in a complete sensor device that can be used effectively to detect BVOCs from lesser grain borers, relate those BVOCs to LGB infestation size, and provide the information needed by farmers and elevator operators to take action to prevent infestation growth in our food and feed supply."

(NP 301, C4, PS 4B).Approach:Developmental profiles of various phytohormones in developing seeds of normal (wild type) and several carbohydrate mutants of known genetic bases in maize will be developed using high throughput chemical approaches, including gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC-MS).  Contemporary genomic approaches will be used to identify genes that are critical to sugar-hormone cross-talk, especially those related to hormone metabolism, transcription factors and proteins that function as receptors and/or response factors. Such genes in developing seeds will be further analyzed in expression studies using both microarray and single gene approaches to dissect gene networks that may control normal seed development and sink strength, the two most critical components of crop yields. Gene discovery studies based on transcriptome and proteome approaches will be initiated to obtain a functional genomic profile of the Basal Endosperm Transfer Layer (BETL), a highly specialized cell layer known be critical for transport and signaling functions in developing seeds. The emphasis in studying pollen biogenesis in sorghum is to understand the base for defective biochemical, molecular and physiological processes (including aberrations in sugar-starch metabolism) associated with heat stress and cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). Profiles of differentially expressed genes that characterize the expression of CMS, the restoration of male fertility and heat-induced pollen inviability will be obtained and analyzed through contemporary transcriptome and proteome technologies.1d. Novel maize peptides associated with pathogen attack will be identified through mining the maize genome sequence for homologs of the defense-regulating peptide AtPep1. Peptides will be biochemically isolated and/or synthesized and applied to manipulate and probe mechanisms of maize defense responses.  Genes induced by biotic attack or peptide treatment will be identified through microarray experiments and expression patterns will be characterized and quantified through real-time PCR analysis.  Chemical defenses and metabolites induced by biotic attack and/or peptide treatment will be characterized and measured by HPLC, LC-MS, GC-MS and NMR.  Differences in gene expression or defense metabolite accumulation in different maize varieties will be assessed using resistant versus susceptible cultivars. The effects of peptide-induced defenses on invading organisms will be assessed through in vivo pathogenicity assays, and in vitro antimicrobial assays.  Assays of in vivo and in vitro effects of maize defense responses on mycotoxin production will also be examined through LC-MS and GC-MS.  Transgenic plants with knocked out or enhanced expression of candidate signaling genes will be used to delineate signaling mechanisms regulating defense responses to biotic stress."

The genetic basis of drought tolerance is ascribed to quantitative trait loci (QTL). Therefore, we propose to utilize the following approaches to map QTL and to identify genes that control the components of drought tolerance. First, traits that potentially contribute to drought tolerance will be identified. The next step is to develop methods to measure the trait and to determine under what conditions trait analysis is best carried out. Following this, information concerning genetic variability of the trait in sorghum germplasm is assessed. If significant genetic variation in the trait is observed, then segregating populations are established, and standard genetic approaches are taken to carry out QTL analysis. In some cases the importance of the trait make it useful to identify genes corresponding to QTL in order to understand underlying mechanisms that regulate trait expression and to provide information and biomaterials useful for further trait engineering."

Through the use of DNA fingerprinting technology, it is now possible to identify and track the spread and origin of new pathogen races, and to identify multiple, unique resistance genes that can be combined to provide more stable resistance. Here, most of the research will be geared toward sorghum, which in addition to being an important grain crop for feeding animals, is gaining attention for its potential as a feedstock for biofuels. The project will identify and tag new genes for resistance to anthracnose, downy mildew and head smut and will provide background information useful in combating ergot, a dieses for which no resistance genes have been identified. DNA-based tags will also be sought that can be used to identify different pathotypes of the fungi that cause these diseases so that resistance gene deployment can be optimized.

The semi-arid subtropical climate imposes heat and drought stress environments that interact with pathogens, insects and other biological and environmental constraints to limit profitable production to only a few crops with the primary ones being sorghum, corn and cotton. Soilborne pathogens like Macrophomina phaseolina (charcoal stalk rot) in corn and sorghum and Aspergillus flavus (pre-harvest aflatoxin) in corn are significant in this region because climatic and soil factors favor their occurrence under the drought stress environments common to this region during crop growth. Since 2001, sorghum down mildew has become a re-emerging disease in some South Texas production regions after a seed treatment fungicide became ineffective on the early season systemic phase of the disease derived from soilborne oospores of Peronosclerospora sorghi. Sorghum ergot caused by Claviceps africana is a new disease to this region and the U.S. since 1997 with the greatest threat being to commercial hybrid seed production fields in the High plains region of Texas. Survival of the pathogen in South Texas and yearly, seasonal spread to the seed production fields is an ongoing concern. Aerial imaging provides an increasingly valuable tool to map seasonal progression of cotton root rot which has been a limiting factor in cotton production in many areas of Texas since the crop was first grown. Aerial image maps can locate fields and field areas at greatest risk to cotton root rot and will aid in precision application of disease controls including fungicides and it will also assist in assessment of control efficacy. Knowledge about the biology, ecology, survival, spread, and variability of major plant pathogens and how they interact with physical and biological environments and their crops hosts provides information that can be exploited to develop warranted controls. Development and implementation of appropriate controls for economically-damaging disease pathogens complements and conserves existing and newly developed host plant resistance in the primary crops. An integrated disease control approach provides for the most efficient and sustainable disease management system to maximize crop production and reduce disease risks."

In general, Industry statistics (ORIL, 2003 and 2008) indicate a continual increase in stocking rate due to loss of farmland to alternate uses and suggest that pasture production has been negatively affected by the drastic reduction in fertilizer use (personal communication). To prevent future instability it is necessary to maximize the productivity and quality of local forages, to reduce the dependency on commercial concentrates, and maximize the efficiency of their use for milk production. The main objective of the proposed research is to develop supplementation strategies to foster improved milk production and efficiency of concentrate use by dairy cows grazing tropical pastures. Two multiyear trials will study the effect of varying the level of concentrate supplementation and stocking rate at pasture on milk production, and concentrate use for milk production. One trial will consider levels of concentrate supplementation to Holstein cows grazing at high stocking rates. A second trial will evaluate concentrate supplementation to Holstein cows grazing mixed tropical grasses after PM milking, and receiving forage supplementation in semi-confinement, after AM milking. A second objective will be to evaluate high quality sorghums as a forage supplement for dairy cows in the tropics. Sorghum, due to its high yield, low water needs and adaptability to the local climate, should be a good alternative to supplement the ration of grazing cows. Sorghum varieties such as brown midrib (BMR) varieties are of high quality, in many cases comparable to corn. Therefore, four commercial high quality sorghums and  millo blanco , a local variety, will be evaluated for DM yield, nutritive value, and silage quality. The best performing sorghum variety and  millo blanco  silages will be evaluated in a feeding trial with lactating dairy cows. In another trial, sorghum silage will be evaluated as a forage supplement to lactating cows grazing mixed tropical grasses at high stocking rates. These adaptable sorghum varieties could supplement dairy cows grazing at high stocking rates, balancing their diets and stimulating greater DM consumption. Results from this project will facilitate the process of making recommendations to local dairy producers on how to improve milk yield and efficiency of concentrate use for milk production under conditions of high stocking rates."

Five major grain crops are grown on approximately 2.26 million ha each year in Arkansas with an estimated annual value of $2.84 billion. With the exception of soybean, yields of these crops in Arkansas are very close to, or exceed, average national yields (Table 1). Although crop yields for Arkansas are generally close to the national average, these yields for soybean, corn, grain sorghum, and wheat are approximately one-half of their yield under optimum conditions. In the absence of biotic limitations (such as pathogens), there are four essential resources required for crop growth and yield: (1) an adequate water and (2) nutrient supply, (3) solar radiation to drive photosynthetic processes, and (4) adequate time during a growing season (frost-free for warm-season crops) for plant development. The primary limitation for yield of soybean, corn, and grain sorghum is adequate and timely water availability. The most obvious method of increasing yield under water-limited conditions is to irrigate, and, indeed irrigation is an important aspect of Arkansas' crop production systems. For soybean, 75% of the crop is irrigated and yield due to irrigation usually ranges 30 to 50% over the nonirrigated crop. Although statistical data are not available for corn and grain sorghum crops in Arkansas, similar yield responses to irrigation would be expected. Despite obvious yield benefits, irrigation may be limited by initial costs of investment, pumping facilities, aquifer depth, quality of water, and competition of irrigation water by other crops. Therefore, there is a need to develop management systems and genetic resources that can efficiently utilize irrigation and rainfall resources for crop production. Genetic variability for all of the five major grain crops listed in Table 1 are great. Our current breeding, management, and Extension programs at the University of Arkansas are focused on using genetic resources that fit well within current management systems. Extending the germplasm pool that we use in Arkansas may be accomplished in two ways. First, high-yielding cultivars (or hybrids) may be available from other regions that can be used effectively in Arkansas for increasing utilization of specific resources. For example, using short-season crops from the northern U.S. may enable farmers in the Midsouthern U.S. to avoid late-season drought. Secondly, specific traits may be available in germplasm collections that when combined with adapted, high-yielding cultivars (or hybrids) would provide increased efficiency in resource utilization."

Worldwide it is an important cereal crop grown for food, feed, and ethanol production. In the United States, total sorghum production ranks only behind maize, soybean, and wheat. Sorghum is well adapted to grow in harsher environments where other crops fail to thrive. Sorghum is also tolerant to many abiotic stresses that plague other cereals including heat, flooding, and drought. These traits have driven the interest in utilizing sorghum as a dedicated energy crop in the US. However, as a warm season cereal, sorghum is susceptible to colder temperatures. At present, a major limiting factor in sorghum production is low air and soil temperatures. Sorghum germinates optimally at soil temperatures of 21 degree C or greater. In the Midwest, low soil and air temperatures in the early spring greatly reduces germination, emergence, and early seedling growth. Making tolerance to cold and freezing two highly desirable traits for increased US sorghum production. Cold and freeze tolerance allows for early season planting and stand establishment allowing for multiple harvests. To date limited there is limited information on QTLs for cold and freeze tolerance a major QTL for early seedling cold tolerance hasn't been identified. Cold tolerance has been identified in several landraces from temperate regions of China. These landraces however carry many unfavorable agronomic traits along with the cold tolerance. So it is necessary to formulate a strategy to dissect and transmit the cold tolerance trait from these landraces into elite agronomic lines. The objectives of the study is to identify markers associated with various traits for early season cold and freeze tolerance and identify new germplasm sources of cold and freeze tolerance. These objectives will be studied through the cross between Tx430 (cold and freeze susceptible) and CT19 (cold and freeze tolerant) recombinant inbred lines. Phenotyping of the population will be conducted in optimized conditions of 25 degree C and Cold temperature of 10 degree c where germination percentages will be scored at seven days at optimal conditions and 14 days at cold conditions.

Recently, the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis, has emerged as an important corn pest in the southern U.S. Other significant stalk-boring pests include the common stalk borer, Papaipema nebris, hop vine borer, Hydraecia immanis, and potato stem borer, Hydraecia micacea. Since 1950, previous committees have focused on ECB and other stalk-boring lepidopteran corn pests. In addition to stalk borers, we propose to address the other lepidopteran corn pests, which include those that feed on corn leaves and ears. This is a natural progression for the committee, as these pests are increasing in economic importance. Corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea, and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, consume corn leaves, tassels, silk and kernels. In the southeastern U.S., losses attributed to corn earworm in field corn range from 1.5-16.7%, and sweet corn losses can be as high as 50% (Wiseman 1999). Black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon, is the most damaging of the cutworm complex in the Corn Belt. Stand loss over 25% and yield losses of about 2,900 kg/ha are not unusual (Showers et al. 1983, Showers 1999). Western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta, increasingly is a pest of corn ears across the north central region. Outcomes or projected Impacts: -Cumulative benefits to Bt and non-Bt maize due to a suppressed European corn borer population during 13 growing seasons are conservatively estimated at more than $6.1 billion for a 5-state region, with cumulative benefits to non-Bt maize accounting for almost $3.9 billion of this total. -An improved program for monitoring for European corn borer resistance to Bt corn would help safeguard Bt technology for growers. -Blended seed refuge would increase grower productivity across the Corn Belt and reduce the likelihood that European corn borer would develop resistance to Bt corn. -Growers and consultants will have practical methods to monitor for western bean cutworm adults so they can initiate field scouting and avoid undue economic loss to either the pest itself or the increased mycotoxin contamination it might cause. -Online publication of outputs will expand clientele access to corn insect IPM decision support tools and increase implementation of IPM for corn lepidopteran pests."

In recent years, and particularly during the U.S. financial crisis, the convergence between futures and cash prices has been of concern to decision makers in the grain industry. The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), for instance, submitted its views to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2008, stating their concerns about  effective performance of futures exchanges as mechanisms for price discovery and risk management.  The AFBF's concerns were extreme price volatility, expanding and volatile cash/futures basis relationships, and the difficulty hedgers have of meeting margin calls (margins are the deposits farmers must keep with brokers to offset adverse futures market price movements). The AFBF expressed its belief in the importance of the functions of futures markets but requested more disclosure and transparency around the composition of traders in the markets and their impact on the price discovery and risk management function of futures markets. These concerns bring forth research questions of interest to the grain industry in Louisiana. Numerous questions arise, and some that are of immediate local interest are: is the convergence of cash and futures prices reliable Are basis forecasts reliable How useful are basis forecasts in setting local cash prices What is the dynamic interaction between speculative activity and price volatility Local grain elevators provide sellers of grain crops (producers) bids for various crops such as wheat, corn, soybeans and grain sorghum. Conditional on historical bid-offers, what are the chances that a producer will be offered a better bid This project proposes econometric and statistical models to provide a quantitative answer to such questions. This information would be beneficial to the local grain industry in understanding price discovery in futures and their usefulness in setting local prices for their grain crops."

In fact, the very existence and diversity of wild plants could be attributed to mycorrhizae that might have helped host plants to adapt to harsh environments. The mineral nutrition requirements and benefits derived from mycorrhizal hardwood trees are very well understood and exploited by the forest industry. However, the influence of mycorrhizal symbiosis in host plant adaptation to temperature and water stress in agronomic crops has not been explored to a great extent. Sorghum (Sorghum vulgaris) is known to form mycorrhizal relations with at least two soil-borne fungi, Glomus intraradices and Gigaspora margarita. However, the symbiotic association of sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) with fungi has not been recorded. This is in light of the fact that the osmotic relations and draught tolerance assessment of varied mycorrhizal crop plants has been detailed in the literature. The proposed research explores the potential of mycorrhizal sweet sorghum to withstand extreme temperatures and a combined salt and water stress conditions. Since sweet sorghum is grown in many parts of the world that have arid to semi-arid climate, and serves as a staple diet in those regions, it would be significant to explore how mycorrhizae would improve adaptation of the host plant to the aforementioned stressors while maintaining acceptable yield."

Major increases in the yield, quality, and disease/pest resistance of maize, wheat, and rice have occurred in the last 50 years due to conventional breeding, improved agricultural management practices, and transgenic technologies. However, to meet growing worldwide food and potentially biomass needs, production needs to be further increased. One approach to improve breeding practices is through accelerated or targeted breeding approaches such as marker assisted selection which relies on molecular markers to facilitate selection of improved lines in a breeding program. With the advent of genomics, including next generation sequencing technologies and bioinformatics, genome sequences and molecular markers can be generated in not only a high throughput but also in a cost effective manner. Providing data and research tools to plant breeders and biologists that enable genomic-based plant breeding will be essential to improved agriculture in the 21st century."

Maize-based ethanol cannot supply the total biofuel demand and it has detrimental implications for food and feed supplies. Therefore, other sources need to be developed to efficiently produce ethanol in large scale, such as lignocellulosic feedstock and/or sucrose producing crops. The main goal of this project is to conduct research that leads to and supports development of sorghum germplasm for biofuel production adapted to Iowa. Sorghum was selected due to its high productivity potential and multiple uses as a substrate for ethanol production. Sorghum can be used to produce ethanol from grain, stover, sugars accumulated in the stems or as a biomass crop. The first objective of this project is to initiate a sorghum breeding program at Iowa State University for biofuel production. Since yield is the most important trait to be improved in every breeding program, increasing biomass and/or sugar yield will also be the main goal in the ISU sorghum breeding program. Several traits impact yield and crop performance. Three of those traits with major effects on biomass and sugar yield will be investigated in objectives 2, 3, and 4: a) plant height; b) sugar production in hybrid sweet sorghums and c) cold tolerance at germination. Plant height is directly related to biomass yield and it is mostly determined by hormones. Genes of three groups of hormones affecting plant height and other characteristics will be characterized. Sweet sorghum produces soluble sugars in the stem that can be processed to ethanol. Sweet sorghums have been commercialized as cultivars for decades but sweet sorghum hybrids were not developed. Biofuels represent a powerful driving force to initiate the comparison of sweet sorghum hybrids vs. cultivars. Low soil temperature during early season is a major limitation for sorghum production in temperate climates. Tolerance to low temperatures at germination is desirable to ensure a good stand, to facilitate early planting, which could translate into longer growing seasons and higher yields and it is required for no-till or minimum-tillage practices. This project will facilitate the generation of tall, lodging tolerant cultivars with desirable plant architecture, sweet sorghum hybrids with higher sugar yields and germplasm with longer growing periods adapted to northern regions. These characteristics would directly impact yield and ethanol production levels. The knowledge obtained from this research could have other beneficial effects: a) Informed manipulation of hormonal genes can result in plant types adapted to higher planting densities; b) The use of lower inputs and reduced tillage practices will translate into more sustainable production systems; and c) The introduction of a new highly profitable alternative crop in Iowa could change traditional rotation schemes. This diversification would reduce the environmental impact of monoculture and will have significant economic and environmental benefits in the near future."

In addition to being renewable and sustainable, agriculturally sourced bio-based polysaccharides and modified products obtained from them have the potential and properties to satisfy all requirements for good polymeric textile printing thickening agents. Because they are also widely available, they are economical as well. By 2015, worldwide production of printed textiles is projected to be more than 30 billion square meters. Traditional textile printing methods such as direct printing, resist printing and discharge printing account for more than 90% of the global market for printed textiles. Therefore, the potential market and hence economic impact of agricultural products as polymeric bio-based thickening agents is immense. The proposed project will study agriculture products for their potential to be used as natural polymeric thickeners in textile printing applications. For the two year duration of this project, focus will be aimed towards polysaccharide sources that are abundant in Colorado and the western region of the country. These include wheat, corn, sorghum and proso millet. Additionally, literature survey indicated little or no research on sorghum and proso millet as potential sources for bio-based polymers in textile processing and therefore particular attention will be directed towards these agriculture products. Nationally, Colorado ranks 1st in production of the proso millet crop. The most common market for proso millet is bird seed and animal feed. Finding alternative additional markets for such agriculture products will be potentially more profitable than current uses such as animal feed and bird seed."

In much of the western United States where groundwater is used for irrigation, the imbalance between aquifer recharge and depletion calls for the development of improved methods of irrigation scheduling and water conservation. Furthermore, climate and land use changes have substantial impact on water resources management. The increasing demand for biofuels over the last decade has induced major changes in land use across the nation. In addition to changes in land use, more acres of row crops such as corn, sorghum, barley, wheat and sugarcane are dedicated for bioenergy production. Some of these row crops require more irrigation and fertilizers than conventionally grown crops and this land use change has direct implications on water resources availability and water quality. To ensure a sustainable bioenergy industry, the environmental, hydrologic and economic impacts of land use changes will be investigated and measures for mitigation of negative impacts will be evaluated. Modeling and field experimentation are complementary to each other, and if used together, they can lead to better understanding of the ecological and hydrologic processes that occur in agricultural watersheds. Hydrologic and water quality models together with reliably measured/estimated input parameters will be used to better understand the watershed processes and suggest strategies that conserve water resources and improve groundwater quality."

In 2006, 88 percent of sweet corn acreage was treated with one or more insecticide application totaling 605,000 lbs of insecticides applied. ECB also attacks crops like sorghum, small grains, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, and peppers. The southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella, causes about USD 1 million in damage in the Western High Plains. Recently, the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis, has emerged as a corn pest in the southern U.S. Other significant stalk-boring pests include the common stalk borer, Papaipema nebris, hop vine borer, Hydraecia immanis, and potato stem borer, Hydraecia micacea. Corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea, and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, consume corn leaves, tassels, silk and kernels.

Black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon, is the most damaging of the Corn Belt cutworm complex. Western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta, increasingly is a pest of corn ears across the north central region. The commercial release of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) transgenic corn in 1996 revolutionized corn pest management. This revolution rapidly moved corn pest management away from synthetic pesticides to biotechnology-based planted incorporated protectants. Bt technology often eliminates insecticide handling and increases the ease of planting and pest control. Seed companies continue to develop genetically-modified (GM) crops for pest protection. New GM corn hybrids have resistance to a broader range of lepidopteran and coleopteran pests. Changes in corn technology have caused major changes in the agricultural community and identified major knowledge gaps, increasing the need to reevaluate knowledge about corn pests. U.S. Bt corn acreage has increased steadily since 1996, as has the potential for resistance evolution. NC-205 Committee Research was used to develop models predicting the rates of resistance evolution and to investigate the role of refuge in preventing resistance. Recently deployed GM corn hybrids utilize multiple genes that target ECB. The IRM plan for these hybrids requires a smaller refuge of at least 5 percent. Seed mixtures (Bt and non-BT) are a new reality that assures refuge compliance, but introduces new concerns regarding movement of corn pest larvae. Models of these IRM modifications were constructed using the best information available and some assumptions to bridge data gaps. These assumptions must be tested to move them to quantified variables. Eliminating these information gaps forms the basis for several objectives of the project. The long-term goal of our research is to develop sustainable ways to manage lepidopteran corn pests. This is a high regional and important national priority."

Develop cost-effective systems and sensors for rapid and nondestructive measurement of moisture content and density of cereal grains, oilseeds and nuts that can be used in static and dynamic situations (on line and in process applications). 2. Develop a portable system for moisture measurements of shelled and unshelled peanuts that can be used in the field and at peanut grading stations. 3. Improve peanut grading processes by developing a rapid system for nondestructive determination of peanut kernel moisture from measurements on pre-cleaned samples and samples consisting of a mixture of pods and foreign materials. 4. Develop methods for monitoring water migration in almonds and other nuts and its effect on their quality by dielectric and spectroscopic methods.Approach:   Developing a cost-effective microwave system for rapid moisture measurement will require analysis of existing dielectric properties data to determine the optimum frequency and measurement parameters. From these results, microwave components will be specified, assembled into a low-cost rapid prototype, compared to a network analyzer, then calibrated and validated for moisture content of wheat, corn, soybeans, almonds, oats, sorghum, and barley. For peanuts, dielectric properties from 2 to 18 GHz on Runner, Spanish, Valencia, and Virginia will first be collected on shelled and unshelled peanuts. As with the other grains above, these data will then be analyzed to determine the optimum dielectric properties parameters and associated algorithms for a density- and variety-independent measure of peanut moisture content, and a prototype low-cost rapid peanut moisture measurement system will be developed. From these measurements and system development for peanut moisture content of shelled and unshelled peanuts, further development of a system to measure the moisture content of peanut kernels without shelling will be developed. Additional dielectric properties of both the unshelled and shelled kernels will be collected as needed, along with the moisture content of both the shells and the kernels. From these data, moisture algorithms will be developed. Additional dielectric properties measurements on unshelled peanuts with and without foreign material will also be collected for development of moisture models that are also independent of foreign material (trash). Models will be developed for both pod and kernel moisture contents. Besides kernel moisture content, meat content and percentage of foreign material are also important grading parameters. Attempts to correlate the dielectric properties data with these parameters will also be made. For almonds, since no dielectric properties data exists, fundamental dielectric properties measurements of almonds of varying varieties, growing locations in California, and moisture contents will be collected with a network analyzer. Correlations between moisture content and dielectric properties data will be developed. To investigate the dynamics of water migration in the almond kernels, known amounts of water will be sprayed on almond kernels of known moisture content, mixed, and then sealed in a Styrofoam box. The sealed box will then be placed between two horn-lens antennas for free-space measurement of the dielectric properties between 2 and 18 GHz at room temperature. Changes in the dielectric properties will be recorded over time as water moves from the almond surface to water in equilibrium inside the kernels. The next stage will be the use of these dielectric spectroscopic methods to monitor water migration inside the almonds under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature. In this instance, the water will permeate the almonds from the atmosphere for varying relative humidities from 20 to 80% in a controlled environmental chamber. Additionally, measurements will be repeated over varying temperatures from 0 to 50 oC in 5 oC increments."

L. Bennetzen (University of Georgia)Plants containing engineered chromosome breakage constructs will be used as a study system to investigate the nature of inaccurate repair of double strand DNA breaks (DSB), and the genetic or environmental factors that affect the nature of inaccurate repair. DSB repair, in all organisms from bacteria to plants and animals, is highly accurate.  This accuracy is necessary to allow chromosomes to be replicated and passed on to subsequent generations of progeny because these breaks are so frequent and are lethal if unrepaired.  However, inaccurate repair of DSB does occur, leading to small deletions, insertions or other outcomes at the break site.  Some previous studies have suggested that the relative sizes and frequencies of the inaccurate DSB repair events may vary from species to species, and that this variance might be responsible for differences in the rate at which genomes change size and for differences in their rate of sequence change.  This project will use a regulated DSB system, involving the enzyme I-SceI expressed off a transgenic construct in plants that are then crossed to other plants that have a cutting site for I-SceI.  The progeny of this cross have been shown, in preliminary experiments, to undergo DSB at the I-SceI site, and to sometimes have inaccurate repair at that site.  The I-SceI site in many of these progeny plants will be DNA sequenced by the investigators to see what kind of deletions, insertions, et cetera, are found at the cleavage site.  This work is being done in four grass species (maize, pearl millet, rice, and sorghum), with very different genomic sizes and genomic stability, to see if this influences the nature or frequency of inaccurate DSB repair.  The I-SceI sites are also integrated at various different chromosomal locations in different plants, so one can investigate chromosome position effects on repair outcomes.  Finally, the investigators will determine the nature of inaccurate DSB repair at different times in development, under different environmental stresses (e.g., high UV light intensity or high ozone levels) and in genetic backgrounds that have known mutations in DNA repair processes or chromatin structure.  Taken together, these studies will provide insights into how plant genomes evolve, and particularly how DSB repair participates in this process, to generate the natural diversity on which natural selection acts. This research will provide a powerful approach, and numerous novel insights, for understanding how genomes change.  This will lead to a better understanding of how genetic diversity can be interpreted and influenced by biologists.  The many direct participants in the project, especially the postdoctoral fellow, graduate student and undergraduate students, will receive direct training in a multi-disciplinary approach to a core question in modern genetics:  how do genomes change, and what effect does that change have on current and future function of genes in that genome.  The description of the project and of the results will be available at a web site that will be created for this project, with a presentation style that makes the information digestible for all levels of interested parties, from K-12 students, to the general public, to active research scientists.  Raw data and the most advanced results will also be provided in public-accessible databases (e.g., GenBank for sequence information and peer-reviewed publications for detailed analysis), including the project web site.    Biological materials (seeds of transgenic plants, constructs for the I-SceI approach, etc.) will be available from the PI's lab until the time that some more permanent maintenance resource can be identified.   Understanding DNA variation, particularly the mechanisms and rates/outcomes, is vital for any mature understanding of genetics or genomes, and is shared by animal, human, plant, fungal, viral and microbial researchers, so it is expected that the training, outreach and data enrichment components of this project will benefit the broadest scientific community and general public."

Corn (maize), the crop with the highest dollar value, is related to sorghum and sugarcane, the potential biofuel Miscanthus and about 1000 other wild species.  Because the entire genomes of corn and sorghum have been sequenced, we can translate information from these crops to wild species and conversely, we can study wild species to help develop better crops.  This project will use DNA sequences to determine how members of the group are related to each other, and then will use that information to assess how their genomes have evolved.  Genome doubling is very common in this group, and may have allowed the species to colonize new habitats and to develop new growth forms.  This work will illuminate untapped genetic resources that crop breeders desperately need to feed the planet.Data from this project can be used for crop improvement, for identifying new sources of biofuels, and for understanding the response of American and African grasslands to climate change.   Training of undergraduate and graduate students in grass taxonomy, analysis of DNA data, and plant genome evolution is another part of this project.  Education components of the project include involvement of undergraduate lab assistants, participation in the summer program for high school students at UMSL, and involvement in the Botanical Society's PlantingScience program.

Any environmental stress such as cold, drought or heat will limit the amount of fixed CO2, and trigger photoprotection mechanisms to dissipate or avoid absorption of excess energy that might cause damage to cells and the plant as a whole. The physiological and genetic aspects of photoprotection have been studied in model species but there has been no investigation of photoprotection as a useful and improvable mechanism of abiotic stress tolerance in crop species. Considering that abiotic stresses are the main cause of yield loss in agricultural systems, and that climate change will generate even more extreme environmental conditions, the utilization of a novel abiotic stress mechanism such as photoprotection could have a significant impact on crop productivity and thus on the prosperity of our society. The goal of this project is to discover genes/molecular markers affecting the plant's capacity to cope with excessive energy under stress conditions, using natural genetic variation in sorghum, a commercially important crop. This project includes the following specific aims: 1) to determine the drought and cold experimental conditions that would maximize the photoprotection response; 2) to test the association of photoprotection candidate genes with photosynthesis and fluorescence by Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) mapping; 3) to discover novel genes/markers associated with variation in photoprotection; and 4) to identify candidate genes, functional polymorphisms and determine expression levels of allelic variants associated with higher photoprotective capacity under stress. The outcomes of this project include genes/markers and allelic variants associated with superior photoprotective capacity, the functional polymorphisms and expression profiles of those genes, and molecular markers  that could be tested under multiple environmental conditions and exploited in breeding programs. The project will also provide research training and mentoring for one PhD and one undergraduate student.  With regard to outreach to the general public, the project will develop a new module for Meta!Blast, a real-time 3D action-adventure video game designed to engage students in the learning process of complex biological systems.  Photoprotection  complements current modules and will focus on photoprotection and its effects on society. This game will be utilized by high school teachers in biology courses but also in undergraduate courses at Iowa State University (ISU).  In addition, the project will provide demonstrations and extension presentations at the biannual Iowa Farm Progress Show and the ISU Research and Demonstration Farms, respectively. These opportunities to disseminate knowledge generated in this project to the general public are uniquely valuable because of the number of people attending those events, their roles on agricultural production systems and therefore their impact on society.  All germplasms used in this project are freely available through the USDA-ARS National Genetic Resources Preservation (NCGRP).

Eric Schaller (Dartmouth College) and Ann Loraine (University of North Carolina - Charlotte)Cytokinins are plant hormones that regulate many traits of agricultural importance, including the control of grain size and yield. In this project, genomic approaches will be used to uncover how cytokinin regulates growth and development in rice, using this plant species as a model to understand the regulation of grain size and yield in all cereals. Computational approaches will be used to interrogate and integrate the datasets generated by these studies. It is expected that these studies will illuminate the role of cytokinins in panicle development, and will provide specific information on how cytokinins regulate grain development in an agriculturally important crop. Because of conservation of gene sequence among cereals, information obtained from the study of rice may be applied to other agriculturally important species such as maize, wheat, barley, rye, and sorghum. This project will enhance the infrastructure of research and education by providing training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers. A computation workshop will broaden the ability of the research community to use genomics resources. In addition, through partnerships with local groups including the Montshire Museum of Science (http://montshire.org/), programs aimed at fostering science education in grades K-12 will be created and maintained.

The  witchweeds , members of the genus Striga, are particularly devastating since their primary hosts include the major cereals (maize, sorghum, rice and millet) and grain legumes that are dietary staples worldwide. How parasitic weeds and Striga species in particular recognize their potential hosts and overcome the innate defense systems are not known. Using the interaction of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), an important food and forage legume, with Striga gesnerioides, this project seeks to identify parasite-derived effectors and virulence proteins that enter host cells, specifically altering their structure and function and suppressing the defense response mechanism at various levels, enabling infection and parasite ingress to occur. Novel, in planta functional screens will be used to identify candidate effectors from Striga that are directly or indirectly recognized by race-specific resistance proteins in cowpea leading to activation of a hypersensitive response at the point of infection and associated downstream defense responses. These functional screens are complemented by comparative transcriptome sequencing in compatible and incompatible host-parasite association and in silico analysis aimed at identifying candidate virulence effectors through race-specific gene expression signatures. The outcomes of this project will provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which parasitic angiosperms identify and parasitize their hosts and how hosts block such attack. The negative impact of parasitic plants on crop productivity increases globally each year and their potential for affecting domestic agriculture looms larger as the movement of seed resources expands globally. The outcomes of this work will contribute directly to the development of strategies to improve crop security by providing targets for manipulating pest resistance responses of crop plants. In addition these studies provide new educational, research, and training opportunities for US students on the African continent."

Carrot is particularly sensitive because the harvested product is directly affected, resulting in severe losses in quality and marketable yield. Soil fumigants are heavily used in carrot to control nematodes, but have been implicated as important causes of poor air quality, and their use is being restricted. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective, economically viable, and sustainable nematode management strategies. Two strategies will be evaluated in this project: using nematode resistant cover crops, and coating carrot seed with a biologically-based nematicide. Specific varieties of sudangrass (var. Trudan 8), sorghum-sudangrass (var. SX-17), and cowpea (var. UCR CC36) have been reported resistant to root-knot nematodes. Sudan and sorghum-sudan are widely grown in California and can be harvested for hay or ethanol production, or incorporated to increase soil organic matter and act as a biofumigant through the release of nematicidal metabolites. Cowpea can fix large amounts of nitrogen and can be harvested for forage, or incorporated to increase soil organic matter. We will evaluate their effect on root-knot nematode populations, and nematode damage in a following carrot crop. Coating seed with minute amounts of abamectin has proven to dramatically lessen the impact of root-knot nematodes in several susceptible crops, including carrots. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this combined strategy in fresh carrot production. Our goal is to develop an integrated, non-fumigant strategy to minimize root-knot nematode damage in carrot without compromising air quality."

It will be possible to quickly exploit the understanding gained from this study of the genetic architecture of biochemical and physical traits in applied sorghum biomass breeding programs. Although essential for plant growth, excess light can damage plants. Plants have developed  photo-protection  mechanisms to protect themselves from the consequences of excess light. The hypothesis that variation in growth rate can be explained by variation in photosynthetic rates and/or amounts of photo-protection will be tested. One of the key breeding objectives for biomass crops is increased yield, which is affected by growth rate. The genetic control of sorghum growth rates will be determined. To do so, biomass volumes of a large genetically diverse collection of sorghum lines will be assayed at multiple time points during the growing season. Identifying the genetic control of biomass growth rates will allow breeders to genetically  stack  genes that control maximal growth rates, thereby paving a path to producing higher yielding hybrids. To identify the genetic control of biomass growth rates, it will be necessary to collect trait data at multiple times during multiple growing seasons. It would be extremely challenging to do so using conventional approaches. Instead, these data will be collected using a sophisticated, high-throughput, field-based, plant phenotyping system that will be developed during the project. Over the last several years, substantial progress has been achieved in the development of automated phenotyping systems. But to date most such automated phenotyping systems have been laboratory- or greenhouse-based. These systems suffer from the limitation that plant performance in laboratories or greenhouses is often only poorly correlated with field performance. Hence, the field-based phenotyping system that will be developed during the project has the potential to revolutionize the collection of phenotypic data from field-based biomass yield trials. As such, this robotic system is expected contribute widely to the genetic improvement of biomass crops of importance to the US economy."

Optimal biomass productivity in temperate latitudes and/or under perennial production systems may require substantial changes to architecture of plants of tropical origin that have previously been adapted to annual cultivation. Sorghum is one of the few crops suited to all proposed approaches for renewable fuel production, i.e. from starch, sugar, and/or cellulose; and as a botanical model for functional genomics of many other bioenergy plants, particularly Saccharum (sugarcane) and Miscanthus. Its low water requirements and adaptability to production regimes that reduce soil erosion further increase its intrinsic merit as renewable fuel crop. We will increase knowledge of the genetic determinants of components of plant architecture that are important to the design of crop genotypes optimized for production of biomass from a range of environments, also characterizing allelic and haplotype variation in salient sorghum genes toward their deterministic utilization, and enabling new integrative queries of these and other results to accelerate their utilization in biomass crop improvement.

To address this challenge, increased biofuel crop production is needed. Although first-generation biofuels like corn ethanol are available, second-generation biofuels are gaining importance because they don't directly compete with food production. Second-generation biofuels are made from the by-products of intensive agriculture or from less-intensive agriculture on more marginal lands. The Southwestern U.S. Cotton Belt can play a significant role in this effort through a change from more conventional crops (like continuous cotton) to second-generation biofuel feedstocks (biomass sorghum and perennial grasses). While we believe there would be environmental benefits associated with this change in land use, their exact nature and magnitude have not been investigated for this region. Our goal is to investigate the energy, water, carbon and greenhouse gas fluxes associated with this change. Our hypothesis is that these biofuel feedstock systems will reduce negative environmental effects associated with conventional cropping systems currently in the region, leading to more environmentally sound agricultural systems while supporting the goal of increased biofuel production. We will conduct a multi-year project involving flux measurements, remote sensing observations, and soil, plant, and climatic measurements. Field-based measurements will be expanded to the regional scale using spatial interpolation based on remote sensing, along with regional simulations using the geospatial model ArcAPEX.

Consequently, the federal government implemented mandates to increase production and consumption of renewable liquid transportation fuels made from agricultural crops and crop residues. As a result conventional food, feed, and fiber agricultural crop acreages are already being converted to biofuel cropping systems, and this is expected to intensify as demand for biofuels grows. Despite these mandates, we have a limited understanding of the environmental implications of converting current crop land to biofuel crops. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to enhance our understanding of the environmental implications of direct land use change from conventional cropping systems to biofuel cropping systems. Specifically, the objectives of the project are to quantify and compare the effects on crop yield, cropping system water use and water quality, and cropping system greenhouse gas regulation (soil carbon dynamics) of converting current conventional cropping systems in the Southeast to emerging biofuel cropping systems. These objectives will be addressed with two large field experiments, one comparing an annual sweet sorghum biofuel cropping system to a cotton-peanut rotation and the other comparing a perennial elephantgrass biofuel cropping system to a perennial bahiagrass pasture system. In both experiments, the biofuel crops will be converted to two different fuels, in one case using pyrolysis and in the other case using microbial fermentation. In both biomass conversion processes a waste product is generated that could be returned to the cropping system as a soil amendment, potentially enhancing the environmental sustainability of biofuel cropping systems. Expected outcomes from dissemination of the outputs of this project include a change in knowledge of the scientific community regarding ecosystem services of biofuel cropping systems, an impact on stakeholder behavior with regard to crop species selection and production practices, an increase in stakeholder adoption of using biofuel conversion waste products as soil amendments, an impact on future water planning of stakeholders/growers, an improved public perception of biofuel cropping systems, and broadly trained experts in ecosystem services of biofuel cropping systems, This project will therefore result in identification of relatively sustainable biofuel cropping systems for the region."

Continued emphasis on improving production efficiency is necessary to offset the inherently low production efficiency of both cow-calf and feedlot sectors of the industry. Increased reliance on corn co-products from ethanol production promises to improve production efficiency as the energy value of these co-products is similar to that of the grain they replace (corn or sorghum). However, health of the rumen and animal are sometimes compromised by their use; primarily from excesses of sulfur and phosphorus, plus the increased acidity derived from fast fermentation of these co-products in the rumen. Therefore, this project will contribute to increasing our understanding of feeding strategies and interventions to ameliorate negative factors associated with feeding DGS, and to step up intervention procedures to enhance production efficiency using alternative rumen modifiers. Incorporation of acute phase protein response will facilitate evaluation of remedies and alternative rumen modifiers while providing another tool to facilitate adoption of newly developed feeding and management strategies and interventions to include corn co-products and newly developed rumen modifiers by cattle producers. Under the following two objectives: 1) to study effects of feed grade mineral oxides and multivalent avian-derived antibodies to reduce the effects of S on rumen fermentation and performance of cattle fed high concentrations of corn co-products from ethanol production; and 2) to determine effects of S inclusion, particle size, concentration of roughage, and inclusion of rumen modifiers such as ionophores and multivalent avian-derived antibodies on APP response and behavioral changes. I expect to determine the maximum nutritionally and physiologically permitted inclusion of corn co-products from ethanol production to facilitate economically efficient operation of feedlots as corn grain price rises. I also expect to develop strategies for use of rumen fermentation modifiers both conventional (roughage inclusion, ionophores and antibiotics) and alternative (multivalent avian-derived antibodies, essential oils, etc) to reduce health related effects of use of corn co-products from ethanol production."

Fertilizer N recovery and use can be very high in high yield situations, but often is not and a better decision tool is needed which considers the risk of N loss in order to reduce reactive N loss to the environment and N2O emission. Manure ammonia volatilization and nitrous oxide emission are of great environmental implication and pose great management challenges. Interest in cover crops has increased but these do complicate N management. Soil acidity management is important and technology for site specific lime application needs to be improved. Research by diverse inter-disciplinary teams will be needed to fully achieve opportunities while solving emerging and potential problems. Applied and adaptive research is proposed. 1) Criteria will be developed for site-specific lime application approaches. 2) Prediction of the occurrence of iron deficiency induced chlorosis, and site specific management options will be developed using various data layers including yield maps, aerial photos and soil pH maps developed from on-the-go sensing. 3) The zone where skip-row planting of grain sorghum is preferable to conventional planting will be determined. 4) Manure N management will be improved for greater N use efficiency, less nitrous oxide emission, and less ammonia volatilization and other N losses. 5) Decisions on use of N fertilizer enhancement products depend on the level of N loss risk and we intend to develop a decision tool for N management that considers the probability of N loss for a field and management system and enables testing of alternative practices. 6) The problem of yield loss associated with cover crops appears to be an issue of N availability that we propose to address with sensor technology. Research of these topics is feasible and each has good potential of making significant impact on crop production in Nebraska and the Midwest. The potential annual impacts at the farm-gate have been conservatively estimated for: a mean 2 bu increase in soybean yield by overcoming iron deficiency induced chlorosis in northeast Nebraska with a benefit cost ratio of 4-6; site-specific lime application ($3,600,000); skip-row planting of sorghum ($6,500,000); partial factor productivity of fertilizer N applied to corn in Nebraska is about 60 lb grain per lb N but a mean value of >90 achieve with N applied to maximize net returns to fertilizer in 32 high yield trials (Wortmann et al., 2010), more efficient use of the 75,000 t/yr of manure organic N applied in Nebraska is feasible, and improved productivity and NUE in cover crop fields.

N.",,,078592789,TEXAS A &amp; M UNIVERSITY,LUBBOCK,TX,79409,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2012,,,"Nearly 95% of the energy consumed in the State of Hawaii comes from imported fossil fuels, mostly petroleum and it is no surprise the islands' residents pay among the highest prices in the nation for gasoline and electricity. This high dependence on imported petroleum leaves Hawaii extremely vulnerable to many economic and environmental risks. In light of the above, securing alternative energy resources, has been a high priority in the energy strategy of the State of Hawaii. Currently, a number of factors make biomass an attractive and synergistic alternative energy source in Hawaii. The tropical climate provides ideal conditions for fast-growing biomass energy crops, while the large tracts of sugarcane lands that were taken out of production largely due to increased labor costs and competition from artificial sweeteners, can be used to produce the bioenergy feedstocks. Compared to petroleum, bioenergy poses less environmental damage regards net CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, thereby reducing the potential for global warming. Furthermore, development of the bioenergy industry offers new opportunities for the declining sugar industry, and the opportunity for economic diversification, and energy security for Hawaii. The skewed focus on a tourism-based economy has previously hindered the development of alternative energy resources. The project is a joint ONR/USDA plan for a resource assessment of feedstock supply to produce advanced biofuels in Hawaii. The project is being implemented jointly by teams from the USDA-ARS Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center, Hilo, Hawaii, USDA-ARS Water Management Research Unit, Parlier, California, and USDA-ARS Grassland, Soil and Water Research Laboratory, Temple, Texas, and will assess potential bioenergy feedstock production from a range of bioenergy feedstock crops, such as sugarcane, energy sorghum, energycane, Bana and Napier grasses etc. The project will initially use the Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S) sugar cane lands in Maui, Hawaii, as the site for the pilot project with the ultimate goal of extending to all the Hawaiian Islands and other areas of the Pacific Basin. To achieve this goal, we will apply the ALMANAC model to determine the feasibility of biofuel production and environmental sustainability in Hawaii. The model has been extensively used to assess bioenergy feedstock production and potentially adverse environmental impacts at various spatial and temporal scales. We will develop the key databases needed to run the model; Crop management - this includes information on land preparation, fertilizer application, planting, irrigation and harvesting. Weather data can be generated within the model or downloaded from web weather sites e.g. NOAA weather site. Similarly, Soils data can be downloaded from web soil survey sites e.g. the USDA-NRCS soil survey site. Crop parameters can be gathered from measured field data, the literature or expert judgment. Management Guidelines and Technical Reports synthesized from the project will provide new data for use by other agronomists / modelers, extension, potential bioenergy feedstock producers, policymakers, and members of the public."

Individual components of the flowering response in plants may be sensitive to photoperiod (day-length), sensitive to temperature, or insensitive to both these environmental inputs. Murphy et al. (2011) recently identified the gene underlying Ma1, the major photoperiod-sensitivity locus in sorghum, a short-day, warm-season grass. Interestingly, the orthologs of this gene control vernalization/cold-induced flowering in wheat and barley, which are long-day, cool-season grasses. This exciting discovery facilitates the search for functional diversity at Ma1 and interacting loci across diverse sorghum germplasm. Shared Ma1 function between warm-season and cool-season grasses supports the comparative genomic hypothesis that the biological knowledge obtained from one organism can be applied productively towards the improvement of related species."

Consequently, many dairy producers have turned to feed by-products to meet cattle nutrient needs. Some of these by-products such as dried distiller&#39;s grains and soyhulls have been incorporated, at modest levels, in dairy diets for many years. Others such as wet corn distiller&#39;s solubles have not been available until the expansion of the ethanol biofuel industry. An ethanol plant located in Vicksburg, MS now has made this product available for dairy and beef producers in the region. Most of these products have been evaluated in mid western states where corn silage and alfalfa make up the major forage base. How dairy cattle in Louisiana that rely heavily on ryegrass pastures, bermuda grass hay and sorghum baleage as forage sources will react to these feed by-products is not known. Furthermore, most of the research was conducted at relatively low levels of supplementation. It is well recognized that high-performing Holstein cows require specific levels of starch, protein, lipids and effective fiber for optimum production and health. This project will attempt to determine how effective these by-prodcuts are at filing these nutrient needs. In so doing, it may be possible to reduce producer reliance on higher priced energy and protein sources and improve profitability of local and regional dairy enterprises."

Conversion of cellulosic biomass such as agricultural residues to biofuels offers major economic, environmental, and strategic benefits. DOE and USDA projected that U.S. biomass resources could provide approximately 1.3 billion dry tons of feedstock (998 million dry tons from agricultural residues) for biofuels, which would meet about 40% of the annual U.S. fuel demand for transportation (Perlack, 2005). Corn stover is one of the most important agricultural bioproducts in the Corn Belt, and much research has been conducted on bioconversion of corn stover for biofuel. Sorghum is another important grain crop grown in the U.S. It represents a renewable resource that is currently grown on six to ten million acres in the U.S. Sorghum is a tropical grass grown primarily in semiarid and drier parts of the world, especially in areas too dry for corn. Sorghum can not compete successfully with corn as cereal in an agro-ecosystem with 900 mm of annual rainfall, but corn cannot compete with sorghum in the areas that receive less than 900 mm of rainfall. Sorghum produces 33% more dry mass than corn in dry land. Sorghum varieties with increased cellulose content and reduced lignin content have been developed through mutation breeding. These brown midrib (BMR) genotypes have reduced amounts of caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme responsible for lignin production. These due to high cellulose content and low lignin content (about 20% percent less lignin than regular sorghum silage), may make this sorghum digestible for ethanol production. Due to climate variability and continuing decline of water resource, utilization of our dry land to grow sorghum and forage sorghum is critically important to insure available energy resources and sustainable economic development. An opportunity exists for sorghum to contribute to bioenergy production through the sorghum growing sates. However, at present, there is not enough scientific information and knowledge about the use of sorghum stover, especially, BMR sorghum for biofuel production to compare with data available for corn stover. It is also true for some other types of biomass, such as switchgrass, big bluestem, etc. More research is needed. DOE (2005) has proposed a model for processing biomass feedstocks and converting them to useable chemicals or fuels. Processing can either follow a sugar platform, wherein lignocellulose is hydrolyzed to fermentable sugars which are used in further processing of products such as biofuels and chemicals. The second route is the thermochemical platform, where biomass undergoes pyrolysis or gasification to produce gases, liquids, or solids which are utilized for chemical and energy production. The goal of this proposed research is to develop comprehensive understanding and utilization of agricultural biomass such as corn stover, switchgrass, sorghum, and praire hays for biofuel and bioproducts production through thermochemical platform."

E.",,,149546160,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,DENVER,CO,80203-1148,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2012,,,"Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) has a small sequenced genome and is a model crop for a subfamily of bioenergy grasses with more complex genomes such as maize, sugarcane, Miscanthus and switchgrass [1, 2]. Sorghum first generated interest as an energy feedstock in the 1980s because it is an annual, accumulates a considerable amount of sugar with relatively little water, and tolerates environmental stresses that other plants species cannot (e.g. arid, saline or high heat)[3]. A number of morphological traits (height, tiller number, dry biomass) are routinely measured in grass species to investigate disease resistance, drought tolerance, hybrid vigor, root traits, seedling characteristics, and yield [6-13]. Gas exchange has been compared in many studies to look for physiological differences, specifically in water use efficiency (WUE), nitrogen deficiency, and increasing atmospheric CO2 [14-16]. However, few comprehensive investigations of biomass and underlying traits in bioenergy crops have been reported [17]. Many environmental factors have been reported as reducing bioenergy yields. Sorghum is more drought resistant than most other biomass crops, but the mechanisms for this are not well understood. Previous studies found sorghum was among the most water use efficient [18], perhaps through more effective control of transpiration [19, 20] It is yet unknown how the negative relationship between sugar accumulation in stems and total biomass yield in drought stressed sorghum will impact the bioenergy industry [21, 22]. Additionally, the lignocellulosic cell-wall composition in sorghum is affected by local growing environments; although it is yet unclear whether water availability affects these traits [23]. Metabolomics has emerged as a valuable tool for comparison of metabolites in biological system for both primary and secondary metabolism. This technique can be used to determine the genetic, environmental, and developmental influences on the chemical composition and metabolism of plants. Metabolomics provides a high-throughput and sensitive method to evaluate metabolic responses and has been proposed as a useful measure to improve crops [24]. This technique has been demonstrated to capture biochemical complexities in grass species to identify metabolite variation related to different stages of development [25], to demonstrate relationships between metabolic and genomic diversity [26], and to characterize responses to stresses [27]. A number of studies successfully correlated genomics with metabolomics [26, 28], and this tool is a novel phenotyping strategy to validate biochemical pathways, including those related genes and proteins, essential to stress tolerance [29] Targeted genetic improvement of new bioenergy feedstocks depends on identifying genetic variation in critical morphological, structural, physiological and biochemical traits. Here, we propose to integrate of physiology, morphology and metabolome to identify key traits for sorghum bioenergy trait improvement. Our long-term goal is to identify candidate genes and pathways that control these traits to expiate breeding."

This stress most commonly takes the form of a combination of salt (resulting from fertilizer aggregation in irrigation water, or the use of contaminated well water) and thermal stresses, but can also encompass drought stress or nutrient stress caused by the use of marginal soils. The acceleration of global warming and the increased demands on global water supplies will only exacerbate these problems, and highlight the crucial need to develop both plant species capable of maintaining production under adverse environmental conditions. Several studies have provided key evidence that several process associated with the plant cell membrane system, including lipid signaling, regulation of hormone transport, and production of steroids or other terpenoid secondary products, play an important role in mediating responses to stress stimuli. The proposed research will define the biochemical mechanisms by which these processes regulate plant adaptation to environmental injury and insult. Further, the research will identify key steps/components of these pathways, allowing them to be targeted for manipulation to increase crop stress tolerance. Completion of the research described in the project will provide information that will contribute substantially to the fundamental understanding of the methods by which crop species adapt to abiotic stress conditions. By defining the role of lipid signaling in regulating protein phosphorylation and auxin transport, these pathways can be used to control plant growth and development, improving stress tolerance and agricultural yields. Initial research efforts have focused on rice, a crop species which yields $1.5 billion to the US in export annually and is the staple food grain for approximately two-thirds of the world's population. The crucial importance of rice as a food crop worldwide was recently highlighted by a global rice shortage, leading to dramatic increases in rice prices and food shortages throughout Asia, particularly in the Philippines and Vietnam (U.N. Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs). The conserved nature of the mechanisms investigated in the proposal across both monocot and dicot crop species, however, means that progress made in rice could easily be transferred to other important monocot crop species including maize and sorghum. As all of the pathways investigated in the research (lipid signaling, auxin transport, and sterol/terpenoid production) function as signaling  hubs  controlling multiple downstream responses and having conserved functions in several stress resposnses, modulation of these pathways could be used to simultaneously improve tolerance to multiple stresses and improve agricultural yields of crops grown under a variety of stress conditions"

It typically sustains higher yields in extreme heat or drought than corn. The host status of grain sorghum for most nematode species is unclear. Some varieties of grain sorghum may be excellent hosts of M. incognita and may be better hosts than corn for lesion, ring, sting, stubby root and stunt nematodes. Grain sorghum can be used successfully to suppress soybean cyst and reniform nematode populations. However, the host status of grain sorghum to lance nematodes is unknown. This work will determine whether grain sorghum can be used to reduce Columbia lance nematode population densities. H. galeatus occurs commonly in this region. Information on the ability of H. galeatus to infect and reproduce on grain sorghum is minimal. Recent work in has shown that some populations of lance nematode that were previously identified as H. galeatus are likely H. stephanus instead. We have no information on the host range of H. stephanus or the level of damage it may cause on row crops. Nematode management for row crops in the Southeast has relied heavily upon the use of aldicarb, which was discontinued in 2011. Telone II (1,3-dichloropropene) is available but the supply is limited. Research has demonstrated that a combination of zone management and site-specific application can maintain yields while reducing pesticide applications up to 50% in many fields. More comprehensive data is needed relative to the effects of soil texture and other biological and edaphic factors on the distribution of reniform and Columbia lance nematodes in typical South Carolina fields. Clemson University is uniquely suited to conduct research on this proposal. It is a leader in the utilization of site-specific variable-rate applications of nematicides. Greenhouse space is available for all culturing of nematodes and screening of varieties for host suitability. Reference cultures and the materials needed for molecular speciation along with the expertise of Dr. Agudelo are available on campus. Recent survey work by Dr. Mueller and Dr. Agudelo will provide many of the nematode populations needed for Objectives 1 and 3. This research is vital to continued successful management of plant-parasitic nematodes in row crops in the Southeast. If nematode control measures are not developed to offset the loss of aldicarb and the continued limited supplies of 1,3-dichloropropene, yield losses on cotton and soybean will likely increase. In South Carolina soybeans alone, growers could lose $25 an acre, or over $6,250,000. Cotton losses would be similar and could be as much as $60 per acre or over $15,000,000 for the state. Previous work on site-specific variable-rate placement of nematicides has shown reductions of 50 to 66% in nematicide applied to fields infested with Columbia lance and root-knot nematode. We need to develop the knowledge base on the in-field distribution of reniform nematodes so that we can expand this precision ag program to reniform nematode-infested fields. This not only saves growers input dollars but lessens the pesticide load on the environment."

The results are applicable to other areas in which there is increasing demands on the water supply.  The in-research program addresses issues related to water management practices in cropping and integrated crop-livestock systems, and irrigation management and automation for increased water use efficiency (WUE). Knowledge of the processes affecting soil water content during a growing season will facilitate refinement of models to simulate water balance and assist in assessing the merits of alternative practices. Longer-term studies will be used to quantify effects of reduced tillage on crop yield, WUE, and soil physical characteristics for wheat-sorghum-fallow crop rotations and alternative cropping sequences.  Several experiments focusing on different hydrological aspects and time scales will investigate management effects on soil water and availability to crops utilizing watershed, remote sensing, and meteorological networks.  Research approaches related to irrigation management include determinations of crop water use by weighing lysimeters, neutron scattering methods, etc. Experiments include variations in irrigation methods, irrigation amount, tillage, and/or crop and crop rotation. Automatic irrigation systems based on sensing of crop water status are being engineered and tested. Remote sensing approaches to water use prediction are expected to improve their utility in decision making by farm managers, irrigation projects or water districts, and policy makers. University partners have critical roles in supporting the above activities as well as providing additional expertise in technology transfer, hydrology and economic assessments of existing and future water conservation technologies and policies. Support from cooperating university is evaluated annually. Work plans are developed for each project describing research to be conducted during a 2-year period. Yearly workshops are held with stakeholders and cooperating scientists; these workshops are used to review progress, re-define or clarify research priorities, and inform stakeholders, project leaders and administrators. Annual and final reports are used to document progress of the research."

We will work cooperatively with plant breeders to develop cultivars and germplasm with desirable agronomic traits and a high level of nematode resistance.  Plant material will be selected for resistance using traditional and marker-assisted selection.  However, we cannot rely exclusively on host-plant resistance for managing nematodes.  We will also investigate ecologically-based control strategies that can be integrated with resistant cultivars to increase the durability of resistance and control a broader spectrum of nematode pathogens.  Biological control organisms are being marketed for use in cotton and peanut, and also occur naturally in fields.  We will explore the effect of crop production practices (tillage, fumigation, cultivar, and cover crops) on these antagonistic organisms with the goal of conserving or enhancing their activity against nematodes.  We will identify crops that can be grown in rotation with cotton and peanut that will reduce populations of root-knot nematode either by producing toxic metabolites (high residue rye) or by limiting nematode reproduction (sorghum for bioenergy use).

In many plant species, flowering occurs at a particular time of year in response to the sensing of seasonal cues such as changes in the length of day and temperature.  This project is designed to further our understanding of how the timing of flowering is regulated by environmental cues at a molecular level in the grasses. Despite the fact that grasses include important food crops such as wheat, rice and corn and potential bioenergy crops such as switchgrass, sorghum and miscanthus, little is known about how flowering is regulated at a molecular level in the grasses. This project will employ Brachypodium distachyon as a model because this grass species exhibits a large range of natural variation in flowering behavior that is genetically tractable, and it is straightforward to identify the genes responsible for genetic differences in flowering among different Brachypodium varieties. Understanding achieved by this project has the potential to inform research designed to improve the productivity of food and bioenergy crops.  This project will result in the training of graduate students and postdocs for independent careers in science, and will provide undergraduates with an opportunity to learn about research in genetics, molecular biology and plant biology.  Students and postdocs working on this project are also encouraged to contribute to our efforts to bring understanding of plant biology into K-12 classrooms."

RSA has been correlated with agronomic performance in many crops, particularly under limiting water and nutrient conditions. However, historical deficiencies in root phenotyping technologies have impeded efforts to target root traits directly for crop improvement. In Phase I, a novel high throughput root phenotyping platform will be used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) that regulate beneficial RSA traits in sorghum. Sorghum is a close relative of corn, and the third most important cereal crop in the US. Its small sequenced genome, abundant genetic and phenotypic diversity, and adaptation to cultivation under limiting water and nutrient conditions make it an ideal crop for these studies. Subsequent phases of this research will identify the genes underlying the QTL, and validate the identified traits for commercialization. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be to increase cereal production in response to growing demands for food. Cereal grains are the most important source of human food and animal feed worldwide. While tremendous gains have been made in cereal crop yields over the last 60 years, the rate of these gains is slowing. At the same time, there is a drive for more sustainable agriculture due to increasing fertilizer and fuel costs, water availability issues, soil degradation, and environmental concerns. Thus, there is a pressing need for sustainable solutions to increasing cereal grain yield. This project will combine unique root phenotyping expertise and state-of-the-art quantitative genetics approaches to discover sorghum root system architecture traits that are important for agronomic performance under low input conditions.  These traits will be commercialized through licensing or alliances with seed companies for the improvement of sorghum (seed market ~$250M) and corn (seed market ~$7B) germplasm through breeding or biotech approaches."

Harmon (University of California - Berkeley/USDA-ARS) Biological clocks orchestrate spatial and temporal control of growth and metabolism, leading to synchronous interactions between circadian rhythms and metabolic homoeostasis. In plants, maintenance of robust circadian rhythms promotes growth and fitness. Hybrids formed between strains or allopolyploids formed between species often show hybrid vigor or heterosis: superior levels of growth, biomass, and fertility in the hybrids compared to the parents. The mechanisms underlying heterosis are poorly understood. A recent study found a direct link between growth vigor and the circadian clock. Alterations in the expression waveform of key circadian clock genes in Arabidopsis hybrids and allotetraploids promote metabolic outputs including chlorophyll biosynthesis and starch metabolism. Upregulation of light signaling, photosynthesis, and starch metabolic genes in hybrids results from epigenetic repression of the circadian clock repressor genes during the day that, in turn, causes upregulation of clock activators and downstream metabolic genes. Although diurnal rhythms in gene expression, photosynthesis, and starch metabolism have been documented in maize, it is unknown whether the circadian-mediated metabolic vigor found in Arabidopsis hybrids and allopolyploids is directly applicable to the improvement of hybrid crops such as maize. Maize is among the best organisms for studying heterosis. Moreover, maize performs C4 photosynthesis, characterized by anatomical and biochemical specialization that increases net carbon assimilation at high temperatures. Part of this specialization in C4 plants may involve clock-regulated metabolic pathways. This project will test how circadian rhythms control metabolism and development in maize, as well as how circadian and other regulatory networks affect growth vigor in maize hybrids. Specific objectives are to (1) determine direct targets of clock genes in biological pathways including metabolism in maize hybrids and their inbred parents; (2) test how circadian clock gene expression and growth vigor in maize hybrids are controlled at levels of chromatin and metabolism; and (3) elucidate molecular bases for circadian regulation of metabolism and growth vigor in maize inbreds and hybrids.The impact of this research is transformative for many fundamental areas of biology ranging from circadian rhythms, first discovered in heliotrope plants in 1726, to hybrid vigor or heterosis, a widespread phenomenon that has intrigued many scientists, including Charles Darwin. The results from this work impact directly on improvement of hybrid crops, most notably maize and sorghum, which are of great importance to agriculture, food security, biofuels, and human health. Mechanistic insights into circadian regulation of metabolic vigor in plant hybrids are also applicable to the circadian rhythms in metabolism and physiology found in other sexually reproducing organisms like humans. With regard to outreach and training, this project will provide summer student internships for future science teachers through the UTeach program.  The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) developed the UTeach program, and many other institutions across the country have replicated it. In addition, the project will provide research training opportunities for Master of Science (MSc) students at Alcorn State University and Mississippi Valley State University, two Historically Black Colleges/Universities.  Sequence data will be available for public through GEO, MaizeGDB, and Gramene.  Requests for seed and information about germplasm generated in this project will be available through MaizeGDB."

The project takes advantage of the recent release of two important paleopolyploid genomes, maize and Brassica rapa (Chinese cabbage).   Having diverged approximately 12 million years ago, each of these ancient polyploids has close relative genomes that can serve as outgroups - sorghum and the other grasses for maize and Arabidopsis, and several recently sequenced crucifers for the cabbages. There are four objectives with the goal of developing a better understanding of the function of enhancers and cis-acting modules, those sequences that regulate gene expression in plants:  1) to develop a new application for CoGe that brings motifs and transcription factor binding sites into view when comparing the sequences of chromosomal segments.  CoGe is a popular, public toolbox for visualizing and comparing sequences; 2) to discover genes with new regulatory capabilities by finding rare cases of new sequence corresponding to new patterns of expression.  Finding genes that switch their patterns of genome dominance should relate to this aim; 3) to find the means by which plant regulatory DNA evolves into non-detectability without losing its function, a process known as  binding site turnover  in mammals; and, 4) to elucidate enhancer evaluation in plants by using the natural process of fractionation mutagenesis to generate specific sequences with specific functions using computational data only.  Hypotheses based on the predicted enhancers will be tested using transient and stable expression of engineered reporter genes.Broader aims of the project include a summer internship program for underserved, local high school students, and continued development of the popular CoGe website (http://genomevolution.org/CoGe/) containing applications that help find meaning when genes and genomes are compared.  This project will host one or two students each summer.  Additionally, this project involves improvements to the CoGe suite of free, on-the fly applications now powered by iPlant (http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/) that will provide broad access to the broader scientific community."

Functional genomics offers great potential for developing high-yielding, low-input-requiring, and widely adapted grasses through genome-wide identification of regulatory factors that can be used in breeding programs and genetic manipulations. Development of such efficient feedstocks that fuel the bioenergy industry will promote rural economies and advance the competitiveness of U.S. agriculture by reducing inputs and maximizing outputs. However, progress in biomass feedstock functional genomics has been very slow, because appropriate genomic tools in relevant C4 models that could facilitate groundbreaking discoveries are lacking. The overall objective of this proposal is to lay a concrete foundation for the long-term establishment of a comprehensive public research resource in sorghum that can serve as a launching pad for C4 crop functional genomics research. The specific objectives of this project are (1) to develop 30,000 fast neutron deletion M2 lines in sorghum as a genomic tool for biomass functional genomics research, (2) to create pools of genomic DNA library from 5000 M2 plants for reverse screening, and (3) to identify sorghum germplasm with altered leaf size and biomass yield that can serve as a proof-of-concept to evaluate the efficiency of the population. This project lays the foundation for acceleration of biomass yield productivity research in biofuel crops. Sustainable feedstock production and supply to the bioenergy industry will reduce environmental pollution and dependence on foreign oil."

Nitrogen is the single most important mineral nutrient required for plant growth and productivity. Application of nitrogen fertilizer has dramatically increased crop productivity, which together with genetically high-yielding varieties spurred the Green Revolution. However, these high-yielding varieties may not be very efficient in capturing and utilizing the applied nitrogen as they were bred for high yield not high nitrogen use efficiency. Over-fertilization combined with low nitrogen efficient plants frequently causes pollution in surface/underground water and acid rain. Pollution in underground water is a known health hazard and pollution in surface water leads to eutrophication of aquatic systems such as the  Dead Zone  along the Louisiana&#39;s coast in the Gulf of Mexico. Increasing plant nitrogen use efficiency is a win-win solution for this problem. With the total nitrogen analyzer acquired through the project, a diverse collection of sorghum germplasm materials will be evaluated for their nitrogen use efficiency in the field. Sorghum is an ideal model for this type of study because it is among the most nitrogen efficient crop plants. Based on replicated field evaluation, the most nitrogen efficient plants will be selected. Those plants will be used to make crosses to produce potentially more nitrogen efficient plant varieties. Varieties efficient in using nitrogen will produce similar, if not higher yield with the same fertilizer application rate. Therefore, growers adopting such varieties will not need to apply as much nitrogen fertilizer to achieve the same yield. This, in the long term, will reduce nitrogen pollution in the environment. Equally important is the participation in the project by both undergraduate and high school students as they will learn more about the science side of the issue, and this will enrich their educational experience in agriculture and natural resources."

Over 50% of the world&#39;s potentially arable lands are acidic, making this problem a major constraint to crop production, particularly in the developing world. The development of cultivars adapted to acid soils is therefore a key aspect in sustainable crop production. To achieve the full genetic potential in breeding crops for aluminum (Al) tolerance, it is critical to understand the genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of this trait. Rice is the most Al tolerant cereal crop, providing a good model to identify Al tolerance genes, and offering the potential to identify novel tolerance mechanisms. The goal of this research is to enable the development of crops with superior performance on acid soils, based on a comprehensive understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying Al tolerance, the genetic variation in key Al tolerance genes, as well as how this variation contributes to the variance in rice Al tolerance. In this proposal, we will build upon the results of our expiring NIFA grant to: 1) Understand how natural variation in the sequence of a major rice Al tolerance gene, whose gene name is ART1, can be exploited to enhance rice Al tolerance. This work will identify versions of the ART1 gene that are most effective at enhancing Al tolerance, and may determine the best combinations of the most tolerant versions of ART1 in combination with the best rice genetic backgrounds. 2) Identify novel, cell wall-related Al tolerance genes and mechanisms, as our preliminary finding suggest that the very high Al tolerance in rice is due in part to curently unidentified Al tolerance mechanisms that protect the cell wall of growing root cells from toxic Al. 3) Translate our recent findings on a novel rice Al tolerance mechanism conferred by a transporter that moves toxic Al from the cell wall into root cells where it is sequestered in an internal cellular compartment. There is great promise for transferring this tolerance mechanism into other economically important cereal species such as corn, wheat and sorghum. This research on rice and other cereals should have immediate and practical applications in agriculture for increasing cereal yields on the acid soils that comprise large parts of the world&#39;s lands, inclduing the southeastern United States and many developing countries in the tropics and subtropics."

Using a transdisciplinary eco-evolutionary genetic approach we will explore mechanisms underlying the success of johnsongrass at several scales; i) looking for potential drivers of rapid evolution including climate and local disturbances, ii) characterizing phenotypic and genotypic diversity among source habitats (e.g., agricultural fields, roadsides), and iii) identifying genotypes (and potentially individual genes) associated with weedy traits, management/disturbance tolerance, and invasiveness. Common garden phenotyping of reproductive, vegetative, and population traits will be complemented with greenhouse studies of disturbance/management tolerance using a robust and deep sampling of 192 accessions of US johnsongrass diversity. Association genetics will be utilized to test whether specific genes are the basis for key weedy/invasive traits. Finally, we will integrate each of the above components to elucidate complex cause-effect relationships resulting in the dramatic success of johnsongrass across diverse systems. Richer understanding of these relationships would be a foundation for carefully-targeted control measures, going well beyond what has been possible in the past."

Atrazine contamination of drinking water is a public health concern in the US, and Wisconsin has been a leader in limiting the use of atrazine. This NIFA research proposal addresses the problem of water pollution from atrazine and other herbicides by using two main research components: 1) analysis of existing water quality monitoring data to examine the impacts of atrazine prohibition areas in Wisconsin 2) social science research using survey data and semi-structured interviews of stakeholders on a) farmer decision-making related to restrictions on atrazine, b) what influences the decision to adopt reduced input-agriculture and what are the economic impacts of doing so, c) what are the innovations of growers successfully growing low-input corn.

Within this group of producers, a modest number have begun to incorporate some reduced tillage practices into their farming operations, particularly when those practices have a direct affect upon crop success. Reduced tillage practices have been examined and found to be beneficial by many agronomic crop producers within the state of Oklahoma. In a survey of farms within the state it was found that approximately one-third of farmers are utilizing some form of reduced tillage in their operation (Wright et al. 2010). Farms that produce specialty crops exclusively may or may not be using reduced tillage practices. Traditionally, few specialty crop producers report the use of reduced tillage practices. Although these practices have many benefits including reducing soil erosion from wind and water and improving soil condition, their use is dependent upon crop type and harvesting technology. Not all specialty crops are compatible within a reduced tillage system. Crops such as leafy greens require clean tillage to prevent crop debris and insects from being harvested along with the crop. That said, there are many specialty crops that may lend themselves to a reduced tillage approach to farming. Fruiting vegetable crops, cucurbits, legumes and other groups of vegetables may work well within this system. There are several benefits that may result from further examination of reduced tillage practices in specialty crops. Obvious benefits would include verification of reduced operational costs, reducing soil erosion, conservation of moisture and fuel savings. Less tangible issues that need examining might include impacts on soil organic matter and quality, stand establishment, and pest management effects between conventional and reduced tillage systems. A whole systems approach that includes both agronomic and vegetable crops may prove to be beneficial to farmers that need a number of unrelated crops for crop rotations to complete their farming system."

S. farmer, reduce costs associated with crop surpluses, improve the U. S. balance of payments, and decrease the dependence of the U. S. on imports of strategic raw materials. Diversification of American agriculture is important for achieving economic stability and future growth. However, it is also important that new/alternative crops complement, not compete with existing traditional crops. In addition, the new/alternative crops must lend themselves to sustainable cropping systems that conserve water and other natural resources. This work will (1) increase the domestic supply of renewable industrial products; (2) promote the environmental sustainability and diversification of agricultural production; (3) promote economic diversity in rural and tribal areas; and (4) enhance the efficiency of production of the researched crops. The crops investigated in this project can also help in the move from a fossil fuel-based economy to a bio-based economy by developing new/alternative crops that can replace fossil fuel products. This project will concentrate on the continued development of three crops. Guayule is a perennial shrub native to the Chihuahuan Desert of northern Mexico and southern Texas. Guayule has long been known as a source of natural rubber. However, guayule was not economically competitive with Hevea natural rubber until the recent widespread occurrence of life-threatening  latex allergy  to Hevea rubber products. This made the development of an alternative, safe source of natural rubber imperative, and the commercial demand for guayule latex is now due primarily to this recent development. In addition, increased demand for tires in developing countries has also allowed guayule to be re-evaluated as a source for rubber for tires, and several tire companies are starting guayule programs. Lesquerella contains a seed oil which has a profile very similar to castor oil. Large markets exist for these oils as lithium greases, polymers in paints and coatings, base stocks for lubricants, nylon-11, hydraulic fluids, and applications in the personal care industry. The hydroxyl group of these oils makes them prime candidates as additives to diesel fuel to improve lubricity. Lesquerella could be established as a reliable, domestic oilseed for a variety of industrial applications and at the same time provide an alternative crop for farmers and increase local profits. Lesquerella will not replace current commodity crops but instead will be placed in a rotation with these crops. Sweet sorghum has been grown traditionally as a syrup and sugar crop in the southeastern United States, but increasing demand for alternative fuels has led to renewed interest in cultivating sweet sorghum as a source of ethanol. Sorghum is well adapted to marginal environments due to its low water requirements, and extracts water more efficiently and yields better than similar biofuel crops in this area."

While most U.S. biofuel products are currently derived from corn as bioethanol, concerns of poor conversion efficiency as well as high input costs, and increased prices for corn and feedstuffs manufactured from dried distiller's grain provide an opportunity to develop alternative crops as sources of biofuel feedstock. Forage and sweet sorghum are alternative biofuel crops that can easily be incorporated into existing row crop production systems common to Alabama and surrounding states. While forage sorghum would be grown for cellulosic feedstock, sweet sorghum, which has biomass (bagasse) yields comparable to forage sorghum and other biomass crops such as switchgrass, also yields a high sucrose content extract that can be fermented into ethanol or complex hydrocarbons and alternately ensilaged and processed to as pelletized animal feed. Diseases, which are a limiting factor in grain sorghum production across the humid southeastern states, may significantly reduce not only the biomass yield of both forage and sweet sorghum but also sugar content in the stalks and ultimately sugar and ethanol yield. Similarly, insect pests such the sugarcane borer, chinch bugs, and lesser cornstalk borer may also reduce biomass or sugar yield as well as increase lodging levels. In contrast to grain sorghum, impact of cropping history as well as other production practices such as tillage, row spacing, harvest timing, and variety selection on the diseases anthracnose, zonate leaf spot, and rough leaf spot as well as the previously mentioned insect pests and possibly plant parasitic nematode such as cotton root knot on wet and dry matter yield as well as estimated sugar and ethanol yield of forage and sweet sorghum has not been determined. While this project will address factors that influence production of forage sorghum as a cellulosic feedstock as well as sweet sorghum for both sugar and feedstock production, focus will be placed on the influence of diseases and to a lesser extent nematodes and insect pests on the production and economics of forage and sweet sorghum as a potential biofuel. Project results will provide a greater understanding of the diseases and other pest systems that affect forage and sweet sorghum yield components, particularly in Alabama's humid climate and will also clarify questions concerning the development of a cropping system for high biomass production employing optimal tillage, rotation sequences, as well as variety selections to minimize the occurrence and severity of diseases and other pests to maximize sorghum and rotation partner yield and profit potential. In addition to data on sorghum production and yield potential, we will initiate an economic analysis that can provide reliable information on potential feedstock/sugar yield toward establishing a viable biofuel feedstock production in Alabama. Study results will be transmitted to clientele groups via presentations and distribution of on-line and printed reports along with posters and presentations at commercial and academic meetings."

Because new crops are being grown where cotton has been historically monocultured, the presence and number of plant-parasitic nematodes will likely change. Very little data is available on the economic importance of root-knot, reniform, or lesion nematodes in soybean, peanut, grain sorghum, watermelons, potatoes, or sweet potatoes in Arkansas, but changing cropping systems will alter the nematode communities throughout the state. These changes, will likely create new concerns in some crops, but will also provide an opportunity to manage certain nematodes via crop rotation in areas where diverse cropping systems did not exist. This project will evaluate the current situation regarding the incidence and distribution of known economic nematodes that exist in the state, including a thorough survey of species of root-knot nematodes that are present. Field experience will be obtained through small-plot and microplot studies with various cropping sequences that are either already being practiced by growers or are being seriously considered for economic reasons. The knowledge that is gained from these studies over the next five years will provide a basis for developing rational and effective crop rotation strategies for minimizing the impact of nematodes, an approach that will become increasingly necessary in the face of declining availability of chemical nematicides and increases in nematicide costs."

We focus on inferences of 3-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins encoded in thousands of genomes and their associated molecular functions. The analysis encompasses the proteomes of many cellular organisms of crucial significance to agriculture, including model plant systems such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula, plants of economic importance such as soybean, sorghum and Populus, and photosynthesizing microbes such as Chlorella sp. and Chamydomonas reinhardii that are of potential interest for biofuel production. Analysis also includes organisms that exhibit symbiotic and pathogenic lifestyles and represent important beneficial agents and pests that affect crop production. Examples include nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Bradyrhizobium sp. and Sinorhizobium meliloti, symbiotic basidiomycete fungi such as Laccaria bicolor, or deadly plant pathogens such as Phytophthora ramorum or Phytophthora sojae. The genomic sequences of plant pathogens for example provide important information that can help us better understand plant disease and evolution of pathogenicity. Oomycetes and fungi for example have evolved biotrophy on plant hosts several times independently. We need to understand the underlying causes of these episodes of convergent evolution so that we can combat and prevent the rise of plant diseases caused by rusts and mildews (e.g. Puccinia graminis, Ustilago maydis, Tuber melanosporum). These organisms are probably the world's most serious plant disease agents. In particular, soybean rust caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi impacts global soybean production and its genetic structure and diversity was explored using molecular markers. However, genomic information and functional annotations are expected to extend knowledge of the diversity and evolution of this important pathogen. Proteomic analysis of cellular organisms will be also extended to plant viruses, including important model systems such as tobacco and cauliflower mosaic viruses (TMV and CaMV) and viruses that cause important plant diseases. Collectively, viruses such as TMV and many others from 49 viral families impact world agriculture and cause annual losses in crop yields of the order of $60 billion. Some plant viruses not only affect agriculture but also human health, such as the pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), which also causes diseases in humans. This highlights the range of hosts that viruses can adopt and their possible ecological impact as well as their potential to spread genetic information."

The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 calls for 36 billion gallons/year of biofuels by 2022 to reduce national dependence on foreign oil of which about 21 billion gallons are to be from sources such as lignocellulosic biomass. New dedicated energy crops are essential to provide lignocellulosic biomass to meet targeted demands for biofuels production in addition to corn grain and stover. A number of annual and perennial C4 grasses, and herbaceous crops and trees, such as Miscanthus, switchgrass, willow, sweet sorghum, etc. are currently identified as potential sources of lignocellulosic biomass. Rapid determination of biomass composition is critical for the screening and selection of Miscanthus genotypes with properties suitable for conversion to bioenergy, biofuels, and renewable chemicals. Variation in Miscanthus biomass composition can be used to identify and breed for superior germplasm with enhanced lignocellulosic properties conducive to bioenergy and renewable chemical generation. Objective 2: Modifying phytochemical profiles in Brassica oleracea vegetables to enhance their health promotion. Brassica oleracea vegetables (subspecies/morphotypes include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, collards and kohlrabi) provide a one-stop source of optimal, bioavailable nutrients with particular importance to low-income communities. The Brassica vegetables are among the richest sources of nutritional phytochemicals in our diets that promote disease prevention. Epidemiological studies and clinical trials indicate that isothiocyanates, carotenoids, tocopherols, flavonoids and other compounds abundant in the Brassica vegetables can act as health-promoting antioxidants and anticancer agents. Substantial variation in the chemical form, concentration, and bioactivity of these compounds occurs within and between Brassica oleracea subspecies. This project will investigate methods to modify health-promoting phytochemical profiles in brassica vegetables by plant breeding, plant transformation, spray application of phytohormones, and by cultural practices. This information will be used in a breeding program to develop brassica vegetable germplasm with enhanced health promotion."

In potatoes, PVY infection reduces yield and quality, and significantly limits the production of certified seed potatoes. Despite various control measures, PVY is a significant concern for potato production in the US and Canada due to the emergence of new strains, particularly ones that cause tuber necrosis. PVY is transmitted by several species of aphids during feeding. Since aphid feeding periods required for transmission are very brief, insecticides do not provide effective control. The use of border crops and biological control of aphids are likely to be important for limiting PVY, and both control methods are related to the configuration of crops and natural habitats in the landscape. However, research at this scale is lacking. In this project, we will study the importance of landscape complexity for the spread of PVY in potatoes in New York State. To address this issue, we will: 1) Identify landscapes of varying complexity in upstate New York using GIS and ground truthing. 2) Quantify the prevalence of different strains of PVY, aphid diversity and abundance, and natural enemy diversity and abundance in potato fields located in simple and complex landscapes. 3) Evaluate the use of sorghum and wheat border crops for reducing PVY transmission in agricultural landscapes. Our approach will include GIS analysis of landscapes, field studies to measure virus prevalence and insect diversity and abundance, lab assays to identify virus strains, and field experiments to determine the efficacy of border crops as barriers to PVY spread. A primary goal of this research is to enhance our understanding of the spread of different PVY strains by both colonizing and non-colonizing aphid species in landscapes of varying complexity and to evaluate the importance of landscape heterogeneity for biological control of PVY transmission. This research will improve our understanding of landscape controls on insect-vectored pathogens and contribute to developing environmentally sound control of PVY, a pathogen of worldwide importance."

During years of extreme pest outbreaks or emergence of a new pest, annual arthropod pest control costs can exceed these amounts by as much as 25-30%. Because of the great potential arthropod pests have for damaging Louisiana's agricultural crops, producers have historically relied heavily on insecticide use strategies to manage these pests. Pesticide use strategies have been most successful when they are combined with other cultural, biological, and plant resistance tools within an IPM system. However, there are numerous obstacles and problems associated with pesticide use strategies in row crops. Widespread use of pesticides can create severe pesticide resistance problems, elevate the pest status of formerly occasional pests, cause pest population resurgences following applications, decrease populations of beneficial insects, increase environmental contamination, resistance and increase toxic effects to non-target organisms. Dramatic changes have occurred across the agricultural landscape during the last 15 years. Specifically, advances in molecular biology have allowed scientists to genetically modify crops that express resistance to arthropod. Since genetically modified crops were introduced in 1996, their use in the United States has grown rapidly, accounting for 80-90 percent of soybean, corn, and cotton acreage in 2009. To date, crops with traits that provide resistance to some herbicides and to specific insect pests have benefited farmers by reducing crop losses to insect damage, increasing flexibility in time management, and by facilitating the use of more environmentally safe pesticides and cultural practices. However, excessive reliance on a single technology combined with a lack of diverse farming practices could undermine the economic and environmental gains from these GM crops. The proposed research project includes multiple achievable goals. Annual pesticide efficacy screening studies provide information to update Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service recommendations of products and document the performance of non-registered products that are in commercial development. This information is used to support changes in crop pest management strategies. One of the most important needs expressed by extension pest management specialists and agricultural consultants is access to recent data detailing the performance of IPM products and strategies. Annual trials are necessary because of the sporadic temporal and spatial occurrence of arthropod pest populations. All IPM and commodity production practices that directly or indirectly affect the need for and use of insecticides must be focused in a holistic manner to further reduce reliance on chemical control measures. Continued research and implementation of sustainable pesticide use strategies are necessary to ensure effective, economical and environmentally acceptable arthropod pest management for Louisiana field crops on a long-term basis."

The five major food crops (corn, wheat, soy, sorghum and rice) in the United States generate about 300 million tons of lignocellulosic crop residues as byproducts every year. These byproducts currently have limited use. These abundant and low cost ($50-$80 per ton) agricultural byproducts are renewable and sustainable without the need for additional natural resources. It has been demonstrated that lignocellulosic byproducts such as corn stover, rice and wheat straw can be used to obtain high quality fibers suitable for textile, composite and other applications (Reddy, 2005, 2006, 2007; Huda, 2008). Cellulose from these lignocellulosics can also be used to generate regenerated cellulose fibers (rayon) or it can be utilized as reinforcing agent or filler to plastics and resins. Similarly, biofuel production from cereal grains generates abundant carbohydrate and protein containing coproducts that have limited applications. For instance, more than 10 million tons of distillers dried grains (DDG) are generated every year and DDG has a selling price of less than $130 per ton, much lower than the current selling price of common thermoplastic polymers such as polypropylene and polyethylene (> $2,000 per ton). It has been demonstrated that coproducts of biofuel production such as distillers dried grains (DDG) can be used to develop thermoplastics (Hu, 2011a,b). Developing biobased products from agricultural byproducts and coproducts as well as wastes has the potential to increase income from the crops while benefits the farmers and biofuel industries economically and reduces our dependence on petroleum based resources. The new value-added products will increase income from crop production, help to establish small businesses and create new jobs leading to economic benefits. Similarly, biobased products can replace synthetic polymers based products and benefit the environment. Adding value to the coproducts of biofuel production will help to reduce the cost of biofuels and make biofuels competitive to fossil fuels and reduce our dependence on foreign sources for energy. This multi-state proposal provides an opportunity for experts in biobased products to collaborate synergistically and develop unique biobased products. Without such an effort, it may be difficult to commercialize biobased products, improve income from agriculture, reduce cost of biofuels and have a sustainable and economically competitive biobased industry. Similarly, methods to conserve energy and water and develop novel technologies to treat textile waste water will help to reduce cost of textile processing and pollution and help to make the textile industry environmentally friendly. This will give a competitive edge to the US textile industry and, in addition, will potentially save billions of cubic meters of water."

Also lacking is the agronomic management strategies that may increase quality and quantities of extracted juice, and its ethanol yield potential. With increasing availability of land resulting from a reduction in acreage under tobacco production in southeast Virginia, sweet sorghum production may be an viable alternative enterprise to increase revenue sources for southeast Virginia producers. However, prior to availability of large scale fully operational bioenergy refineries, there is a need for research to gather enough data to equip producers with the skill set needed for sweet sorghum production management. Data from the research will be used to guide the development of recommendation on sweet sorghum production and on-farm juice extraction and processing."

However, there are many parts of this market which are not being fulfilled; two of the missing pieces are various styles of gluten-free beers (e.g. IPAs, stouts, porters, etc.) and gluten-free malts for the craft brewer, microbrewer, brewpub, and homebrewer who want to make their own gluten-free beer. To address these shortcomings, it is necessary to produce gluten-free malts from which beer can be brewed. The two approaches to produce gluten-free malts are to use gluten-free grains or to reduce the gluten content of existing malts. We have chosen to use gluten-free sorghum to produce gluten-free malts. The proposed research and development initiative focuses on developing new gluten-free malts based on New Mexico grown sorghum to provide the necessary ingredients to produce a wide range of gluten-free beer styles. The research will initially focus on developing three types of malt from sorghum: base malts which provide the majority of sugars for fermentation; caramel malts which provide body, color, sweetness, and head retention; and roasted malts which provide flavors such as coffee and chocolate and color. By blending these malts in different proportions and by carefully selecting the hops and yeast used in brewing, a wide range of styles from pale ales to stouts and porters can be made. Once optimum process conditions for producing the gluten-free malts have been identified, the project will shift focus to how the malts can be used. Here, attention will be given to the production of wort (the sugar containing solution that is fermented into beer) using the gluten-free malts. Of concern is the possible lack of the enzymes necessary to convert carbohydrates into fermentable sugars. The necessary chemistry and engineering studies to obtain an optimum conversion will be conducted. When successfully completed, this project should result in a wide range of gluten-free malts suitable for brewing. These malts could be sold in packages ranging from 1 pound bags for homebrewers to 50 pound sacks for micro- and craft brewers, to truck and train loads for regional brewers. Given the current retail prices for similar barley products (a single pound sells for $1.50 to $3.00 while a 50 pound bag sells for $50 to $70), these represent a significant value added opportunity for New Mexico sorghum growers."

Should the fertilize be appled before harvest of the planted crop versus after harvest Should urease inhibitors such as Agrotain be used This information will enable the grower to best utilize N fertilizer, not only improving profitability but also reducing pollution risks to the environment. Finally, corn, grain sorghum and small grains OVT's are a critical component of agronomic research that provides the grower with the ability to select hybrids/varieties based on unbiased research conducted near their locale (similar soils and environments)."

Although annual warm-season grasses require production cost from annual planting, crops such as sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), sweet millet (Pennisetum glaucum), photoperiod sensitive sweet sorghum, and low lignin type summer annuals may retain different aspects of advantage recognizable from perennial type grasses for biomass production. Sorghum and pearl millet species are productive over a wide expanse of the US with considerable differences in growing conditions. This creates a broad range of management options such that optimum planting date, harvest maturity, selection of cultivars, and development of cropping systems, etc. Several interrelated studies are proposed in this proposal to assess management options targeting sustainable biomass production for emerging biofuel industry and also alternatively for livestock operations. Development of nutrient management enhancing biomass production which sustains soil nutrient pools would provide a long term benefit. The high demand on feedstock in the future will require strategies for maintaining soil nutrients to provide consistent biofuel feedstock production. Diversity of feedstock production, especially cultivating crops not sharing a growing season, may expand annual biofuel feedstock availability. As an emerging oil seed producing crop in the US, canola cultivation may become a valuable winter crop component in a double cropping system along with warm-season annual grasses. Although major canola cultivation has been limited to Canada and the northern U.S.A., field trials in Florida and Alabama have indicated greater yield potential because of the longer growing season. In every year since 2007, warm season annual grass cultivations have experienced a certain degree of lodging in LA when a severe weather event occurs particularly during the hurricane season. Probably, lodging will be one of the major problems degrading economic gains from sweet sorghum cultivation, which has not been only seen in LA but also appeared in research from other inland states. Sorghums lodged by heavy rain and strong wind are often under stress from dehydration due to broken stems and exposed roots in the aftermath of severe weather. In winter, warm-season perennial grass harvest can be often delayed because of continuous rain and wet soil conditions. Delayed harvest could result in substantial loss of biomass through broken stems, losing tillers and leaves, and eventually affect the recovery of the biomass and quality. It would be advantageous to assess potential yield and quality loss from various field conditions."

Production practices of these two crops are changing rapidly as specialty production and biotechnology traits are adopted by farmers'. At present specialty crop options are well developed for maize, while these are emerging for sorghum. Limited information is available regarding how agronomic production practices influence grain quality, especially in grain sorghum. Optimizing yields and resource use efficiency of corn and sorghum are critical for both commodity and specialty grain production. Yield component analysis is a way to better understand changes in crop yield due to improved management, and relates to several grain quality attributes. Updating recommendations for row spacing, plant populations and N management of maize and sorghum remain important to producers, and may become of greater importance if genetic gains plateau as projected by some agronomic scientists. Future release of biotechnology traits promise to offer additional options for production of specialty grain, and increase the potential for more efficient use of water, N and other production inputs."

Improvements in the efficiency of cattle production are likely to be related to increases in availability of products (e.g., beef, milk, leather), improved economics related to production, and reductions in environmental impacts. Cattle in intensive production systems are often limited most by energy available to support physiologically productive purposes. Thus, rapidly growing or lactating cattle often consume diets that contain appreciable amounts of starch from cereal grains (e.g., corn, wheat, sorghum). Typically, cattle diets are designed to optimize ruminal fermentation of cereal grains because these diets generally have greater total tract digestion of starch. However, data indicate that small intestinal digestion of starch in cattle may be 30 to 42% more energetically efficient, and this may allow for considerable improvements in the overall efficiency of cattle production. Additionally, ruminal fermentation of starch has potential for production of methane and can be related to increased incidences of metabolic disorders. Therefore, small intestinal digestion of starch in cattle may provide opportunity to increase efficiency of cattle production and decrease environmental impacts. Unfortunately, the extent with which cattle apparently digest starch in the small intestine is less than nonruminants, and these limitations preclude benefits from shifting the site of starch digestion from the rumen to the small intestine. Previous data indicate that considerable improvements are possible to the extent with which cattle digest starch in the small intestine. If a greater understanding of small intestinal starch digestion in cattle is achieved this may allow for dietary manipulations and feed technologies that augment small intestinal starch digestion and facilitate considerable improvements in the utility of dietary energy by cattle. If improvements in small intestinal starch digestion can be realized then it is likely that the efficiency of cattle production could be significantly improved. This project will use cattle that allow for study of small intestinal starch digestion, and generate new knowledge that may be used to improve the efficiency with which cattle use dietary energy."

Environmental factors such as drought, chilling and excessive heat can damage or impair photosynthetic processes. Our research goal is to increase knowledge of the response of photosynthesis to environmental factors (excessive heat, cold, and drought as well as use of nitrogen and water) that limit plant productivity. Our studies will be conducted under field and controlled environment conditions, with emphasis on whole-plant responses. We will use standard techniques such as canopy temperature measurements, gas exchange instrumentation, leaf fluorescence, pollen viability, seed-set percentage, and harvest index to quantify effects of heat stress, and develop remote sensing methods for assessing stress responses in the field. We will apply these techniques to evaluate genotypes of sorghum, wheat and soybean to identify tolerance to drought or heat stress. For example, to assess drought stress, canopy conductance will be inferred from digital images which provide information about leaf photosynthetic activity. As a consequence, new methods of evaluating plant performance, under stress conditions (including remote sensing) will become available and will lead to a refinement of our understanding of the impacts of these stresses on plant growth. Genes or metabolic pathways associated with water- and nitrogen-use efficiency and tolerance to temperature extremes and drought will be identified in wheat, soybean and sorghum. New stress tolerant crop hybrids and varieties, including those with greater nitrogen- and water-use efficiency, will be developed by manipulating the genes or pathways associated with environmental limitations to photosynthesis.

CRMs are DNA sequences that comprise a fundamental component of the mechanisms that orchestrate transcriptional programs - both during development, and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Thus, CRMs are key for biological functions that allow plants to grow and efficiently respond to their environment. However, it is currently very difficult to predict CRM activity based solely on available genomic sequences. This project should address this difficulty by testing a generalizable, genome-wide computational approach (&#39;fractionation mutagenesis&#39;) for predicting the identity and function of CRMs. As a test model of biological interest, the project will focus on genetic control of tip-growth in two model cell types: root hairs and pollen tubes. Tip growth is directly tied to plant productivity, as pollen tubes are key for seed set and fruit development, and root hairs assist in the nutrient and water acquisition that sustains plant growth. Expression data for each of these cell types in maize and sorghum will be generated via a combination of extraordinarily-precise laser microdissection with next generation sequencing methods (RNA-Seq). Using these RNA-Seq data along with computational analyses of evolutionary changes in the maize and sorghum genomes, functional predictions for putative CRMs will be made across the genome. Predicted CRMs will then be tested for their activity in regulating transcription in these tip-growing cell types via transient transformation. The project should reveal the strengths and weaknesses of this computational approach, as well as some of the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation in tip-growing cells."

The overall objective of this project is to evaluate and develop this trait as a tool to improve drought tolerance in maize and eventually other crops. Specifically, we will: 1. Confirm the physiological utility of CCFN for root growth, soil exploration, and water capture from drying soil in controlled environments. 2. Identify genes underlying natural variation in CCFN and develop stocks that will support mechanistic assessment of its regulation and utility. 3. Evaluate the utility of CCFN for drought tolerance in the field in rainout shelters in PA and a field research facility in AZ. Defining and understanding traits enhancing drought tolerance is of considerable importance for keeping American agriculture competitive while ending world hunger, as well as adapting to climate change, two of NIFA&#39;s grand challenges. CCFN could be an entirely new tool for improving drought tolerance of crops. In addition to drought, CCFN may be useful in the acquisition of limiting soil nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. While this project focuses on maize, we have observed variation for CCFN in rice, sorghum, and common bean, so this trait may have broad utility. This project therefore addresses novel scientific issues that are of demonstrable relevance to human welfare."

This project will develop management practices and identify forage genotypes that are resilient under variable climate and will increase forage productivity and input use-efficiency on livestock farms at a range of scales. Commensurate with the scope of the location as a Long-Term Agroecosystem Research network site, we will initiate assessments of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and agricultural production under different livestock systems of the Southern Great Plains, including both native prairie and wheat pasture.  Data from this study will be pooled with results from similar flux studies in the region to evaluate climate and environmental impacts on system response.  To evaluate system resilience, over-utilized prairie ecological sites with a mix of native and introduced species indicative of good and poor condition mixed grass prairie will be used to evaluate the use of infrequent, high-intensity grazing on succession and diversity of forage species at the sites. The impact of prior encroachment of redcedar on old-field nutrient and seedbank reserves and consequent recovery of understory and grass species following removal of redcedar will be assessed.  The use of legumes and grasses as green manure sources will be researched for summer (sorghum) and winter (wheat) grain crops to promote efficiency of N and water use.  Nitrogen turnover and utilization by the subsequent crop will be assessed.  Also, N-uptake and efficiency of utilization of cool-season annual and perennial species will be measured in greenhouse experiments to develop screening methods for plant germplasm.  Improved management methods will be developed to fully utilize the genetic potential of new cultivars by enhancing establishment, yields, and utilization by livestock. To increase marketing options of livestock producers, we will determine appropriate forage resources for production of farm-finished beef, either on all forage or with limited grain inputs.  Interactions of animal genetic type (frame score) and finishing system (forage or grain) will be assessed.  Time-series data from ryegrass trials in four southern states in the last decade will serve as the basis for examining the possible importance of 5-day and 7-day summary weather statistics of the near-surface environment, and the variations of those statistics around decade-long averages, as a predictor for seasonal production.

Improve the productivity, quality, and persistence of warm-season grasses grown for forages, bioenergy, and turf by enhancing germplasm to increase stress tolerance under a variety of environmental conditions and improving tools that will efficiently assess forage quality.   2. Develop improved production strategies that include warm-season grasses, legumes, and winter cover crops to meet life-cycle objectives for feedstock production and quality, carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas emission reductions for the Southeast regional conditions.  Approach: Objective 1: Three bermudagrass populations with desirable traits for forage, good seed production, and synchronous pollination will be used in a system of recombinant recurrent selection to develop a uniform, highly productive seeded bermudagrass for forage and/or turf.  Multiple cycles of selection and crossing will be done to create populations that will be tested in multiple replicates at different locations.  In napiergrass, a similar approach will be developed to develop vegetatively propagated high yielding, disease resistant genotypes for multiple location testing and eventual release.  Also for napiergrass, sequence data generated from genomic DNA from the cultivar Merkeron will be used to mine single sequence repeat (SSRs) markers and match them with genotypic traits of interest as marker assisted selection.  Similarly, SSR markers will be developed for salt tolerance in segregating populations of seashore paspalum.  Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) will be developed as a tool to screen for forage and biomass quality from available genotypes with diverse cell wall characteristics.  Non-grain sorghum germplasm from multiple sources will be evaluated in replicated trials in the field and greenhouse for susceptibility to anthracnose, root-knot nematodes, and fall armyworm.  Selected lines will be used as parents to test hybrids for biotic stress and yield characteristics for eventual public release.  Linkage maps will be developed for markers of biotic traits.  Objective 2: Replicated tests will be performed to determine appropriate nitrogen-fixing winter legume cover crops (clovers and alfalfa) for use in forage bermudagrass (Tifton 85, Russell) to reduce fertilizer applications and improve forage quality.  Similar tests will be conducted for efficient production of biomass from energy cane, napiergrass and biomass sorghum (rotated with traditional row crops).  Winter cover crops (lupine, clover, others) will be tested against inorganic and unfertilized controls to determine efficient ways of reducing inorganic fertilizer use.  These replicated tests will be conducted at multiple sites.  Production systems will be tested to determine water and nutrient requirements for maximum biomass yields of napiergrass using a replicated split block design with three irrigation rates and six fertilizer treatments.  In collaboration with other research units, greenhouse gas emission comparisons will be determined for the cropping systems of biomass crops as well as for forage bermudagrass cultivars compared to traditional row crops."

Over the next five years, the following specific objectives will be addressed:  Objective 1:  Determine and manipulate the genetic, biochemical and physiological mechanisms controlling the biological pathways involved in non-grain energy sorghum germplasm. Sub-objective 1.A:  Determine the effects of six newly identified brown midrib (bmr) mutants on lignin synthesis and the monolignol biosynthetic pathway. Sub-objective 1.B:  Develop transgenic lines over-expressing genes in monolignol biosynthesis to determine their impact on lignin content and composition.

The project will conduct basic studies on the genetic, biochemical, and physiological mechanisms affecting the composition of sorghum biomass and its conversion to liquid fuels.  The focus will be on decreasing or increasing lignin content and/or modifying its composition and on increasing sugar content and yield for juice extraction.  Low lignin is desirable for the saccharification and fermentation conversion process while high lignin concentration is desirable for conversion via pyrolysis.  The impacts of fungal pathogens on sorghum with compositionally modified biomass will be determined.  Germplasm with desirable genes affecting the conversion of sorghum biomass to energy will be developed, fully characterized, and released and deposited in Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) for use by public and private sector plant breeders for developing improved hybrids and cultivars.  The project consists of three integrated components: germplasm development, molecular biology, and plant pathology (Figure 1).  Molecular and conventional methodologies will be utilized, and the project scale will range from field-level to gene-level. The project also has extensive formal and informal collaborations enhancing our ability to conduct this research.  Anticipated products include improved sorghum germplasm for the sorghum seed industry with enhanced energy traits and biotic stress tolerance, and tools to assess the biological pathways that impact bioenergy traits and fungal pathogen responses of sorghum."

Sorghum breeding stocks, landraces, and elite tropical sorghums will be phenotyped and genotyped with an amalgamation of approaches, and knowledge of the genetic basis for key traits that impact productivity will be acquired. New sorghum genetic stocks will be developed, characterized, and released with new genes and traits not presently available to sorghum breeders. Specifically, during the next five years the project will focus on the following objectives. Objective 1: Develop and use markers in molecular marker-assisted approaches to introgress day-neutral flowering response into elite tropical sorghums and thereby create new sources of temperate-zone adapted sorghum germplasm. Objective 2: Identify genes and alleles in sorghum breeding stocks for pollen fertility restoration, and exploit this information to accelerate development of new parental lines. Subobjective 2.A: Identify an exhaustive set of fertility restoration (Rf) and partial fertility (Pf) genes in cultivated sorghum using genetic linkage analysis, association mapping methodology, and bioinformatics. Subobjective 2.B: Elucidate the genetic and molecular basis of cytoplasmic male-sterility (CMS) in sorghum A1 cytoplasm by sequencing mitochondrial genes and transcripts in CMS- and normal cytoplasms, and examine the effect of Rf genes and unfavorable temperatures on the expression of CMS-associated genes.  Approach: The long-term goal of this project is to utilize recent advances in high-throughput genotyping, bioinformatics, and molecular biology to acquire knowledge of sorghum genes and germplasm, and utilize this information to enhance the rate of genetic gain for complex traits such as grain yield through the development of new adapted breeding material.  The challenge facing scientists is how to exploit the vast amount of knowledge and tools in molecular biology, genomics, and bioinformatics to accelerate the rate of genetic gain in applied breeding programs.  We have targeted several agronomically critical objectives that include introgressing day-neutral flowering response into elite tropical sorghums to create new sources of temperate-zone adapted sorghum germplasm, and identifying genes and alleles in sorghum breeding stocks for pollen fertility restoration, and exploit this information to accelerate development of new parental lines. In ongoing collaboration with scientists at Texas A&M University and private sector plant breeders at MMR Genetic LLC, a classical breeding approach augmented with robust genomic and bioinformatics tools will be used to identify elite tropical sorghums and convert these lines to temperate adaptation.  The approach developed under Objective 1 will introduce new germplasm and favorable genes for complex traits, including grain yield, into sorghum breeding programs in the USA and worldwide.  In ongoing collaborations with our collaborators in Queensland and Perth, we will use genetic linkage analysis, association mapping methodology, and bioinformatics under Objective 2.A to identify an exhaustive set of fertility restoration (Rf) and partial fertility (Pf) genes.  Under Objective 2.B, we will sequence mitochondrial genes and transcripts in CMS- and normal cytoplasms, and examine the effect of Rf genes and unfavorable temperatures on the expression of CMS-associated genes.  Through the combined approaches outlined under Objectives 2A. and 2B. we will elucidate the genetic and molecular basis of cytoplasmic male-sterility (CMS) in sorghum A1 cytoplasm. The overall approach of objective 2 will permit breeders to exploit this information to accelerate development of new parental lines for hybrid production fields.  Objectives 1 and 2 are complementary, and the knowledge gained under one objective will facilitate the success in all."

Identify new sources of maize germplasm with resistance to aflatoxin and insects, and identify new sources of sorghum germplasm with improved insect resistance. 1A. Evaluate exotic maize germplasm from the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) program, International Center for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat (CIMMYT), and the U.S. maize germplasm collection for resistance to infection by Aspergillus flavus and aflatoxin contamination. 1B.

Develop maize and sorghum germplasm adapted to the southeastern United States with enhanced resistance to diseases and insects. 2A. Develop maize germplasm with reduced aflatoxin accumulation, increased resistance to insects, and enhanced agronomic performance in the southern Coastal Plain region. 2B. Develop sorghum germplasm with improved disease and insect resistance and high yield potential.  Approach: Objective 1:  Exotic maize germplasm from the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) Program, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (or CIMMYT), Mexico, and the U.S. maize germplasm collection will be screened for resistance to multiple insects and diseases, and reduced aflatoxin contamination.  Equal priority will be given to the GEM and exotic germplasm, since the GEM germplasm will likely have better agronomic traits but the exotic germplasm may have better adaptation to the South.  Such a combination has the potential that allows us to identify new germplasm resistant to multiple insects, diseases, and reduced mycotoxin contaminations.  To effectively serve the seed industries, the screenings of maize insect pests will focus on ear- and kernel-feeding insects, in particular, stink bugs, sap beetles, thrips and maize weevil.  The genetic and biochemical bases for the biotic stress resistance in these newly identified germplasm lines will be further examined.  Three genetic studies (i.e., diallel analysis, xenia effect, and heterosis) will be used to elucidate the genetic mechanisms, whereas phytoalexins and other secondary metabolites of plants will be examined to elucidate biochemical and physiological bases of biotic stress resistance.  A similar approach is utilized for the screening of sorghum germplasm for resistance to multiple biotic stress factors.  Previously identified disease resistant and agronomically-elite germplasm in the U.S. germplasm collection will be screened for resistance to fall armyworm, foliar anthracnose disease, and sorghum midge.  The genetic mechanisms of insect and disease resistance will be examined utilizing three genetic studies (i.e., North Carolina Design II, heterosis, and xenia effect).  The contributions of the secondary metabolites to biotic stress resistance in sorghum will also be examined.   Objective 2:  New maize breeding crosses will be made by recombining germplasm with superior agronomic traits with the newly identified germplasm that confers multiple insect and disease resistance and with reduced mycotoxin contamination.  New maize germplasm will be developed by continuously screening and continuous self-pollination of the segregating populations.  At the same time, recombinant inbred lines (RILs) will also be developed to identify DNA markers for the newly-developed multiple pest-resistant maize germplasm lines.    New sorghum breeding crosses will also be made using the newly identified sorghum germplasm lines that are resistant to multiple biotic stresses and with good yield potential.  The breeding crosses will be continuously screened and selected, and self-pollinated to develop and release new sorghum germplasm lines (B lines, or maintainer lines).

If successful, this project will generate a new paradigm for the study of abiotic stress tolerance in maize and other C4 plants and the immediate improvement of crop abiotic stress tolerance by the plant breeding industry. It could also enable scientists to rapidly predict the consequence of genotype on adaptation to increasing temperature, decreasing water arability, and other predicted outcomes of global climate change. A postdoctoral scientist will receive training and mentorship in the integration of high throughput phenotyping, bioinformatics and quantitative genetics.  All data generated in this study will be accessible through iHUB (www.ionomicshub.org) and the Purdue University Research Repository (http://purr.purdue.edu). Many phenotypes used for drought tolerance estimation in plants are slow, costly, and of insufficient heritability to make substantial progress connecting genotype to phenotype. Measures of water relations often assess dynamic responses of the plant to the local environment, are strongly influenced by temporal factors and unusable for genetics. The absence of high throughput quantitative phenotyping approaches (e.g. phenomics) that precisely report the integrative physiological status of field-grown plants is hampering the discovery of molecular mechanisms of plant adaptation. This problem is particularly notable in plants with C4 photosynthesis and has limited the discovery of the mechanisms controlling water use in these drought adaptable species and inhibited crop improvement in maize and in many target biofuel crops including sorghum and switchgrass. Preliminary data suggests a correlation between delta-13C, the ratio of stable isotopes 13C:12C, and yield under drought and the relationship between delta-13C, water relations, and photosynthetic capacity in C4 plants. This EAGER project will test the hypothesis that the combination of water-soluble element accumulation and carbon isotope ratios in mature maize kernels can predict adaptation to drought. The specific objectives include a genome-wide assessment of genetic contribution to these traits by genome-wide association study. Both traits will be assessed within an association panel of maize in the field under a managed drought environment."

One of the ways to determine if a biomass feedstock will maintain its quality under different storage conditions is to develop its moisture sorption isotherms. There are three major issues associated with the traditional method of using saturated salt solutions in desiccators to conduct moisture sorption studies: 1) lengthy period of time required to achieve equilibrium (four weeks for a single temperature), 2) difficulty of obtaining accurate measurements due to the protocol of continuously removing the biomass sample and exposing it to lab environment which often has a different relative humidity and temperature, and 3) the time-consuming, cumbersome steps required of the researcher to obtain weight measurements for the duration of the equilibration period. By acquiring an AquaLab Vapor Sorption Analyzer (Model No. 40430, Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA), both static and dynamic vapor sorption analysis can be performed with ease.Technical DescriptionDevelopment of biomass feedstock moisture sorption isotherms at different temperatures and relative humidities will provide critical information in determining how a biomass feedstock will react in different climates, and thus aid in establishing the optimal storage, transportation, and drying conditions. The proposed instrument will be used to study the equilibrium moisturecharacteristics of several biomass feedstocks. More specifically, the AquaLab Vapor Sorption Analyzer (VSA) would provide the PI the opportunity for conducting the following research activities: (1) determination of moisture sorption characteristics of sweet sorghum, energycane, napiergrass, and Paulownia; and (2) evaluation of isotherm models for describing isotherm sorption data for sweet sorghum, energycane, napiergrass, and Paulownia."

They play important roles in grain yield and biomass accumulation, and understanding the genetic signals that regulate the number, size and fertility of tillers is of critical importance for optimizing yield potential in the world's major food, animal feed and biofuel grass crops. In addition, the initiation of tillers is important for perenniality in many grasses, and as such, full knowledge of the tillering pathway will contribute to the development of perennial biofuel and grain crops. The panicoid grasses are immensely important for all of these uses, and the full suite of genes that comprise the tillering pathway and the components that have been selected during domestication are largely unknown.  This project exploits evolutionary variation and changes during domestication in three panicoid cereals (maize, sorghum and foxtail millet) and their wild, highly tillered ancestors to uncover the genetic regulation and evolutionary modification of tillering.  Forward and reverse genetic approaches and transcriptomic analysis in both ancestral and domesticated backgrounds will provide insight into the gene networks necessary for growth and development of tillers in panicoid grasses. It is anticipated that the results from this comparative project will extend to and inform experiments across a wide range of agronomically important taxa.In addition to training postdoctoral associates and graduate and undergraduate students, this project aims to immerse high school science teachers from rural schools and from areas serving high proportions of underrepresented student populations in a research environment that will be combined with professional development activities. This immersion experience will help educators gain an explicit view of how scientific knowledge is generated and will assist with their own curriculum development.  They will implement this new content knowledge and pedagogical skills into their existing curriculum, mentoring students and preservice teachers in student research projects, and coaching students in science fair competitions.  Scientific findings and educational outreach experiences will be shared at science and education conferences and through publication in scientific and practitioner journals. All data produced in this project will be accessible through a project website (http://tillering.okstate.edu) and long-term through public repositories including GenBank, Gramene, MaizeGDB and PLEXdb.

The infestation occurred on grain sorghums as well as bioenergy and forage sorghums. Currently, the infestation intensified in the core infestation zone of the TX/LA Gulf Coast, and spread north into OK and the Mississippi Delta (MS, AR). Current and further expansion is occurring from annual aphid flights of Gulf Coast overwintering aphid progeny. Grower associations have estimated an economic impact annually of $60--140M in the current core infestation zone of TX/LA. From work sponsored by a one-yr IPM grant, improved detection and insecticide use reduced economic impact. Preliminary data justify research to shift judicious but arguably wide-area application of insecticides based on sampling (early stage IPM), to more fine-tuned thresholds integrated with plant resistance and natural enemies (advanced IPM). Objectives take an interdisciplinary IPM approach (e.g., economic threshold studies integrated with natural enemy and resistant sorghum assessment) appropriate to address invasives such as this aphid on sorghum, and promote diversity and integration of tactics leading to a more stable management system for this new pest of sorghum.The project will 1.

Many biomass feedstocks destined for conversion platforms must be dried, however, the capital cost for dryers is high due to long residence times and the operating cost is high due to system inefficiencies. Consistent and reliable operation of biomass dryers is problematic across emerging and rapidly expanding biofuel firms due to inexperience of operators and lack of knowledge about drying characteristics of their feedstocks. This project will develop advanced, retrofit-able dryer control systems utilizing modern sensor equipment as well as high pressure low temperature down draft drying methods that optimize final moisture content, energy input, and capital costs that can be applied to both new and existing dryers. During this project we will develop a table of drying properties for bioenergy feedstocks of switchgrass, miscanthus, sorghum, high-moisture baled corn stover, and poplar chips. We will also formulate a physics-based drying model for moving bed dryers relevant to a model based control system in order to minimize drying time and energy consumption.Products of this research will include a table of important drying parameters for select crops as well as a model based control system for dryers.

In an analysis of actions needed to achieve the bold projections of the current, aggressive biofuel agenda (700 million tons/year), Fales et al. (2007) prioritize the development of new crops and cropping systems that enhance the capture of C on croplands with improved use-efficiency of inputs including water and N. Our earlier studies (Cherney et al., 1991) revealed that sorghum biomass production exceeding 25 Mg ha-1 and it thrived on marginal soils where biofuels cropping is likely to occur. On-going bioenergy crop work with Gebisa Ejeta has identified three sorghums with desirable feedstock traits and apparent high N use efficiency (NUE). Potential herbaceous perennials being considered for biofuels include switchgrass and Miscanthus. Switchgrass is a warm-season (C4) perennial grass that is very productive during warmer, drier summer months and has demonstrated potential in the U.S. cornbelt. Miscanthus is also a warm-season grass, but Miscanthus has been hypothesized to be superior to switchgrass in both biomass productivity and NUE. To date, however, Miscanthus production has been confined to the European Union and only limited data exist on potential productivity and nutrient management in the United States. Native grasses also have been advocated as a low-input, sustainable biofuels feedstock (Tilman et al, 2006). The relative merits of each of these systems needs to be documented and integrated into a full environmental and economic accounting. Ecological data from comprehensive comparisons for existing systems are limited and data for more novel systems (switchgrass for biomass, Miscanthus, and sorghum and maize with residue removal) are entirely lacking."

The main thrust on crop management research is to be directed to cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and grain sorghum (Sorghum biM AgriLife Research Center at Corpus Christi as well as in the State of Texas. Soil water deficit is the most dominant yield-limiting environmental factor in drought-prone Texas croplands. Statewide crop production could be significantly increased and become more stable with improved irrigation management and the use of improved drought-tolerant cultivars, as this would reduce the negative impacts of water deficits on yield and quality. Improvement of irrigation management focusing on use efficient systems, timing, frequency and amount of water applications and the availability of commercial cultivars with improved drought-tolerance would help growers to produce more from every raindrop and every gallon of irrigated water, the latter contributing also to conservation of water resources. The objectives of this project are: 1) characterize the water economy of a selected group of cotton genotypes provided by AgriLife&#39;s breeding programs and seed companies (also expandable to other crop species such as grain sorghum and sugarcane), discern the associated anatomical and physiological attributes controlling their water use, and transfer this information back to breeders and geneticists to advance the development of drought-tolerant cultivars; and 2) enhance the Web-based Crop-Weather Program for South Texas by expanding the network of weather stations providing quality weather data for its suite of crop management tools and developing additional tools for simulating yield and fiber quality in cotton, as well as crop growth and yield and water use for other economically important crops such as grain sorghum and sugarcane."

Specifically, drought occurring at the post-anthesis stage inflicts extremely severe damages to plant production. With the threat of more frequent and severe drought episodes due to global warming, selecting for plants&#39; natural drought tolerance is the only viable and sustainable method to quell the issue of water unavailability. Besides being one of the most important crops, sorghum is also one of the best adapted cereals to abiotic stress; the high tolerance to drought exhibited by certain sorghum cultivars such as SC56 is, therefore, crucial for plant improvement to drought stress. In order to release better resistant sorghum elite varieties, plant breeders and researchers directed their efforts towards identifying quantitative traits loci (QTLs) for tolerance to drought stress. Such efforts culminated in the mapping of several QTLs related to tolerance to drought stress at the reproductive stage. To date, however, there has been no gene expression investigation related to this character. This project proposes to instigate the identification of genes that are involved in the late stage drought tolerance in sorghum cultivar SC56.

The PI will continue to develop a comprehensive program on arthropods important to human and animal health and agriculture. The PI&#39;s program is centered in the Grand Challenges identified by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at TAMU: 1) Feeding the world, 2) Protecting our environment, 3) Improving our health, 4) Enriching our youth and 5) Improving our economy. Specifically the PI is strongly positioned for the first three, with emphasis in arthropod vectors of disease, and decreasing the burden of insecticide resistance both in agricultural and urban pests, which in turns protects the environment and human and animal health by avoiding application of ineffective pesticides. Similarly protecting ecosystem services such as those provided by polinators (honey bees, native solitary bees, bumble bees, etc.)The thrust of the program in basic research is the characterization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in different arthropod species, mainly fire ants, mosquitoes, ticks and lepidopterans (caterpillars). On the applied aspect smaller projects are dedicated to pesticide resistance in the bollworm Helicoverpa zea and the citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri. Work continues on cattle fever tick receptors to finalize projects that started in the previous cycle and were funded by the USDA-AFRI grants. An extension of that work was developing comparative analyses with GPCRs from the tick Ixodes scapularis. The PI is part of the community that annotated GPCRs in this species for the upcoming genome paper.The red imported fire ant (RIFA) is an invasive species due in part to its high reproductive capacity, adaptability and aggressiveness. It causes millions of dollars in losses in Texas and in the southeast U.S. This pest continues its invasion globally, and has spread to other countries such as Taiwan, New Zealand and China. Little is known about the molecular regulation of reproduction in social insects, and reproductive processes in RIFA need further in depth study. We are focusing on the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of reproduction in red imported fire ant queens with the goal of obtaining basic knowledge that may aid in managing fire ant populations in the future. Further, we are focusing on neurobiological control of division of labor in worker subcastes. We want to know how they sense nutritional needs and how their nervous system controls the foraging and other tasks performed by workers.The PI will continue to focus on the understanding of the physiology of excretion in blood feeding arthropods. Although neurohormones and neuropeptide receptors have been characterized in arthropods, the molecular mechanisms and pathways that regulate diuresis and water balance are not fully understood . The study of hormone receptors will provide new understanding of the biological significance of this signaling system for water balance in blood feeding arthropods that are vectors of disease agents. Data generated through genome projects of mosquitoes and ticks (whole genome, RNAseq, and ESTs (expressed sequence tags)) provide opportunities to study physiological processes more intensively in these important pests. The development of new and sensitive methodologies such as gene silencing through RNA interference (RNAi) and quantitative PCR are available to answer questions that were technologically challenging in the recent past. These tools are available in the PI&#39;s laboratory to be applied to this project.Pests such as lepidopterans, ticks and mosquitoes, have developed resistance to pesticides, therefore, novel insecticides and novel arthropod targets are needed to overcome this evolutionary problem. We believe that antagonists for diuretic hormone receptors could be excellent synergists of conventional pesticides that are detoxified in the Malpighian tubule of insects or ticks. The hormone receptors we are studying belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and are promising because GPCRs are proven  drug  (in a broad sense) targets: the  proof of concept  is exemplified by the insecticide/acaricide amitraz, acting on octopamine receptors in arthropods. As a first step toward developing stable agonists or antagonists to study diuresis in vivo, we are working in collaboration with a peptide chemist on the rational and functional development of insect and tick peptidomimetics, molecules bearing identifiable resemblance to a peptide that, as a ligand of a biological receptor, can imitate or inhibit the effect of a natural peptide. Testing of these peptidomimetics in vitro and in vivo will allow new insights into the physiology of water balance, urine production and excretion, and help determine if these receptors are suitable targets for further disruption to kill pests. There is also evidence that kinins and diuretic hormones act at the central level in the insect nervous system in association with eclosion behavior.IV. The use of insecticides is important in agriculture within an integrated pest and resistance management approach, and is a constant factor in urban environments to provide immediate remedial action to vectors of disease agents. As a consequence of high selective pressure, many active ingredients are rendered ineffective to control arthropods due to pesticide resistance. Translational research and service in support of the mission of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station includes the diagnosis and monitoring of insecticide resistance in important agricultural pests such as Heliothines (Helicoverpa zea) in cotton, corn and sorghum. This research also includes the development of fast molecular tools for diagnostics by PCR. The laboratory works on cloning of target sites (receptors, enzymes) to identify mechanisms of target site insensitivity."

Farms are family owned and fields are small. Alfalfa hay is the primary crop but pecan acreage is rapidly expanding. Cotton is used as a rotation crop. In Lea County, in the High Plains of New Mexico, crops include wheat, corn, sorghum, peanuts and a number of vegetables. Agronomic conditions are quite different from the southern New Mexico desert valleys which only average 10-12 inches of rain per year. Counties on the NM eastern High Plains average 13- 17  of rain per year. Fields are larger, and farms are larger with most fields in sprinkler irrigated circles. (USDA-NMAS 2012).Insect pressure and insecticide use is higher in the High Plains. The Pecos Valley currently has lower pressure from insect pests, but changes in management practices will likely increase insect pest pressure. In particular, a reduction in alfalfa acreage, a concomitant increase in pecan acreage and larger fields coupled with the increasing use of center pivot irrigation will likely increase insect pest pressure in all crops (Corbett and Plant 1993, Flint and Roberts 1988). Historically, insect pest pressure in the Pecos Valley has not only been lower than in Lea County but also lower than in a very similar valley 160 miles west, the Mesilla Valley. This is likely due to higher acreage of alfalfa in the Pecos Valley and the high production of beneficial arthropods in hay that provide significant control of arthropod pests in nearby crops. Replacement of alfalfa acreage with pecans will likely increase insect pest pressure in all crops but alfalfa. Although it is important to respond to issues as they arise, we will likely continue to emphasize three of the major crops in southeastern New Mexico: pecan, cotton and hay.Currently the primary pest in pecan is pecan nut casebearer. Aphids, leaf miners, stinkbugs, hickory shuckworm and leaf footed bugs are occasional pests that also may cause economic losses. The primary need in pecan in SE New Mexico is to evaluate biological control to determine techniques to conserve and enhance populations of predators and parasitoids (LaRock and Ellington. 1996). Our initial work has indicated that predation levels are typically high, but periodic disruptions in populations of beneficials have been associated with dramatically higher populations of insect pests, particularly aphids. In 2011, for example, when populations of beneficials were unusually low, some growers made up to 4 applications for aphids, when typically growers average less than one application.The near eradication of cotton boll weevil and pink bollworm has opened up more opportunities to use pest management tactics in cotton that were less tenable before eradication due to routine insecticide applications. In addition, the widespread use of Bt cotton varieties have further reduced problems with lepidopterous insect pests. Now, the primary insect pest of cotton in SE New Mexico is thrips. Conchuela stink bug, Chlorochroa ligata, lygus, and leaf footed bug are occasional pests that can cause economic damage. In non Bt cotton varieties we also need to consider a complex of lepidopterous pests. The key lepidopterous pest is cotton bollworm with beet armyworm a secondary pest. Cotton square borer, Strymon melinus Hubner, and cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni Hubner, are present but not at economic levels.The market for cotton has been difficult. Growers compete on a world market and do not receive significantly higher returns for a higher quality crop. The low price of cotton has resulted in a reduction of acreage in recent years. An effort is underway to increase crop value by growing a value added variety that is glandless, producing seed that can be consumed by humans or used for high value feed such as farm-raised shrimp. The primary obstacle to the production of glandless cotton has been insect pressure, since gossypol provides some baseline resistance to insect pests (Benedict et al. 1977, Jenkins et al. 1966). It is hoped that relatively low insect pressure and research into other management tools to suppress pest populations will allow New Mexico growers to produce glandless cotton without resorting to excessive insecticide applications. We have been evaluating the potential for insect damage in SE New Mexico and potential management techniques including the impact of biological control and modifying nitrogen rates.Although beneficial arthropods often control insect pests in alfalfa hay, alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal), is still a key pest in New Mexico. Secondary pests can also cause economic damage. These include numerous species of cutworms, beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), cowpea aphid, Aphis cracciuara Koch, and alfalfa caterpillar, Colias eurytheme Biosduval. Damage from secondary pests can produce extremely high economic impacts by causing the loss of stands particularly, but not exclusively, in young stands of hay.Emerging pests are expected to cause issues over the next five years. Brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomopha halys(Stal), for example, has been detected in New Mexico. It is already established in parts of Texas and much of the continental U.S. Bagrada bug, Bagrada hilaris (Burmeister), has been detected in New Mexico and has become an issue feeding on cotton in Arizona. These are examples of just some emerging issues that are likely to become the subject of research in the next five years in New Mexico."

Mycotoxins, especially aflatoxin, are known carcinogens that pose a severe health hazard to human and animal consumers of grains and co-products.Freshly-harvested, high-moisture content grain must be dried to minimize (or prevent) excessive respiration and mold growth on grains. At present, most on-farm systems which use either natural air or slightly-heated air to dry grain are becoming very popular. With these systems, the grain could be dried more slowly which generally results in improved quality and also the drying practice reduces pressure on commercial driers. Although drying practice with on-farm systems can lead to very positive results, they are weather dependent and unfortunately could lead to over drying of grain, fissured kernels that reduce milling yields, result in loss of functional performance, nutritional and sensorial quality of the grain and even development of harmful molds in areas of the bin that incur delays prior to drying. In particular, the development of mycotoxin-producing mold leading to mycotoxin contamination of stored grain in the on-farm systems has become a great concern to the grain industry.Recently-introduced technology for use in on-farm drying systems offers a means to utilize the advantages of low-temperature, in-bin drying systems, yet prevent the disadvantages that are sometimes incurred. The new technology is governed by the principle of Equilibrium Moisture Content (EMC), which is the moisture content that a specific grain will attain if exposed to air with a given relative humidity and temperature for a long enough duration. Grain dried by continuous fan operation would be exposed to multiple drying/rewetting processes due to changing hourly/daily weather, resulting in inefficient and non-uniform drying. Natural air/low temperature (NA/LT) drying with fan operation in a given EMC window restricts the delivery of air that is too wet and/or too dry. The new NA/LT in-bin technology comprises cables to monitor not only air ambient conditions, but also grain moisture content and temperature throughout the entire grain bin mass and the data can also be accessed anytime via the internet. The systems have advanced fan and heater controls or self-adapting variable heat (SAVH) capability, which automatically adjusts the upper and lower EMC windows throughout the drying process, minimizing fan run-time hours and over drying costs, as well as moisture content non-uniformity.These new in-bin systems are becoming very popular and have great potential for wider adoption by many farmers. However, the duration required to achieve drying with the new systems is greatly affected by prevailing weather conditions (temperature and relative humidity). The real problem is that the weather may not allow drying of the grain, particularly the upper layers, in a timely manner. When this happens, there is a great possibility for mold growth in the grain mass, with potential mycotoxin development, and grain quality related problems such as loss of grades, functional performance, nutritional and sensory value may ensue as well. For instance, across the U.S. Mid-South, prevailing weather conditions will dictate the upper moisture content limit of grains that can be stored in these new in-bin drying/storage systems without significant  quality  deterioration and mold growth leading to mycotoxin development. The term  quality  could mean desirable characteristics for effective further processing and/or end-use. It is vital to know, for instance in the case of rice, how rapid grain  quality  attributes, such as grain yellowing, hardness, dry matter loss/respiration, milling, nutritional, functional (e.g. paste viscosity, stickiness, cohesiveness etc.) and sensory related characteristics change under prolonged high-MC conditions; and for the case of soybean destined for seed, how germination rate is impacted under different drying and storage conditions.The primary and practical questions the research will seek to answer for successful implementation of the new in-bin systems in Arkansas and the Mid-South are as follows: (1) what is the rate of grain  quality  reduction and mycotoxin development under various drying/storage scenarios; (2) with respect to stored product  quality , what is the upper moisture content limit for grain (rice, corn, sorghum, and soybean) placed into these systems at various locations; (3) what energy savings could be realized with these new in-bin drying/storage systems?"

The opportunity is available for the Louisiana Sugar Industry to expand if biomass feedstocks can be produced on fallow or marginal land. Several developments must occur for success; apart from the obvious agronomic factors, procedures must be developed for valuing the crops for the producer and the processor, the crops must be shown to be economically convertible to fuels and chemicals, supplemental juices produced during processing must be investigated as to their ability to supplement fermentable sugars for conversion to fuels and chemicals, pre-processing procedures for each crop must be developed and the integration of the whole into existing sugar mill operations must be investigated. Energy cane and sweet sorghum can be harvested after January - March or before July - September; respectively, while commercial sugarcane is generally harvested from October - December. Energy cane and sweet sorghum crops are similar in gross structure to sugarcane and are a sensible choice of feedstock as they could be handled by the traditional sugarcane harvest and delivery system. The future of the Louisiana Sugar Industry rests on its ability to expand its product offerings and extend its processing season. The recent National push to green chemicals and the need for a lower cost transportation fuel for the State of Louisiana adds urgency and opportunity for this Industry. This opportunity is available in the State if lignocellulosics can be produced on fallow or marginal land and be harvested and delivered in a manner such that they can be processed in a modified sugar mill operation. This would significantly increase the number of marketable product options for sugar mill industries through a biorefinery alternative that converts lignocellulosics to refined biofuels and biochemicals. This project will focus on developing and validating integrated technologies that will convert juice and bagasse from biomaterials or energy crops (i.e. sugarcane, energy cane, sweet sorghum) into syrups that could serve as building blocks for the production of green chemicals and be potentially integrated into a biorefinery (i.e. sugar factories).The expected benefits from this project will be the development of new processing technologies and business opportunities for the State and the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center."

BiofuelsFuel grade ethanol production from plant biomass provides a strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and reducing world petroleum dependency . However, ethanol is readily miscible in water and therefore cannot be readily transported in existing oil and natural gas pipelines, which contain some water. Ethanol alone also cannot be used to fuel conventional automobile engines. Finally, ethanol possesses less energy per mole than gasoline and other fuels that contain long-chain hydrocarbons. Therefore, bioconversion technologies that enable the production of long-chain alkanes and other hydrocarbons hold significant interest. The yeast D. hansenii provides a compelling biofuel biosynthesis platform. First, the organism is genetically tractable, possesses a fully sequenced genome, and it is amenable to genetic engineering. Second, it mediates the biotransformati on of biomass into the high&shy; energy, long-chain hydrocarbons (C16-C18) commonly found in biodiesel. D. hansenii hydrocarbons accumulate in large quantities when the organism is grown under defined conditions, approaching 70% of the dry weight of the organism. Third, D. hansenii grows rapidly to high density in culture. In fact, the organism grows, and accumulates long chain hydrocarbons, more than 100-fold faster than microalga. Fourth, D. hansenii is halotolerant, and can grow in high salt conditions such that the risk of contamination to industrial-scale bioreactors is limited. Fifth, it produces high concentrations of long chain hydrocarbons when grown on a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources. For example, fatty acids and certain sugars, including hexoses and pentoses, can be exploited as substrates for hydrocarbon production. Pentoses (especially xylose) and hexose are major components in hemicellulose and cellulose, respectively. Thus, the products of lignocellulosic biomass degradation, in general, and sorghum and energy cane hydrolysis, in particular, can be utilized as feedstocks for fuel synthesis by this &middot; extraordinary microbe. Sixth, the organism efficiently degrades cellobiose, a potent inhibitor of cellulose solubilizing enzymes. Finally, D. hansenii synthesizes a variety of hydrocarbon structures under assorted culture conditions. Therefore, D. hansenii metabolism can likely be fine-tuned to address varied biofuel and co-product demandsB.PathogenesisBrucella is an animal pathogen that causes brucellosis, a zoonosis that perpetuates poverty worldwide. In humans, brucellosis typically presents with undulant fever. However chronic brucellosis may affect many host organs, leading to arthritis, orchitis, liver damage, encephalomyelitis and endocarditis. Arthritis represents the most common complication. The protean manifestations and insidious onset complicate diagnosis. Brucellosis has eluded systematic attempts at eradication for more than a century, even in most developed countries, and no approved human vaccine is available. Brucellosis is transmitted primarily by ingestion of contaminated animal products; however the low number required for infection and capacity for aerosolization render B. melitensis a category B pathogen and potential bioterrorism agent.Our research group was the first to implicate the subversion of UPR proteins as critical to the intracellular lifestyle of Brucella. The data suggest a provocative and testable hypothesis: Brucella subverts host IRE1 signaling cascades to secure an intracellular niche that supports nutrient acquisition and pathogen replication. Here, we propose to test this hypothesis, with a particular emphasis on the XBP1-independent signaling arm because of its centrality in mediating infection. In addition, we propose to extend these ideas to Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungal pathogen.C. LIVE technologyThere is broad appreciation that mammalian models, especially humanized mouse or non-human primate systems, offer the most relevance as systems for discovering and developing human or veterinary therapeutics, or assessing the safety or toxicity of natural or synthetic chemicals. This is especially true when considering chemical activities in tissues for which in vitro models are unavailable. Moreover, the physiology of primary tissue is very different from the immortalized cells in which large-scale screens are typically performed. Primary tissues also have documented differences in chemical sensitivity. However, the large-scale analysis of the activities of chemical compounds directly in living animals is entirely impractical using conventional approaches. For example, to evaluate the potential endocrine disrupting activity of 100,000 compounds directly in the mouse using conventional (one compound per mouse) approaches would require more than 600,000 animals at a cost of more than $54,000,000 to complete. These values exceed (by several orders of magnitude) the resources available to most commercial or public high throughput screening facilities. Here, we propose to systematically develop the LIVE platform, which, if successful, will deliver a technology for evaluating the activities of small molecules directly in the mouse with a potential for reducing costs by 4-6 orders of magnitude. Although the focus of this proposal is to demonstrate the power of the LIVE approach for identifying toxic activities in vivo, it should be noted that the basic principles of the technology can be reconfigured to uncover novel therapeutics that address ischemia/reperfusion injury, infectious disease and cancer. By providing a platform that enables toxicity analysis, drug discovery, and other forms of biological inquiry, to be moved from the petri dish to living (and potentially humanized) animal models, the LIVE platform, if successful, may signal a sea change in the way that chemical toxicity is evaluated, drugs are discovered and biological questions are interrogated in the future. The LIVE system may thereby become a foundational technology for future life science inquiry."

To do so we will employ our established screening tools of an iron bioavailability bioassay and an animal model.  In conjunction with these tools, we will make use of mass spectroscopy and marker assisted molecular breeding techniques.  With these approaches, we will be able to identify and utilize regions of the plant genome that harbor genes associated with the enhanced food crop nutritional quality for Fe. To further complement the above approaches, we will continue our work on the identification of agricultural and food processing practices that enhance the bioavailability and content of Fe and Zn in staple food crops.   The second major objective of this project is to develop a method to measure and evaluate the bioavailability of functional phytochemicals from plant foods.  To do so, we will assess the use of a surgical model utilizing the unique intestinal anatomy of the broiler chicken to measure absorption of compounds from the duodenal segment of the intestine.  This approach uses an established surgical preparation involving anesthetized animals.  Our initial efforts with this model will focus on compounds that are common to many staple food crops, fruits and vegetables.  These phytochemicals will include the flavonoids epicatechin, quercitin, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and kaempferol. Enhancing our knowledge of bioavailability of health promoting phytochemicals will significantly improve efforts to develop more nutritious plant foods."

Identify and characterize field sugar crop quality traits that affect sugar crop refining/biorefining efficiency and end-product quality, and collaborate with plant breeders in the development of new cultivars/hybrids to optimize desirable quality traits.  6. Develop, in collaboration with commercial partners, technologies to improve the efficiency and profitability of U.S. sugar manufacturing and enable the commercial production of marketable products from residues (e.g, bagasse, trash) and by-product streams (e.g., low purity juices) associated with postharvest sugar crop processing.  Please see Project Plan for all listed Sub-objectives.  Approach: There are currently two major trends in the U.S. with respect to sugar crops: (1) the manufacture of higher quality raw sugar for supply to sugar refineries, and (2) the production of biofuels and bioproducts at new, flexible biorefineries.  In recent years, mostly because of the increased harvesting of green sugarcane with leaves and tops, higher concentrations of starches and color have tended to occur.  Some U.S. sugar refiners have placed a penalty for high starch concentrations in raw sugar.  The occurrence of larger concentrations of insoluble starch in downstream factory products have exacerbated viscosity problems and reduced the efficiency of amylase enzymes to control starch.  In close collaboration with industrial partners ARS scientists will develop new enzyme systems and other commercially viable technologies to control starch, viscosity, and color in factory and refinery streams, while also developing a method for measuring both insoluble and soluble starch in sugar products at the factory and refinery.  Stable, storable, easily transportable, and available year-round supplies of sugar crop feedstocks, including sweet sorghum and energy beets, are needed for the conversion of sugars into substitute biofuels and bioproducts normally manufactured from fossil products.  In close collaboration with industrial partners, ARS scientists will develop commercially-viable technologies for the extraction, stabilization, concentration, and fermentation of juices and syrups from sweet sorghum and energy beet feedstocks that will enable the deployment, growth, and profitability of new commercial biorefineries.  Commercially-viable technologies will also be developed that are crucial to mitigate cultivar, seasonal, and environmental quality variations on feedstock performance."

Processes will also be developed to extract and fractionated cellulose-rich and hemicellulose-rich fractions from sorghum kernels, sorghum bran, sorghum bagasse, and biomass sorghum.   Other processes will be developed to improve the biofuel value of biodiesel by blending biodiesel with modified fatty acid derivatives to enhance its low temperature performance, reduce the levels of impurities that block fuel lines, economically convert trap grease and float grease to biodiesel, and improve the in situ process to make biodiesel directly from oil-rich low value agricultural products.  In addition to biodiesel applications, other processes will be developed to produce branched fatty acids with unique functional (including improved lubricity) and biological properties (including antimicrobial and antioxidant properties)."

Information about growth and development is encoded in a plant's DNA, which has four fundamental chemical components, often referred to as A, C, G and T. However, the C can also be modified by a process called methylation, which allows it to function as a 5th information component in DNA. While it is apparent that methylated Cs play an important role in plant growth and development, their role has yet to be fully understood. In this proposal, the number and pattern of methylated Cs among different crop plants will be compared, including barley, einkorn wheat and sorghum. These comparisons will be used to investigate the influence of methylated Cs on the function of genes. The overall goal is to better understand the contribution of methylated Cs to plant growth and development, so that eventually this information can be used for crop improvement.  DNA methylation is one of several epigenetic modifications that are crucial to plant genome function. Recent work has also shown that methylation has broad consequences for genome evolution, including the composition of intergenic DNA, as a fundamental evolutionary property of specific genes, and as a driver of compositional biases among genomic regions. Given the importance of epigenetic mechanisms, a thorough understanding of the evolution and function of plant genomes requires characterization of epigenetic variation among plant species. Yet, such a characterization is presently lacking. This project will generate and analyze whole genome bisulfite sequencing (BSseq) and transcript (RNAseq) data for an array of grass species. The data will be released to the Short Read Archive and Gene Expression Omnibus databases prior to publication. The goal is to use the data to better understand the relationship among DNA methylation, gene evolution and gene function, as measured by gene expression. To achieve this end, a series of unique evolutionary analyses will be developed that will address three specific hypotheses: 1) that gene-body methylation is a conserved feature of functionally important genes and maintained over evolutionary time by natural selection; 2) that evolutionary shifts in gene body methylation (and/or the methylation of flanking regions) drive shifts in gene expression between species; and 3) that DNA methylation variation among tissues - specifically in genes and flanking regions - contributes to tissue-specific gene expression."

Gregory (University of Pennsylvania)  Co-PIs:  Eric Lyons and Mark Beilstein (University of Arizona)   Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of molecules gaining attention for their roles in various biological processes. lncRNAs are defined by the fact that they do not code for proteins and are therefore not mRNAs. In addition, they do not fit into other well-defined small silencing RNA-producing categories such as small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Despite the importance of lncRNAs in development, epigenetic modification, and stress responses, there is still much to be learned about their structure, protein interactions, and functions, especially in model and crop plant species. This project will address this significant gap using a combination of genomic, evolutionary, and bioinformatics approaches. It is anticipated that the data, web-accessible genome analytical tools, and data management systems developed by the project will provide novel insights into plant gene expression regulation by lncRNAs, and provide important new findings and resources for studies focused on the improvement of numerous crop and genetic model plants. With regard to outreach and training, this project will provide interdisciplinary research training in RNA biology, computational science and evolutionary biology for students and postdoctoral associates.  In addition, the project will develop an interdisciplinary course entitled  Applied Concepts in RNA Biology  that will leverage large-scale computing and datasets to understand various aspects of the role of RNA in biological systems.  This project-based course will teach the fundamentals of RNA biology, next-generation sequencing techniques, distributed and high performance computing, data-intensive science, and collaborative research techniques that will be used in student-driven research projects. The course will be taught simultaneously at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Arizona, with two-way audio/video conferencing and lecture topics alternatively taught at each site. All project outcomes will be made readily accessible to the broader research community through a project website (https://genomevolution.org/wiki/index.php/EPIC-CoGe_Tutorial), the iPlant Collaborative and long-term repositories such as GenBank and the Short Read Archive (SRA).    This project is uniquely positioned to provide insights into the structure and function of lncRNAs, and their interaction with specific epigenomic regulatory modifications in the genome. The specific goals of the project are to define a subset of lncRNAs that are important for proper gene regulation in both normal development and stress response.  Specifically, the project will focus on identifying and functionally characterizing those lncRNAs that are (1) nuclear, (2) highly structured, (3) stress responsive, (4) protein bound, and (5) evolutionary conserved in genetic models (Eutrema salsugineum and Arabidopsis thaliana) and in crop species (Camelina sativa, Brassica rapa, Zea mays, and Sorghum bicolor), focusing on their roles in stress adaptation. Finally, the project will expand EPIC-CoGe, a central repository for plant epigenomics data across all species, with advanced data integration, visualization, and analysis tools to allow for the integration of functional genomics data to provide new insight into genome-wide epigenomic interactions."

LOUIS,MO,63132-2918,UNITED STATES,,,47.074,2015,639217.0,,"The tallgrass prairie of North America is an iconic landscape, central to America history.  The grasses from which the prairie takes its name are close relatives of those that make up the vast grasslands of eastern Africa.   The grasses provide food for livestock and wild animals, and habitat for birds; they also pull carbon from the atmosphere and bury it deep in the ground where it supports beneficial microbes that make the rich soil on which American agriculture depends.  This project is a collaboration between research scientists at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri, undergraduates at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, and colleagues in eastern Africa, and is aimed at unraveling the ways the grasses spread their pollen, how they provide their seeds with carbon, and how the seeds are dispersed across the landscape.  This information will tell us how the grasslands will respond in the face of current disturbance such as fire, urbanization, and conversion to farmland, and future disturbances caused by a changing climate.   This project focuses on three major grass genera, Andropogon, Schizachyrium, and Hyparrhenia, plus a few smaller related genera, that together include some 250 species many of which are ecological dominants.  Researchers will first use DNA sequences to uncover the phylogenetic history of the group, and then use that history to trace how the seed-bearing portions of the plant have changed over evolutionary time and how they correlate with climate, fire, and moisture.  The seeds in these plants do not simply drop off the plant.  Instead they are released as part of a complex dispersal structure that includes pieces of floral stalks and leaf-like bracts. The dispersal structure varies between species in size, presence or absence of hairs, presence of male and female flowers, and presence or absence of awns (hygroscopic extensions of bracts).  The structure may be an adaptation for seed dispersal, for the control of germination in particular soil types, or for resistance to fire.  However, the same structures may also help with pollination.  In addition, many parts of the dispersal structure are green during development, and may provide photosynthate for the developing seed.  Thus the structure could be selected for functions at three different life history stages: pollination, grain filling, and dispersal.  This project will use both a historical phylogenetic approach and an experimental approach to test the current function of the dispersal structure.   The dispersal structure studied here is much like that of sorghum, sugarcane and Miscanthus, so the data will apply to those crops as well as to the major grassland species."

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) notes that, while maize has the largest acreage of all field crops in Africa, the average yield (1.6 t/hectare) is less than 1/3 of that achieved per unit area elsewhere in the world. The situation is further exacerbated by widespread dispersal of Striga seeds that intermix with maize kernels and ears going to market.  This EAGER project will test a potentially novel strategy for dealing with Striga infestation using a newly identified transposon-induced (non-transgenic) mutant of maize.  This plant carries a mutation in a gene that encodes a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 (ccd8) and has been shown to produce little to no precursors for strigolactone (SL), a maize hormone that is sensed by the Striga parasite and is required as a chemo-signal for host location and germination of its own seeds. The non-transgenic nature of this new maize mutant also enhances prospects for its acceptance and use by peoples with diverse cultures. This project will test the extent to which actual interactions between maize and Striga are affected by the partially-understood roles of strigolactone in plant biology. The specific objectives are to: 1) determine the degree of resistance to Striga seed germination and host attraction offered by the ccd8 mutation, and 2) test the concept that a relatively modest yield penalty in ccd8 maize can be countered without losing Striga resistance, by breeding strategies based on hybrid vigor and naturally-occurring genetic modifiers.  If successful, this EAGER project will provide for a new strategy that could counter Striga-based yield losses that extend from 15% to 100%, thereby making maize production sustainable in Striga infested regions."

This reliance on oil has major sociopolitical and environmental effects, i.e., fluctuating gasoline prices, political instability in certain regions, and anthropogenic climate change. Due to these issues, the threat to U.S. national security is high. Thus, there is an urgent need to utilize renewable energies from sources produced here in the U.S.  Plant biomass, the most abundant renewable material on Earth, serves as an attractive alternative to petroleum fuels. To meet U.S. energy needs, dedicated biomass energy crops such as sorghum, switchgrass, and miscanthus, must be improved. One approach is to genetically engineer these plants to produce traits leading to higher yields of liquid fuels. This I-Corps team has developed gene technologies that result in higher yielding biomass energy crops well suited for biofuel production. These technologies are ready for commercialization and the goal of this project is to help bring these products to market.  Ultimately, this project will help to lessen U.S. dependence on petroleum fuels, cut foreign oil imports, reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with oil production and consumption and strengthen U.S. national security by helping to establish an alternative resource for U.S. energy needs. Globally, the need for renewable energy made from non-food plant biomass is increasing. Plant lignocellulosic biomass serves is an attractive alternative to the current corn grain and sugarcane feedstocks. Plant cell walls are composed of energy-rich polysaccharide polymers that can be saccharified to produce biofuels and many other bio-based products. This team proposes to test the commercial viability of its technologies through customer-based interviews for analyses of the U.S. biomass feedstock market. The team's goal is to meet with representatives from agricultural biotechnology firms to discuss their needs and discover how our technologies could help meet them. In addition, the team will gain better insight into the biofuels 'value chain' (from feedstock to fuel) to determine the best 'go-to-market' strategy for our gene technologies.  Ultimately, the data collected from these interviews will be used to develop a business model towards commercialization of research."

However, sorghum lags behind other crops in making progress in breeding for increased yield and improved traits. Heartland Plant Innovations is developing a robust system for producing and utilizing Sorghum Doubled Haploids (SDHs), a non-transgenic approach that greatly accelerates plant breeding. DH breeding systems are widely used in crops such as corn, but totally lacking for sorghum. Developing a SDH production system will offer a quicker route to new, improved hybrids with increased yields for farmers. In Phase I, HPI discovered a Haploid Inducing Pollinator (HIP1) that induces formation of viable haploid seeds in diverse lines of sorghum. Working with collaborators, HPI will use HIP1 to develop and implement an efficient pilot scale SDH system for breeding and genetics. This will be accomplished through research and development focused on the following objectives: 1) Confirm and characterize haploid-inducing pollinators identified during Phase I, determine the genetic basis for haploid induction by these lines and improve their performance; 2) Plan and execute a 2nd year of field trials to expand the hunt for useful pollinators; 3) Develop and integrate components of a commercial SDH breeding system, including seed sorting and chromosome doubling; 4) Develop a plan for marketing HPI&#39;s SDH breeding system to customers.Sorghum breeders who are working to deliver new inbreds and hybrids to farmers would greatly benefit from incorporating SDH lines into their programs. SDH lines could be used to accelerate traditional breeding, or to rapidly introgress high-value traits for resistance to diseases, insects or abiotic stress. Success with the proposed sorghum DH research will permit expansion of HPI&#39;s customer base to include sorghum breeders around the world. HPI expects to market production of SDHs on demand, or to partner with others in making DH technology available for customers to use."

Melanaphis sacchari is also an important pest of sugarcane throughout the world, including Louisiana, Florida, and Texas as a vector of sugarcane yellow leaf virus. Current management tactics available for M. sacchari in sugarcane and sorghum rely solely on the use of broad spectrum insecticides without economic thresholds, cultural practices, or resistant cultivars. Development of biology- and ecology-based management strategies which reduce reliance on insecticides is needed. The proposed project aims to quantify the effects of host crop, cultivar, plant phenology, and nitrogen fertilization level on M. sacchari life table parameters through a series of greenhouse and laboratory assays. This approach will improve understanding of M. sacchari population dynamics and identify production practices such as planting date and nitrogen fertilization which can be modified to provide cultural control by limiting aphid development and reproduction. Additionally, the project will develop an efficient rapid aphid density assessment rating (RADAR) sampling protocol easily implemented in the field. Extensive field sampling studies will be used in development and validation of a cost-effective rapid aphid density assessment tool. Development of a binomial-based rapid sampling protocol for accurate assessment of aphid density without laborious counting will improve quantification of aphid densities for use in pest management as well as in future research efforts. Aphid density-yield response studies will be used in development of economics to improve sustainability of M. sacchari control. Greenhouse assays and replicated field studies will identify factors which influence the biology, ecology, and impact of M. sacchari infestations in sugarcane and sorghum. Results from these studies will be incorporated into an integrated forecasting model. A web-based predictive tool will be developed and delivered to stakeholders to aid in making IPM decisions based on forecasted infestations and impacts on yield.

This research focuses on rhizomes, vegetative/reproductive structures that are a valuable asset in productivity of biomass, forage, and turfgrasses cultivated on &gt;60 million US acres and likely to increase. Rhizomes also enhance &#39;weediness&#39; of undesirable plants that infest millions of acres, reducing crop productivity and hindering utilization of potentially valuable genes in breeding. Information about rhizomatousness from botanical models extrapolates well. Relatives of sorghum, a model for rhizomatousness, will be studied. Comparative and association genetics will clarify the genetic control of rhizomatousness from Sorghum halepense, discern novel QTLs from those shared with S. propinquum, and investigate candidate genes by several approaches. Expression profiling during early stages of rhizome development and in genotypes with different QTLs for rhizomatousness will reveal gene networks, functional groups and specific genes associated with specific S. halepense QTLs for enhanced rhizomatousness. At the intersection of positional, expression, functional, comparative and association genetic evidence, a tractable number of candidate genes are expected to be strongly implicated in the genetic and developmental control of rhizome growth, perhaps initiating functional tests by means such as CRISPR/Cas genome editing. These approaches will also provide new information on genetic control of tillering, another important determinant of plant productivity. Findings are expected to advance knowledge toward development of novel methods to enhance productivity of desirable plants and control undesirable ones, also training young scientists in integrative contemporary approaches to addressing agricultural challenges."

By identifying the changes in specific genes and metabolites that provide this increased cold tolerance, this project aims to develop the knowledge that will make it possible in the future to develop varieties of corn and sorghum which can be planted earlier, havested later, and have higher upper boundaries on yield than has previously been feasible."

This challenging goal is further complicated by growing competition for land, water and energy, as well as by the potential negative impacts of climate change on crop productivity. Therefore, continued and dedicated research efforts are essential to increase yields and to expand the range of locations and environments where these crops can be grown productively.One of the most critical factors underlying grain crop productivity is a precise timing of the developmental transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages to optimize seed production. For example, in environments with hot summers, early-flowering photoperiod insensitive wheat varieties mature prior to the onset of damaging high temperatures and show significantly higher yields than photoperiod-sensitive later-flowering varieties (&gt;35% in Southern Europe). By contrast, photoperiod sensitive wheat varieties show yield advantages in milder climates, as their delayed flowering extends the period of vegetative growth providing more resources for biomass and grain production. Similarly, late-flowering forage and energy sorghums show increased biomass, whereas grain sorghums are selected for early flowering to ensure sufficient time for grain maturation while avoiding drought. This proposal is focused on improving our understanding of the photoperiodic regulation of flowering in the grass family to assist breeders in selecting better adapted crops with improved yield and wider production environments.A critical factor underlying crop productivity is a precise adjustment of the developmental transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages to optimize seed production. In wheat and sorghum this adjustment is regulated mainly by the PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 37 (PRR37), a gene that accounts for most natural variation in photoperiodic response in several economically important grass species. In spite of its central role, it is still not known how PRR37 promotes flowering in wheat but represses flowering in sorghum under long days. The first objective of this proposal is to determine the cause of the reverse activity of PRR37 in short-day (sorghum) and long-day (wheat) grasses using transgenic approaches to exchange critical photoperiod genes between the two species. The second objective is to understand the interactions between the different photoperiod genes. Populations segregating simultaneously for the different genes will be used to determine their interdependencies in the regulation of flowering genes and heading time. The final objective is to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms involved in the differential activity of PRR37 in the regulation of its downstream targets by analyzing PRR37 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.A precise understanding of the similarities and differences in photoperiod regulation of flowering time in wheat and sorghum can have a significant impact on the development of novel varieties better adapted to a wider range of environments. In addition, the understanding of the similarities and differences in photoperiod regulation of flowering time in crops as diverse as sorghum and wheat will also enable the translation of this knowledge to other economically-important crops, including both short day (e.g. rice) and long day species (e.g. barley)."

The constraints imposed by crops&#39; intolerance to low temperature and the natural variations of the climate cause significant economic impacts to farmers, either directly through loss of crops or indirectly through reduced potential yield. While many aspects of plant biochemistry affect the overall tolerance of plants towards cold, a single modification of membrane lipids in the otherwise cold-hardy plant Arabidopsis thaliana is sufficient to make that plant extremely sensitive to even a mild cooling. This modification, a desaturation of the very long-chain fatty acids in sphingolipids, is relatively uncommon in nature, being found only in a few cold-tolerant plant species. Along with other evidence pointing towards a critical role for sphingolipid desaturation in determining plant cold-tolerance, it is hypothesized that sphingolipid desaturation is an adaptation that imparts cold-tolerance and that it can be used to improve the cold tolerance of cold-sensitive crops. This hypothesis will be tested by disrupting sphingolipid desaturation in the cold tolerant crops barley and Cammelina and introducing sphingolipid desaturation into the cold-sensitive crops sorghum and maize. The expected outcome of these experiments is a new means by which it will be possible to modify cold-tolerance in plants that could be broadly applicable to engineering cold-tolerance into a wide variety of important crop species"

It is also by far the highest yielding of all the grain crops (e.g., compare U.S. average 160 bu./acre for maize versus soybeans, 43 bu./acre, and wheat, 46 bu./acre). The higher yield potential of maize is attributable to a specialized photosynthesis process, termed C4 photosynthesis, that maize leaves use for fixing CO2 into carbohydrate. In contrast, all the other major grain crops, with the exception of Sorghum, rely on a more widely occurring photosynthesis process termed  C3  photosynthesis. The difference between C3 and C4 photosynthesis in terms of productivity (i.e., carbohydrate synthesized per unit of absorbed sunlight) is striking. By using C4 photosynthesis, maize leaves can synthesize twice the amount of carbohydrate from assimilated CO2 versus grain crops that utilize C3 photosynthesis. Because of the huge productivity advantage conferred by C4 photosynthesis several consortiums of plant scientists world-wide are now organized with the expressed aim of engineering C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species such as rice. Recent studies estimate that a  C4  rice would yield up to 60% more grain than present day C3 rice cultivars. To enable the introduction of this powerful photosynthetic engine into C3 crop species, a comprehensive understanding of how C4 photosynthesis is biochemically regulated in leaves will need to be gained. This research project will expand our knowledge in this area by elucidating how a newly discovered enzyme in maize leaves called pyruvate phosphate dikinase isoform 2 (PDRP2) biochemically regulates the C4 photosynthesis enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK). Our working hypothesis is that PDRP2 functions to biochemically inactivate PPDK enzyme that inadvertently accumulates in a specialized leaf cell called bundle sheath (BS) cell. According to current models of C4 photosynthesis, the presence of any PPDK in the BS cells would result in a short circuiting of the photosynthetic process. We propose that PDRP2 prevents such a short circuit from ever developing by ensuring that any PPDK that appears in this cell type will be rendered catalytically dead. This hypothesis will be experimentally examined using principally immunological (antibody dependent) methods. These methods include high resolution western blotting and confocal microscopy. In parallel to these experiments, an in-depth investigation into the biochemical properties of PDRP2 will be conducted to better understand the mechanism of how PDRP2 catalyzes biochemical regulation of PPDK. In all, this project will contribute essential knowledge to those efforts aimed at engineering C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species."

Small intestinal digestion of starch is very poor in cattle in comparison to many nonruminants (e.g., pigs, humans, mice), and almost one-third of the energy absorbed from small intestinal starch digestion contributes to omental (i.e., belly) fat accretion, which provides little benefit in production of beef or milk. Greater flow of high-quality protein (i.e., casein) or a specific amino acid (i.e., glutamic acid) can increase small intestinal starch digestion in cattle; however, little is known about how greater flows of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion or potential impacts on beef or milk production. We hypothesize that greater flows of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion by different mechanisms in cattle and that apparent influences on beef production will differ. This project will allow greater understanding of how increased absorption of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion by directly measuring pancreatic and small intestinal enzymes that can limit small intestinal starch digestion in cattle. Additionally, this project will provide insight to the potential value of increasing small intestinal starch digestion in cattle by greater postruminal flow of casein or glutamic acid by measuring increases in dietary energy (i.e., retained energy) and quantify fates in the body from starch digested in the small intestine. It is likely that the mechanisms that increase small intestinal starch digestion in response to greater postruminal flow of casein or glutamic acid differ and differences may have large impacts on dietary energy retained by cattle. Additionally, amounts of digested starch used for omental fat accretion may be less when small intestinal starch digestion is increased in response to greater small intestinal flows of casein or glutamic acid. Greater knowledge of how postruminal flow of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion in cattle and subsequent impacts on beef production may allow for broader application of diets that can increase efficiency of beef production in the United States."

Preemergence soil-applied herbicides continue to be widely used in many crops. Atrazine was applied to 55% of the total corn area, while acetochlor and s-metolachlor were applied to 38 and 27% of the total corn area in the USA in 2014, respectively (NASS 2015). In Kansas, total land area of 4.05 million corn acres, 2.85 million grain sorghum acres, and 4 million soybean acres were planted in 2014 (NASS 2015). Significant acres planted to these crops, together with increasingly more acres treated with PRE herbicides, highlights the efficacious and economic need to optimize the application of these soil-applied products. Soil application of herbicides for preplant or preemergence weed control is not a new technology but has slipped from producers&#39; minds with the advent of herbicide-tolerant corn hybrids and soybean cultivars. Herbicide-tolerant traits in corn, soybean, cotton, sunflower, and soon in grain sorghum, encourage producers to use more post-emergent (POST) herbicides, often glyphosate or other broad spectrum products. With the shift to these herbicide choices, however, an increased occurrence of weeds resistant to these same or related herbicides has occurred, resulting in poor or complete lack of weed control (Godar and Stahlman 2015; Godar et al. 2015). As a result, the use of soil-applied herbicides as a tool for integrated weed management in corn, grain sorghum, and soybean production will need to increase. Many herbicides that are applied to soil for weed control do present their own concerns from an environmental standpoint, such as carryover issues to subsequent crops in a rotation (Van Acker 2005), loss of efficacy with rapid degradation rates (Shaner et al. 2007), or leaching and/or runoff to groundwater and surface waters (Van Acker 2005). The activity and fate of soil-applied herbicides are affected by multiple soil factors, including soil organic matter (SOM), pH, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), and texture (Blackshaw et al. 1994; Kerr et al. 2004; Nordmeyer 2015), which affect the adsorption of the herbicide to soil. Adsorption of herbicides to soil determines the bioavailability of the chemical in soil solution to weeds for control and to soil microbes for degradation.Spatially-dense maps of soil properties would allow design of effective prescription maps for soil-applied herbicide applications. The next step is to actually apply these herbicides using the prescription map in the field. Equipment to apply VRA herbicides according to prescription maps is currently available (e.g., Gerhards et al. 2001; Vogel 2004). There is great potential to reduce total herbicide load applied, and to place the right amount of herbicide in the right place in the field for greatest efficacy.Precision application technology has been available to VRA soil-applied herbicides for more than 15 years, but the algorithms necessary for optimizing the use of these tools still need to be developed and validated for use in farmers&#39; fields. There is no published research that has evaluated the use of VRA soil-applied herbicides in the field. Herbicide labels describe how recommended rates can be varied based on soil texture, SOM, and pH, which are soil properties that can vary dramatically within a given field, not just from one field to the next. Theoretically, it has been demonstrated that VRA herbicide applications should be effective (Novak et al. 1997; Shaner et al. 2008; Williams et al. 2001).The overall goal of this project is to develop procedures for determining effective soil management zones for variable rate application (VRA) of preemergence (PRE) soil-applied herbicides for corn, grain sorghum, and soybean production fields across Kansas and surrounding states based on apparent soil electrical conductivity (soil ECa) and related data. A Veris MSP3 system will be used across 6 different fields of ~5 ha to document soil ECa, organic matter, pH, topography and other data that can be used to define soil management zones. Each zone is expected to require a different herbicide rate for efficacious weed control. To determine the appropriateness of these soil management zones we will set up comparisons using strip trials of VRA and uniform soil-applied herbicide applications in each of these fields in 2016. The herbicide application effectiveness will be evaluated by sampling soil in each strip before and after application to determine herbicide binding and residue, and by using small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) with optical sensors, together with on-the-ground evaluation, to determine weed control efficacy. Grain yields will be collected across each strip using a combine equipped with a yield monitor, if available, or an area within each strip and soil management zone will be hand-harvested to determine yield. These studies will be repeated over two years in different fields, thus refining the precision crop protection algorithm based on first year results.The goal of VRA soil-applied herbicides is to optimize weed control efficacy (right rate in right location) while maximizing profit per acre, to minimize potential losses (due to leaching or rapid degradation), and to limit spread of herbicide-resistant weed populations in fields."

Summer annual crops such as grain sorghum and corn were successfully produced in rotation with winter wheat in a winter wheat-summer crop-fallow (WSF) rotation and usually resulted in greater economic net returns than WF (Dhuyvetter et al. 1996; Norwood and Currie 1997; Schlegel et al. 1999; Thompson 2001)."

The proposed research will focus on signaling that regulates mechanisms/processes that facilitate drought and low temperature tolerance.

Most of these animals are in concentrated production farms in the Coastal Plain physiographic region. Animal manures are collected in anaerobic lagoons and this effluent is applied to adjacent fields. Approximately 2500 lagoons supply swine manure effluent to about 2 million acres of sprayfields in the Coastal Plain region. Hay production is a dominant practice in sprayfields, providing a marginal profit to the growers. Bioenergy crop production would be an alternative use for sprayfields that could increase farm income and contribute to North Carolina&#39;s goal of developing a renewable energy industry. Changing usage of sprayfield acreage would also have little negative impact on the state&#39;s food, feed and fiber production.State and federal regulations for sprayfield usage stipulate that swine effluent N applications cannot exceed the agronomic needs of the receiver crop. Agronomic needs are determined by a North Carolina database of realistic yields for each specific crop with value adjustments by soil type for yield and N application factor. As new crops like biofuels gain importance, yield and nutrient requirement data needs to be assembled for pertinent regions of the state.Developers of cellulosic ethanol production in North Carolina have indicated an interest in sprayfield production of the following annual and perennial grasses as feedstocks: miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus L.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), and fiber and sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). Nitrogen requirements and yields for these biofuel grasses have been investigated in other locations throughout the US and Europe. Perennial grass yields may increase over several years after planting before achieving a production plateau. Annual yields, nutrient removal and long-term stand survival can also be influenced by the frequency of harvests. The unique system of biofuel grass production in sprayfields receiving frequent swine lagoon effluent applications precludes direct transferal of information from many locations. Nevertheless, yield and nutrient management information for sprayfields in the Coastal Plain region are needed for growers to successfully manage their swine production with concomitant application lagoon effluent on biofuel grass receiver crops."

Nutrient management in intensified cropping systems is more complicated than in a crop-fallow system. Due to shortened fallow period, very little nitrate-N accumulates in the soil profile in continuous cropping compared to crop-fallow systems. Therefore pre-plant soil profile N tests as used for crop-fallow systems may not be an effective indicator of N availability for continuous cropping systems. The amount of N mineralized from crop residue and soil organic matter during the growing season may be of greater importance than pre-plant accumulated soil N. Developing nutrient management programs that capture potential in season N mineralization will increase our ability to accurately predict optimal N requirements for intensified crop production systems while maintaining environmental quality. A long-term experiment at the Agricultural Research Center-Hays (initiated in 1975) to investigate the effect of tillage intensity [conventional tillage (CT), RT, NT] and N fertilizer rates provides will be to investigate the long-term influence of crop management practices such as tillage, cropping intensity and N fertilization on N mineralization rates in dryland production systems. Knowledge gained in understanding the influence of crop management practices on nutrient cycling, and the ability of soils to supply plant available N during the growing season will enhance our ability to predict optimal N fertilizer requirements of crops to avoid over fertilization. In addition, N responses among adapted winter wheat varieties and grain sorghum hybrids will be conducted to identify winter wheat varieties and grain sorghum hybrids that exhibit high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) when grown under common tillage practices in Kansas.Aside nutrient management, one of the challenges facing agricultural producers and researchers in the northern and central Great Plains is to identify and evaluate alternative crops that are adapted to the semiarid climate. Oilseeds have been identified as one of the seven bioenergy feedstocks by United states Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy for biofuel production. Recent studies have shown that non-food oilseed camelina is a superior feedstock for biodiesel and jet fuel in terms of fuel performance based on flight testing on commercial airline and military fighter jets. As an energy crop, camelina has potential as a fallow replacement crop in wheat-based cropping systems. Growing camelina in the fallow period will avoid direct competition for land use with food crops in wheat-based production systems. Unlike other oilseed crops (e.g. canola &amp; sunflower), information on adapted winter and spring camelina genotypes, production systems and best agronomic production practices are limited. Field trials will be conducted to evaluate camelina planting date and varieties, nitrogen and sulphur fertility requirements, and camelina water use in a wheat-sorghum-camelina production system. These research efforts are aimed at developing production recommendations for camelina that will optimize camelina production as bioenergy feedstock in wheat-based cropping systems.

This has the potential to improve farm income, profitability and long term sustainability of crop production systems in the region."

In Louisiana, the cattle industry had a value of $663 million in 2013, up 18% over 2012 (LSU AgCenter, 2014). Cattle and calves rank second only to poultry which is the largest animal industry in the state. Cow-calf producers in the United States typically market calves at weaning; most of these calves are born during the late-winter and or spring and consequently weaned in the fall. In general, producers have small numbers of cows (less than 100) and 90% of the calves weigh below 230 kg at weaning, leaving them with very little marketing opportunities for those calves. Only some producers have enough calves to market in a truck load (21,800 kg). Marketing alliances between small and medium size producers have had some success. For several weather-related reasons (drought, excessive cold/snowfall) in different areas of the country, cattle prices have been at an all-time high in recent years and have made a fresh weaned calf a valuable commodity, although analysts indicate that these times are not going to last and the cattle cycle will go back to  normal  by 2016. Regardless of the actual conditions, large economic benefits exist for beef cow-calf producers to retain ownership after weaning by growing calves to a heavier sale weight prior to finishing. Over the past two decades more cattle producers have been retaining ownership of their calves through the stocker phase, and in some cases, through the finishing phase as well (McKinnon, 2001; Rathwell, 2000). In addition, an increased number of summer row crop farmers are grazing stockers on winter cover crops, which include annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) and small grains. Each year, several million calves graze cool-season pastures in the Southeastern United States to add valuable weight as stocker calves. Utilization of cool-season annual forages is one of the primary venues for growing these calves in this region of the country.In Louisiana there is the chance to grow abundant forage resources. Warm season perennial grasses primarily bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) and bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) sometimes associated with dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum) are the  core  of perennial forages. Annual (sorghum-sudan hybrids [Sorghum sp.], pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum]) summer grasses can complement these resources. In winter, cool season annual grasses (rye [Secale cereale], annual ryegrass) or legumes especially Trifolium sp such as ball (T. nigrescens L.), crimson (T. incarnatum), berseem (T. alexandrium), and white (T. repens) clover among others can be successfully planted. Even though these many species can fit into the different ecoregions of the SE, they are the warm season perennial grasses that have been traditionally the forage base for beef cattle systems. Around them and depending on production objectives there are more (or less) intensive systems. The intensive use of greater nutritive value pastures are usually pursued with classes of cattle that demand them such as stockers (steers and heifers) and forage-fed finishing programs. In spring-calving systems having cool season pastures is a major advantage providing nutritive value to the diet of highly demanding cows around parturition and through the first few months of lactation when nutrient demands are at their peak (NRC, 2000). The use of mixed swards (grasses and legumes) is an attractive alternative for producers because: 1) ruminants show preference for a rich (more than one component) diet (Scaglia and Boland, 2014a), and 2) legumes can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, hence reducing the need for fertilizer.All these pastures, however, do not provide adequate year round supply of feed or an adequate nutritive composition. There are a few alternatives to extend the grazing season and try to reduce hay feeding periods, also called  transition periods  or  gap periods . These periods (usually May-June and October-December) of the year with these limitations are usually complemented with stockpiled or conserved forages, which, depending on the nutrient requirements of the animal, may or may not need to be supplemented. Forage brassica crops such as turnip, swede, rape, and kale can be spring seeded to supplement pastures in August and September or summer seeded to extend the grazing season in November and December. Due to the increase use of cover crops in the Northeast, Midwest and upper Midwest of the US, producers in the SE became familiar with other forage alternatives that can be used for grazing. Forage brassica crops such as turnip, swede, rape, and kale are annual crops that are highly productive and digestible and can be grazed 80 to 150 days after seeding, depending on the species. In addition, crude protein levels are high, varying from 15 to 25 percent in the herbage and 8 to 15 percent in the roots, depending on the level of nitrogen fertilization and weather conditions. Despite these advantages these forages require appropriate management not only for their own productivity but also for the grazing animals. Brassica crops can cause health disorders in grazing animals if not managed properly. The main disorders are bloat, atypical pneumonia, nitrate poisoning, hemolytic anemia (mainly with kale), hypothyroidism, and polioencephalomalacia (Hall and Jung, 2008).All around the US and Louisiana is no exception, there is a trend showing that consumers demand for  organic  or  natural  foods is increasing sharply. In recent years (up to 2012), there was annual growth in sales of 24 and 39% for natural and organic meats, respectively. Grass-fed beef is within these niche markets and its relevance has been noted by the USDA. In September 2013, The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#39;s (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) announced a new Market News report that covers grass fed beef (USDA-AMS, 2013). Furthermore, on April 2014 the USDA Grass Fed Program for Small and Very Small (SVS) Producers was presented as a verification tool for SVS producers to certify that animals meet the requirements of the AMS Grass (Forage) Fed Marketing Claim Standard. For this program, USDA is targeting producers that market 49 cattle or less each year (USDA-AMS, 2014). Adding to this trend, consumers are more inclined to support locally produced products, commercialized in farmers markets, favoring localized economies which by end result will strengthen the community&#39;s economy. From 1994 to 2013, the national count of farmer markets directory listings (which is voluntary and self-reported) increased from 1,775 to 8,144 with a 3.6% increase from 2012 (7864) to 2013. In Louisiana there are more than 120 farmer markets (LDAF, 2013).The present proposal plans to contribute to an already developing stocker and forage-fed beef industry in Louisiana and to improve the efficiency of utilization of the forage resources available in the Gulf Coast region."

After the adoption of glyphosate-based system, weed control cost and complexity was greatly reduced. In 2006, glyphosate-resistant weed biotypes were detected and confirmed in the Southeastern United States. In response, growersreadily adopted management practices that included adding multiple soil residual herbicide applications throughout the growing season, preplant and in-season tillage, and hand weeding to combat this resistant weed which substantially increased production costs and environmental degradation. In addition, several cultural practices are being evaluated to combat resistant weeds including cover crops and selective tillage. Cover crops have shown the potential to greatly reduce the incidence of annual weed emergence. Cover crop mixtures also enhance key soil attributes by adding nutrients to the soil, improve soil structure, and increase organic matter content. Therefore, this research project will evaluate integated chemical and culturalapproaches to management of troublesome weeds in agronomic crops in South Carolina. Field trials will be established where appriopriate weed populationsare present. In the fall of each year, cover crops will be established at each site. Data collected from each plot and site will include spring cover crop biomass at planting, percent cotton injury and Palmer amaranth control plus population counts at selected timings, stand counts, percent in-season management efficacy for other economically important weeds, crop yields, and relative costs of all weed management operations.In addition, cover crop biomass sampleswill be collected to evaluate the degree of degradation of the cover crop residue on the soil surfacethroughout the growing season. In addition, field trials will be established to evaluate selected herbicide programs for the management of resistant and troublesome weeds in cotton, soybean, grain sorghum, peanut, and corn. Visual crop injury and growth parameters, plant stand and heights, will be measured at selected periods after planting. In addition, plant heights and crop reflectance will be collected 7 days after each herbicide application. Weed control evaluations will be collected at predetermined interval after herbicide application. Yields for each crop will be collected at the end of the season. Currently, herbicide resistant weeds are the most threatening agricultural pest issue in South Carolina and the Southern United States. Current managementstrategies in response to weed resistancehave greatly increased production costs. Therefore, this project seeks to reduce tocosts whileproviding a robustmechanism tomanage weeds in agronomic crops in South Carolina."

South Carolina is also a major consumer of imported coal from other states needed to meet the growing demand for electricity in the Southeast. Although relatively inexpensive, the combustion of coal by electric utilities is the greatest source of CO2 emissions in the State. For national security and environmental reasons, South Carolina and all other states are in need of alternative energy sources to fossil fuels. On a national basis, federal mandates will soon put heavy emphasis on the use of renewable energy such as biomass, wind, and solar. These mandates are not only focused on reducing our reliance on foreign oil, but also on reducing carbon emissions by utilities. A number of crop species could be used as a source of biomass to make biofuels. Crop species showing the most potential for production on the Coastal Plain include switchgrass (a native and perennial plant found in most counties of South Carolina), biomass sorghum (an annual plant bred for high biomass productivity), and purposely grown trees selected for rapid growth throughout the region. Their drought tolerance, need for few agronomic and fuel inputs, and positive environmental impacts should make them ideal for production on the sandy Coastal Plain. Lttle research has been conducted to determine how to best produce these crops as a biomass crop over the wide range of growing conditions common to this region. This information is urgently needed as companies such as Abengoa are considering new industrial developments in bioenergy in South Carolina that would employ these different feedstocks. With the dramatic decline in cotton and tobacco production on the Coastal Plain, the emergence of this new crop and new industry could not have come a better time to help revitalize the rural economy of the I-95 Corridor.This type of research will give vital information related to feedstock biomass yield potential for the Coastal Plain, general production information for farmers wanting to produce these crops, how management will affect end-use quality, potential genetic and management limitations that will need to be overcome to further increase biomass quantity and quality, and compliment on-going energy-conversion research being conducted on the Clemson University main campus and elsewhere throughout the world."

Increasing processing efficiencies and diversifying their product portfolio are viable options that Louisiana&#39;s sugar mills could adopt to keep this industry competitive, especially in the face of fluctuating world sugar prices, imports and development of sugar substitutes and sweetness enhancers. Compared to other sugar factories around the world, Louisiana&#39;s factories have higher sucrose losses in filter cake, molasses and bagasse. Simulation, control and optimization methodologies based on mathematical process models can be used to increase efficiency in milling, clarification, evaporation, and crystallization operations. Additionally, factory steam and energy balances, feasibility studies and design problems can also be tackled through model-based methodologies. Ultimately, this represents higher sugar recoveries, and hence, lower production costs per pound of sugar.Sugar mills produce large quantities of bagasse, which is burned to produce the steam necessary to run the roller mills and to evaporate the water in the juice. Many sugar mills around the world also use this bagasse to produce electricity, not only to supply their own needs but also, in several cases, to send to the grid. Not all of the 11 sugar mills in Louisiana generate part of their electric power requirements on site, and in 2013 only one mill exported power to the grid. Diverse factors have contributed to this situation. Among them, the grinding season of only 3 months is the most evident obstacle, which contributes to the low prices offered by the electric companies, so turbogenerators have a long return of investment. Therefore, large quantities of bagasse remain after the season is over. Hauling this bagasse is expensive and as to now, no practical and economic uses of bagasse exist as an alternative to burning. Strategies to use this material must consider on-site preparation and conversion. Extending the grinding season with other crops to provide more consistent supply to the grid is an alternative that needs to be evaluated. This includes sizing boilers and turbogenerators, balancing the factory and improving efficiency to provide consistent feed to boilers.On the other hand, the goal of producing 36 billion gallons per year of renewable fuels by 2022, of which 16 billion must originate from cellulosic material (Energy independence and security act, 2007), requires an estimated 1 billion ton of biomass per year (U.S. Department of Energy, 2011). Sugar mills have the necessary infrastructure to expand their product portfolio into providing future biorefineries with sugar syrups, lignocellulosic biomass and electricity by complementing the sugarcane grinding season with energy crops. Sweet sorghum and energy cane have been identified as potential biomass crops for Louisiana. After multi-year crop production, fallow sugarcane fields provide a cultural opportunity for alternative biomass crops such as sweet sorghum and energy cane during this period. The possibility of using current sugar cane infrastructure to harvest, transport and process energy cane and sweet sorghum is another clear advantage of sugar mills for processing these crops.This proposal intends to contribute to the improvement of the Louisiana sugar industry by devising strategies for optimal operation and its expansion into a multi-feedstock and multi-product facility, processing sugar cane, sweet sorghum and energy cane with high efficiencies to produce raw sugar, molasses, bagasse, sugar syrups and electricity for the general and the biorefinery markets."

Sweet sorghum is a crop that can provide readily fermentable sugars and significant quantities of cellulosic material and is adapted over a wide geographical area which enhances potential use as a biofuel/biochemical crop. Sweet sorghum has primarily been used in a niche syrup production system and there is limited research regarding effects of agronomic practices on productivity. Although row spacing was not a criteria in recent studies in Louisiana, locations using relatively narrow row spacing reported greater biomass and sugar yields. It would be beneficial to understand the relationship of row spacing and plant density on biomass and sugar yield from sweet sorghum grown in southeast US environments. Sweet sorghum and energy sorghum have previously been used as forage crops and harvest timing for quality forage would probably differ from optimum harvest time for biochemical use. It would be beneficial to better understand sorghum plant development so decisions concerning alternative uses could be made within a growing season and producers would not be economically bound to a single use. The impact of row spacing and plant density on forage quality, biomass and fermentable sugar production will be evaluated. Results should provide production guidelines to producers for using sweet sorghum or energy sorghum as forage for livestock or as feedstock for biofuel/biochemical processes. Information derived from these studies could also provide a basis for decisions by industry personnel regarding potential for production plant locations.There is currently an initiative to reduce nutrient losses from fields into water bodies. Nitrogen loss from agricultural systems is considered an environmental concern but also has economic implications as well. Studies have shown winter grown crops including forage radish can accumulate N and reduce the potential for N leaching. There are indications brassica crops can outperform some annual cool-season grasses for nutrient capture in some environments or under certain conditions. Cool-season annual grasses are commonly overseeded into pastures in the southeast USA and research is needed to determine the feasibility of utilizing forage radish as a pasture crop and determine if this species can contribute benefit to pasture soils and possibly reduce the risk of nutrient leaching or runoff. Studies will be designed to evaluate productivity and nitrogen scavenging potential of forage (tillage) radish and other overseeded crops and the effect on some soil properties. Effect of overseeded pasture crops on soil physical properties such as bulk density, and water infiltration rates will be measured. Results should provide information regarding potential of overseeded crops to stabilize pasture nutrients and enhance pasture soil properties. Findings from these studies could be used as demonstration of a means to reduce environmental concerns from agriculture runoff."

The project include five objectives. The objective 1 is designed to generate essential data needed for making science-based decision regarding the suitability of seed blend refuge strategies for Bt corn resistance management in the U.S. south region. Contamination of non-Bt refuge corn from Bt corn pollen and larval movement are the two major concerns for the use of seed blend. To address these uncertainties, resistance risk in seed blend will be assessed for three commonly used pyramided Bt corn technologies. Intensive laboratory, greenhouse, and field studies will be conducted to investigate the effects of seed blend on Bt protein expression in kernels, insect movement, survival, development, and reproduction of four major pest species targeted by Bt corn in the South. Data generated from these studies will be used to determine if seed blend significantly reduces refuge populations and/or create a favorable condition for resistance selection.Objective 2 will document and mitigate fall armyworm (FAW) resistance to Bt corn in the U.S. south region, a research priority recently identified by the Southern Corn-Insect Working Group. Our recent work has shown that resistance allele frequency to Cry1F Bt corn in FAW is high in some areas of the south and field resistance might have occurred in some spots in Florida. The consequences would be extraordinary if field resistance to Cry1F corn occurs and spreads in the U.S. Therefore, it is urgently needed to document the current status of the Cry1F resistance and develop the corresponding resistance mitigation strategies. In the study, F2 screen and dose-response bioassay will document the resistance status in FAW across the region and thus to determine the areas where mitigation actions are needed. Intensive laboratory, greenhouse, and field studies will identify Bt corn traits and chemical insecticides that can be used for Cry1F resistance mitigation. In addition, upon completion of the study, an enhanced Bt resistance monitoring program will be established. Such monitoring program is essential for implementation of effective resistance management plans for Bt crops.During the 2007-2009 cropping season, Hessian fly seriously damaged wheat in many fields across the state. Yield loss due to Hessian fly damage was estimated to be 60-80% in some fields in south Louisiana. In addition, a new insect, the sugarcane aphid, has recently become a severe pest of grain sorghum in 2013 in LA and several other states in the south. Effective management methods are urgently needed to control the outbreak of this pest in the state. Objectives 3 and 4 of the project will develop effective strategies for managing these insect pests. Data generated from this study will define the temporal occurrence, plant damage, and yield loss caused by insect pests of wheat and grain sorghum. Insect occurrence and plant injury will be surveyed in selected wheat varieties commonly planted in Louisiana. Agronomically acceptable varieties resistant/tolerant to Louisiana populations of Hessian fly or sugarcane aphid will be identified from the field trials. The information generated from this study can be used by wheat/sorghum growers in areas where Hessian fly/sugarcane aphid could be a problem. In objective 5, field trials will be conducted to evaluate novel seed treatment technologies for managing insect pests in early plant stages of field corn and grain sorghum in south Louisiana.A scientifically sound decision making of resistance management plans for Bt corn for the southern region of the U.S. is not only important for the south but also will be critical to ensure the long-term durability of Bt crops for the entire country. Accomplishment of the objectives will also ensure that effective mitigation plans will be implemented in the target areas to ensure the long-term success of Bt corn as an IPM tool. Resistant insect populations (e.g. corn earworm or fall armyworm) in the South, if developed, could move to the rorth and thus place a great threat to Bt corn in the North Corn Belt. In addition, data generated from this study will be useful to validate or improve the  conditionally approved  seed blend strategy that is currently used in the North Corn Belt. Information generated from this project will also provide supporting data to improve the current LA Cooperative Extension Service recommendations for pest management of corn and small grains."

Even though aflatoxin contamination occurs less frequently in pistachio and almond nuts compared to other crops such as corn and peanuts, some pistachio and almond nuts do become aflatoxin-contaminated in commercial orchards. Aflatoxins are widely regulated by governments, who have set very low tolerances for aflatoxins in food and feed. Strains of A. flavus that are not able to produce aflatoxin ( atoxigenic  strains) are able to successfully reduce aflatoxin contamination by displacing or excluding the aflatoxin-producing strains of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. Although several atoxigenic strains have been registered and are being applied commercially for aflatoxin reduction, the main atoxigenic strain used in the western United States is the atoxigenic A. flavus strain AF36. The use of the atoxigenic A. flavus strain AF36 as a biocontrol agent was developed first in Arizona. We have found that the atoxigenic strain AF36 is naturally widespread in California, occurring in all of the major pistachio- and almond-growing counties. After doing research for 10 years and obtaining efficacy data in commercial pistachio orchards, the atoxigenic strain AF36 was registered for pistachio in the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. In 2013, about 150,000 acres of commercial pistachios were treated with AF36. In this new project, we plan to evaluate new formulations of the atoxigenic AF36 product involving sorghum and seed coating (possibility for the sorghum inoculum to replace the newly produced sorghum AF36-inoculum. and determine the optimal time of application of AF36 strain for one time application within a year. Along the same lines, it is essential to determine the population dynamics and survival of AF36 in almond and pistachio orchards under different commercial settings and evaluate aflatoxin contamination levels of nuts as affected by commercial application of AF36 after registration. Furthermore, we will continue searching for more atoxigenic strains in pistachio and almond orchards so that to adapt mixtures for applying them in the field. It is expected these mixtures to have a better fit in the environment and colonize more diverse habitats. The methodology used to investigate these objectives has been commonly used in our laboratory for years now with a lot of success. We expect some major outcomes after the completion of this project. First, the growers will have a putative new product (AF36 sorghum inoculum) to use; second, information on the optimal time for application of the AF36; third, an answer on whether the atoxigenic strain would be needed to be applied once yearly or once every other year; forth, information about fitness and survival of mixtures of atoxigenic strains in comparison with the single registered strain AF36. It is expected that a mixture of atoxigenic strains will occupy a more diverse habitat in almond and pistachio orchard, thus have a better fit in the environment, and expected to survive more diverse soil environmental conditions."

Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is the major crop grown in this region, with 3.75 million acres planted and 2.44 million bales harvested in 2013 (http://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Ag_Statistics/2013/). Other important cash crops grown in rotation with cotton include wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and corn (Zea mays L.). Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) and guar (Cyamopsis tetragonolobus L.) may be planted on more acres as water efficient crops are in more demand and are effective alternatives in a cotton rotation system. Water is the key limiting factor in crop production and dryland (rainfed) production is dependent on the timeliness and amount of rainfall. In areas where cotton has been established and maintained, record cotton yields have been recorded in part due to crop genetics and improved crop protection options. A key limiting factor to crop production is weeds. At least 12 billion dollars annually are lost due to weeds growing with crops in the United States (Holt and Orcutt 1991). Producers spend approximately 3.6 billion dollars on chemical weed control and approximately 2.6 billion dollars on cultural, ecological, and biological methods of weed control (Tsaftaris 1996)."

Detoxification of the mycotoxins through either adsorption or degradation as the last defending mechanism in preventing the adverse effects of the mycotoxins to humans and animals is still critical. This study is aimed to select and modify clays and layered double hydroxides to improve their binding efficiency for these five major agriculturally important mycotoxins. We also will tackle more practical challenges in the use of the clays and layered double hydroxide in removing or inactivating the mycotoxins in vitro (fermentation) and in vivo. The specific objectives are to: 1) Modify smectites to ensure the nanominerals&#39; binding efficacy for aflatoxins in real corn fermentation solutions; 2) Modify smectites to improve the nanominerals&#39; catalytic functions in degrading adsorbed aflatoxins in corn fermentation solutions; 3) Engineer smectites to detoxify aflatoxins in vivo at realistic toxin levels in broiler chickens; and 4) explore and modify clays and layered double hydroxides for binding fumonisin, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone. Once implemented in practices, the adverse effects of the mycotoxins to animals and humans; and the economical losses of corn growers, biofuel industry, and animal industry can be minimized.Arsenic, zinc, lead, copper, nickel and many other heavy metals are the major concerns of acid mine drainage (AMD) resulting from the oxidation of sulfide minerals exposed to air. In theory, acid mine drainage and heavy metal contamination should not be problems in limestone areas due to the abundance of carbonate minerals that can neutralize the acidity. Poorly crystalline nanoparticles such as various iron oxides, silica, and the oxides of heavy metals are the most reactive compounds in regulating the heavy metals. Unfortunately, our knowledge on these reactive particles in the limestone environment or the liming reclamation areas is very limited due to the difficulties of characterization of these materials with common methods and instruments. The general objectives of our study are to: 1) characterize on an atomic scale low-crystallinity nanoparticles and colloids generated in AMD and examine their transformations in a limestone environment, 2) characterize As (the major focus), Zn, Cu, and Pb speciation in each associated solid phase and quantify the mobilization and transformation of As and the heavy metals associated with the mineral phase conversions, and 3) model the reactivity of the nanoparticles and the geochemistry of As and heavy metals in the limestone environment. This proposed study will characterize both representative field samples and simulation samples, combine several advanced spectroscopic and microscopic methods and geochemical modeling to address the speciation, composition, atomic scale structures and the influence of the heavy metals and metalloid on the nanoparticles. The results will offer more insight to the geochemistry of the nanoparticles AMD and offer more structural and thermodynamic parameters for modeling."

Herbicides typically exert enormous selection pressures due to high control efficacies. Currently, herbicide-resistant weeds pose an immense threat to crop production efficiency worldwide. As of 2015, there are 449 unique cases of herbicide resistance in 245 weed species across the world (Heap 2015). A common phenomenon shared by these cases is that weed management practitioners relied heavily on few herbicide options without implementing sufficient management diversity (Norsworthy et al. 2012).In Texas, the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds is an emerging problem in several cropping systems, tremendously affecting crop yields, quality and profitability. Currently, glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth and common waterhemp are two major weed issues in Texas causing serious economic damages in a number of row-crops, including cotton, sorghum, corn and soybean (Baumann 2013; McGinty et al. 2015). Herbicide-resistant annual ryegrass (resistance to ALS- and ACCase-inhibitors) is a serious threat to wheat production throughout the Blacklands of Texas (Swart 2012; Swart et al. 2012). The first ALS-inhibitor-resistant johnsongrass was reported in 2000 (Green 2000) and currently more resistant populations are suspected in Texas corn and sorghum. In Texas rice, ALS-inhibitor-resistant red rice (Avila et al. 2005) and barnyardgrass (Bradshaw, personal communication) are two of the important resistant weed problems. As a result of growing resistance issues, producers are forced to use more and more environmentally less-benign herbicides in their weed management programs, which has a direct impact on production costs and the environmental footprint of weed management practices. Surveys indicate that herbicide-resistant weed issues have tremendously increased herbicide use, hand-weeding, and mechanical tillage, tremendously increasing crop production costs (Sosnoskie and Culpepper 2014). In areas where conservation tillage practices have been adopted for long-time, returning to tillage as a means for controlling herbicide-resistant weeds has been jeopardizing all the soil conservation gains made over the past several years (Shaw et al. 2012). Overall, herbicide resistance issues have been threatening the sustainability of economical weed management in several cropping systems in Texas.Although herbicide resistance, particularly resistance to glyphosate, is a growing problem in Texas, it is still in its early stages in several parts of the state. There is a critical need to prevent further evolution and spread of resistant weeds and effectively manage already existing resistant populations. The key to preventing resistance is to be proactive, but a better understanding of the factors influencing the evolution of herbicide resistance can guide the deployment of robust and effective proactive tactics. Knowledge on weed biology, population genetics, management factors, and their interactions is vital to understand the evolutionary dynamics of herbicide resistance. However, research information is often limited in this regard.Developing a robust resistance management strategy begins with an understanding of the background levels of resistance at regional scales. A key consideration to herbicide resistance management is managing selection pressure (Norsworthy et al. 2012), which is achieved through diversifying management tools by integrating both chemical and non-chemical options. Diversified approaches will minimize selection pressure placed on a single management tool. Yet, the number of tools available for effective resistance prevention and management are limited. While there is a need to develop additional tools for integration, it is critical to protect and preserve all the management tools that are currently available. Additionally, research efforts are needed to develop stewardship practices to ensure sustainable deployment of herbicides and herbicide-resistant crop technologies in our cropping systems and minimize potential unintended impacts on the broader environment. Further, developing decision-support tools are necessary to facilitate extension and outreach activities geared towards promoting widespread adoption of sustainable resistance management practices."

Components of sustainable farming practices may include: adapted hybrid selection, such as sorghum (choosing the best adapted sorghum hybrid is one of the least expensive and yet potentially one of the most cost effective decisions growers make); water conserving farming practices, such as strip till (strip till allows the placement of lower cost nitrogen fertilizer and deeper, root-capturing placement of phosphate fertilizer, while fracturing shallow tillage pans directly below where the crop seeds will be planted with less disruption of the soil-conserving crop residue than conventional tillage), twin row planting (twin row planting is paired seed rows instead of single rows arrangements for quicker row crop canopy, which conserves soil moisture and shades out competitive weeds), and drag driplines for center pivot irrigation (drag driplines combine the water efficiency of surface drip irrigation with the ease and mobility of a center pivot); and cover crops in dryland fallow (cover crops promote soil health and abate soil erosion)."

An interdisciplinary IPM approach will be taken (e.g., economic threshold studies integrated with natural enemy and resistant sorghum assessment) with additional ties to allied research in remote sensing strategies to increase the efficiency and effectiveness in detecting this invasive aphid pest of sorghum. Characterization of pest damage will allow establishment of IPM decision-making aids such as field monitoring methods and economic thresholds.

Its role as health promoting food, tolerance to major environmental stresses (heat and drought), potential as bio-fuel feedstock and its versatility for use in various applications have contributed to the renewed interest in the crop. Kansas is the leading producer of grain sorghum; thus Kansas farmers will be the major beneficiary from this growing interest and economic benefits that this may bring. Because of its inherent tolerance to heat and drought, the crop is well embraced by farmers in much of the state and other southern states. The incidence of heavy drought met in years 2011 and 2012 proved the unprecedented resilience of sorghum and its potential for dry land agriculture in the United States. Nevertheless, sorghum suffers the most from drought stress globally because it is exclusively grown in parts of the world frequently hit by drought. In the US, sorghum is mainly grown as rain fed crop in the driest parts of the country, and thus seriously suffers from occasional drought and heat stress. High yielding hybrids with increased resilience to drought are needed to achieve improved productivity and maintain high and stable profit margin for producers. Other a-biotic and biotic stresses such as cold temperature, grain weathering and stalk rot diseases are among the common barriers to increased productivity and competitiveness of the crop. Another unique problem faced by sorghum producers is competition by grass weeds. Lack of effective post-emergence weed control has undermined sorghum production and growers profitability. According to local farmers in Kansas persistent problem with weed control was the major driver for the decline of sorghum acreage in the state. Fortunately opportunities exist to overcome these constraints. Scientific information on sorghum physiology and genetics related to these factors are becoming available and this along with the wealth of genetic variability in the crop can be exploited to develop germplasm and parent lines enhanced for these traits. Sorghum is one of the most genetically diverse cultivated species; it harbors genetic sources that can be exploited to overcome most of the problems that sorghum producers are facing today. While the key trait associated with post-flowering drought tolerance have been effectively incorporated in modern breeding lines, new traits associated with pre-flowering drought stress have begun to come to light and our program is in the forefront in that endeavor."

The Bayou Teche region has unique soils and production environments that require screening of experimental sugarcane clones for local adaptation. Upon assignment of permanent numercial designations in year six of the breeding program, experimental clones will be evaluated in the region using both hand-harvested and combine-harvested nurseries. Successful clones will be advanced to the final yield trials and ultimately released to the industry. The fallow period between crops in the sugarcane production cycle is longwhich subjects soil in those fields to erosion for about a year. Occupation of this fallow period with legume cover cropswould protect against sediment removal, provide nitrogen for the subsequent plant-cane cropand allow the use of grass herbicides to controlimportant grass weeds of sugarcane. Both sunn hemp and ironclay cowpea will be evaluated for suitability as cover crops, with emphasis for effects on sugarcane yield and the possibility of N fertilizer credits. Sugarcane residue remaining after combine harvesting is typically burned on the ground to prevent lower yields in the subsequent ratoon crop. While the yearly effects on crop production have been well quantified, the long-term effects of post-harvest residue managementon sugarcane production and nutrient cycling have not received the same amount of attention. A study, in place since 1997 andcurrently in crop cycle number five, is designed to measure the temporal changes in the soil andcrops of the cycle. The environmentally responsible approach to reduce non-point source of pollution in sugarcane production is to eliminate burning in favor of the development of management practices that retainresidue for sediment control and soil organic matter maintenance. Sugarcane loses about 1,362grams of sucrose per ton of sugarcane biomass for each 454grams of vegetative and soil material present during processing, but such interference in sugar recovery is not completely known for sweet sorghum processing. A project will measure the influence of difference components of the vegetative materials (stalks, leaves and panicles) of sweet sorghum on the amount and proportionality of sugarsplant juice (sucrose, fructose and glucose). This information on sugar profile may be important for the production of biofuel products other than ethanol orfor the need of a particular ethanol quality standard."

The overall goal is to develop optimal strategies for converting agricultural biomass to biofuels and to create value-added products (bioproducts) that improve the economics of biorefining processes. Specific emphasis is to develop strategies for biorefineries located in the Western United States by using regionally-specific feedstocks and crops, including sorghum, almond byproducts, citrus juicing wastes, pomace, municipal solid wastes (MSW), and food processing wastes. These feedstocks will be converted into biofuels, bioenergy and fine chemicals.   Objective 1: Develop commercially-viable technologies for converting agriculturally-derived biomass, crop residues, biogas, and underutilized waste streams into marketable chemicals. Research on converting biogas will involve significant collaboration with one or more industrial partners. Sub-objective 1A: Provide data and process models for integrated biorefineries that utilize sorghum and available solid waste to produce ethanol, biogas and commercially-viable coproducts.  Sub-objective 1B. Convert biogas from biorefining processes into polyhydroxyalkanoate plastics.  Sub-objective 1C: Apply the latest tools in immobilized enzymes, nano-assemblies, to convert biomass to fermentable sugars, formaldehyde, and other fine chemicals.   Objective 2: Develop commercially-viable fractionation, separation, de-construction, recovery and conversion technologies that enable the production of marketable products and co-products from the byproducts of large-scale food production and processing. Sub-objective 2A: Add value to almond byproducts. Sub-objective 2B: Apply bioenegineering of bacteria and yeast to produce diacids, ascorbic acid and other value-added products from pectin-rich citrus peel waste. Sub-objective 2C: Convert  Approach: Objective 1, referred to by some as Gen 1.5 Biorefineries, involves development of processes that will generate advanced biofuels using the “cheapest source of carbons” within a given region.  Sub-objective 1A provides data about the properties of grain, forage, and sweet sorghum grown in California. Compositional analysis of cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose for grain, forage, and sweet sorghum varieties grown in California provides growers information to decide whether sorghum will become a viable biofuels feedstock in integrated biorefineries that also include anaerobic digestion.   Sub-objective 1B is goal-driven research toward improving methanotrophic bacteria for commercial production of commodity and fine chemicals. High throughput mutagenesis is employed to enrich production of polyhydroxyalkanoate, PHA, from mixed populations. Sub-objective 1C tests the hypothesis that bioconversion of biomass substrates into value-added products will be achieved more efficiently with enzymes anchored to nano-assemblies, compared with using the same enzymes free in solution. The basic nano-assembly building block, termed the Rosettasome, will spontaneously assemble into an 18-subunit, double-ring structure that holds up to 18 different enzymes. Proposed research involves developing optimized Rosettazymes for hydrolyzing various biomass substrates into value-added bioproducts using multiple tethered enzymes.  Objective 2 will provide data and technology that will add value to food processing byproducts. Sub-objective 2A consists of a goal-driven series of engineering developments to recover value-added free sugars, hemicellulose, and gums from almond byproducts. Release and utilization of free sugar and sugar alcohol can be improved by optimizing extraction parameters (time, temperature, particle size of the hulls, etc.) during hot water isolation. This process releases fermentable sugars, hemicellulose molasses and gums from almond shells and hulls. Equations  and their corresponding parameters will be developed into process models for recovery of water soluble sugars in almond hulls. The goal is to add increased value to all components of the almond processing industry.  Research in sub-objective 2B is driven by the hypothesis that whole cells can be engineered to convert pectin and other specific oligosaccharides into value-added products more efficiently than using multi-step chemical or enzymatic reactions. This will be achieved by applying bioenegineering of bacteria and yeast to produce diacids, ascorbic acid, and other value-added products from pectin-rich citrus peel waste.   The general hypothesis driving sub-objective 2C is that bioconversion research is that specific well-defined enzymes can be applied to  surgically  remove selective branching groups from individual polysaccharide substrates via controlled enzymatic debranching and cleavage of main chain polymers."

Determine the degree to which heat stress impacts sorghum grain quality traits.

Characterize phytonutrient composition in tannin and black sorghum germplasm grown at multiple locations.  Approach: Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is an important drought tolerant crop in regions of the Great Plains where water is limited and rainfall unpredictable. Sorghum has been primarily used for animal feed in the U.S. but recently has seen increasing use in the food and biofuel industries which has provided a new growth area for sorghum utilization. That said, there has not been extensive research conducted on grain quality factors related to sorghum. Recent advances have been made regarding improving sorghum protein and starch digestibility at the genetic level, yet little is known about how environmental factors impact sorghum grain quality attributes and nutritional bioavailability. Sorghum is typically grown under non-irrigated conditions and can face serious drought and heat stress during grain fill. Drought and heat stress may become more prevalent in sorghum growing regions due to climate change and have the potential to severely impact sorghum grain composition and end-use quality traits. Consistency is an important quality attribute of cereal crops and further research is required to quantify the degree to which sorghum grain quality is impacted by the environment. Our research will support on-going efforts to improve sorghum grain quality at the genetic level by providing grain quality information to breeding programs about the stability of various traits. We will provide knowledge of how drought and heat stress impacts sorghum grain quality, ultimately providing information necessary for the sorghum breeding community to improve the end-use quality of sorghum."

Examine the impact and sensitivity of resistance management options for major insect pests of southern row crops through simulated modeling.  Approach: Insect management guidelines are generally static from year to year regardless of crop prices, costs of insecticides and yield potential of the crop.  We plan to summarize published information for bollworm, tarnished plant bug, and stink bugs and develop economic injury level probability distributions using Monte Carlo simulations.   On-farm field evaluations across the Mississippi Delta will evaluate economic returns and environmental sustainability of different insecticidal control strategies in soybean and cotton.  Commercially available and experimental sweet potato varieties will be planted annually and the economic impact of insect and nematode control in sweet potato will be examined.  The impact of current insect management strategies in southern row crops on populations of pollinators and beneficial insects will be examined in production fields. The surrounding habitats of each field will be documented for plant community composition, focusing on blooming plants that may be of interest to pollinators. Each of these fields will be sampled using a combination of sampling techniques.  Community structure will be compared between cropping systems, and related to insecticide applications. We plan to evaluate acute and sub-lethal toxicities and synergistic/antagonistic interactions of honey bees to commonly used pesticides.  An examination of gene regulation in honey bees associated with immunity, adaptation, detoxification, digestion/metabolism, and stress-related genes will be conducted after exposure to pesticides with techniques such as real-time PCR , RNAseq or microarrays.  Hemipteran and lepidopteran phytophagous pest populations are highly mobile within the landscape and use a variety of weeds and crops as host plants. To examine landscape influences on these insects, the landscape composition surrounding historic and current collection locations will be quantified using Cropland Data Layers (CDLs).  Using these CDL layers, buffer zones will be generated around locations. Output data will be tabulated to produce total area of habitat type included within each buffer area and will be related to data collected on insect populations using appropriate statistical analyses.  SIMRU will continue to examine susceptibilities of hemipteran and lepidopteran insect pests collected from locations across the Mississippi Delta with a variety of assay methods which may include topically treated diet, residual contact bioassays, glass vial bioassays and a feeding contact assays using floral foam.  Insects from original collections will be preserved for molecular analysis using genetic markers.  When colonies of any of the pest groups have reduced susceptibility to the tested insecticides, efforts will be made to preserve the colony under a selected and non-selected sequence of exposures to the insecticides of interest We propose to develop rapid bioassays to predict the effectiveness of an insecticide application on a real field population of insects.  To examine predictive values of laboratory assays on actual field populations, a plot sprayer will be used to deliver a range of formulated product rates on targeted insects."

Effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs are vital to a sustainable cropping system. Over the next 5 years, the project will focus on the following objectives:  Objective 1: Evaluate newer herbicide chemistries (i.e., 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPPD) inhibitors, cell wall biosynthesis inhibitors, etc.) for efficacy of weed control in sugarcane and crop safety, as well as older, currently registered herbicides to improve weed management (tank-mix combinations, timing of application, use of spray adjuvants, etc.).  Objective 2: Evaluate cultural control methods for reducing weed interference in sugarcane including, but not limited to: varietal differences in competitiveness of sugarcane, inter-row tillage timing, type, frequency, and rotational crops (including green manure cover crops) that could be used during fallow season compared with chemical fallow, and site-specific management.  Objective 3: Enhance the role of plant resistance in managing damaging infestations of stem borers (i.e., sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer) in sugarcane. Sub-objective 3.A: Characterize fiber among commercial sugarcane cultivars resistant to the sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer. Sub-objective 3.B: Identify borer resistant progeny in high sucrose bi-parental crosses.  Objective 4: Identify control tactics for managing damaging infestations of a hemipteran complex (e.g., sugarcane aphid, yellow sugarcane aphid, West Indian canefly, and sugarcane delphacid) to include the role of soil health on these infestations and new insecticides for controlling the complex.  Approach: The approach to meeting the objectives of this project plan will be primarily in the form of replicated field experiments. Some of these field experiments will also be supported by laboratory analyses. New herbicide chemistries, when they become available, will provide the potential for greater efficacy in weed control; however, determining appropriate application rates, application timing, and application methodology will require replicated field experimentation that are repeated in multiple years. Results from these experiments will be used for obtaining labeling by EPA and ultimately in formulating extension recommendations to sugarcane growers. Cultural controls provide opportunities for reducing weed pressure by planting sugarcane varieties with greater competitiveness resulting in more efficient tillage practices (i.e. fewer cultivations). Planting rotational crops (e.g. soybean and sweet sorghum) will provide an additional income stream to growers while also aiding in suppressing weed infestations. To develop these improved cultural practices will also require a series of field experiments. The results from these studies will also be used to develop extension recommendations for sugarcane growers. Enhancing the role of plant resistance in controlling the sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer will require a more in-depth knowledge of fiber composition in commercial sugarcane varieties. A replicated field experiment consisting of sugarcane varieties with known reaction to sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer will provide plant tissue for detailed fiber analyses. Ultimately a fiber profile will be qualified and quantified that will allow selection for stem borer resistance in the absence of the insect pest. Finally, field experiments will be conducted to identify control tactics for managing damaging infestations of a four-species hemipteran complex infesting sugarcane. These experiments will seek to better refine damage thresholds and ultimately establish action thresholds for initiating insecticide applications. The most effective insecticide formulations will need be to be identified as well as determining their most economical application rates. Ultimately, the findings from this Project Plan will be used to develop improved and sustainable management strategies for weeds and insects pest of sugarcane primarily in Louisiana, but the findings are generally applicable for sugarcane grown in Florida and Texas."

The looming threats to food security demand transformative innovations in agriculture that will drive the second green revolution. Maize is the most economically important crop in the U.S providing food, feed and bioenergy to the global economy. It is also one of the most photosynthetically productive plants on the planet. This productivity is driven by biochemical and anatomical adaptations associated with C4 photosynthesis. One proposed grand challenge is to introduce C4 traits into C3 crops such as rice and many temperate grasses. A major conceptual breakthrough in the understanding of the development of C4 photosynthesis was realized through the discovery that a root endodermal cell fate module was co-opted to drive a leaf specific cellular differentiation program. Importantly, a prediction from this model suggests that a limited number of changes in genes could lead to a major reprogramming of leaf cell fates.  This project will test this prediction and expand on our understanding of the gene regulatory networks that drive both biochemical and anatomical innovations associated with C4 photosynthesis. The results of these studies will not only provide candidate genes for engineering C4 traits into C3 crops, but also provide novel targets for improvement of existing C4 crops such as maize, sugarcane and sorghum. With regard to training and outreach, the project will continue to expand on the MutantMillets outreach program at the DDPSC. MutantMillets provides teaching modules and teaching resources with hands-on activities in the plant sciences to engage high school students in the St. Louis metropolitan region. Importantly, all resources developed through this program will be portable to other school systems through the project website and through the educational networks established by the Education and Outreach Center at the DDPSC. Grasses that utilize C4 photosynthesis include maize, sorghum, sugarcane and Miscanthus.  C4 grasses use two distinct cell types to create a CO2 pump that elevates the levels of CO2 in the vicinity of the enzyme Rubisco, effectively eliminating wasteful photorespiration. Under hot, dry conditions C4 systems display significantly increased productivity relative to C3 crops such as rice and wheat. This project aims to identify the foundational genetic and regulatory networks that control the differentiation of the two photosynthetic cell types in maize - the bundle sheath (BS) and mesophyll (M). This work expands on recent discoveries that has linked the SHR/SCR/IDD regulatory module to the differentiation of the BS and M cells of maize and provides new opportunities to more fully explore the function of this regulatory network in C4 grasses through an integrated systems biology approach. These studies will include the development and implementation of several emerging technologies including cell-type specific proteomics, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technologies, robotics-based yeast one hybrid screens, ChIP-seq, translatomics, X-ray computed tomography, novel informatics/network analysis algorithms, and modeling of both developmental phenotypes and mechanistic regulatory networks. All data and resources generated in this project will be made accessible to the public through the project website and through long-term repositories."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Samuel Leiboff is  Exploring Gene Networks in Maize Tassel and Sorghum Panicle Development during Drought  The host institution for the fellowship is the USDA-ARS Plant Gene Expression Center and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Sarah C. Hake.Increasing crop yield during drought is a critical challenge for U.S. corn production. The male flowering structure or tassel of the corn plant makes several branches, which produce the pollen necessary for fertilizing female flowers found in corn ears. During severe drought early in the growing season, energy is re-routed from the tassel to the ear and the number of tassel branches decreases, potentially leading to a shortage of pollen during the season. Sorghum's flowering structure, or panicle, is highly drought-resistant and sorghum has therefore been studied as an ideal crop for drier regions of the U.S. This project aims to understand genome-wide responses to drought in corn tassels and sorghum panicles, providing molecular information for breeding better plant performance during drought. Broader impacts include the formation of undergraduate outreach programs promoting STEM majors, research, and career opportunities to increase participation and retention of LGBT undergraduate students in STEM academic and professional fields. Students will be surveyed over time and long-term management of the programs will be transferred to campus advocacy groups, providing an outreach model for campuses nationwide. Training objectives include genomics, bioinformatics, biological modeling, and molecular genetics. Although previous studies have elucidated gene regulatory networks (GRNs) responsible for tassel branching in maize, little is known about how tassel GRNs respond to abiotic stresses, such as drought. Whereas several maize GRNs are conserved in other grasses, sorghum panicle GRNs have not been established. Using drought to manipulate tassel/panicle morphology, this project will explore GRN-wide drought response in maize and sorghum, including known mutants of tassel/panicle morphology. This research will use RNAseq to analyze inflorescence tissue from several different drought simulations. Leveraging existing GRN and genome resources in maize and sorghum, this project will generate and compare dynamic, drought responsive tassel/panicle GRNs. With these GRNs, morphological models linking RNA levels to tassel/panicle branching will be constructed. To test morphological-GRN models, this project will generate and analyze novel tassel/panicle mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques. Research findings and analysis methodologies will be disseminated through conferences, publications, and submissions to data/code repositories (NCBI-SRA, NCBI-GEO, GitHub, MaizeGDB, and Grassius).Keywords: abiotic stress, co-expression networks, drought, inflorescence biology, maize genetics"

When cowpea is combined with starchy grains such as corn, sorghum or rice, the result is a complete source of major nutrients for energy and growth. It also provides protein-rich leaves and is used for animal feed.  Cowpea is the primary source of protein for people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where it is presently produced on over 20 million acres mainly by farmers with small land holdings. Its popularity is also due to its resilience to low rainfall and heat while also enriching the soil. Despite its relevance to food security in Africa and elsewhere, there has been relatively little basic research on cowpea. Advances in next generation sequencing technology have made it possible to  read  the genetic material of cowpea and decipher the instructions (genes and genetic variation) that ultimately provide for crop improvement.  Producing an optimized reference genome sequence for cowpea is one of the main goals of this project, a feat that has been accomplished for human, mouse, cow and economically important crop plants such as corn, soybean, rice, bean and poplar. A broader purpose is to provide genetic resources to improve decision-making abilities within an existing network of African cowpea breeders. Breeders develop new varieties by making crosses between parents that carry favorable traits and selecting progeny containing favorable characteristics of both parents. This project will provide new materials for progeny selection in addition to knowledge that will facilitate the development of new cowpea varieties for increased food production. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is in the family Fabaceae, tribe Phaseoleae which includes other warm season legumes such as soybean, common bean and pigeon pea, as well as Vigna species adzuki bean and mung bean. Cowpea is diploid with 2n=22 chromosomes and a genome size of 620 Mb. Unlike other legumes, cowpea lacks a published reference genome. A highly fragmented draft genome sequence assembly has been available from previous work since 2011 (harvest-blast.org; harvest-web.org) and is derived from 60x short-reads combined with BAC-end and gene survey Sanger sequences. This project will elevate the sequence of cowpea to state-of-the art by: (1) adding long-read sequences and an optical map; (2) anchoring contigs to a recently developed genetic map containing 37,372 SNPs; and (3) improving browser access for the broader legume community. This will enable deeper utilization of cowpea germplasm for gene discovery and marker development, while providing a stronger foundation for the cowpea genetics and breeding community. Genetic intercrosses will be conducted to produce new pre-breeding lines that will theoretically carry optimal combinations of traits present within elite lines using a recently developed multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population based on eight parental lines. Marker-trait information, in the context of the genome sequence and haplotypes, will be disseminated for broad adoption of marker-informed breeding. This work is tightly linked to leading breeding programs in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria and Senegal through USAID Feed the Future and CGIAR Tropical Legumes projects."

Becraft (Iowa State University), Joanne M. Dannenhoffer (Central Michigan University), and Gary N. Drews (University of Utah)Endosperm is a major component of the seed, and is biologically and economically important. In all angiosperms, endosperm provides nutrients and signals to the embryo during seed development. In cereal grains, endosperm composes a large proportion of the mature seed, and contains large amounts of carbohydrates and proteins, which provide more than 50% of the calories in the human diet, either directly or indirectly through animal feed. Cereal endosperm also serves as a raw material for manufacturing important industrial products, including ethanol. Maize is an excellent model system for molecular genetic analysis of cereal endosperm and is the primary subject of this research project which focuses on maize early endosperm development, encompassing the time when the endosperm grows from a single cell into a multicellular structure composed of different specialized cell types.  Although the molecular mechanisms that control this developmental period have not been elucidated, they are likely to affect many economically important processes including, but not limited to, the regulation of seed size, and accumulation of starch and protein during grain filling. In addition to the training of students and postdoctoral associates, the project will provide summer research training internships for undergraduate students from Central Michigan University.      To identify genetic pathways that control endosperm cell differentiation, gene expression profiling will be performed on each endosperm cell type at multiple time points; this will be accomplished through a combination of laser-capture microdissection to collect specific endosperm cell types and the RNA-seq method (high throughput sequencing of cDNA) to identify all the genes expressed in the collected tissues. This information will be used as a framework for gene-network analysis in two of the endosperm cell types: the starchy endosperm and basal transfer layer. Starchy endosperm is the major repository for starch and protein accumulation, while the basal transfer layer is important for transporting sugar and amino acid building blocks into the growing grain; both tissues are important for grain yield and quality. The gene networks will be revealed by performing gene co-expression analysis and key transcription factors will be studied with protein-DNA assays and genetic analyses.  Early endosperm development is highly sensitive to drought stress which can decrease grain yield, even if favorable moisture conditions are restored. To identify the gene-expression perturbations caused by drought stress in maize kernels, gene expression profiling will be performed with kernels from drought-stressed plants. In addition, this project will profile the genes expressed during early endosperm development in a closely related cereal, sorghum, and use comparative genomics with maize to reveal fundamental and species-specific aspects of endosperm development. Data generated can be accessed through the project website (www.grainendosperm.org) as well as through long-term repositories such as MaizeGDB and NCBI's GEO and SRA."

A report on contending 21st Century needs for food, water, and energy commissioned by the National Science Foundation15 responds that ... it is impossible to project strategies for meeting these demands without considering two other key factors: energy and water. Society is increasingly forced to choose, for example, between using land and fertilizer for food production or for bio-based or renewable energy production, and between using fresh water for energy production (e.g., hydraulic fracturing or growing corn for biofuels) or for irrigating food crops. Neither wheat nor sorghum is achieving the 2 %/yr rate of yield gain needed to meet the 2050 food goal alone, even for fully watered crops. (Wheat is currently at 0.9 %/yr14.) Meeting this target when less water is available due to competition from other uses makes the problem acute. This is true even for sorghum where use as a bioenergy crop competes with feeding animals. Water uses in feedlots include cattle drinking, suppressing dust, feed processing, cooling and washing animals, managing stock effluents, etc. Stock hydration, alone, takes 50-60 liters/day/head16. Although reducing systemic water needs by feeding wheat rather than sorghum is a Phase 1 priority in the near-final draft of the new Kansas Water Policy17 breeding is needed to make this possible. Yields must be adjusted to incentivize growers to produce the material and the grain must be made visibly distinct from existing varieties to enable appropriate grading and tracking in the marketing chain.An overriding context is climate change. Many previous climate scenarios have assumed a doubling of CO2 to ca. 700 ppm by 2100. However, the recently released IPCC Fifth Assessment report18 places the 2100 level at 1000 ppm unless additional mitigation strategies are implemented beyond those now planned. This suggests levels of 575 ppm by 2050 vs. 496 ppm under older scenarios - an increment equal to the global CO2 increase from 1970-2010.In the past it seemed as if the rates of major systemic changes were slow enough that breeding programs might keep pace. As events have developed, however, this is far from true. For wheat the 35 years between now and 2050 is only five breeding cycles. (For sorghum it is 4.) And yet, currently, it is not even known whether wheat breeders should seek varieties that cope with water stress by maintaining cool canopies or ones that can function despite elevated leaf temperatures.It is therefore now imperative that breeding programs acquire predictive technologies to choose breeding targets in light of impending operating environments in the nexus of food- energy-water tradeoffs and climate. Moreover, increasing weather variability accompanied by more frequent extreme events means that farmers need tools permitting agile, within-season management adjustments.This proposal meets these needs.Physiological models track plant growth and development under conditions that change on hourly, daily, weekly, and yearly time scales but they do not incorporate genetics. Genetic models do but can struggle to predict endpoints resulting from complicated interactions. Both model types can benefit from the intensive sensory data streams coming online for breeders and crop managers. The first project objective melds the two model types of models so their relative strengths can complement each other. It also explicitly links them to data from high throughput platforms. The second objective places the needed computational power directly were it is needed, on the platforms that collect the data and, therefore, in the hands of breeders and crop managers. By doing so, it eliminates what might otherwise be significant delays and/or logistics complications in moving data from sensor to computation sites for conversion to answers."

In 2015, planted acreage of sorghum in Arkansas is estimated to be 500,000 acres, which is a marked increase from the last several years. Target leaf spot of sorghum has become one of the most widespread and frequently observed diseases of sorghum in Arkansas. Caused by Bipolaris sorghicola, target leaf spot is frequently observed throughout the state, particularly in the humid growing region of eastern Arkansas. Most sorghum varieties evaluated in recent years by the University of Arkansas Grain Sorghum Variety Testing Program are moderately to highly susceptible. During severe infections, lesions coalesce, leading to widespread leaf necrosis and defoliation. The overarching goal of this research is to understand the molecular basis of target leaf spot of sorghum. The specific objectives of this work are to 1) analyze a draft genome sequence for a reference isolate of the pathogen via comparative genomics to assess potential mechanisms of pathogenesis; 2) develop tools for molecular genetics in B. sorghicola, including genetic transformation protocols, 3) create molecular markers to assess genetic diversity in the pathogen, and 4) assess genetic diversity in natural populations of the pathogen in Arkansas and other states. Information derived from this project will contribute to the fundamental understanding of target leaf spot, and will provide information that can be used in public and commercial sorghum breeding programs to enhance genetic resistance."

For example, once a mutation is found, a breeder could simply cross that mutation into breeding stocks if the level of effect is desirable. Candidate gene analysis could be performed in an association panel to look for natural variation in the gene that might be selected by breeders. The identified gene could be used with molecular methods to modify gene function, or used in transgenic constructs.

US government in the last two years has increased research funding to small grains like sorghum and millet, and an evidence is the establishment of a  Feed the future Innovation lab  at Kansas State University, dedicated specifically to research the genetic diversity, value-addition and economic aspect of grain sorghum and millet. Millet production actually doubled between 2012 and 2013 in the US. The interest in using millet as ingredient in food and energy production is based on similarity of these grains to the common ones. Millet possesses characteristics similar to wheat and corn, two important cereals in the US. Millet therefore has the potentials to replace these other cereals in several human food applications and for energy production. Millet is particularly suitable because it is drought resistant, it is less susceptible (8 fold less) to aflatoxin incident than corn, it has comparable nutrient profile as wheat and corn. Some millet varieties have higher protein content than wheat and corn. A major advantage of millet versus grain sorghum is low level of antinutritional factor in millet. Also, about 3 million Americans are gluten intolerant, and millet is gluten free therefore it is an excellent ingredient for production of foods for this category of people where specialty food market attracts sales in billions dollars yearly, and it continues to increase. However, the understanding of millet important constituents, protein, starch and fiber functionality are very important in determining their effectiveness in various food and fuel applications. The need for research at this stage to evaluate the functionality of this grain&#39;s constituents and extensively test the quality attributes of the products produced from them, cannot be greater. There is significant opportunity for farmers in Kentucky to tap into the potential for profit available in the production of millet, considering the projected increase in demand for millet in the US, especially for production of gluten free foods and sport nutrition industry. Our goal in this project is to study the functionality of the important macronutrients available in proso millet cultivars, produce and study the quality characteristics of extruded products made from millet."

Also, I frequently answer questions from area growers or extension agents about forage and cover crop cultivar selection and production management. The information generated by the research in this project allows me to give growers advice to improve their forage crops performance and quality.The optimization of alfalfa management (fertility, seeding rate, and harvest frequency) greatly impacts the productivity. The studies in alfalfa fall dormancy, fall harvest, and alfalfa-grass mixtures will increase the forage yield on average at least 0.3 ton/acre/year. Pure alfalfa acreage in North Dakota in 2014 was 395,711 acres and alfalfa grass mixtures 1,000,961 acres (USDA FSA, 2014). An increase in forage yield of 0.3 tons/acre x 1,396,672 acres at a price of $100/ton of hay equals an economic impact of $41,900,160/year. Any improvement in alfalfa yield or reduction in cost by management has a tremendous economic impact. Forages are ranked third in value and acreage among all other crops in the USA. North Dakota is the second most important state in alfalfa acreage in the USA (USDA FSA, 2014).My program has additional impact by testing new forage sources and improving the management of the existing traditional forages. The economic impact of sorghums, forage brassicas, and other annual forages is difficult to estimate, because most of their benefits are indirect. North Dakota cover crop acreage in 2013 was 218,000 acres with a potential to increase which merits a need to provide management information to producers of cover crops.My project also includes bioenergy crops and cover crops research. The impact value of these are hard to estimate, but as a reference legume cover crops planted after wheat in one of our studies (Samarappuli et al., 2014) reduced the need of nitrogen fertilization in corn by 100 lbs N/acre/year. With a N credit of only 50 lbs N/acre, the economic value of reducing the fertilization in corn in 2,693,677 acres x 50 lbs N/acre at a saving of $0.3 lb N, is $40,405,169 per year."

Therefore, it is important to fully understand how to most effectively and efficiently utilize currently available herbicides, as well as take advantage of new herbicide safener techology to increase the margin of selectivity between cereal crops and target weed species. Grain sorghum growers, in particular, require new, selective herbicide technology options. Pyroxasulfone (ZiduaTM; previously known as KIH-485) is a new PRE herbicide from BASF that is not labeled for sorghum. Pyroxasulfone inhibits the same target enzymes (very-long-chain fatty acid elongases) as the chloroacetamide herbicides dimethenamid-p, s-metolachlor, alachlor, and acetochlor, but has a unique chemical structure. Pyroxasulfone offers an advantage compared to currently labeled chloroacetamides labeled for grain sorghum (s-metolachlor, alachlor and acetochlor) in that it provides longer residual weed control, as well as providing exceptional control of both annual grasses (Setaria and shattercane) and small-seeded dicots. In this proposal, I plan to collaborate with a sorghum geneticist and plant breeder(Dr. Patrick Brown, University of Illinois) to apply our collective expertise in herbicide physiology, plant metabolism, and sorghum molecular-genetics to assess the diversity of sorghum responses to pyroxasulfone with and without seed-applied safenertreatments, as well as gain a more fundamental understanding of the genes involved in natural sorghum tolerance to pyroxasulfone and safener-induced tolerance mechanisms.Knowledge gained from these studies will provide important, useful and timely information for improved management of hard-to-control annual grass weeds, as well as multiple-resistant Amaranthus populations in grain sorghum. Increasing the selectivity margin between grain sorghum and target weed species will translate into higher yields for sorghum growers and reduce the occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds. Pyroxasulfone is a promising new herbicide that is not yet labeled for use in grain sorghum. Results from the proposed project will be integrated with a similar, ongoing project in my program aimed towards studying s-metolachlor tolerance and fluxofenim responsiveness in diverse sorghum lines."

Specialty crops are those that are grown in small acreage relative to major crops (apples, canola, corn, cotton, grain sorghum, grapes, rice, oranges, soybean, sunflower, turf, peanuts, potatoes, sugarcane, tomato, tobacco, and wheat). Specialty crops encompass minor use fruits, herbs and spices, tree nuts, ornamentals, and minor use vegetables. Because of their small acreage, and the large expense in registering pesticides, there is hardly no economic incentive for biological or chemical pesticide companies to develop the necessary database required for registration of their products on specialty crops. The need for pesticide registration in specialty crops and minor uses led to the formation of what used to be called the Interregional Project #4, or the IR-4 Project. Today, the Specialty Crops and Minor Use Program has expanded to also include pesticides needed to protect public health such as control of mosquitoes and ticks. Including all secondary impacts, the IR-4 Project is anticipated to support research and industry sales to support 104,650 U.S. jobs and increases annual gross domestic product by $7.3 billion (Miller and Leschewski 2012).The IR-4 project facilitates the examination of pesticide ingredients, crops and locations where pesticides will be used, the manner of use, and potential impact on consumers and nontarget organisms. The project helps ensure that any pesticide registered for specialty crops fall below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) allowed by EPA for food and feed. Recently, the IR-4 Project has provided about 50% of field and residue data for EPA&#39;s annual work plan and new clearances. About 70 - 80% of IR-4 Project&#39;s effort supports the registration of reduced-risk pesticides, thereby reducing the risk to human and environmental health relative to existing, or recently de-registered products (Viray and Hollingworth 2009; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2001a). Reduced risk pesticides are applied at lower rates than the older compounds; thus, volume of chemicals uses in fruit and vegetable production.The IR-4 Project has three programs: 1) Food, 2) Ornamental Horticulture, and 3) Biopesticides and Organic Support. Minor-use food crops (vegetables, melons, fruits, and tree nuts) comprise about 25% of total agricultural food crop production, worth about $33 billion annually. Without available modern pest management tools, losses of food and income are high.This proposed project is under the Food Use Program. The Food Program works with growers to establish minor-use, food crop priorities that instruct the Food Program on which commodity-pesticide registration projects to pursue."

Drought, heat, aflatoxins, corn earworm and spider mite are major constraints for corn production in Texas and many parts of the world. Frequent drought and heat stress causes significant yield loss and destabilizes crop production. The Texas High Plains has one million acres of irrigated corn and produces the majority of grain and silage corn in Texas. The huge livestock and dairy industries in this region post a high demand for corn grain and silage production in the state. Irrigation is the largest input factor in feasible and sustained corn production within the Texas High Plains. Drought stress is prone in the rain-fed regions of the state. Currently, predominant corn hybrids grown in the Texas have a relative maturity of 115 days. Although these hybrids can yield 300 bu/ac, the declining Ogallala Aquifer water level and increasing pumping restrictions by the ground-water districts for crop production cannot sustain the current yield level. Thus, drought-tolerant hybrids are critical to sustain corn production in Texas, and shorter-season corn is one genetic approach to meet the forecasted reduction of irrigation. Breeding corn for drought tolerance and overall adaptation to Texas environments is the core objective of this project.Aflatoxin contamination of corn, caused by A. flavus, is a chronic problem in the southern states where a hot and dry environment favors aflatoxin production (Payne, 1992). A recent association study has confirmed previously reported QTLs and identified new makers associated to aflatoxin (Warburton et al., 2013, 2014). Insects can exacerbate aflatoxin levels in corn. The natural population of corn earworm (CEW) is high and very active in Texas and southern states due to widespread host plants (cotton, corn, sorghum, and spring weeds), mild winters, and 5-6 generations per year. The insect causes a significant loss in yield and grain quality and a great increase in aflatoxin contamination. In collaboration with Drs. Ni and Brewer, we infested corn plants with larvae of CEW and fall army worm and confirmed insect resistance in our inbred lines (Farias et al., 2014; Ni et al. 2012, 2014a, and 2014b). W In addition, spider mites can cause serious damage to corn plants in the High Plains. Periods of hot dry weather favor rapid mite population increase in conjunction with accumulation of aflatoxins in corn grains. Therefore, we believe that to effectively reduce aflatoxin risk in corn, we should improve drought and heat tolerance, and insect resistance in addition to incorporating direct kernel resistance into Texas corn germplasm.Development of a multiple stress-tolerant crop via selection of native genes, incorporation of transgenes, or both, requires efficient selection tools. Effective selection depends on accurate evaluation of the traits. Drought tolerance in crop plants is a complex trait. Its evaluation depends on the timing, intensity, and duration of drought stress. Our corn breeding program has focused on exploring native genes, established a drought tolerance screening protocol in the field in West Texas, and developed a number of drought tolerant corn lines and hybrids. Drought resistant corn genotypes show short anthesis-silking interval (Byrne et al., 1995), and maintain higher leaf water and leaf turgor potential due to deeper root systems. We determined that root characters and hydraulic lift (a process of water movement from relatively moist to dry soil layers using plant root systems as a conduit) play an important role in hybrid drought tolerance (Wan et al; 2000). Understanding genetic and physiological mechanisms of drought tolerance and establishing molecular breeding procedures for target traits (drought and heat tolerance, aflatoxin and others) can help the public and private breeders using our germplasm to move the traits/genes quickly into elite germplasm. Discovering the traits contributing to drought tolerance in these lines and hybrids and understanding the physiological and molecular basis of these traits is the second goal of this project. A number of our lines have been licensed to seed companies.Significant progress has been made by the Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research-Lubbock corn breeding program. Our inbred lines are currently used as a parent in commercial hybrids in the U.S and have been generating royalties since 2012. Two companies are currently utilizing our lines and hybrids in their commercial hybrids and paying royalty to Texas A&amp;M AgriLife. In 2014 we signed new Material Evaluation Agreements with three seed companies for evaluating our new lines and hybrids for commercialization.The unique characteristics of the lines and germplasm developed from our breeding program include that they are derived from crosses between the exotic germplasm (tropical, subtropical, and wild species) and U.S. temperate corn. Tropical germplasm and wild species represent vast gene pools for continued corn improvement. Our program has been an active cooperator in the USDA-ARS Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) project. The GEM breeding crosses were made between the best tropical populations identified by the Latin American Maize Project and elite temperate lines. These crosses harbor superior genes for improving pest resistance and broadening the genetic basis of commercial hybrids (Xu et al., 2003) and serve as an important source of germplasm for our breeding program.Our team has managed and conducted the state silage corn performance tests in the Texas High Plains (Etter and Halfway) since 2007 and has produced high quality comparison data. These tests have helped seed companies bring the best hybrids to Texas and assisted consultants and producers in choosing the best hybrids. Working closely with the seed industry and producers is paramount for transferring the technologies developed by our program."

In many cases, the basal defense response is believed to be responsible for non-host resistance: the phenomenon whereby most plants are resistant to most microbial pathogens. Furthermore, there is some evidence that MTI may be involved with quantitative disease resistance, resistance which although partial, tends to be extremely durable. While much is known about MTI in model species, this is not the case for crop plants. Furthermore, naturally-occurring variation in the MTI response within a species and its relationship to quantitative disease resistance is not well understood. This proposal seeks to use knowledge derived from studies on model plant species, as well as the rich genetic resources available for sorghum, to investigate variation in basal disease resistance in this species and, more specifically, the relationship of MTI to quantitative disease resistance. The cultivation of sorghum is expected to increase substantially in the next decade as it becomes more prominent as a biomass crop. As the practices and geographical areas under sorghum cultivation change it is inevitable that new disease challenges will be encountered. This project will provide us with greater understanding of the genetic architecture controlling sorghum basal disease resistance and its connection to quantitative disease resistance. It will identify loci and alleles that will be helpful for breeders in producing more robust sorghum lines designed for biomass production. Ultimately, the knowledge gained will inform efforts to improve basal immunity in the field."

These threats pose substantial risks to profitability of agriculture in Texas given that 130 million acres of land are in agricultural production in Texas and market value of agricultural production exceeds $25 billion (USDA NASS 2012). Moreover, common agricultural practices that include infrequent crop rotation, increasing farm size, preventative insecticide applications, and continuous use of crops genetically engineered to express limited diversity of anti-pest toxins commonly contribute to increased risk for pest outbreaks (Bianchi et al. 2006, Hendrickx et al. 2007, Landis et al. 2008, Gardiner et al. 2009, Gassmann et al. 2011). These practices require recurrent monitoring of instances of insect and mite outbreaks, incidence of insecticide resistance and development of tactics that prolong effectiveness of insecticides through proper rotation and adherence to guidelines for chemical suppression of pests. Taken together, these sustainable approaches to management of insect and mite pests promote long-term profitability of crop and vegetable production in the region and contribute to securing safe and nutritious food supply produced with lower environmental costs.Moreover, propensity for arthropod outbreaks in such highly managed system is especially relevant in context of arthropods that vector plant diseases, where direct feeding injury caused by the herbivore is coupled with a systemic injury brought about by the pathogen they vector. In many cases, the indirect impact of arthropod vectors, i.e., transmission of plant pathogens, outweighs the direct feeding injury thereby elevating the negative consequences of arthropod infestations (Stout et al. 2006). While some basic research on mechanisms underlying plant responses to arthropod and pathogen attack has been recently done (Huot et al. 2013), little is known about the physiological and molecular mechanisms governing plant responses to simultaneous arthropod and pathogen attack in conditions of drought and under conventional crop production regimens. Expanding our basic knowledge of these mechanisms will improve precision of the practical recommendations developed to suppress arthropod pests and mitigate their environmental and economic costs.Already established insects and mites pose quantifiable risks to agriculture. However, emerging new pests that arise through expansion of host or geographical range (e.g., sugarcane aphid) and introductions of invasive species (e.g., saltcedar) present new and largely unknown threats (Pimentel et al. 2005). Timely research focused on early effects of invasions by emerging pests and tactics to mitigate their impact is necessary to limit their negative effects on agricultural production. Recent emergence of sugarcane aphid as a significant pest of sorghum, for example, prompted extensive and thorough research of biology and management of this pest on its new host plant in southern Texas (Brewer et al. 2013, Bowling et al. 2015), but has not been researched in High Plains yet. Experiments focused on describing basic natural history traits of new pests in the dry and hot climate of the High Plains in order to establish economic injury levels and action thresholds that account for their population dynamics constitute the basic research-based tactics that will improve resilience of crops to these threats. Likewise, quantifying effectiveness of biological control in alleviating the impact of invasive weeds on native vegetation and associated arthropod communities remains one of the significant research needs in the Texas High Plains.Crop production in Texas High Plains is also affected by an additional challenge of inherent water limitation. Drought stress often renders plants more susceptible to injury caused by some arthropods and pathogens (Thaler and Bostock 2004, Stout et al. 2006, Asselbergh et al. 2008), thereby intensifying economic losses caused by insects and mites. Thus, assessing the impact of arthropods and the diseases they vector in the context of drought stress, which often exacerbates injury caused by these pests, is vitally important to sustainability and profitability of crop production in the High Plains. In addition, research on variable irrigation regimes that promote reduced water use in agricultural production without compromising plant resilience to arthropod pests and associated diseases is critical given the global awareness of the need to intensify our efforts to conserve water.The significant gaps in knowledge listed above have not been comprehensively addressed in the Texas High Plains in recent years. The over-arching goal of this project is to contribute to sustainability of arthropod management in the Texas High Plains through basic and applied research coupled with effective communication of the outcomes and their implications to peers and stakeholders."

Sorghum is a critically important crop in Africa and India and though the U.S. is the world&#39;s top producing country, there is great potential for increased cultivation. In Nebraska alone, as recently as the 1980s, more than 2M acres of sorghum has been replaced with corn requiring irrigation and greater amounts of fertilizer. If all or part of this land were returned to sorghum cultivation, substantial input cost savings would be realized by farmers and there would also be environmental benefits in terms of reduced aquifer depletion and nitrogen run-off. Despite the input efficiency of sorghum, the protein in its grain, like maize, is deficient in amino acids such as lysine, which are essential in the diets of humans and non-ruminant livestock. Compounding this issue in sorghum is the fact that the alpha kafirin storage proteins, which make up most of the grain protein, form highly indigestible protein bodies. People consuming sorghum as a primary protein source are thus susceptible to malnutrition when they rely too heavily on this staple. Monogastric livestock require supplementation from legumes or synthetic amino acids. Improving the composition and digestibility of sorghum proteins would significantly enhance its potential as a food and feed both in the U.S and in developing countries. Although sorghum currently has limited application for human consumption in the U.S, there is a growing interest in gluten-free sources of whole grain, and sorghum has several attractive nutritional characteristics which could be exploited if the digestibility issues can be overcome.Despite the fact that the sorghum genome sequence is known, functional genomics resources are limited. The platform being developed here will enhance our ability to generate mutants in sorghum for forward genetic screens of seed and whole plant variants and when scaled up, may be used for reverse genetic screens by other sorghum researchers.The work uses targeted &#39;CRISPr&#39; genome editing as well as random deletion mutagenesis to create a suite of lines which have variably reduced alpha kafirin proteins with improved protein quality and digestibility. The genome editing approach is designed to generate a series of variably and partially silenced kafirin variants which will have improved digestibility and protein quality while still maintaining an acceptably hard kernel texture. Kafirin variants will be identified using a next-generation sequencing approach of kafirin PCR products from pooled primary transformants. Identified mutants will be further propagated and outcrossed for transgene removal. After characterizing the initial transgenic events and demonstrating proof of concept, we will initiate a process to patent the technology for partial ablation of prolamin gene families in cereals. After that, we will publish a timely paper describing the novelty of targeting an entire gene family to create novel improved output trait.The deletion approach uses gamma-irradiation to create variably sized deletions across the sorghum genome. Because some of the deletions induced are large, we will screen for deletions which fully or partially knock out the alpha kafirin gene cluster on chromosome 4. Kafirin variants created genome editing or deletion mutagenesis will be bulked up for larger scale testing and if necessary, breeding. On the basic science side, we have shown using our maize deletion mutagenesis platform, that many of the deletions are small enough to affect single genes. Thus, we will leverage the sorghum population for general functional genomics of kernel development. We will use our optimized mapping and candidate gene identification platform for mapping causal mutations and identifying candidates within the mapping interval. We will publish a general paper describing the phenotypic and genotypic repertoire of the sorghum deletion mutant population and subsequently, follow-up papers describing the biology of individual mutants. All the RNA and DNA sequence we obtain will be made publically available on the website of my long term bioinformatics collaborator, Chi Zhang (http://sysbio.unl.edu/services/).The goals that the project should address through the above methods are as follows:Provide important insight in the emergent field of CRISPr genome editing about the feasibility of down-regulating gene families of duplicated genes using a single short RNAGenerate reduced kafirin sorghum lines through genome editing and random mutagenesis which have direct application as increased protein quality and digestibility food and feed stocksProvide a novel platform for sorghum functional genomics to investigate kernel and potentially other agronomic traits"

Moench) has a small sequenced genome and is a model crop for a subfamily of bioenergy grasses with more complex genomes such as maize, sugarcane, Miscanthus and switchgrass [1, 2]. It is an herbaceous grass genus with diverse germplasm for many morphological and phenotypic traits. Sorghum first generated interest as an energy feedstock in the 1980s because it is an annual, accumulates a considerable amount of sugar with relatively little water, and tolerates environmental stresses that other plants species cannot (e.g. arid, saline or high heat)[3]. Although sorghum is generally considered to be drought-tolerant, there exists tremendous genetic variation for this trait, which may be used to improve performance in water-limited environments.A number of morphological traits (height, tiller number, dry biomass) are routinely measured in grass species to investigate disease resistance, drought tolerance, hybrid vigor, root traits, seedling characteristics, and yield [4-11]. Gas exchange has been compared in many studies to look for physiological differences, specifically in water use efficiency (WUE), nitrogen deficiency, and increasing atmospheric CO2 [12-14]. However, few comprehensive investigations of biomass and underlying traits in bioenergy crops have been reported [15].Many environmental factors have been reported as reducing bioenergy yields. Sorghum is more drought resistant than most other biomass crops, but the mechanisms for this are not well understood. Previous studies found sorghum was among the most water use efficient [16]. Several traits contribute to this resistance, including an extensive root system to acquire water, stomatal closure and leaf curling to reduce transpiration rates, and leaf cuticular waxes to prevent water loss. In addition, sorghum has the ability to reduce its metabolic processes to near dormancy during drought conditions [17, 18]. Sorghum&#39;s tolerance to drought, however, varies with developmental stage and varying susceptibilities have been characterized for pre- and post-flowering stages [19]. Drought stress during pre-flowering growth is of particular concern as it reduces panicle size, grain number, and grain yield [20] and takes place during the longest stage of plant development. Susceptibility to pre-flowering drought can occur early at the seedling stage or the period of panicle development prior to flowering.Metabolomics has emerged as a valuable tool for comparison of metabolites in biological system for both primary and secondary metabolism. This technique can be used to determine the genetic, environmental, and developmental influences on the chemical composition and metabolism of plants. Metabolomics provides a high-throughput and sensitive method to evaluate metabolic responses and has been proposed as a useful measure to improve crops [21]. This technique has been demonstrated to capture biochemical complexities in grass species to identify metabolite variation related to different stages of development [22], to demonstrate relationships between metabolic and genomic diversity [23], and to characterize responses to stresses [24]. A number of studies successfully correlated genomics with metabolomics [23, 25], and this tool is a novel phenotyping strategy to validate biochemical pathways, including those related genes and proteins, essential to stress tolerance [26]Targeted genetic improvement of new bioenergy feedstocks depends on identifying genetic variation in critical morphological, structural, physiological and biochemical traits. The stability of these traits under abiotic stress will be necessary to ensure the required yields to sustain the biofuels industry. Here, we propose to integrate of physiology, morphology and metabolome to identify key traits for sorghum bioenergy trait improvement in water limited environments. Our long-term goal is to identify candidate genes and pathways that control these traits to expiate breeding."

The overall objective ofthis project is to intensify smallholder farmers&#39; cropping systems and on-farm operations through mechanization in a sustainable manner. Sustainable intensification will integrate social,economic and environmental impacts with a specific focus on easing the burden on women. The ASMC includes members with substantial institutional capacity and expertise, and active collaborations with institutions and entry point organizations in four designated countries in South Asia, East Africa and West Africa: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso.The ASMC will utilize a three-tier approach that accounts for the required farming tasks, associated mechanization priorities and an operational strategy for achieving appropriate and scalable mechanization for crop and livestock production on smallholder farms. The operational strategy includes the following six key functions: 1) engage entry point organizations to establish Innovation Hubs, 2) assess country specific mechanization challenges, opportunities, and priorities, 3) implement country specific activities utilizing participatory research methods, 4) build human capacity with gender emphasis, 5) monitor and evaluate impact of activities, and 6) share knowledge with in-country stakeholders.To address the barriers to adoption, the ASMC will facilitate the creation of unique Appropriate- Scale Mechanization Innovation Hubs in each country that will identify specific needs, leverage ASMC resources to attract additional support and funding, and implement innovative solutionsto address current challenges and opportunities for mechanization. Innovation Hubs will create an ecosystem of innovation by engaging various stakeholders including smallholder farmers, faculty, students, and business professionals in identifying needs, seeking solutions and resources, promoting/adopting/scaling technology and business development. To ensuresustained and long-term impacts, the Innovation Hubs will focus on capacity building efforts that span mechanization-specific training/educational programs and curricula development to extension activities targeting smallholder farmers and especially women farmers.The work in South Asia will focus on rice and vegetable value chains and the development of technologies and tools that can be used especially by women to sustainably intensify land preparation and water management, transplanting, cultivation and weeding, crop harvesting, handling and on-farm processing. The work in Ethiopia and Burkina Faso will develop and refine sustainable mechanization practices with draft animals and small 2-WD tractors with an emphasis on zone tillage, seeding, weeding, and shelling technologies for maize that will be readily transferrable to other cropping systems, such as sorghum and millet production, as well as for use in other Feed the Future countries such as Tanzania and Senegal where two of SIIL&#39;s regional representatives are located. The scope of activities will include prototype testing and evaluation, train-the-trainer sessions for local extension and technical service providers, on-farm evaluation and artisan training for local manufacturing and marketing of technologies, tools and custom services.

Moench] is drought tolerant crop that was grown on over 110,000 acres of Louisiana cropland in 2014 and contributed over $55 million to gross farm value in 2013. Production and quality potentials are limited by numerous biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic factors include the genetic potential of the crop as well as numerous insects and diseases. Abiotic limitations are attributable primarily to water and temperature. Historically, most emphasis on the development of improved grain sorghums has come from the Great Plains states. Recent interest in utilizing the low production cost, drought resistance, and tolerance to less than optimal soil conditions of grain sorghum has renewed interest in this crop in the Mid-South and Southeast. Specifically in Louisiana, the shallow hardpan soils of the northeastern part of the state are particularly susceptible to drought conditions and grain sorghum is an attractive fit. Furthermore, as a rotational crop, grain sorghum has value in managing weeds by rotating herbicide chemistry, in managing nematodes that attack cotton and soybeans, and in improving soil properties. This proposal looks to capitalize upon this opportunity through the establishment of a grain sorghum breeding program targeted to these environments. The overall aim of the project is to develop high yielding grain sorghum inbred lines and hybrids adapted to Louisiana and the humid Southeast. In addition to yield, other traits of interest include: 1)Resistance/tolerance to the sugarcane aphid, 2) Improved resistance/tolerance to biotic (e.g. anthracnose) and abiotic stresses, and 3) grain quality."

They are good sources of bioactive compounds with potential health promoting properties. United States is considered the top producer and exporter of soybean and sorghum in the world. A plethora of report suggest that consumption of soybean is associated with reduction of risk to certain diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have shown potential applications of sorghum and sorghum bioactives in management of human diseases including diabetes and thromboembolism. One potential source of bioactive compound in soybean and sorghum is protein. Protein, when digested, can lead to production of peptides with certain biological activity. Soybean contains naturally occurring bioactive peptide called lunasin with reported health benefits. To date, the importance of protease inhibitors on the stability of lunasin against digestion is not yet completely understood. This proposal is seeking to define the role of Bowman-Birk inhibitor and Kunitz trypsin inhibitor on the stability of lunasin and generation of peptideswith potential health benefits. On the other hand, the application of sorghum as a source of functional food ingredient in the US has not been explored completely. Hence this project is seeking to develop sorghum proteins as functional food ingredient. Currently, the use of sorghum in the food industry is limited as sorghum proteins are indigestible. We are developing a pre-treatment process that will lead to production of sorghum proteins with improved digestibility. To study this program, sorghum proteins will be fractionated and pre-treated with enzymes and ultrasonication. The resulting pre-treated sorghum proteins will be subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion to see if pre-treatment improves the digestibility of sorghum proteins. The goal is to produce a functional food ingredient from sorghum proteins with improved digestibility to further increase food applications of this important crop in the US. In addition, the biological activities of generated peptides will be examined using different in vitro techniques involved in their potential antioxidant property and modulation of inflammasome activation."

Plant genetic resources are the building blocks of genetic variability upon which scientists conduct research and develop improved cultivars and products. S-009 germplasm has been utilized in research resulting in hundreds of publications and numerous crop cultivars. These materials were obtained from over 180 countries in the last 110 years. This project has grown from 811 accessions of 41 genera in 1949 to one of the largest collection of the four NPGS regional multistate projects with 91,930 accessions of 260 genera and 1,553 species in 2013. Over 88% of S-009 accessions are available for distribution and over 97% are safely backed up at Ft. Collins, CO. Intervals between seed regenerations are maximized to reduce loss of valuable genetic variability by storing 75% of the accessions in -18C rather than 4C . Over 1,000 requesters each year use these genetic resources in plant breeding, plant pathology, entomology, molecular biology, genomics, archaeology, anthropology, crop management, ecology, medical, and alternative uses. This project has had numerous impacts on research progress, agricultural productivity, and public benefits. For example, a peanut accession (PI 203396) collected in 1952 from a Porto Alegre, Brazil, market has resistance to a major peanut disease, tomato spotted wilt virus. Resistance from this single accession has been bred into 24 peanut cultivars including the five cultivars currently dominating the Southeastern U.S. peanut acreage for an estimated economic return of $200 million per year. In 2012 alone, graduate students and postdocs in university programs worldwide (AL, GA, NC, ND, OK, IL, OH, WI, WV, Canada, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Puerto Rico, and Turkey) utilized S-009 genetic resources and associated information in their university research programs. The new project will continue to provide plant genetic resources and information to scientists for research, education, and extension programs in the region, the nation, and the world.The conservation of plant genetic resources is essential to safely preserve and have available for research the genetic diversity vital for global food security. Plant genetic diversity provides breeders the material to develop and select cultivars for increased production, improved quality, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Global food security depends on the extent to which genetic improvement of crops can meet the challenges of population increases, climate change, sustainability, increasing crop production, and reduced environmental resources. The Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit S-009 Multistate Project at Griffin is one of 21 seed and clonal germplasm repositories in the NPGS. The National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation stores reserve seed of accessions for the other repositories. The NPGS repositories, as well as germplasm repositories in other countries and international centers, have long preserved plant genetic resources for use by present and future researchers throughout the world (Fowler and Hodgkin, 2004). Presently, the NPGS preserves almost 550,000 accessions. Plant genetic resource collections worldwide consist of a wide range of material with no selection or different levels of selection or development. These collections may include crop wild relatives (CWR), primitive landraces, farmer selections, breeding lines, heirloom varieties, pure lines, germplasm, genetic stocks, and current cultivars. The goal of germplasm collections is to preserve the genetic diversity found in all species.The S-009 Multistate project strives to conserve the range of genetic variation and diversity located within each plant species maintained at this location.This project is one of four regionally-based multistate projects, cooperating with USDA, ARS Units at each location, charged with the acquisition, characterization, maintenance, evaluation, documentation, and distribution of agronomic and horticultural crops in the U.S. Crops are divided among the four projects to prevent duplication of effort. These projects include NE-009 at Geneva, NY; NC-007 at Ames, IA; and W-006 at Pullman, WA. Techniques and procedures for plant genetic resource conservation and collection backup are coordinated with ARS projects at the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, Ft. Collins, CO. Acquisition of new accessions and documentation efforts are coordinated with ARS projects at Beltsville, MD. Regeneration of sorghum and other photoperiod-sensitive crops is cooperative with ARS projects at Mayag&uuml;ez, PR."

Alfalfa, a perennial dicot, generally offers high protein content. Sorghum, an annual monocot, offers more cellulose and other nutritious carbohydrates. As forage crops, traits such as rapid growth rates, increased harvest yields, and high quality (digestibility) are desirable. Improvement of such traits has been the goal of numerous biotechnology efforts. However, alternative biotechnology techniques are typically constitutive and when applied to commercial crops have resulted in net negative consequences. For example, efforts to improve quality by lowering lignin biosynthesis have resulted in plants with poor structural integrity and diminished mass at maturity.In this USDA SBIR Phase I project, AFINGEN will transfer a simple tissue-targeting technology from our previously demonstrated switchgrass project to two forage crops, alfalfa and sorghum. These two commercial crops will be enabled to offer three beneficial agricultural traits - faster growth, more harvested biomass, and improved digestibility. We will generate a total of eight constructs with unique gene assemblies for alfalfa and sorghum. We intend to characterize the viability, gene integration and transgene expression of the constructs and will perform further growth, morphological and quality analyses of the selected lines. This proposed project with first generation engineered plants will narrow down the two best strategies to increase biomass yield by at least 30%, reduce lignin content by 20% for better forage digestibility, and demonstrate robust, healthy plants with shorter life cycle. Given the positive outcomes in earlier projects we are confident to state the above targets - and if the project demonstrates these goals in both alfalfa and sorghum, this new biotechnology platform would be able to be applied to many other varieties of forage and energy crop."

However, sorghum is prone to stalk rots, which can significantly limit sorghum biomass production through yield reductions and lodging. Stalk rot-causing fungi normally grow endophytically within sorghum plants. When sorghum plants experience water stress, changes in host metabolism often triggers a developmental switch causing the fungi to become pathogenic. The underlying plant molecular circuits that can limit or exacerbate fungal transition from endophytic to pathogenic growth are not known and are the focus of this proposal. Several publicly available lines have previously demonstrated resistance or tolerance to sorghum stalk pathogens, including those with postflowering drought tolerance (nonsenscence), which appears to suppress pathogenic growth. In addition, we have developed several near-isogenic sorghum brown-midrib (bmr) 6 and 12 lines with reduced lignin content, which were previously demonstrated to have increased resistance or tolerance to sorghum stalk pathogens. Lignin, a component of plant cell walls, has been a focus for development of bioenergy sorghums because it inhibits cellulosic conversion technologies, but its presence also increases total energy content of biomass, which is important for thermal conversion technologies. To increase energy content, we have engineered sorghum plants overexpressing a MYB transcription factor that induces lignin synthesis, and a gene encoding caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), a monolignol pathway enzyme. Both the transgenic and bmr plants accumulate phenolic intermediates from lignin synthesis that are toxic to stalk pathogens in vitro. We recently have developed the ability to apply water-stress in a controlled environment, which reliably induces the developmental switch from endophytic to pathogenic growth of sorghum stalk rot fungi. Using this unique collection of plant lines described above, in combination with genomics and metabolomics tools, we will directly evaluate the hypothesis that  Identifying molecular components of host resistance will lead to increased stalk rot tolerance in sorghum , using two notoriously virulent fungi that cause sorghum stalk rots, Fusarium thapsinum and Macrophomina phaseolina. The specific objectives of this proposal are: 1) to determine pathogenic and endophytic growth of stalk pathogens in sorghum lines under water deficit conditions; 2) to identify host metabolites and metabolic pathways involved in resistance or tolerance to fungal stalk rot pathogens under water deficit conditions in lignin modified, nonsenescent and stalk rot resistant/tolerant lines; 3) to identify host genes from the phenylpropanoid and defense-related pathways with altered expression levels during pathogenic or endophytic growth of fungal stalk pathogens under water deficit conditions; and 4) to identify genes, gene networks, and metabolic pathways whose expression is altered in stalk rot tolerant sorghum lines under water sufficient versus deficit conditions. Our aim is to discover host molecular pathways that enhance endophytic growth of stalk fungi and inhibit the developmental switch to pathogenic growth that frequently occurs under periods of prolonged abiotic stress. From this valuable research, we will identify biomolecular markers for resistance that will significantly enhance efforts to develop superior bioenergy sorghum with resistance to increasing disease and environmental stresses."

However, like rice, maize, and sorghum, it is achieving barely 50% of the annual yield progress rate necessary to meet food needs widely forecast for 2050. For over ten years an approach melding ecophysiological and quantitative genetic modeling has been evolving the potential to accelerate breeding rates of gain. This entails a two-step process that first fits crop models to data and then association maps the resulting parameter values to genetic markers. However, technological limits impede collection of the large amounts of needed plant trait data, especially the geometry of dense plant canopies.Targeting Kansas wheat breeding trials, this project is a proof-of-concept test combining microwave radar sensing with a novel, inversion algorithm to ameliorate the situation. The basic rationale is that (1) it is unnecessary to sense the 3D position, angle, and size of every tiller and leaf in a trial plot - rather one desires the genetic markers and effect sizes associated with these quantities&#39; statistical distributions; (2) models interrelating markers and morphology exist; (3) if radar calculations for plant canopies can be accelerated, then the models in (2) can be inverted to yield genetics in a single-step; and (4) an extension of the Analytical Element Method (AEM) from hydrology to electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation can provide such a speed up.Briefly, the AEM exactly solves the field equations for very simple shapes that are then combined to yield machine accurate-answers for complex geometries. Unlike solvers in common use, the AEM only calculates solutions at the specific points of interest, thus hugely reducing computational loads. Prior work has found AEM sollutions for EM waves in two dimensions. This project will extend those solutions to full 3D.Concurrently, an existing wheat model that predicts highly realistic plant shapes will be modified so its outputs are expressed in terms of the AEM basic shapes. A three-layer model will then be built comprising [genetic markers : plant shapes : EM fields] and solved by probablistic methods. This will yield the genetic markers most associated with the plant shapes sensed by radar. The method will be tested by team members with radar expertise using the facilities of the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets. Experiments in a large anechoic chamber will compare AEM predictions to actual radar reflectance data for simplified targets. The EM properties of wheat at radar frequencies will also be measured in the chamber using small, movable plots.Based on these data, a prototype field system will be constructed and used to gather plot data in a field trial conducted as part of the on-going Kansas wheat breeding program. Two tests will be performed. First the radar data will be association mapped directly to detect any responses to genetically determined canopy features. If positive results are found, they will be compared to published phenotypic mapping studies and hypotheses developed as to features to which the radar might be responding. The second test will solve the three layer model described above and also compare the results to literature."

In humans, dietary carotenoids act as precursors to vitamin A, as well as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, protecting against a myriad of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and age-related macular degeneration. Cereals are generally poor sources of carotenoids compared to fruits and vegetables, but since cereals make up the majority of the human diet an increase in cereal carotenoids could have a significant impact on human nutrition. Sorghum is one of the world&#39;s largest produced cereal crops and a staple food for millions of people in semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In the United States, it is primarily used in animal feed, but is increasingly used in specialty food products, especially those that are gluten free. Efforts to improve the nutritional quality of sorghum grain have relied primarily on traditional plant breeding, a process that can take years before a line is ready to be released. Marker-assisted breeding (the use of genetic markers to select for a trait of interest in crop breeding) can vastly accelerate the development of biofortified crops.The ultimate goal of this research is to provide genetic tools that will help breeders rapidly develop high-carotenoid sorghum varieties. To this end, we will quantify grain carotenoid concentrations in hundreds of sorghum lines using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), a gold-standard technique for quantifying compounds. Since HPLC is a time-consuming and expensive technique, we will develop a high-throughput method for measuring carotenoid concentrations using near-infrared spectroscopy, a technique that predicts the concentration of a compound by reflecting near-infrared light on the whole grain. We will identify the genomic regions containing genes that control carotenoid concentrations using a genome-wide association study (GWAS), a method that scans the genome for associations between carotenoid concentrations and variations in single nucleotides. Finally, we will identify the nucleotide variations responsible for carotenoid variation by sequencing candidate genes that were identified through GWAS. The allelic variants can then be used as markers for marker-assisted breeding to develop high-carotenoid sorghum varieties that will benefit human health."

Perennial crop species are central to the overall sustainable intensification of cropping systems for food, feed, fiber, and fuel. Dual-use crops that can serve as a biofuel feedstock in addition to a source of edible grain add additional economic potential to the cropping systems that are needed to meet projected demand for both food and fuel. Historical efforts to create perennial grain species with both vigorous perennial regrowth and high grain yield has remained challenging, leading to efforts to instead domesticate perennial species to improve traits like increased seed size, non-shattering, and free threshing. Intermediate wheatgrass (IWG), or Thinopyrum intermedium, is a strong perennial species with prolific biomass production, relatively large seeds and high grain yield that has been targeted for domestication as a dual-use perennial grain and biomass crop. IWG and related Thinopyrum species have long served as an important gene reservoir for wheat breeding, including attempts to develop perennial wheat through hybridization with a relative of IWG, Thinopyrum elongatum. As a perennial crop, IWG can provide essential ecosystem services to current agricultural practices such as stabilizing soil with its deep (&gt;3 meters) root structure, reducing nutrient runoff, and limiting weed growth. For biofuels, IWG produces biomass quantities similar or greater than switchgrass, with the added potential of &gt;1,000 kg/ha of grain that is comparable to wheat in food products.Significant efforts to improve IWG through traditional breeding have focused on traits such as plant height, biomass production, seed size, free threshing ability, and early maturity. While some progress has been made, accelerating the improvement of IWG is likely possible using modern genomics-based breeding tools. There are limited molecular breeding and genomic tools for IWG due to its large, highly repetitive genome. Ongoing efforts to develop genomic tools for IWG and the high quality reference genomes for species across the Triticeae provide a novel platform for exploring the genomic landscape of plant perenniality using comparative genomic and systems approaches. Currently, there is only a nascent understanding of the complex genetics of perenniality across the plant kingdom, which has limited the development of vigorous perennial crops that produce consistent yields year to year and limited the perennialization of annual crop species.An improved understanding of the genomic landscape of the annual vs. perennial growth habit could enable the development of other robust perennial crop species, like IWG, suitable for wide scale production. An enhanced understanding of the complex suite of genes underlying perenniality will enable the improvement of current perennial biomass and grain crops, along with providing vital resources to address the long-standing goal of &#39;perennializing&#39; annual crops like rice, wheat, and sorghum. Additionally, unraveling the genome evolution within the Thinopyrum genus will improve our basic knowledge regarding the sources of novel traits introgressed from Thinopyrum species into wheat."

With the prevalence of extreme drought increasing, there is a critical need for the development of new tools to improve crop drought tolerance. We propose to leverage the microbial symbionts that already live inside plants. In general, plant responses to drought and other abiotic stresses have been studied outside the context of the plant microbiome. Yet symbiotic fungi living inside plant leaves can directly alter plant physiology and improve plant drought tolerance. Understanding the mechanisms by which fungi improve plant drought tolerance will increase our basic understanding of what controls plant physiology and will help us to develop these fungi as agronomic drought management tools. Specifically, we propose to address how symbiotic fungi affect plant drought physiology and to test how we can use those fungi in field conditions to improve crop production and survival under drought.To accomplish these objectives, we will examine how plants and fungi interact across multiple levels, from genes to physiology. We will initially use controlled approaches in the greenhouse to isolate and characterize these mechanisms in a model warm-season grass, Panicum hallii. We will then move to slightly more realistic conditions important for treatment success, including how target fungi fare in the face of other fungi that arrive later and attempt to invade the same plant and whether the outcomes we see for individual fungi scale up to a diverse fungal community. Finally, we will test how fungal effects on plant drought responses translate to switchgrass, maize, and grain sorghum in a field setting with different levels of irrigation.Ultimately, we hope to identify the ways in which fungi and plants interact to produce drought benefits and determine how to exploit those interactions to increase the resilience of our agricultural systems to drought."

The instrument is to be housed at the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center, an established analytical laboratory performing mass spectrometry-based lipid analysis at Kansas State University. The mass spectrometer acquisition will directly impact and advance the training of postdoctoral trainees, graduate students, and undergraduates. Early-career faculty and faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions will benefit from access to state-of-the-art lipid analysis. Undergraduates learning and using mass spectrometry will include students at Kansas State University, including participants in the McNair and other undergraduate scholars? programs, and from historically black Fayetteville State University. Training will include an annual workshop on mass spectrometry-based lipid analysis (lipidomics) for faculty and trainees and a research club focused on analysis and interpretation of lipidomics data on crop species.  Lipidomics has not reached its ultimate potential as an analytical tool, because the methods, materials, and computational resources to effectively carry out lipid profiling, particularly for plant lipids, are not conveniently available. Thus, Kansas Lipidomics Research Center personnel will aid scientists who wish to implement lipidomics analyses at their institutions by providing consultation, protocols for sample preparation, plug-and-play mass spectral methods, internal standards, and data processing systems, resulting in data suitable for upload to and analysis at a publicly available database. Knowledge obtained through use of the acquired mass spectrometer will be applied to improve food, industry, and energy applications in major crops including sorghum, camelina, and wheat.The acquired Sciex 6500+ mass spectrometer with accessories will provide improved definition of lipid structure while maintaining high sample throughput. The ion mobility spectrometry accessory will improve ability to specify lipid structural features without slowing the analytical work flow, compared to current technologies. The improved lipid structural specificity will provide scientists with the ability to unambiguously assign specific lipids to metabolic maps, connecting quantitative and structural information on plant lipids directly with genes and enzymes, thus transforming our understanding of lipid metabolic pathways in model and crop plants. The mass spectrometer acquisition will deliver critical capabilities for the projects of researchers from fifteen laboratories. Additionally, the mass spectrometer will be made available to new users as well as past and current Kansas Lipidomics Research Center analytical users. Projects will use the high structural definition provided by the Sciex 6500+ with ion mobility spectrometry to link the lipidome accurately with plant genomes and phenomes, while investigating the roles of lipids and the functions of lipid metabolizing and signaling gene products in plants. Lipids will be analyzed in genome wide association studies, and other large-scale studies of genetically variant plant populations, identifying candidate genes putatively functioning in lipid metabolism and signaling during plant stress responses. Other projects will biochemically and functionally characterize lipid metabolic events that occur during plant responses to stress and during growth and development. The new instrument also will advance the work of scientists modifying plant seed oil composition for increased yield and quality. Thus, the acquired mass spectrometer will facilitate food, industrial, and energy crop improvement."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The host institution for the fellowship is Pennsylvania State University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Jesse Lasky. Agronomic weeds pose a serious threat to agricultural productivity, and weed infestations may intensify under changing climates. To better understand interactions between biotic and abiotic stressors, this project investigates mechanisms of specialization to different host crops and abiotic environments in purple witchweed (Striga hermonthica).  Parasitic witchweeds constitute the greatest biotic constraint to food production in sub-Saharan Africa and devastate yields of economically important cereals such as maize, sorghum, millet, and rice.  Broader impacts include generation of new genomic and phenotypic resources to enhance development of resistant crop varieties, training of undergraduate students, and workshops in witchweed bioinformatics targeted to African scientists.  Training objectives include statistical evolutionary genomics, ancient DNA sequencing, quantitative genetics, and experimental plant-parasite interactions.The main goal of this project is to better understand evolution of crop-parasite interactions across diverse abiotic environments. First, genomic signatures of host-specialization and local adaptation will be identified, using targeted exome sequencing of 200 herbarium specimens collected within the past 150 years from different hosts of origin across East and West Africa. Loci will be identified that exhibit statistical associations with environment and host of origin, with allelic variation that tracks change in regional host crop production over time. For the second aim, effects of abiotic stress on host range will be experimentally evaluated. Seed germination, early host-seeking behavior, and host resistance will be quantified under nitrogen- and water-limitation for 20 parasite populations across 60 genotypes of three agriculturally important host crops: sorghum, millet, and maize.  Genomic and phenotypic resources generated during the project will be publicly accessible through online databases (NCBI; Project Unity, http://phenome-networks.com) and a dedicated project website including instructional materials, code, and molecular protocols."

Reductions in soil evaporation rates will lower irrigation demands and overall water consumption for crop production, thereby conserving water worldwide and in the Ogallala Aquifer in the Great Plains. This research project will understand the effects of hydrophobic soil (where water beads up) on evaporation compared to typically hydrophilic soil (where water spreads out) through laboratory studies. Glass beads will be coated to make them hydrophobic and these beads will be used to simulate soil. Evaporation will be studied from a few beads and a tray of beads under weather conditions similar to fields. Next, a type of soil called Ottawa sand will be coated to become hydrophobic and evaporation will be measured from the plain, hydrophilic sand and hydrophobic sand. These experiments will show how soil hydrophobicity affects evaporation from soil. Soil hydrophobicity can occur naturally due to minerals, organic materials, or waxes. Information from these laboratory evaporation studies will be used to determine best agricultural practices to reduce water losses since the Ogallala Aquifer provides water for over 20% of corn, wheat, sorghum, and cattle produced in the United States. Additionally, this research project will attract diverse students due to the importance of the research. The Principal Investigator (PI) and student researchers will use bread baking as an analogy for soil evaporation with groups of female High School students at the EXCITE workshop at Kansas State University (KSU) and the PI and researchers will showcase the research to first year, female undergraduate students at an annual Research Open House. The PI will also teach an interdisciplinary course on heat and mass transfer in the Food, Energy, and Water nexus to graduate students from multiple colleges at KSU.This research will investigate transient evaporative phase change in a three-phase (i.e., soil, water, and air) system. The objectives of this study are to understand the impacts of hydrophobicity on evaporation mechanisms including contact line dynamics, capillary transport, and enhanced water vapor diffusion. Glass and Teflon-coated beads will be used to simulate soil for pore-level experiments. Evaporation will be modeled and experimentally investigated using a high speed and IR camera for a range of surface temperatures and realistic environmental conditions (e.g., air temperature and relative humidity and simulated solar irradiation). Contact lines will be observed for water evaporating from hydrophilic or hydrophobic single pores. Using knowledge obtained from these single pore studies, evaporation fronts and mechanisms such as capillary transport and enhanced water vapor diffusion will be investigated for multiple pores; water will be dyed with fluorescent dye rhodamine B and excited using a Nd:YAG laser. Color shifts will be used to identify evaporation fronts and liquid capillary transport for a given cross section of the porous material. In the final phase of the research, evaporation will be studied from layers of naturally hydrophilic and artificially hydrophobized Ottawa sand to understand the impacts of hydrophobicity on capillary transport and enhanced water vapor diffusion. This study will numerically and experimentally assess the relative impacts of hydrophobicity on these three primary evaporation mechanisms (i.e., contact line dynamics, capillary transport, and enhanced water vapor diffusion) and create a mechanistic map to show the dominant evaporation mechanism for field environmental conditions. As a result, the improved understanding of hydrophobicity on soil evaporation can inform agricultural best practices."

Additionally, fertilizer runoff produces many secondary problems such as aquatic dead zones with low oxygen contents, and reduced water quality, increasing the costs of providing safe drinking water in agricultural regions of the country. Genetic gains in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by plants will aid in protecting yield while mitigating both costs and negative environmental impacts associated with high rates of fertilizer application in agriculture. Through this Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII Track-2 FEC) project, researchers at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Alabama and the University of Nebraska will partner to conduct cutting-edge plant genomics research to better understand how nitrogen affects plant growth and development. HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology will bring its biotechnology education and agricultural genomics research expertise to the collaborative project while the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will contribute its expertise in plant transformation and automated phenotyping with their state-of-the-art automated greenhouse system for imaging large plants. Researchers will collect information of how plants respond to nitrogen levels through a variety of genetic, biotechnological, and observational methods in the widely-used grain crop sorghum. Sorghum thrives in climates where many food crops struggle and is more efficient at utilizing resources such as water and nitrogen. It is an ideal crop to target for improvement to meet the predicted doubling of global food demand by 2050. In addition, the project will include an educational component, which will train and inspire students to pursue genetic and biotechnology-based research for agriculture. To accomplish this, HudsonAlpha will develop a three-week summer course for advanced high school students called the  AgriGenomics Academy.  Additional activities include the recruitment of three undergraduate students who will complete summer internships at both HudsonAlpha and University of Nebraska-Lincoln to learn advanced techniques, and support for the Launching Aspiring Biotechnology Students (LABS) program, which introduces low and moderate-income students to biotechnology. The project will also mentor four early career faculty. In addition to nitrogen use efficacy, the combined efforts of these two institutions will make significant progress toward understanding the biology of other complex agronomic crop traits.The goal of this project is to understand the role of genes in nitrogen (N) responsive co-expression networks in sorghum using a combination of genomics, biotechnology and automated phenotyping by combining the expertise at the Hudson Alpha Institute of Biotechnology and the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. We will achieve this goal through three main objectives: (i) Generate transcriptomic and phenotypic data to characterize the molecular responses of sorghum to N availability; (ii) perturb the N response by combinatorial CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and overexpression of key genes in N network modules; and (iii) characterize plants with targeted changes in components of the N network. Genomic and transcriptomic data will be used to identify key regulatory sequences controlling genes predicted to affect nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), through effects on component traits of NUE from nitrogen assimilation through in planta metabolism. These predicted target regulatory sequences and genes will be validated in sorghum using innovative protocols for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to manipulate the promoters of high-priority gene targets, resulting in expression changes of these genes. Lines confirmed to carry misexpressing alleles will be characterized across development under different levels of nitrogen deficit stress using nondestructive, high throughput phenotyping techniques. Plants exhibiting phenomic changes under N deficit stress will be analyzed for variation in their gene expression networks to understand their roles in regulating sorghum's responses to N deficit stress. The outcome of this program holds great potential to expand our knowledge on N responsive gene regulatory networks and associated gene function in sorghum and closely related C4 grasses. It can also serve as a model for understanding other complex agronomic traits through gene network manipulation. This project will contribute to research infrastructure capacity building by cross-training and motivating students and post-docs to explore strategies to improve the rate of genetic gains in crops by understanding how genomic and phenomic approaches can be integrated using cutting edge genomic, molecular, and whole-plant tools.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This productivity is due to a shared physiology and genetic ancestry over the last 15 million years. While these four crops will be extensively used, they are closely related to another 800 species that dominate grasslands across the world and are adapted to numerous environmental stresses including flooding, drought, heat, and frost. The project team will use modern genomics and machine learning to survey and analyze these related species, determining the most important genetic features they share that allow them to adapt to heat and drought. The results of this work will be used by commercial and public sector plant breeders to make maize and sorghum more productive and resilient to extreme weather. Key to this long-term impact is training the next generation of scientists in computational biology to address fundamental questions. These skills will be developed through hackathons and bioinformatics training workshops. The project will communicate this science to the general public through venues such as a traveling museum exhibit.The Andropogoneae tribe of grasses contains a thousand species that collectively represent over a billion years of evolutionary history. It has used NADP-C4 photosynthesis and a wide range of adaptations to become a dominant clade on earth.

The project team will sample and analyze the worldwide spectrum of genetic diversity in Andropogoneae to develop detailed models testing whether (1) quantitative estimates of evolutionary constraint improve predictions of fitness-related traits, and (2) convergent environmental adaptations shared across the Andropogoneae explain a substantial proportion of total adaptive variance. These hypotheses will be tested by assembling the gene and regulatory content of 57 species as well as whole genome sequencing of another 700 species. For eight species, diversity across their natural range of adaptation will be surveyed at the sequence level. Evolutionary and machine learning models will be used to quantify the disruptive impact of a mutation in every ancestral genomic element. The inter and intra-specific surveys will also permit an estimation of the prevalence of convergent evolution. This project addresses two key elements of the genotype to phenotype problem - how to quantify the disruptive impact of mutations and how to determine whether adaptive solutions to environmental stresses are convergently shared across species.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Lucas Busta is  Genes Controlling Wax Biosynthesis in Sorghum bicolor: Potential for Improving Crop Performance and Value . The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Edgar Cahoon, David R. Holding and Chi Zhang.Sorghum bicolor is a multi-use crop with exceptional water- and nitrogen-use efficiency whose expanded use will likely decrease water and fertilizer consumption and create a more sustainable agricultural system. In sorghum, natural waxes cover aerial plant surfaces where they protect against dry climates and increase water-use efficiency. Waxes accumulate in sorghum to levels higher than nearly all other plant species and sorghum kernel waxes are an emerging industrial bioproduct that can be extracted during grain processing. Understanding the processes that regulate sorghum wax biosynthesis and accumulation will enable scientists and plant breeders to (1) potentially transfer some of sorghum's water efficiency to other crops such as maize; and (2) rapidly navigate routes to high-wax sorghum lines with enhanced grain value. This project seeks to identify the genes and gene networks that control sorghum wax deposition. Training objectives include functional genomics, biochemistry, bioinformatics, and plant breeding. Broader impact activities include the mentoring and training of undergraduate chemistry students in the analysis of plant chemicals as well as developing a hands-on active learning module and a hands-on laboratory workshop for educating children, adults and young women about the economic, nutritional, and environmental benefits gained through the study of plant chemistry, plant diversity, and crop improvement that will inspire interest in STEM fields, education, and careers. The goal of the project is to combine wax biochemistry with genomics and bioinformatics to identify genes controlling sorghum wax deposition via two complimentary specific aims: (1) identify high-confidence sorghum wax gene candidates by correlating epidermis-specific transcriptomes and comprehensive wax profiles, then evaluate their functionality by performing complementation tests in Arabidopsis wax mutants; and, (2) use bulked segregant RNA-seq mapping to pinpoint causal mutations in existing sorghum mutants affected in both kernel and leaf sheath waxes (as putative transcription factor mutants). In addition to initiating and catalyzing future sorghum wax research and the further development of applications for sorghum wax knowledge, the whole tissue and epidermis-specific gene expression data collected in this project will be made accessible through public repositories as well as through the Sorghum Epidermis Gene Expression Almanac, online server that will be developed as part of this project where users can query sequences against the sorghum transcriptome and view the expression of similar genes in whole tissue and the epidermis of sorghum leaves, leaf sheathes, and developing kernels.

Despite the opportunity to greatly improve food security, the mechanisms that cause stalk lodging have not been established. This RII Track-2 FEC FY 2018 project entitled  Understanding the relationship between genome and phenome  brings together a unique team from mathematics, engineering, chemistry, genomics, and biology to provide a unique approach to solving this complex problem. Three interjurisdictional Universities, the University of Kentucky, University of Idaho, and Clemson University have leveraged their research expertise to create the Kentucky/Idaho/Clemson Plant Biomechanics Consortium (KIC-Consortium). This consortium will combine mathematical modeling with innovative technology designed to test stem strength on large populations of plants to predict the underlying features that both cause, and may be used to overcome, stem lodging. These features will be systematically used in the future to improve grain crop varieties; thus, aiding in both food and energy security. The project will provide early career opportunities and exposure to interdisciplinary research for seven early career faculty and build a robust intellectual infrastructure in this field through several training programs. Technical DescriptionThis project will focus on stalk-lodging, a problem that has faced agriculture (maize and sorghum in particular) for decades and limits food security nationally and globally. Stalk lodging is the breakage of plant stems prior to harvest and may reduce worldwide grain yields by up to 20% annually. Improving stalk lodging by a mere 1% in maize would lead to a production increase of 20 billion pounds (~$2 billion) each year. The genetic regulation of stalk lodging resistance has proven to be elusive. While currently available state-of-the-art genomics approaches like genome wide association (GWAS), gene co-expression networks, and expression quantitative locus (eQTL) analyses have been successful in linking specific genes/variants/transcripts to specific phenotypes, they tend to either underestimate (missing heritability), or overestimate genome-to-phenome interactions. A more flexible mathematical/statistical framework capable of capturing complex multiscale, nonlinear interactions and functional relationships will provide a comprehensive picture of genome-to-phenome relationships. The proposed interjurisdictional plant biomechanics consortium involving the University of Kentucky, the University of Idaho, and Clemson University (KIC-Consortium) is focused on the hypothesis that the relationship between a genome and phenotypic traits is governed by complex functional relationships and nonlinear interactions existing at multiple temporal and spatial scales. To pursue this hypothesis, the KIC-Consortium will develop a multiscale, multiphysics modeling framework that is flexible enough to account for sophisticated nonlinear interactions and that utilizes advanced statistical methods, finite element methods, and intermediate phenotype data typically excluded from genome-to-phenome mapping efforts. The team has developed integrated workforce goals and education/early career recruitment and training goals to accommodate and advance each jurisdiction?s research future.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specialized organs appear to originate as specialized versions of existing organs, yet their specialization requires a divergence in regulation between different copies of the same organ. This project will test a proposed rule of life, that states that the largest and most complex changes in the evolution of multicellular organisms are easier to achieve when the entire set of chromosomes of an organism is duplicated in the course of evolution. Links between whole genome duplication and an increase in the number of body parts has been suggested to explain the evolution of early tetrapods or the emergence of flowering plants, but these are harder to study experimentally as they have occurred tens or hundreds of millions of years ago. A more recent event is the emergence in corn with two types of inflorescences (group or cluster of flowers arranged on a stem) for male and female reproduction - tassel and ear; contrasting to the situation in close relatives of maize that produce only a single type of inflorescence. This research will use comparative genetics techniques in maize and one such relative, sorghum, to identify which genetic systems, when turned on or off, change the inflorescence types. The project will provide valuable training to undergraduate students, supported by institutional UCARE and REU programs.This EAGER project tests the hypothesis that the development and evolution of specialized reproductive organs of maize are controlled by the specialized ensembles of duplicate copies of one set of ancestral genes that was required for development of non-specialized sexual organ, before it underwent a duplication in the course of the whole-genome polyploidization. Generation and phenotypic characterization of knockouts of syntenic orthologous genes in polyploidized maize and nonpolyploidized sorghum will provides a systematic test of the Ortholog Conjecture, a rule of life that tells that genes evolved by speciation tend to preserve function, whereas genes produced by duplication tend to evolve related but not identical functions.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The host institution for the fellowship is the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Douglas Allen.As the world population increases, crop breeding efforts will need to increase yields while minimizing detrimental impacts on the environment. In particular, understanding how plants acquire and use nitrogen can help determine proper fertilizer use. Plant nitrogen demands vary in different parts of the plant based on whether the tissue is photosynthetic and acting as a source of carbon, as in leaves, or is a sink for carbon and nitrogen as in seeds. Plants with optimized source-sink relationships could break the inverse correlation between yield and protein content that is well-documented over the last 50 years. Training objectives for the Fellow include synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and metabolic flux analysis. Broader impacts include promoting plant science through outreach programs with the St. Louis Girl Scouts, ASPB Planting Science, and Future Trek STEM Careers.This project will use a genetic approach in maize, sorghum, and the C4 model species Setaria viridis to investigate the interrelationship between asparagine cycling in nitrogen metabolism and the C4 photosynthetic pathway in leaves and seeds of cereals in order to modulate source and sink relationships. New expression patterns for genes involved in asparagine cycling and C4 photosynthesis will be engineered to optimize expression throughout the plant life cycle and break the protein and yield tradeoff.

Patterns of gene expression that dictate plant responses to the environment and changes during development are directed by DNA sequences called transcriptional enhancers. In plants, fewer than 20 plant enhancers have ever been characterized yet understanding them is crucial for crop engineering and breeding. Using novel, genome-scale technology, this team will discover large numbers of transcriptional enhancers in the cereal crops maize, sorghum, rice and wheat, particularly those driving gene expression in response to heat and cold stress. The team will then compare heat- or cold-specific enhancers among these species and among different varieties of each species, determine what differences among them are associated with differences in plant performance under heat and cold stress, and identify the protein factors that bind to these enhancers to influence gene expression. After validating the function of these enhancer sequences in heat and cold tolerance, beneficial natural variants of them will be identified for crop improvement efforts. In addition, the team will introduce mutations into these candidates to try and improve them and carry out massively parallel functional assays of enhancer fragments to develop a toolkit of synthetic enhancers with defined strengths and specificities for future crop engineering. This project broadly impacts plant research, crop engineering and breeding; it also impacts the education of future plant genome scholars through targeted outreach efforts, including summer research internships for undergraduate students.This project will apply a novel combination of ATAC- and STARR-seq to discover large numbers of regulatory elements that actively drive transcription in maize and sorghum. Limited studies in rice and wheat will allow for species-level comparisons. The team will focus on transcriptional enhancers, in particular enhancers that drive gene regulation in response to heat and cold stress. With enhancer sequences in hand, the team will characterize condition-specific enhancers that are conserved or diverged between maize and sorghum, determine phenotype-associated enhancer variation, and identify the transcription factors binding these enhancers through motif searches. In-depth comparisons of sorghum and maize enhancers will yield insights into genome evolution after genome duplication in addition to insights into sorghum's greater stress tolerance. The team will also carry out mutagenesis and massively parallel functional assays of enhancer fragments in order to computationally derive synthetic enhancers of defined strength and specificity for crop engineering. Securing food supplies through crop engineering holds immense public interest and the pursuit of this goal enables this team to effectively reach out to diverse groups and students. The outreach program, a distributed network of undergraduate plant genomics scholars, builds on the success of existing programs at partner sites by providing additional funding for four students.

This sorghum grows relatively tall (3-5 m) but commonly breaks and topples under wind, rain, hail or other mechanical stresses. A promising approach to reduce breakage is to develop new mechanically robust sorghum varieties. To do this will require a fundamental understanding of the biomechanical properties of stalks and identifying the genetic and environmental influences that produce stronger plants. Experiments have shown that mechanically stimulating the plants during growth can significantly change the physical and biomechanical characteristics of sorghum stems. This occurs because the mechanical load changes the growth of the cells in the plant stem. This mechanical stimulation causes adaptive growth that improves the mechanical properties of the stalk. This research will accelerate the development of new fuel-rich and mechanically robust varieties of sorghum, thereby leading to significant increases in food, feed, and biomass productivity. This project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary professional and technical training. The team will also participate in a summer research experience for teacher (RET) program and summer camps to disseminate the study of biomechanics and genetics/epigenetics of sorghum to high school teachers and students.To accomplish these goals, this study will integrate experimental and computational studies of structural morphologies, biomechanical properties, physiology, and genetics/epigenetics of bioenergy sorghum stalks, to provide a fundamental explanation of stalk lodging (breaking) and to guide development of new lodging-resistant sorghum. The intellectual significance of this work resides in addressing the following fundamental topics: 1) uncovering the thigmomorphogenic response (response to mechanical stimulation) in tuning the biomechanical properties of bioenergy sorghum stalks, including investigating epigenetic changes, gene expression, and hormonal responses associated with the mechanical properties of stalks; 2) revealing the impact of the viscoelastic responses of stalks and their constituents (sclerenchymatous tissue and parenchymatous tissue with different cell wall structures) on stem lodging; and 3) providing structure-property-genetic/epigenetic relationships for stalks with superior biomechanical properties.

Collectively, the experiments described in the Objectives below will provide for direct testing of a priori hypotheses regarding the genetic pathways associated with plant microbiome recruitment (Objective 2), which we define in this proposal as the assembly and maintenance of plant-associated microbiome, as well as unbiased genome wide analyses that may capture genes previously unsuspected to be involved in this phenotype (Objectives 1 and 3). Integration of the results from this multifaceted approach may allow for corroboration of key findings from individual Objectives. For instance, loci identified in Objective 1 from the association-based analysis of host genes will be cross-referenced with the genes identified as part of the transcriptional analyses described in Objective 3. In Objective 2, genes confirmed through mutant analysis to have direct effects on plant microbiome phenotypes can potentially serve as positive controls for analyses carried out in Objective 1. While the Objectives differ in terms of experimental methodology, as well as the precise question being addressed, the broader goal of each is the identification of elements involved in host control of the microbiome, and we anticipate that this diversified approach in a single host system and by a single investigative team will provide valuable insight addressing this key knowledge gap in the field of plant-biotic interactions.   Objective 1: Identify the host genetic elements (genes and other functional sequences) associated with microbiome recruitment through genome wide association studies in Sorghum bicolor using microbial community analysis as the scoreable phenotype.   Objective 2: Create sorghum mutants in cell wall biosynthesis pathway genes, and other target plant processes, that are critical for the recruitment of microbes during drought stress; characterize the microbiomes and abiotic stress tolerance of these lines.
