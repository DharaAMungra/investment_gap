Stored-grain insect pests have traditionally been controlled with synthetic chemical insecticides or fumigants. Mounting public concern, however, over pesticide residues in food, increasing numbers of stored-grain and vegetable insect pest species exhibiting insecticide resistance, loss of methyl bromide, restrictions on phosphine, and most recently the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, make it necessary to investigate novel management strategies including natural products. Several plants are known that naturally accumulate epoxy fatty acids in their seed oil. It is thought that plants have evolved this characteristic as a chemical defense. The impact, however, of such compounds on seed pests is not known. Also, there is interest in producing various epoxy fatty acids in bioreactors or engineered plants for multiple industrial uses. Some of these compounds might be useful new antibiotic compounds and the toxicological properties of those used for industrial purposes should be better understood. A considerable market currently exists for epoxy fatty acids, particularly for resins, epoxy coatings, and plasticizers. The current United States plasticizer market is approximately 2 billion pounds per year. Presently, most of this is derived from petroleum. In addition, there is industrial interest in the use of epoxy fatty acids in oil-based paints, lubricants and lubricant additives, adhesives, insecticides and insect repellants, crop oil concentrates, and the formulation of carriers for slow-release pesticides and herbicides. Although it has been widely hypothesized that there is evolutionary pressure for organisms to synthesize epoxy fatty acids as a chemical defense, the defensive properties of these compounds are largely unknown.The objective of this research project was to examine bioactivity of epoxy fatty acids on maize weevil, red flour beetle, sawtoothed grain beetle, and flour mill beetle. The specific objectives were to: (1) isolate epoxy fatty acids from suitable natural sources that are models for oilseed improvement such as Vernonia seeds; (2) produce other epoxy fatty acids using in vitro enzymes, microorganisms, and engineered plant tissues; (3) test the effects of these epoxy fatty acids on stored product insect pests and model bacteria; and (4) test the effects of these epoxy fatty acids on stored product insect pest behavior.Dr. David Hildebrand&rsquo;s laboratory at the University of Kentucky primarily was responsible for carrying out the research for objectives 1 and 2 and the bacterial component of objective 3, as well as some epoxy fatty acid biosynthesis studies. Dr. John Sedlacek&rsquo;s laboratory at Kentucky State University was responsible for the bioassays on storage insect pests in objective 3, as well as objective 4. We conducted replicated bioassays exposing maize weevil, sawtoothed grain beetle, red flour beetle, and flour mill beetle to three epoxy fatty acids extracted from iron weed, Vernonia galamensis, and two epoxy fatty acids derived from castor beans, Ricinis communis. Specifically, we quantified adult mortality and progeny production of these four stored grain beetle species at a dose of 30 times 103 ppm of vernonia oil, vernolate, vernolic acid, castor oil, and hydrolyzed castor oil. This dose is similar to the amount found in V. galamensis seeds."

Our goal is to develop irrigated and non-irrigated cropping systems, management techniques and technology for peanut producing areas by accomplishing the following objectives:1:  Determine the yield and quality of peanut following the double cropping system of vegetable and cotton crops in an alternate year rotation when irrigated with Surface Drip Irrigation (SDI).2:  Determine crop management strategies for srtip tillage of peanut and cotton under SDI.3:  Develop SDI system technologies for peanut production cropping systems.Expand development of surface and subsurface irrigation systems and management strategies for rotational crop production, minimum tillage systems and reduced water use in peanuts. Research should determine the best plant populations/planting patterns for peanut in both irrigated and non-irrigated regimes.4.  Determine if furrow-diking improves soil moisture availability and reduces preharvest aflatoxin levels, determine the cost-benefits of adapting furrow diking to Southeast production systems, and improve current expert system models of farm management and irrigation scheduling.5.  Develop reduced cost cropping systems to address the feasibility of peanuts as a bio-diesel feedstock.Approach:A continuous peanut crop is not a viable system because of disease which will reduce crop yield and may increase pesticide inputs.  Cotton and/or corn rotated with peanut in alternate years does increase peanut yield compared with continuous peanut but still may not be economical for the grower.  The possibility of double cropping higher value vegetable crops (green bean and sweet corn) with a lower value field crop may be a sustainable cropping system.  Typically green beans and sweet corn are planted in single rows.  Research has shown that peanut has greater yield potential and disease suppression when planted in a twin row orientation.  If a grower goes to the expense of having a twin row planter for peanut, he would need to use that equipment on all crops instead of having two planters.  Therefore, vegetable and cotton crops will be planted at various plant densities with two row orientation.  Final yield results will be compared with traditional peanut rotations.  Strip tillage can be an effective management tool to reduce crop production costs.  However, strip tillage with peanut production has not shown a clear yield advantage over conventional tillage but has shown an advantage in reducing some diseases.  Unfortunately, yield increases and disease reductions are not consistent from study to study because of different peanut varieties, various cover crops, and management procedures.  Peanut varieties being released have better disease resistance than older varieties.  In university tests, theses varieties have performed well with little or no fungicide treatments which can be an economical savings to growers provided  pod yield is acceptable.  A relationship between strip tillage, peanut variety, and fungicide rate would be beneficial to all peanut growers.  This comprehensive project will incorporate six crop cover treatments, three peanut varieties, and three fungicide application rates to address the relationship between these variables when irrigated with subsurface drip irrigation.  Irrigation at appropriate times is essential to stabilize and insure peanut production of obtain high yield and quality.  One of the greatest advantages of using surface drip irrigation is that the system can be installed easily with low initial investment and provide flexible irrigation schedules without using large pumps and wells.  However, little research has been done to use surface drip irrigation in peanut production to increase peanut yield and quality, and no information is available to transfer this technology into peanut production to improve the grower's profit.  Irrigation systems will be installed that will have various drip tube spacing, crop rotations and water application rates.  Tests will be conducted to determine water movement, water use efficiency, crop yield, and economics of surface drip irrigation."

Assess the role of processing-induced chemical or structural modifications on the individual allergens by systematically altering amino acids thought to be important in clinically-symptomatic allergic reactions. 5. Develop computer models and/or determine NMR/crystal structures of native and recombinant peanut and select tree nut and legume allergens in raw and processed forms.  6. Combine the structural information obtained with the empirical knowledge from Objectives 3, 4, and 5 to identify clinically-relevant allergen-antibody interactions in peanut and tree nut allergy. 7. Develop and improve immunoassays for detection of peanut, select tree nut and soy allergen residues before and after processing (i.e. roasting, baking into cookies, etc.) 8. After establishing standardized protocols for determining threshold doses for peanut, select tree nut, and soy allergens, determine threshold (minimal eliciting) dose of reactivity for processed forms of these allergens and develop computational and statistical models to estimate population thresholds.   Approach:Peanuts, tree nuts, and legumes will be subjected to processing, and the allergens will be compared for changes in digestibility and antibody binding (IgE); structural alterations (e.g. changes in secondary structure,  cross-linking); solubility and degradation; and functional properties (e.g. oligomerization, enzymatic ability).  The prominent allergens from the selected nuts and legumes will be cloned, expressed, and purified and then subjected to specific chemical treatments that mimic reactions that occur during processing.  Alterations to structure, function, and allergic properties will be assessed.  Amino acid sequences thought to be modified during processing will be altered through specific reactions to confirm modification, and the structural properties will be assessed via circular dichrosim and molecular modeling methods.  Protein homology models will be developed for the selected allergens from the different nuts and legumes, and used to determine particular structural or chemical changes empirically determined to alter IgE binding.   The structure of small allergens, for which structural information is unavailable for homology modeling, will be subjected to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to resolve their structure.  Based on these protein models and empirical data, known functional foods, will be selected and assessed for interfering with antibody recognition of various allergens.  Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays will be optimized for recognition of allergens in various food products and processing lines following different processes.  To enable regulatory agencies to adopt proper labeling guidelines for manufacturers, threshold dose determination protocols will be developed for processed forms of peanut, tree nut, and soy allergens.  Small-scale threshold dose studies will be carried out, and the results will be used to develop computational and statistical models to estimate population thresholds."

This information will be used to develop strategies to both improve herbicide efficacy and reduce the environmental impact of herbicide use.Approach:Assessment of weed and conservation practices on the environmental fate of herbicides in soil and plant residues will be assessed in laboratory, greenhouse and field conditions. Most field investigations will study long-term changes in soil properties associated with reduced tillage, cover crops, and residue management to determine how suites of best management practices can be developed to facilitate herbicide effectiveness with minimal potential for adverse effects on the environment.

Field and laboratory research on the environmental fate of the herbicide s-metolachlor will be part of a national effort to examine the role of edaphic factors in degradation kinetics of this herbicide to develop into a predictive model for ascertaining herbicide efficacy and minimize environmental risks.  Factors associated with herbicide dissipation, e.g., herbicide degradation, sorption and movement, and specific microbial degradation pathways, will be studied to determine interactions among weed management practices and the environmental fate of herbicides.  The effects of using transgenic crops resistant to the herbicides glyphosate and glufosinate on soil microflora and plant-microbial interactions will be evaluated, specifically nitrogen fixation and nitrogen assimilation.

Hypothesis:  There are detectable gene and protein differences between uninfected and pathogen-infected plants and between susceptible and resistant plants, and there are pathogen virulence factors critical to pathogen infection, development and survival. 	Objective 2:  Determine modes of action for plant disease resistance genes, pathogen virulence factors and molecular signals responsible for host-parasite interactions through analysis and characterization of genetic, molecular, protein and metabolite networks.  Hypothesis:  Examination of the many genes involved in plant-pathogen interactions will reveal critical molecular networks with specific modes of action that are essential to resistance in soybean and to virulence in soybean pathogens.  These networks may share commonalities to networks in other plants and pathogens. 	Objective 3:  Engineer and evaluate new methods for obtaining resistance, such as gene silencing, over-expression and protein antagonism, and chemical inhibition of host and pathogen processes, with special emphasis on soybean rust and the soybean cyst nematode.  Hypothesis: Expression of gene silencing constructs or of proteins inhibitory to important aspects of pathogen infection, development or maintenance can result in increased tolerance or resistance to a particular pest or pathogen.Approach:We have soybean genotypes resistant to one or more rust isolates, but susceptible to all others.  These soybean genotypes will be challenged with specific pathogen isolates to study the resistance and susceptible response.  Gene and protein expression in both plants and pathogens will be monitored using microarrays, membrane arrays, expressed sequence tag analysis, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR.  Proteins will be detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  Cell fractionation, laser capture microdissection, and subtractive hybridization will be used to isolate specific tissues, organelles, or materials involved in disease processes or responses.  Other methods such as antibody localization, gene silencing, plant hairy root transformation (for SCN studies) and mutant analysis will be used to determine the function of genes and proteins and to evaluate their importance in resistance and susceptibility.  The disease and pest resistance responses to infection in soybeans will be elucidated systematically using microarrays, proteomics and metabolomics to resolve the biological network evoked. A comparison of differential gene expression and protein accumulation in the resistant and susceptible response of soybean to pathogens will identify components of the network.  These networks will be built, examined, and perturbed to confirm function of components using an array of tools, including bioinformatics, yeast two-hybrid screens, mutation analysis, immuno-localization, immuno-precipitation, affinity purification, protein tagging, gene over-expression, phage library display, and other methods that will resolve protein-protein interactions and interactions among molecules.  Based on these data, we can identify candidate members of pathways and networks involved in signaling and evoking the resistance response.  Other plant systems, including common bean and Medicago truncatula, will be used as needed in parallel investigations studying host-pathogen responses and interactions to take advantage of the knowledge and specific traits of the resistance response in these systems.   Approaches for achieving pathogen control include engineering transgenic plant tissue and organs to express genes that boost the natural defense system of the plant or to provide the plant with a new trait that confers resistance by blocking pathogen attack or survival.  Genes shown to have important roles in plant defense may be over-expressed in transgenic plants.  Likewise genes that are critical to survival of the SCN in the host or that make the plant susceptible to SCN may be silenced in transgenic roots using hairy root transformation techniques.  Additionally, genes that express antibodies or protein antagonists will be engineered into soybean to block the survival and development of the pest or pathogen.   BL1/BL1-P  certified 7/14/05."

Global warming, increased energy consumption, increasing agricultural demand, and new air and water pollution regulations that have been adopted in agriculture have prompted the need for diverse and integrated waste to energy solutions to meet the needs of farmers, the surrounding community, and the environment. The objective of this P3 project is to develop a biological wastewater treatment system that utilizes algal growth to simultaneously create renewable energy in the form of biodiesel and digester biogas, remove polluting nutrients, and abate green house gases. For Phase I of this research, bench-scale experiments were conducted using dairy wastewater from an on-campus dairy. A 50-gallon anaerobic digester was operated, and the effluent from this digester was treated in six experimental algae bioreactors operated under different conditions. These bench-scale bioreactor experiments were used to determine the oil productivity of algae grown on dairy wastewater while simultaneously determining the wastewater treatment capabilities of algal bioreactors. Lipid percentages were determined experimentally throughout the growth phase of two separate batch cultures at set time intervals. Water quality parameter such as nutrient concentrations (N and P) and biological oxygen demand were monitored to characterize the wastewater treatment efficiency. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that has the potential to improve people&rsquo;s lives through energy independence and reduced environmental impacts. Biodiesel burns 50% cleaner than conventional petroleum-derived diesel (Haas, 2001) and can be used in any diesel engine with little to no modification. However, biodiesel is currently produced mainly from soy bean oil which requires high energy inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides that are polluting to the environment (Landis, 2007). The rapid growth of the biodiesel industry is also quickly absorbing the soy bean oil that was sold for export, and the relatively low oil production yields can not support the total U.S. demand for petroleum fuel (Duffield, 2007). Figure 1: Scenedesmus from Bench-Scale Bioreactors Biodiesel production from algae is promising because algae has the potential to solve this feedstock problem since algae biomass productivity is far greater per acre than terrestrial plants and their oil content would significantly exceed the oil productivity of soybeans (NREL, 1996). Previous research by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) demonstrated biodiesel production from algae, but their final conclusion was that it was uneconomical (at the time) to use selective strains and controlled environments to produce biodiesel from algae. NREL suggested a more economical approach would be to combine efforts of algal production with wastewater treatment. This P3 research project was conducted to test the practicality of combined biodiesel production and wastewater treatment using dairy wastewater as a substrate. The ultimate vision for this research is to combine the biodiesel production from native species of micro-algae grown in agricultural wastewater while simultaneously removing polluting nutrients and sequestering carbon dioxide-rich flue gas from a generator running on biogas from an anaerobic digester."

Determine the effect of alternative swine manure application methods on nutrient fate and bacterial transport in systems with and without cover crops.  1) Determine effect of application method (surface application with disking versus low disturbance injection) on crop and cover crop uptake of N and P.2) Determine retention and form of 15N-manure after application to soil.3) Determine the distribution of bioavailable P in the root zone after manure application.4) Determine loss of N, P and E. coli in runoff. C. Determine the effects of composted animal manure, tillage and their interaction on C and N cycling in extended corn-soybean rotations containing small grains and/or legumes.1) Determine the effects of application of composted animal manure on soil and crop C and N within a corn-soybean-winter wheat/red clover rotation under three tillage treatments (fall moldboard plow, fall chisel plow, and no-tillage).2) Determine the contribution of N from composted animal manure to plant available N within corn-soybean rotations.Approach:This research examines the use of a rye-oat cover crop to increase manure nutrient retention and to prevent losses of nutrients and fecal bacteria in runoff.  The research tests the feasibility of this concept and provides an initial demonstration of this practice to selected growers.  If successful the research would form the foundation for field-scale testing and the development of guidelines for producers. Cover crops have been previously shown to be effective in preventing erosion and nitrate leaching, thus they have the potential to mitigate the off-site effects of manure application.  Cover crops in the Midwest are established following soybean harvest in October or early November.  Swine manure is also applied at this time either as a surface application or by injection.  Manure application causes considerable disturbance, thus cover crop survival and function will be assessed.  Furthermore, the effects of conventional and low disturbance manure injection equipment will be compared with respect N and P retention and cover crop survival.  This research would evaluate the cover crop uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus. The ability of cover crops to mitigate runoff losses of nutrients and fecal bacteria will also be examined in rainfall simulation experiments.  In addition, we will determine the effects of composted manure on nitrogen utilization by corn in a rotational cropping system."

Specific objectives include: 1) Measure the effects of tillage, residue management, fertility, and crop rotation on physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils in agricultural crop production systems. 2) Develop crop rotation, nutrient, soil, residue, and pest management practices that improve farming efficiency (increase unit output/unit input), maintain or increase soil productivity, and improve crop yield and quality. 3) Measure the effects of corn stover/residue removed for biofuel feedstock on: (1) short-term balances of soil C and N; (2) crop yield and quality; and (3) soil resource condition.Approach:Established long-term field experiments evaluating the effect of crop rotation, residue management, fertility and tillage will be utilized to evaluate the research hypothesis that crop rotations, crop diversity, and crop sequence improves soil quality and productivity and that increased crop diversity, attained through the introduction of alternative crops and improved crop sequences into the traditional corn/soybean rotation, will improve crop yield and quality while maintaining or improving soil quality.  To address the hypothesis that no significant effect of genetic modification of corn genotype on soil microbes (DNA compositional measures) and their processes (e.g., C&N transformations) will be detectable, a field experiment will be established evaluating several different corn isolines with and with out genetically modified organisms.  To evaluate the hypothesis that cover crops and integrated weed management strategies will increase biodiversity and enhance sustainable crop production, research will be conducted in two phases.  Phase 1 will consist of a small-plot field experiment in which different species of grasses and legumes will be evaluated as cover crops in a corn/soybean/spring wheat rotation. The viability of cover crops as a management tool for weeds and insects relative to chemically-driven pest management will be investigated in Phase 2 of the research.  Field and greenhouse experiments will be established evaluating a number of different soybean genotypes to test the hypothesis that soybean genotypes with significantly more root length and mass in the top 10 cm of soil (extensive fibrous root system) will have a more positive impact on soil organic matter, aggregate stability, and soil strength than other soybean genotypes."

Crop residues from wheat and canola will be removed at commercially achievable rates. Each crop will be managed under three irrigation regimes intended to create three productivity levels representative of low, intermediate, and high production regimes. Irrigation application amounts will be varied as a fraction of evapotranspiration (ET) rate û 50, 75, and 100%.  Experimental design is a split-split plot with four replications with cropping system (corn, wheat, switchgrass) as the main factor, productivity level (low, intermediate, high) as the first split, and residue removal as the final split."

Develop tools and strategies for site-specific weed management.3. Develop tools to assess the impacts of cropping systems and irrigation practices on furrow irrigation-induced erosion.Approach:We will use small plot field trials to develop water production functions, weed management strategies, and remotely sensed water deficit measurements of four crops (corn, sunflower, wheat and dry beans) under two tillage systems (conventional tillage and minimum tillage).  The effects of tillage and limited irrigation on crop yields, weed population dynamics, and herbicide efficacy will be measured.  Deficit irrigations will be scheduled to optimize production using past studies of critical growth stages and crop simulation models.  Active and passive sensors on ground-based platforms will measure crop response to water and nitrogen stress.  The research will be done in collaboration with an agriculture economist and crop modelers to provide basic information for both short and long-term decisions on the best way to maximize economic return with limited irrigation water.  Field measurements and computer simulation studies will be used to determine the utility of site specific weed management in growers' fields.  We will contribute to an ARS effort to develop a model for NRCS to assess the impacts of cropping systems and irrigation practices on furrow irrigation-induced erosion."

Over the next 5 years, we will focus on the following objectives:1. Develop and evaluate environmentally sustainable forage and nutrient management systems that protect and enhance water and soil resources in forage-based beef cattle agro-ecosystems of the subtropics.  a. Understand and quantify the impact of grazing cattle, cattle movement, and grazing behavior on changes in water quality and soil nutrients dynamics around and beneath cattle congregation sites (mineral feeders, water troughs, and shades). b. Determine the effect of grazing, stocking rate, and pasture grass-legume mixtures on soil carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen dynamics, and on above ground net production and N and P uptake in subtropical pastures.  c. Assess the ecological and physiological mechanisms of forage plants to cope with wet soils, high water tables, and occasional flooding by forage plants in the subtropics.   d. Develop fundamental understanding of the processes controlling nutrient   transformations, fluxes, transport, loading, and sequestration following conversion of improved beef cattle pastures to wetland cells.  Provide vital information needed to meet water quality goals and standards and quantify effects of BMPs on water quality and for model validations: EAGHM (Everglades Agro-Hydrology Model) and SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool).2. Assess nutrient richness and degradation of manure pats from ruminants grazing pastures composed partially of tannin containing legumes.   a. Determine if natural tannins in temperate and tropical legumes affect C, N, and P mobility, degradation, and cycling from feces.  b. Assess microbial activity in dung pats from cattle grazing tannin containing forage plants.3. Develop and implement technology particularly near-infrared spectroscopy to rapidly assess forage, soil, and manure for chemical nutrients and biological contaminants.Approach:The research project outlined in this plan represents the next 5-year component of a long-term research strategy (described below) that optimizes forage-based cow-calf operations while improving sustainability of beef cattle agriculture and water quality protection. This plan seeks to develop and evaluate and environmentally sustainable forage and nutrient management systems that protect and enhance water and soil resources. Through concurrent collaborative studies at three locations representing divergent subtropical soil types, hydrology, and environments, the impact of grazing intensity, cattle movement, and grazing behavior on soil C, P, and N dynamics in pastures will be determined and changes in water quality around and beneath cattle congregation sites will be assessed at the same locations. This plan will also assess nutrient richness and degradation of manure pats from ruminants grazing pastures composed partially of tannin containing legumes. To accomplish this, collaborative studies will determine if natural tannins in temperate and tropical legumes affect C, N, and P mobility, degradation, and cycling from feces. The third component of this project plan is to develop and implement technology, particularly near-infrared spectroscopy, to rapidly assess forage, soil, and manure for chemical nutrients and biological contaminants. This work involves development of new tools and knowledge for scientists, producers, and action agencies so all can better understand the linkages between soil, climate, and farming practices on water quality, leading to the development of appropriate management practices and technologies for water quality protection, pasture stability, and cattle ranching profitability."

Over the next 5 years we will focus on the following objectives: Objective 1: Use P. syringae pv. syringae B728a genomic expression chips to identify and characterize genes regulated by the gacS/gacA two-component regulatory system. Sub-objective 1.A. Use genomic expression chips to identify the members of the gacA/gacS transcriptome that are regulated under a variety of growth conditions. Sub-objective 1.B. Functional genomic analysis of gacS/gacA regulated genes.Objective 2: Develop and analyze transgenic plants expressing a viral protein that may inhibit Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) transmission by thrips.Sub-objective 2.A. Develop real-time RT-PCR methodologies to quantitate TSWV  replication in host plants and the thrips vector. Sub-objective 2.b. Construct and characterize transgenic tomato plants expressing the TSWV glycoprotein GN-S.Approach:For Objective 1: Bacterial growth conditions that will be analyzed include varying pH, iron availability and liquid vs. solid media. These growth conditions are all known to affect the growth of bacteria on plants. High quality RNA will be prepared using standard bacterial protocols. RNAs will be used to probe commercially available genomic expression arrays containing oligo DNA markers for all 3,840 genes within the B728a genome. Reproducibility will be ensured by having standardized hybridization protocols performed by the vendor, with the chip data processed by the SY using proprietary software. Changes in gene expression will be confirmed using real-time RT-PCR. Genes that show differential expression under the various growth conditions will be mutated and their effect on plant virulence determined.For Objective 2: All three TSWV RNA contain very similar but not identical sequences at their ends. We will use these end sequences to design primers that are specific to either the genomic RNA (contained in the viral particle) or anti-genomicRNA (necessary for replication) to produce cDNA specific to that RNA. We will determine the amounts of viral message RNA species by using random hexamers to generate cDNA. The viral RNA within each cDNA will be quantitated by real-time PCR using our standard protocols. The amount of each RNA species will be determined by using a standard curve consisting of a dilution series of cloned viral DNA of known concentration. As a preliminary to the analsysis of TSWV, we will determine the relative amounts of genomic, anti-genomic, and viral mRNAs expressed by the maize pathogen Maize fine streak virus. MFSV is a mono-partite negative-sense virus that contains only a single RNA genome and avoids the complexity of distinquishing three RNA genomes containing related sequences as is the case with TSWV.We have shown that feeding thrips a modified form of the TSWV glycoprotein GN (designated GN-S) dramatically inhibits the acquisition of the virus and the ability of the thrips to transmit the virus. This most likely is due to the saturation of viral binding sites within the thrips guts by GN-S thus preventing viral binding and transport of the TSWV virion through the intestinal lining. We will express the GN-S protein in potato and other hosts to establish that this protein can inhibit the acquisition and transmission of TSWV when expressed within the plant. The GN-S ORF will be cloned into an Agrobacterium vector. This construct will be either transiently expressed using an Agro launching technique or transformed into a susceptible host. Plants will be analyzed for GN-S gene expression using real-time RT-PCR and GN-S protein expression by western blot. Thrips will be fed on transiently expressing leaf discs or transformed plants showing a high level of expression of the GN-S protein for a two hour acquisition period and then moved to TSWV infected hosts. Acquisition of TSWV by thrips will be analyzed using real-time RT-PCR and transmission of TSWV to host plants will be quantitated using a leaf disc or green house assay."

As  a highly mobile generalist herbivore Lygus disperses frequently across the agricultural landscape, often rapidly  increasing population densities in economically susceptible crops to the extent that insecticides are required  to protect the yield. These rapid shifts in pest densities demonstrate that Lygus densities within a field are not  solely a result of the grower&rsquo;s in-field management practices but instead  depend upon migration events initiated outside the field. Effective Lygus management must, therefore, be done at the landscape level.To  manage Lygus from a landscape  perspective, it is essential to understand its dispersal capability. Specifically,  quantifying long-distance dispersal is essential for understanding the  colonization potential of highly mobile insects. The smallest-scale local  movements undertaken by the majority of the focal population do not  sufficiently explain the speed and spread of the seasonal redistribution of  insect populations. It is also important to determine the relative  contribution of long distance versus local dispersal, and of different source  types, in the colonization of economically vulnerable cotton fields. A better understanding of this relationship  will lead to optimal landscape configurations that minimize the probability of  damaging densities of Lygus occurring  in cotton."

Town, J. Craig Venter Institute, Inc.Co-PI: David C. Schwartz, University of WisconsinMedicago truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa, is the preeminent model for legume genomics and has been the target of an international sequencing initiative for the past five years. When the international sequencing efforts wind down in the fall of 2008, there will be ~280 Mb of high quality DNA sequence distributed across the plant's eight chromosomes each with blocks of sequence ranging in size from a few hundred thousand bases to between five and 10 million bases in length and with from 10-30 gaps in each of the euchromatic arms. Based upon the projected capture rate of expressed sequence tags, the euchromatic, gene-rich portion of genome will be around 80% complete. There will also be ~200 Mb of unsequenced DNA in the centromeres that is gene poor and was not targeted for sequencing. This project will integrate, manage and enhance our understanding of both the structure and annotation of the Medicago genome, and comprises three goals:1. Creation of the best possible sequence-based representation of the M. truncatula genome. This will involve construction of an optical map, which is a physical scaffold derived by methods totally independent of the DNA sequencing process. The map will allow the runs of contiguous stretches of DNA sequence (contigs) produced by the sequencing centers to be placed in the correct order and orientation and the sizes of gaps between these contigs and the location and sizes of the gene-poor centromeric regions to be determined.2. Capturing and localizing as much as possible of the remaining gene-containing regions of M. truncatula genome in the most cost-efficient fashion, thus providing a close to complete inventory of its gene content.3. Supporting and maintaining the IMGAG (International Medicago Genome Annotation Group) annotation pipeline that represents a consensus annotation process for the entire Medicago (and legume) community and enriching the annotation of the M. truncatula genome by overlaying other data types including expression data (both microarray and NextGeneration sequencing), proteomic data, locations of transposon and fast-neutron induced mutations, links to genetic resources, etc. With the sequencing projects terminating, members of the IMGAG consortium (including the JCVI group in the US) will have few resources to devote to continued annotation. This project will maintain and keep updated both the sequence content and annotation of the Medicago genome and provide a critical central and stable resource for legume researchers for years to come. The project will also host a community annotation portal that will allow researchers to enrich the basically automatic, computer-generated annotation with more refined structural and functional details based upon their own knowledge and experience. All information generated by this project will be freely accessible through the project web site maintained at the J. Craig Venter Institute (http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/medicago-truncatula-database/overview/).The project will be monitored by an advisory committee composed of members of the community-elected International Medicago Steering Committee. At the educational level, both participating institutions will host visiting students in their laboratories for summer internships. In addition, annual workshops will be held to provide education in genome annotation and analysis to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and interested faculty in the legume community."

However, in a teaching laboratory with 20 or more students, a limiting factor in student success with open-ended research problems is instructor availability for real time, individualized scaffolding (guiding students to higher-level thinking and complex problem solving related to the student's research problem). This project is testing the hypothesis that by moderately scaffolding the student research process a carefully designed web interface tool, the  Exploring Genomics in Context Interface  (EGCI), can support classroom instruction and facilitate authentic research in genomics with only a modicum of faculty input. The EGCI provides an iterative way for students to choose strategies for asking and addressing biologically interesting questions using a range of genomics tools. It is designed to help students develop the ability to: 1) define biologically interesting questions that can be addressed with data, 2) relate a gene to biological function, 3) analyze data including the aspect of quality, 4) develop a literature-based understanding of important quantitative approaches, and 5) test thoroughly a viable hypothesis by bringing together the literature, classroom knowledge, and analysis of data. The project's specific research objectives are to: 1. determine how undergraduate students' scientific thinking skills are enhanced by an authentic research experience in the context of a course; 2. analyze the role of scaffolding in supporting student research success; and 3. identify generalizable components for computer-based scaffolding of open-ended research.   These are being explored using a mixed-methods research approach to collect data that characterizes: 1) the skill level of individual students prior to the course, developed through the course prior to the specific assignment, and following the assignment, 2) student behavior during the assignment (including structured observations; student reflections; and analysis of EGCI webmetrics), and 3) the scaffolding accomplished by the faculty member (including structured observations and reflection by the faculty members). Intellectual Merit: Genomics education is an ideal platform on which to initiate this work because genomics, an important frontier in modern science, provides the opportunity for students to work with large datasets; and allows scaffolding of biological questions at multiple levels of organization. Chamaecrista (partridge pea) and Aiptasia (model for symbiotic corals), the organisms selected for this initial work, are ideal test subjects because they are threatened by global climate change and evolution, are scientifically important, and, most important for an undergraduate project, have readily available gene sequences and appropriate supporting analysis tools. Broader Impacts: Identifying general elements of scaffolding software that support authentic student research at scale increases opportunities for undergraduates at many institutions to develop higher order, scientific thinking skills, meeting a national need. All curricular material, assessment tools, and editable forms of the EGCI are being made freely available for adoption on the Teaching Genomics website.  The work is being conducted at two different institutions - one that integrates genomics throughout the curriculum (Carleton) and one with distinct genomics and bioinformatics courses (Vassar), thus broadening the applicability of the efforts to other institutions."

However, these beneficial infections are predicted to be evolutionarily unstable. Bacteria that help hosts can potentially evolve into parasites that exploit hosts. Alternatively, they might shift into novel life histories and abandon host interaction entirely. Both evolutionary pathways can be harmful to hosts, as uncooperative bacteria spread and take over beneficial populations. Here, the symbiotic bacteria (rhizobia) found on legume roots will be used to examine instability of beneficial bacterial infections. Field surveys, inoculation assays, experimental evolution studies and molecular analyses will (i) assess the frequency with which uncooperative rhizobia emerge in wild symbiont populations, (ii) investigate the reproductive success of uncooperative strains, and (iii) test hypotheses about the evolutionary forces that can shape uncooperative rhizobial strategies.Symbiotic bacteria are a key yet poorly understood facet of life. Humans and our food sources often depend upon bacterial cooperation for health, and research is needed to investigate the origins of harmful strains. This research will provide clues about how and why host-beneficial bacteria shift into harmful modes. It will provide training opportunities to students, and results will be incorporated into classroom activities."

This property has enabled legumes to colonize marginal habitats and provides an ideal system to study how coevolution promotes adaptation to stressful environments. The model legume Medicago truncatula is a close relative of alfalfa and grows naturally in both highly saline soils across North Africa as well as on normal soils. In collaboration with Tunisian and French researchers, this research project will use genomic resources to understand how Medicago and its partner Sinorhizobium have adapted to saline soil. The main goal of this research is to identify both the genes and the genetic and biochemcial networks that underlie ecological differences between saline-adapted and non-adapted populations. By measuring the effects of these genes and networks under the natural conditions that plants experience, this research has the unique potential to bridge genetics, ecology, and evolution. Statement broader impacts Soil salinisation is a growing problem with the potential to impact up to one third of agricultural land world-wide. Thus, understanding how abiotic factors, including salinity, impact symbiotic efficiency represents an important challenge for agriculture both in the developed and developing world.  Since Medicago truncatula is a model species, the genes and pathways identified in this research will be directly applicable to breeding efforts to improve many agriculturally important legumes and more broadly to plant biology as a whole. The interdisciplinary and inter-continental nature of this project further provides an exceptional training opportunity. This project will integrate Tunisian and American teams-facilitated by generous matching funds from public (UC Davis) and private (USC) institutions-by cooperatively performing field experiments in Tunisia and through the exchange of personnel. Tunisian students and scholars will be hosted at the US institutions where they will engage in research, undertake individually-tailored coursework, and make contacts that will spur their professional growth. American undergraduate and graduate students will benefit via hands-on research experience, individual mentored projects, and the opportunity to participate in workshops and conferences in North Africa. All data generated by this research will be made publicly available at http://nlab.usc.edu. The project website will be publicly accessible with released data and project updates. The genotyping array, and the genotype and phenotype data collected will serve as a community resource enabling future work on Medicago. The results of this research will be published in peer-reviewed open-access journals, made accessible to the American and African media, and presented by junior members of the team at international meetings across the globe."

Creating a Bean Beetle Curriculum Development Network  is a collaborative project between Emory University and Morehouse College. The goal of the project is to expand the use of inquiry-based laboratory exercises with the bean beetle model system, Callosobruchus maculatus.  There are four primary objectives. The first objective is to use faculty workshops, along with the handbook and website created as part of an earlier project, to develop faculty expertise in the use of bean beetles in inquiry-based laboratory courses. The faculty recruited for these workshops will be from biology disciplines, such as animal physiology, neurobiology, molecular biology, genetics, and developmental biology that were not addressed in the previous project.  The second objective is to provide faculty in the workshops the opportunity to adapt the inquiry-based laboratory exercises developed in the previous project to fit their curricula and institutions. Fulfilling this objective is allowing the implementation of these educational innovations in a greater diversity of educational institutions.  The third objective is for faculty in the workshops to develop and implement new inquiry-based laboratory studies (i.e., new learning materials) using bean beetles in the areas of animal physiology, neurobiology, molecular biology, genetics, and developmental biology. Finally, the fourth objective is for network participants to develop or adapt assessment tools to evaluate their new laboratory exercises and to implement those assessments. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the development, testing and implementation of inquiry-based laboratory experiments, which have been shown to increase student understanding of scientific content, experimental design, and the nature of science. By creating a curriculum development network, the project is broadening significantly the disciplines within biology that will be able to use bean beetles as a model system for inquiry-based laboratory courses. New laboratory materials are being produced for courses in animal physiology, neurobiology, molecular biology, genetics, and developmental biology.  Finally, the project is assessing the effectiveness of inquiry-based learning in laboratory courses across a diversity of institutions and disciplines in biology.The broader impacts of the project emerge from the recruitment of faculty for workshops from a diverse array of institutions.  As a result, the curriculum development network established at the proposed workshops is promoting better teaching and learning in diverse settings.  In addition, the workshops are establishing partnerships that will continue to improve laboratory education in biology.

Creating a Bean Beetle Curriculum Development Network  is a collaborative project between Emory University and Morehouse College. The goal of the project is to expand the use of inquiry-based laboratory exercises with the bean beetle model system, Callosobruchus maculatus.  There are four primary objectives. The first objective is to use faculty workshops, along with the handbook and website created as part of an earlier project, to develop faculty expertise in the use of bean beetles in inquiry-based laboratory courses. The faculty recruited for these workshops will be from biology disciplines, such as animal physiology, neurobiology, molecular biology, genetics, and developmental biology that were not addressed in the previous project.  The second objective is to provide faculty in the workshops the opportunity to adapt the inquiry-based laboratory exercises developed in the previous project to fit their curricula and institutions. Fulfilling this objective is allowing the implementation of these educational innovations in a greater diversity of educational institutions.  The third objective is for faculty in the workshops to develop and implement new inquiry-based laboratory studies (i.e., new learning materials) using bean beetles in the areas of animal physiology, neurobiology, molecular biology, genetics, and developmental biology. Finally, the fourth objective is for network participants to develop or adapt assessment tools to evaluate their new laboratory exercises and to implement those assessments. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the development, testing and implementation of inquiry-based laboratory experiments, which have been shown to increase student understanding of scientific content, experimental design, and the nature of science. By creating a curriculum development network, the project is broadening significantly the disciplines within biology that will be able to use bean beetles as a model system for inquiry-based laboratory courses. New laboratory materials are being produced for courses in animal physiology, neurobiology, molecular biology, genetics, and developmental biology.  Finally, the project is assessing the effectiveness of inquiry-based learning in laboratory courses across a diversity of institutions and disciplines in biology.The broader impacts of the project emerge from the recruitment of faculty for workshops from a diverse array of institutions.  As a result, the curriculum development network established at the proposed workshops is promoting better teaching and learning in diverse settings.  In addition, the workshops are establishing partnerships that will continue to improve laboratory education in biology.  Furthermore, to increase involvement of under-represented minorities in inquiry-based research, some workshop slots are being set aside for faculty from community colleges and minority-serving institutions.  Finally, the materials developed by participants in the curriculum development network are being disseminated through a devoted website, workshops and presentations at annual meetings of the undergraduate STEM education community, and publication in journals related to undergraduate STEM education."

Principle Investigator: Gardner, Gary M. Title: Functional Analysis of an Indoleacyl-Modified Protein From StrawberryAward AbstractStrawberry fruit are a classic system for studies of the signaling between adjacent tissues as the expansion of the receptacle tissue is dependent on auxin released from the achenes. Within the last several years significant genetic resources for Fragaria and other members of the Rosaceae have been developed such that the diploid strawberry is now an important reference species for molecular characterization of studies of hormonal signaling within fruit tissues. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is found in plants in both free and conjugated form. Among the conjugated IAA forms, there exists a unique class of proteins where IAA is a prosthetic group attached directly to the polypeptide structure. The first gene, for a bean protein with an IAA prosthetic group, has been cloned and a related protein and several smaller peptides were identified in Arabidopsis. The work in this project focuses on a unique IAA-modified protein found in the achenes and receptacle tissue of strawberry that has been shown to be the beta subunit of ATP synthase. This is the first IAA-protein with a predicted function to be described. While we have a general interest in understanding indoleacylation of plant proteins, the goals of the current project are focused on an indoleacyl-modified mitochondrial F1-ATP synthase from the diploid strawberry, Fragaria vesca. The project will focus on two main goals: 1. the use of mass spectral tools for determination of the site of IAA attachment; and 2. determination of the function of the IAA-modification on the ATP synthase.Broader impacts of the project are as follows. This project will directly support one postdoctoral scientist and one graduate student who will be involved in this project that requires, in addition to plant biochemistry and molecular biology, specific expertise in the use of modern techniques of protein and small molecule mass spectrometric analysis to answer fundamental questions in plant biology. It will also provide a resource for others interested in studies of novel native modified peptides and studies of plant hormone metabolism, either as visitors to the host laboratory or by transfer of the methods to their own facility."

Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is an important leguminous tree for agro-forestry in many tropical and subtropical countries. Leucaena is known as  the alfalfa of the tropics  since the high protein content of its foliage is comparable to that of alfalfa. However, leucaena plants contain a toxin, mimosine, which is harmful to animals.  Producing mimosine-free leucaena is a challenging task because the biosynthetic pathway for mimosine is unknown and leucaena is recalcitrant to transformation. A novel metabolic engineering strategy will be used for removing mimosine from leucaena by introducing genes from its bacterial symbiont. This project will use two Rhizobium genes that are required for degradation of 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (HP), which is a precursor for mimosine biosynthesis in leucaena. By expressing these genes in transgenic leucaena, the metabolic pathway for mimosine will be redirected to produce ammonia, pyruvate and formate, which should serve as additional nitrogen and carbon sources for the plant.This work will lead the way for neutralization of toxins in other legumes and non-legumes using metabolic engineering approaches. Hawaii is a prime location for testing bioengineered crops throughout the year, for which many scientists and trained technicians are needed. This project will help to create a group of scientists for the near future by training two graduate and six or more undergraduate students in biotechnology. Special efforts will be made to recruit the native Hawaiian and other Pacific Island students for training through this project. This project will also enhance biotechnology education in Hawaii by training 24 science teachers. Teachers will learn the latest developments in biotechnology, which will be then transmitted to the students. Biotechnology education is essential to stimulate interest of high school students to this rapidly growing technology. Without proper biotechnology education there is always a danger that the public may absorb negative publicity against biotechnology, transgenic crops, and their testing in Hawaii."

These symbioses form the basis for crop rotation and allow legumes to thrive without the application of nitrogen fertilizer.  Establishment of the symbiosis between Sinorhizobium meliloti and its plant hosts requires the S. meliloti ExoS/ChvI genes, which encode an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway.  Orthologs of the ExoS/ChvI genes also play essential roles in host interactions of other alpha-proteobacteria, such as the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. To elucidate the roles of ExoS/ChvI signaling in both symbiotic and free-living S. meliloti, new transcriptional target genes of ExoS/ChvI will be characterized, and their contributions to ExoS/ChvI function will be analyzed using genetics, genomics, and microscopy.  Further, the regulation of ExoS/ChvI signaling will be investigated by biochemical and structural analysis of a novel ExoS/ChvI inhibitor.  These studies will provide crucial insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying a bacteria-plant symbiosis with agricultural and economic importance.  The project will be accomplished at a Hispanic-serving, comprehensive university by undergraduate and master's students, including future high school biology teachers.  These students will gain experience in molecular biology research while working collaboratively.

They are crucial for all cells, since they represent the primary energy source for plant life. The system responsible for distribution within plants is the phloem which consists of tube like cells that form a microfluidic network within the plant body. Due to its high content of sugar, the phloem is a primary target for pests like aphids and mealybugs. Currently, infestation of crop plants by such pests causes substantial economic damage and the dependence on pesticides. An increasing number of consumers, however, are concerned about the occurrence of pesticides in food. Numerous studies have demonstrated that pesticide residues are common rather than exceptional. For example, in a sampling of apples in Washington State, 84% tested positive for pesticides; in some cases, levels were so high that a child consuming half an apple would exceed the daily safe exposure level. In order to reduce pesticide exposure, new strategies need to be developed.  Recently protein bodies have been discovered which reversibly occlude phloem cells in case of injury. This type of protein body has only been found to date in bean plants.  Using molecular, microscopic, and biochemical methods the mechanism and control of the reaction will be investigated. In addition it will be investigated if similar mechanisms occur in other plant families, and if those mechanisms can be used to induce resistance in plants which have high susceptibility to phloem feeding insects. These new strategies carry the potential to dramatically reduce the amount of insecticides currently required in modern agriculture. Additional broader impacts are expected through training of undergraduate and graduate students on the use of microscopy to study the mechanism of phloem transport and phloem insect interactions"

Use of experimentally evolved populations of rhizobia derived from the model rhizobium 'Sinorhizobium meliloti' will enable direct measurement of the extent of host-symbiont conflict by asking whether mutations that confer higher rhizobia fitness have positive or negative effects on host performance. Identification of mutants will lead to development of testable mechanistic hypotheses and macro-evolutionary predictions, connecting laboratory results to natural populations.The symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia, bacteria that form root nodules and fix atmospheric nitrogen, is among the best model systems for understanding coevolution. While the interaction is widely assumed to be mutually beneficial, there is ongoing debate over the extent to which rhizobia can cheat their host plants by receiving plant resources without providing fixed nitrogen in return. The rhizobia-legume symbiosis is a key component of sustainable agriculture, as legumes can grow without oil-derived fertilizers and enrich soil fertility over the long-term when used in crop rotations. Legumes include the economically important crop species soy, alfalfa, pea, bean, chickpea, and peanut that provide plant-based protein for human and animal nutrition. Thus, increased understanding of the rhizobia genes implicated in this study may prove useful to agriculture for designing more efficient legume-rhizobia symbioses."

These advancements set the stage for efforts to coordinate legume genetics and genomics to insure future progress and, more importantly, to transition basic discoveries into practical applications. The International Conferences on Legume Genomics and Genetics (ICLGG) were established in 2002 to reflect the growing development of legume genomics and genetics. This effort was driven in part by the adoption of the model legumes, Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus. A major impetus was the desire on the part of model legume researchers to see their discoveries translated into practical advances in crop legumes. A key element of these meetings from the beginning was the inclusion of plant breeders and agronomists, alongside researchers focused more on basic research.  To encourage the participation of junior scientists, the Conference defrays the cost of attendance for a number of graduate students and postdoctoral associates to present their work and to otherwise participate in the 4th ICLGG.

CollinsJennifer R. WiegelUniversity of Wisconsin-MadiosnOver the past decade in Latin America supermarkets? share of food retail has grown from 15% to 70% on average, and concentration of retail at the national level has increased, leaving only a few lead firms.  At the same time supermarkets have shifted procurement from wholesale markets to semi-contractual relationships with networks of preferred suppliers.  These changes have increased the power of supermarkets in developing countries to reshape food production and distribution, with important implications for producers and consumers, and for the rural and urban poor. This dissertation studies the changing structure of food retail channels, for example from traditional markets to supermarkets, matters for agriculture, farmers and the rural poor in developing countries. The co-PI will spend twelve months conducting fieldwork in Nicaragua to study the recent growth of supermarkets there and its effects on food retailing and domestic food production.  This work addresses three research questions:  (1) how does retail-led restructuring affect a developing country?s integration with world food markets,  (2) how is retail-led restructuring affecting existing food retail channels, food provisioning, and food markets within developing countries, and (3) how are farmers in developing countries experiencing and responding to these changes? The study draws on recent research in the fields of sociology, agricultural economics, and geography which identifies global food retailers as the drivers in transforming agri-food systems in developed countries.  Yet it extends this research to focus on the growth of supermarkets within developing countries, and its impact on farmers domestically, through its effects on traditional food retail institutions and practices.  It also extends the focus on farmers directly supplying supermarkets, to include farmers supplying traditional food retail channels.  Data on production, consumption and trade will be used to explore the changing integration of Nicaragua with world food markets.  Government statistics on household spending, prices, and food retailers, combined with interviews and short surveys of wholesalers and retailers will help understand changes in food retail channels.  Agricultural census data and interviews with buyers will help to map out procurement networks for transnational supermarkets, national supermarkets, and traditional markets.  Communities within these different procurement networks for tomatoes (perishable) and beans (not perishable) will be identified and qualitative interviews with farmers to study how they are experiencing and responding to these changes.  Broader Impacts:  The research will be conducted as a collaborative endeavor involving individuals from national universities, government agencies, agricultural NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and farmers associations.  These collaborations will help foster local research, training, and teaching networks around these issues, ensure local relevance and dissemination of research findings, and their incorporation into policy.  Findings will also be disseminated in US and international academic and policy forums and publications.  Knowledge gained will enrich teaching and research in the sociology of agriculture and development by bringing together work from the disparate disciplines mentioned above."

The principal investigators identified specific BR-dependent phosphorylation sites of Arabidopsis BRI1 and BAK1 in planta and isolated a putative cytoplasmic substrate of BRI1 with homology to the mammalian TGF-beta receptor interacting protein (TRIP-1). TRIP-1 (also known as eIF3i) is a dual function protein that regulates TGF-beta signaling in mammals and also plays a critical role in the eIF3 protein translation initiation complex in animals, yeast and plants. Arabidopsis BRI1 interacts with TRIP-1 in planta and phosphorylates TRIP-1 on three specific residues in vitro. Initiation is the rate-limiting step in eukaryotic protein translation and is often regulated by phosphorylation of specific initiation factor subunits in response to various signals. A proteomic screen for novel BRI1 and BAK1 interactors identified an additional four eIF subunits; eIF2B, eIF3g, eIF4A and eIF5, as putative kinase domain substrates for BRI1 and/or BAK1. Taken together, the preliminary evidence suggests that BR-dependent phosphorylation of TRIP-1 (and other eIF subunits) by BRI1 may affect initiation factor activity and/or assembly and thus impact the global cellular phenomenon of protein translation, providing a novel mechanism for BR regulation of plant growth. The research will examine the intersection of BR signal transduction and protein translation initiation by focusing on three objectives. Objective 1. Characterization of Arabidopsis TRIP-1 in vivo phosphorylation sites by a variety of mass spectrometry approaches and analysis of their functional significance with respect to BR signaling and eIF3 activity. Objective 2. Detailed in vivo and in vitro characterization of the putative interaction of eIF3g and eIF5 with BRI1 and BAK1. Objective 3.Generation of an in vivo phosphorylation site database of multiple eIF subunits followed by quantitative studies of BR-dependent phosphorylation in these proteins using label-free mass spectrometry methodologies.Intellectual merit: A great deal is known about genomic effects of BR signaling and BR regulated gene expression, but little is known about non-genomic pathways through which BRs might regulate cellular physiology directly, e.g. by phosphorylating cytoplasmic proteins such as translation initiation factor subunits. Identification of specific in vivo phosphorylation sites in eIF subunits coupled with their functional characterization will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating protein translation in plants.Broader impacts: The proposed research will provide excellent training in biochemistry, molecular biology and mass spectrometry at all levels, including postdoctoral scientists, graduate and undergraduate students and high school student summer interns. A database of eIF phosphorylation sites will be made publicly available and vector constructs and transgenic plants useful to the research community will be distributed via the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. BRs are now firmly established as essential regulators of plant growth and development affecting a broad spectrum of developmental processes. The identification of BR biosynthetic and insensitive mutants in tomato, rice, barley and pea, clearly extends the importance of these compounds from the experimental plant Arabidopsis thaliana to crop plants and recent field experiments have shown slight alterations in rice BRI1 expression can alter rice yields by up to 30%. Understanding the molecular details of BR signal transduction can thus have practical application in regulating the growth of agricultural plants."

Research will be conducted in Argentina and Paraguay in collaboration with the National University of Rosario in Argentina under the auspices of Dr. Darien Prado.  This study will provide key information on the distinctive morphology, ecology, and biogeography of Sesbania and a framework for comparison to related legumes.  Specific research goals include a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of Sesbania based on morphological data and molecular markers, testing of dispersal history and key morphological innovations, and the production of a monograph.  Outcomes produced from this comprehensive analysis of Sesbania will provide novel datasets for testing current hypotheses of the evolutionary history and biogeography of Sesbania and its nearest relatives.    This study provides the opportunity to expand collaborative ties with botanical institutions in northern Argentina and Paraguay, a geographic region with high legume diversity.

This research will focus on the symbiosis between Caribbean octocorals and zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium sp.) and will determine how changing environmental parameters may affect octocoral-zooxanthella symbioses.  The genetic identity of the zooxanthellae and the physiology of octocoral species and their zooxanthellae will be determined.  In addition, the effects of changing environmental parameters such as seawater temperatures, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and increased ocean acidification on the physiology of octocoral-zooxanthella symbioses will be determined.  These data are crucial to understanding and predicting the survival of octocorals and of Caribbean coral reefs.     Symbiosis in the classroom will be taught using student created interviews of people in their community and responses will be gathered using personal response systems ( clickers ).  This approach, termed 'you and symbiosis,' will be taught at the undergraduate level then modified for K-12.  Examples of topics include: the legume Kudzu; humans and their gut flora; and West Nile virus.  A laboratory course will provide students experience with molecular and physiological techniques applied to research of symbioses.       By merging research and innovative teaching techniques to show students and the public the applicability of symbioses to their lives, individuals may develop greater personal interest in coral reef ecosystems."

Two major groups of rhizobia, 1) alpha-proteobacteria, i.e. the family Rhizobiaceae (alpha-rhizobia), and 2) certain beta-proteobacteria, Burkholderia and Cupriavidus (beta-rhizobia), inhabit legume root nodules, converting inert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which is assimilated by plants into proteins and nucleic acids.  Surprisingly, little is known about the interactions with beta-rhizobia, especially for the Caesalpinioid legumes, the most basal of the three sub-classes of the legume family.  Although more than 80% of Mimosoid and Papilionoid legumes nodulate, less than 30% of the Caesalpinioid species form nodules.  Thus, they represent a transition from non-nodulating to nodulating legumes and can help tease out the evolutionary origins of nodule formation.  This project will investigate two Caesalpinioid legumes: 1) Gleditsia triacanthos, in which bacteria enter roots and fix nitrogen without nodule formation, a mutualism that probably predates the evolution of nodules, and 2) Chamaecrista fasciculata, one of the few caesalpinioid legumes that nodulates.  Experiments will be carried out to determine how the bacteria establish these associations with basal legumes and identify orthologs of genes known to be critical for nodule formation in the advanced legumes.  After identifying the gene orthologs, they will be mutated to test their function.  A hairy root transformation system for implementing RNAi mutagenesis has been established with the help of an undergraduate student, and is a major advance for studying gene function in basal legumes.  The project will provide other opportunities for student training.  Caesalpinioid legumes comprise the major flora of the subtropics and tropics, serving as important food/forestry crops and replenishing nitrogen to N-limited soils.  Studying these basal legumes will bring us closer not only to learning more about the genes responsible for nodulation, but also to educating students about the value of basal plants to the nitrogen economy of subtropical and tropical soils; these are threatened because of increasing human populations and climate change.  Soil degradation could lead to the extinction of these environmentally important legumes."

The PIs collaboration will also involve a number of French scientists working with Dr. Aouani.  They plan to discuss the Genomics of Salinity Adaptation in the Medicago truncatula-Sinorhizobium symbiosis.   They will participate in extensive discussions and tour the Tunisian lab, greenhouse facilities, and field sites. Dr. Aouani's team will contribute biological material, perform genetic characterization and greenhouse trials, and participate in field experiments during the course of the proposed project.Intellectual merit: Although Darwin emphasized the importance of ecological interactions for evolutionary diversification, we have only recently acquired the molecular tools that allow us to understand how adaptive variation evolves in response to environmental challenges and ecological interactions. The project will focus on an ecographically diverse Tunisian collection of Medicago truncatula (Mtr) and their nitrogen-fixing symbionts Sinorhizobium meliloti (Sm). The primary research goal is to identify networks of genes in the Mtr and Sm genomes that are involved in adaptation and coadaptation in response to high-salinity conditions. Genotypes from six focal populations, three from highly saline sites, will be tested under high vs. low salinity and in factorial combinations with rhizobial strains from high and low salinity sites, to document the roles of Mtr genotype, Sm genotype, and their interaction on performance under contrasting salinity regimes. Concurrent metabolome and transcriptome profiles will identify networks of genes associated with salinity tolerance and fitness tradeoffs between experimental treatments. Broader impacts: Increasing soil salinity is a major agricultural problem that will only becomemore urgent with continued irrigation. A long-term goal of this project is to facilitate thedevelopment of legume crops suited to saline environments, by identifying genetic pathways involved in salinity tolerance, and determining how these pathways influence the relationship of the host plant with its nitrogen-fixing symbiont.  Because disparate regions of the world face similar environmental challenges, cross-cultural exchanges of knowledge and training are essential for science-based problem solving. The project will involve support for a U.S. post-doctoral scientist and a U.S. graduate student to participate in the visits."

In addition to samplingconducted by the project, we will leverage pre-existing sampling programs such as theUC-Davis Mid-Lake Tahoe Profile (MLTP), which collects depth profiles from the lakeevery 30 days. A proposal will be submitted in December to the NSF HydrologicSciences to interpret the data resulting from the SGER.Scientific meritLittle is known regarding black carbon colloids, produced by incompletecombustion, in aquatic systems. However these nano-particles are now believed to bean important component of the global carbon cycle, the hydrologic cycle, globalwarming, accelerated snow pack and glacier melt, fresh water and marine chemistry andsediment geochemistry. Recent studies of BC in seawater and marine sedimentssuggest that BC may have a very long residence time in the ocean and fresh waterbodies. These particles may also determine the partitioning of many toxic organiccompounds in aquatic ecosystems. To our knowledge there have been no studies of BCcolloids in a lake system following a major fire in its basin.Objectives. Collect and analyze BC in water samples from Lake Tahoe and Fallen Leaf Lakeover a two year period after the Angora Fire.Broader impactsThe project represents a rare opportunity to study the impact of a fire on BCcolloids and determine how these colloids impact the aquatic environment. The results ofthe project may have wide ranging impacts on the global Earth Science Community aswell as the Lake Tahoe community. For example, if the study can establish theresidence time of BC in the lake, we will be able to determine the impact of BC on thelakes optical properties and chemistry over time. The results from the study may then beapplied to other lakes and rivers. The data will be used by Federal and Statepolicymakers and local planners to evaluate and implement environmental policy in theLake Tahoe area. The project will communicate the results to the Lake Tahoestakeholders and scientific community through journal publications and public meetings."

Himmelgreen, Dr. Nancy Romero Daza, and Ms. Noemi Danao, along with graduate students from the University of South Florida and staff from the Monteverde Institute, will undertake research on the impact that the ongoing transition from farming to tourism is having on the food habits and nutritional health of rural Costa Rican households.  As part of the new global economy, tourism provides for new economic opportunities and the development of infrastructure and services.  Yet with a de-emphasis on local food production, there is an increased reliance on imported foods which are more expensive and include processed energy-dense foods that are high in fat and refined sugar.  The primary research question is whether food consumption and nutritional health vary depending on the degree to which rural households rely on tourism for income.  The research will take place in two communities in the Monteverde region, where dairy farming and coffee farming are  being replaced by eco-tourism.  Two hundred households will be included. A quantitative and qualitative study will be conducted to examine the ways in which households combine economic strategies and  the impact that such activities have on dietary behaviors and nutritional health.  Additionally, a market assessment and interviews with food suppliers will be done to examine the seasonal availability and cost of fresh produce and staple foods such as rice, beans, and dairy products).  Researchers will employ surveys, focus groups, in-depth interviews, measures of food security, food frequency questionnaires, and physiological measures of nutritional health using anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance analysis.This study contributes an anthropological perspective in which the bio-cultural dimensions of health are examined.  Using mixed methods, it will identify the biological consequences that globalization has on rural populations. The research will contribute understanding how social and cultural processes shape food-related behaviors. The research also will provide training opportunities for graduate students."

In animals, loss of control of cell division leads to cancer.  In some cell types, a modified cell cycle occurs during differentiation in which the DNA is replicated without concomitant cell division, resulting in an increase in nuclear DNA content.  This process is called endoreplication; in plants, important examples of endoreplicated cell types include cereal endosperm, cotton fibers, and nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodules in legumes.  The coordination of this modified cell cycle with cell differentiation remains poorly understood.  Previous work using Arabidopsis leaf hairs (trichomes) as a model for cell differentiation demonstrated that the SIAMESE (SIM) gene encodes a cell cycle regulator necessary for the suppression of mitosis during establishment of endoreplication in trichomes.  The goal of the proposed work is to test a proposed mechanism for the establishment of endoreplication.  The proposed work is expected to shed light on the establishment of the endocycle, and on the integration of the cell cycle with development.  The proposed role for SIM focuses on a stage of the cell cycle that is not well-understood in any organism; thus the proposed work may also shed light on the mitotic  cycle in both plants and animals.  Additionally, the proposed work will play a role in the education of graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students from a wide diversity of backgrounds."

This has led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to classify ricin as a level B biothreat.  Indeed, evidence has been found suggesting that terrorist groups have attempted to develop it as a weapon, and there have been instances of domestic attacks.      The investigators have developed a non-toxic ricin vaccine, RiVax, from the A-chain subunit of ricin, by introducing two site-specific mutations that eliminate both its ribotoxic and vascular leak syndrome-inducing activities.  Once preclinical testing demonstrated that this vaccine, as a frozen sucrose/Tween formulation, was safe and immunogenic in mice and rabbits, the investigators conducted a Phase 1 study in 15 human volunteers and showed that it was safe and able to elicit ricin neutralizing immune responses.  In order to improve the efficacy of this vaccine, by increasing the degree and duration of the response, the investigators have developed an aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel) formulation and have shown that it greatly improves immunogenicity in mice.  The investigators now propose to conduct a dose-escalating Phase 1 trial, involving 3 groups of 10 healthy volunteers to determine if this new formulation is safe in humans and increases and prolongs the response.  Doses of 1, 10 and 100 micrograms - each with 0.5 mg Alhydrogel, will be given at weeks 0, 6, and 26 and serum will be assessed for anti-vaccine and neutralizing titers."

Additionally, concerns over environmental quality in many areas of the country warrant a shift to more resource-efficient farming practices. Forage legumes have the potential to improve on-farm nutrient cycling, nutrient management, soil health, and enhance pasture nutritive value. Moreover, introducing legumes may result in decreased soil erosion due to utilization of improved grazing methods required to enhance the persistence of legumes. Rotational grazing, for example, reduces soil-erosive potential and provides more uniform distribution of nutrients through animal excretion. Despite obvious advantages of systems containing forage-legume components, research questions for introducing legumes are as follows: (1) What are cost-effective establishment methods for selected annual and perennial legume species (2) What is the long-term persistence of perennial and annual legume species (3) Is the inclusion of annual and perennial legumes into grazing systems cost-effective and environmentally sustainable in the light of current synthetic N fertilizer prices and other external farm inputs We seek to answer these questions simultaneously by initiating three separate studies on these subjects and will also incorporate an outreach component. While these projects will be conducted independently from each other, they complement each other by providing key information to stakeholders."

Recent losses have become so large (individual growers have reached $2 million) that the economic viability of the vegetable industries in many states is at risk and a larger, coordinated multi-state research effort is needed. Researchers in Michigan and California will collaborate with industry partners to achieve these goals through a multi-disciplinary effort. Sub-objectives include developing fast method to detect and quantify pathogens in plant, soil, and irrigation water using PCR-based technology, developing novel production strategies (appropriate cover/rotational crops, biofumigants), identifying cultivars with genetic tolerance or growth habits that reduce disease, and optimizing the efficacy of fungicidal products (identifying effective active ingredients, optimal application, timing).

In Wisconsin we have developed the foundation for biointensive IPM education. We are now proposing to develop specific educational tools which will enable growers to integrate biointensive IPM strategies into existing production systems. Wisconsin fruit and vegetable growers are particularly vulnerable to FQPA since risk calculations are higher for crops that are consumed directly rather than as processed products. The processing sector has undergone rapid consolidation in the past decade, leaving only two locally-owned processors in the state. Other than on-farm processing, apple growers have no processing options. Also, given the small acreage of fruit and vegetable crops as compared to grains or pasture in Wisconsin, they represent a small market and hence there is little incentive for agrochemical companies to pursue registration of pesticide alternatives, which requires costly risk assessment studies. . The overall momentum of the eco-potato and eco-fruit projects has been extremely strong as many things have been accomplished such as the continuation of the marketing effort, enhancements of the Collaboration standards, improvements of resistance management protocols, database implementation, grant coordination and expansion of the use and development of educational tools for growers. We have worked with numerous faculty, industry representatives, potato and other commodity organizations, and environmental organizations to export the agricultural model for targeted and industry-wide change. In Wisconsin, this work is expanding to other vegetable crops, such as carrots, peppers, beans and peas. Furthermore, we have enhanced the ecological portions of the Collaboration by working with national and local environmental organizations and expanding our research with University of Wisconsin faculty by involving their expertise, research and education into the project. We need to maintain this strength while exporting the model of industry-wide agricultural changes through the use of policy and communication efforts. The University of Wisconsin is an appropriate site for this project because of the proven capacity to complete this project; the talent of its faculty, staff and students; its long history of commitment to outreach; and the vulnerability of Wisconsin growers to further restrictions on pesticide use. The UW is able to play a unique coordinating role between state and federal agencies, non-profit organizations, and private businesses to attain the project objectives."

The general public is becoming increasingly concerned about pesticide residues in food, toxic effects of chemicals on non-target organisms, and environmental contamination. Developing and evaluating alternative practices that are ecologically sound, economically feasible, and acceptable to growers will be a high priority. This project will achieve these goals by: 1) developing and evaluating microbial pest control agents and botanical products for control of insect pests and plant pathogens on vegetable and specialty crops, such as collard, cucumber, squash, and edamame edible soybean; 2) developing integrated pest management practices for leafy greens in South Carolina that reduce losses to bacterial diseases, and 3) evaluating cucurbit rootstocks for resistance or immunity to Fusarium wilt and for use in seedless watermelon production. These objectives will be achieved through carefully planned research projects carried out at Clemson University's Coastal Research and Education Center in Charleston, SC, at the Calhoun Field Laboratory organic farm in Clemson, SC, and in grower fields throughout the state. Scientists at Clemson University already have identified many insect viruses and botanical materials for testing against pests. Data will be analyzed with appropriate statistical techniques, and results will be published in refereed journals and communicated to Extension agents and growers. All approaches emphasize conservation of indigenous biological control agents and sustainable agriculture. This project will immediately focus on research and technology transfer for developing sound pest management options."

The ability of Hawaii growers to produce a consistant supply of high quality vanilla will help to stabilize the market. Vanilla production holds high potential since a fairly large amount of vanilla can be produced in a relatively small area, characteristic of Hawaii's agriculture. This makes this an ideal project for displaced sugar cane workers and others interested in growing a small crop or agrotourism crop.

Michigan is the number 1 producer of pickling cucumber and squash and ranks among the top 10 in the USA for the production of fresh market cucumber, snap bean, bell pepper, pumpkin and fresh market tomato. Michigan cultivates nearly 83,000 acres of Phytophthora-susceptible vegetables worth $148 million and 7,600 acres of Fraser fir worth $10.6 million. Phytophthora can be easily spread across and within agricultural regions via water. Phytophthora management is complicated by its large host range and lack of known disease resistance in vegetables. Phytophthora can last for 10 or more years in soil and it is common for growers to experience complete crop loss in some fields. Some strains of Phytophthora have mutated to become resistant to key fungicides and have colonized an estimated 25% of the acreage in the Michigan growing region. Disease outbreaks occur yearly and recent losses have become so large (up to $32.5 million) that the economic viability of these Michigan industries is at risk. This project seeks to reduce losses suffered by Michigan growers and stakeholders by developing integrated management strategies that emphasize cultural methods and environmentally friendly practices. Research will include investigating ways to limit the spread of Phytophthora; identifying and developing cultivars that are resistant to Phytophthora disease; investigating soil amendments, mulches, crop rotation and water management as new techniques for managing Phytophthora; and testing fungicides, biological control agents and new chemistries for disease control. Phytophthora management recommendations for growers will be developed from research results and demonstrated in on-farm trials and presented at extension meetings."

Vegetables are important food and cash crops in Georgia with 34 different vegetable crops produced in the state and a farm gate value of more than $828 million in 2006. Georgia leads the nation in production of fresh-market cucumbers, squash, and watermelon, and is among the top four states in production of bell pepper, cantaloupes, and snap beans. Phytophthora blight, caused by Phytophthora capsici, has become a devastating disease in recent years in the production of watermelon, bell pepper, squash, cucumber, and several other vegetable crops in Georgia. The efficacy of current strategies for management of Phytophthora blight is limited. No conventional measure has shown to provide consistent and effective suppression of the disease when environmental conditions favor the development of the disease. While fungicides containing the active ingredient mefenoxam provide some level of control of P. capsici, the efficacy is impaired by the presence of mefenoxam-resistant strains of the pathogen. Due to the destructive nature of the disease and lack of efficient control measures, growers are often forced to abandon production of certain vegetable crops once the field is severely infested. Development of alternative or complementary approaches for effective management of the disease is highly desirable. This project is to evaluate new and/or alternative disease management approaches and integrate the most promising ones for more effective management of Phytophthora blight on vegetables. The objectives of this proposal are: (1) To evaluate the efficacy and application method of new and promising chemical and biological fungicides for control of Phytophthora blight. (2) To screen Brassica spp. and other cover crops that produce general biocides for control of Phytophthora capsici. (3) To evaluate the efficacy of systemic acquired plant resistance (SAR) in control of Phytophthora blight on vegetables. (4) To determine host range, genetic diversity, and survival of P. capsici in Georgia. (5) To develop and implement best management strategies integrating cover crops, chemical and biological control agents, SAR inducers, and resistant or tolerant genotypes in management of the disease. Successful completion of this project will permit the development of environmentally sound strategies which would, significantly reduce losses resulted from Phytophthora capsici in vegetable production; maintain safe food supply; and increase the sustainability of the vegetable industries in Georgia and the U.S."

For decades, unpredictable episodic outbreaks of aphids and the diseases caused by viruses they vector have severely reduced yields of pea and lentil crops in this region. Adapted dry pea and lentil varieties lack resistance to the two most prevalent viruses, Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) and Bean leaf roll virus (BLRV), each vectored by the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Growers, therefore, typically either prophylactically apply the organophosphate insecticide dimethoate to suppress aphids even when the realized risk of virus infection is low, or they avoid spraying and instead leave the crop open to catastrophic loss when infection risk is high. We address this problem with three integrated research and extension outreach components. The first develops IPM decision tools for producers. These include deriving a virus risk assessment system for pea and lentil based on monitoring immigrating aphids for virus (using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction based detection of viral RNA) and incorporating meteorological data to predict the intensity and timing of aphid flight activity. This first component also develops economic injury levels for direct aphid injury as well as indirect injury caused by the aphid-vectored viruses, and tests alternatives to dimethoate for reduction of indirect injury when indicated. The second component accelerates ongoing efforts to breed resistance to BLRV and PEMV in adapted pea and lentil varieties. These varieties will reduce the need to treat aphids for one or both viruses. The third component educates producers about the IPM tools developed and engages these producers in project activities and product development. The principal investigators include virologists, breeders, entomologists and extension educators from two universities in Idaho and Washington and the USDA-ARS. Results and IPM recommendations will be disseminated via the world wide web, grower newsletters and listserves and workshops. The virus management decision support system will be maintained with industry funds under the guidance of the PD after the project's completion. The project addresses issues covered in the Pest Management Strategic Plan for Pulse Crops. The project also directly addresses RAMP program goals to enhance the development and implementation of innovative IPM strategies for multi-crop food and fiber production systems on an area-wide or landscape scale."

With only 1,664,934 hectares of total land area, an overwhelming 47.99% and 46.94% of this area is managed for conservation and agriculture, respectively. Agriculture shares many boundaries with natural areas, having very little buffer within this confined island setting. From the time when humans first colonized these islands; many ecosystem changes have resulted from anthropogenic activities and exotic weed introductions often associated with agriculture. Despite these influences, native and contemporary civilizations view nature conservation and agriculture as congruent sustainable activities in land management. This project operates with the mission of ensuring coexistence between these two land uses. While many research initiatives appropriately strive for long-range goals and future technologies, this project will address a wide range of contemporary situations with applied research and extension for developing readily adoptable and cost-effective outputs in weed management. In the first objective, rapid-response strategies will be developed for suppressing exotic pasture grasses that occupy abandoned pastures being transitioned back to native forest ecosystems. In the second objective, native plant species utilized in conservation will be evaluated for potential utility as cover crops in agriculture. Finally, the third objective is an integrated multi-discipline project to promote and demonstrate an integrated pest management system that stabilizes agriculture production areas to become more resilient to pest invasions. While this system will not be demonstrated with native species, it will utilize a scientifically-characterized legume sunn hemp (Crotolaria juncea), which is not considered to be an invasive weed in the Hawaii Weed Risk Assessment protocol. The outcomes of this project will create opportunities to increase diligence in land management styles that will nullify current extreme detriments resulting from invasive weeds and future conflicts between conservation and agriculture."

Higher N-fixation should translate into higher yields in the organic system. Correlation between nitrogen fixation ability to other plant characteristics will provide clues to characteristics important for modern varieties. Varieties developed with higher nitrogen fixation will be beneficial to all growers and may reduce the need or amount of fertilizer applications in all systems. Although common beans are not recognized as major nitrogen fixers when compared to other long-season legumes, they do have the ability to fix a large proportion of their nitrogen needs from the atmosphere. The variability in modern commercial varieties could be assessed and utilized in breeding programs to generate genotypes with greater ability to fix nitrogen. Sugar beet is a management intensive crop. This proposal seeks to investigate sugar beet production systems that utilize reduced tillage strategies and cover crops to improve stand establishment, weed management, and sugar beet yield and quality in glyphosate-resistant sugar beet. This proposal will also use genetics and molecular markers to study specific traits for breeding optimal quality beets and the introgression of traits of new sources of sugar beet cyst nematode resistance. Quality has specific meaning in the sugar beet industry, that of reducing sucrose loss during processing and recovery. Impurities such as Na, K, and amino acids impair sucrose recovery from molasses, sometimes by 25% or more. Reducing impurities, hence increasing sucrose yield, is the goal of the proposed quality contract for sugar payments to growers."

Previously demonstrated, in the United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) Tribal Colleges Grant (On the fringe of survival: How the wild environment gives native berries the edge for protection of Tribal people's health), wild berries conferred significant phytomedicinal benefits to Native Americans. These wild native berry species (chokecherry, buffaloberry, juneberry, and cranberrybush), demonstrated significant capacity to counteract the symptoms associated with Type II diabetes and the broader pathological condition known as metabolic syndrome (Kraft et al. 2008). The above-noted publication, revealed particularly-potent hyperglycemic properties from the cranberrybush extracts, and a subsequent, in-depth set of experiments on this berry species is now underway (Kraft et al., in preparation). This new proposal assesses potential mechanisms of bioactive activity of traditional medicinal plants, indigenous to the Upper Missouri River region, their novel benefits for human health. This project will recruit youth to acquire hands-on, experiential science training using native plant materials, and forge linkages between Tribal elders and the younger generations leading to enhanced preservation, appreciation, and knowledge validation for native resources. c) expected results Outcomes from this project, in terms of scientific results and social interaction,from the first stages of youth and elder collaboration to initiate the project and streamline the selected list of target plants. Based on our recent past investigations on native endemic species in the Upper Missouri River region, we have strong confidence that the experiments will yield previously undocumented, insights into the bioactive mechanisms and health value of these plant resources."

The first objective is to develop detection methods for residues of two commonly allergenic foods - buckwheat and pistachio. This group has previously develop detection methods for peanut, milk, egg, other tree nuts, soybeans, shrimp, clam, mustard, and lupine so these two additional methods help to complete the set needed by the food industry. The industry can uses to determine if its cleaning practices are sufficient or whether the use of shared equipment presents potential hazards to allergic consumers. The new buckwheat and pistachio assays will give food processors sensitive and specific techniques to detect inadvertent contamination of their raw materials and finished products with residues of either of these allergenic foods. Ultimately, the antibodies used in the pistachio detection method may be useful in the development of a multi-plex tree nut ELISA as we already have antibodies for walnut, almond, hazelnut, pecan, and cashew (but Brazil nut, macadamia nut, and pine nut are also missing). The second objective relates to the refinement of methods for the assessment of the potential allergenicity of genetically modified or other novel foods. These methods are needed to assess the potential risk and prevent the unintended introduction of a major allergen or protein that would likely cause allergic cross-reactions in some consumers. Bioinformatics approaches (computer assisted sequence comparison analysis) have been developed as one of the most important tools to identify potentially allergenic proteins. AllergenOnline is a public database created through the efforts of the Food Allergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP) at the University of Nebraska. The database provides a publicly available, searchable list of protein sequences of known allergens and bioinformatics strategies useful in comparing these sequences to those of novel proteins. FARRP will continue to screen the literature to identify new allergens so that the list can be annually updated. This database is used by academic and government scientists developing genetically engineered and other novel foods, by regulatory officials in many countries, and by the agricultural biotechnology industry in a key step in the overall allergenicity assessment process. As part of this project, we will assess the validity of the search criteria of 35% identity over any 80 amino acid segment as a predictor of allergenicity through serum testing of legume allergic subjects, using allergic sera. IgE-binding proteins will be separated, identified, and compared to known allergens in the database."

The proposed and recently initiated research will explore areas to improve sustainability of various production systems. Some will be organic, others will be conventional production. Several cover crop studies presently underway will be continued. Trials are already underway on two farms. They will be continued through the end of 2008, the termination date for a NE SARE Partnership project that was secured to provide additional support for this work. The focus of cover crop studies will be to reduce weed pressure on cash crops in the rotation and improve soil fertility. Increasing nitrogen production from legumes in an age of increasing energy costs will be a necessity. The OFR coordinator will continue to provide guidance to a county extension educator for a dairy feeding study begun in 2007. The focus of this effort is to demonstrate that through reducing the amount of protein fed lactating dairy cows, animal performance can be maintained and possibly improved while reducing the feeding cost of milking cows. The project is being conducted on ten farms. A Pennsylvania Soybean Promotion board funded project will be continued during 2008 to evaluate when soy stand loss occurs and to learn of the benefits for using soy seed treatments. Stands in marked plots will be sequentially counted to document when loss is occurring. Should results indicate that most loss occurs prior to emergence or early establishment, most likely because of disease, this may indicate a need for increased use of seed treatments or other means to limit the impact of these pests. Supported with a NE SARE Research and Education grant, researchers from Penn State and Rodale Institute will continue a project that seeks more consistent performance for farmers who want to grow heavy cover crops and use the relatively new concept of crop rolling to control them. The OFR program is supporting this project through three on-farm sites in PA, NY, and MD. Proven and experimental practices/treatments will be utilized on these private farms to demonstrate the potential for this technology to reduce or eliminate the use of herbicide in a subsequent corn or soybean crop. The recent large increase in fertilizer prices, especially nitrogen, has prompted strong promotion of several products that are added to N fertilizer to reduce losses to volatilization and leaching. Two on-farm studies will be conducted to complement one being conducted at the experiment station to quantify relative efficiencies of N utilization when urea is treated with commercially available products. This project will likely be repeated in 2009 and 2010. Other areas of research are identified as the on-farm research coordinator continues to discuss production problems and possibilities for collaborative research with producers, county and state Cooperative Extension personnel, PASA organizers, and representatives of other agencies."

Future farming in this region under energy-constrained scenarios must focus on increasing the energetic net gain associated with N inputs. A new class of crops, the pulses (annual grain legumes), are poised to play a major role in diversifying cropping systems in the NGP, due to their inherent profit potential, and due to farmer perceptions of meaningful N contributions to their wheat crops. Area devoted to pea and lentil crops increased several fold in the NGP over the past decade and may increase further. There are two key limitations related to using pulse crops to offset N fertilizer. First, N contributions from pulse crops are difficult to estimate accurately, especially in the short term. It will be important to investigate pulse crop effects in the medium- (and long-) term to better understand their role in conditioning cropping system energy budgets, and especially with respect to changes in soil stasis in the form of embodied soil N supply. The role of pulse crops in conditioning soil organic N stasis is being hotly debated and must move toward resolution. Second, and perhaps more important, some agroecozones within the NGP do not receive sufficiently consistent rainfall to permit annual cropping, and are reliant on fallow - wheat systems. There may be an unmet opportunity to `green' fallow in a more sustainable fashion, with the use of annual legume green manures (LGM), if the balance between soil water use and N contribution can be managed to be energetically and economically favorable. However, optimal tactics for managing this water use - soil N balance are not understood. Unresolved questions relate to tactical tillage (perhaps within reduced till systems), seasonality and duration of LGM growth, and optimal LGM species. The major objective of this study is to determine the energetic and economic worth of legume crop inclusion in semiarid wheat-based cropping systems. Using an energy budget approach we will quantify the potential for offsetting a portion of N fertilizer use, with a special emphasis on using legume green manures in conventional cropping systems. Results from this effort, combined with previous work, will aid producers in adapting their cropping systems to best meet production and ecosystem service goals. Ecosystem services that will be provided are reduced greenhouse gas concentrations, improved soil quality, and improved water quality. Quantification of the `significance' of this research can be estimated with limited precision. For example, it will be possible to chronicle increases in pulse crop and LGM acreage in the NGP (and elsewhere), and not difficult to estimate associated energy savings. Although it would not be known to what degree this particular research project was responsible for enacting this change, the potential impact on agricultural sustainability is very large."

Biological control and related technologies have the potential to provide these nontoxic solutions for the control of plant pests and to increase plant growth and yield. Among the direct effects of biocontrol agents are: (a) disease control through induced resistance, (b) increased growth of roots and shoots (seed treatments may give season-long effects), (c) increased drought tolerance, (d) increased leaf greenness that probably results in greater photosynthetic rates, and (e) increased yields of a variety of crops. Similarly, rhizobacteria in the genera Pseudomonas and Bacillus have abilities to control plant diseases through multiple mechanisms, including antibiotic production and induced resistance. However, rhizobia (bacteria in the genera Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium) nodulate legumes and fix nitrogen, via complex plant-microbe interactions."

S. However, since 2000, it has been expanding range to the north and east, and now is found in corn as far east as Ohio. Although they are not economic pests in all areas of their expanded range, there is increasing interest in information about monitoring procedures, and economic injury levels for this insect. Previous research on other ear feeding insects indicates that insect injury is a contributing factor to fungal growth and mycotoxin development on the grain, however this relationship has not been examined for the western bean cutworm. There is little published information available to design statistically reliable sampling plans, or identify valid economic thresholds. In the absence of research-based recommendations for western bean cutworms, there is a potential for growers to react to an emerging pest with inappropriate use of insecticides, not based on local conditions as assessed by scouting and use of valid economic thresholds. The research outlined in this proposal is designed to provide that needed information. Results from this project will be published in referee articles, presented at professional society meetings, incorporated into our extension programs, and shared with colleagues through regional technical committees such as NCC 205 and NCERA 201 (of which Hunt and Wright, respectively, are active participants). We will consider conducting a regional teleconference workshop, similar to past workshops on soybean aphid and corn rootworms sponsored by the North Central IPM Center, if there is interest, as another way to transfer from research results from this project to end users across the region. Western bean cutworms were identified by the North Central IPM Center in their August 2006 newsletter as an `IPM issue  which has arisen since the Field Corn Pest Management Strategic Plan (Pike 2002) was published. The Regional USDA Technical committee, NCC 205: Ecology and Management of European Corn Borer and Other Lepidopteran Pests of Corn, identified in its project proposal that western bean cutworm is an increasingly important pest, and is among a group of insects not affected by many Bt corn hybrids which may be favored by the reduction in broad-spectrum insecticide usage. They identify research on insects such as these, as a priority to evaluate if `pest replacement' may occur with widespread use of Bt corn hybrids. This research project addresses all three goals of the NC IPM Competitive Grant program: improve the economic benefits related to the adoption of IPM practices; reduce potential human health risks from pests and the use of pest management practices, and reduce unreasonable adverse environmental effects from pests and use of pest management practices. It is also addresses the Research Needs identified in the National Road Map for IPM; develop economical high-resolution environmental and biological monitoring systems to enhance our capabilities to predict pest incidence, estimate damage, and identify valid action thresholds."

Dry or dry edible beans (DEB) are produced in the U.S. on 1.7 million acres by nearly 11,000 farms with estimated sales at $1.8 billion. Production occurs in fourteen states and includes fifteen different varieties of beans. However, dry bean diseases can dramatically reduce yield, quality of harvested beans and therefore, greatly affect grower profits. White mold in particular is a key pest of dry beans in Michigan. Serious losses can occur when weather conditions are favorable for disease development and disease organisms are present. Except for the driest seasons, 100% of crop acres are at risk and up to 40-50% can be affected, with yield losses as high as 50% occurring within 2 weeks late in the growing season. Under irrigated production in California and the Northwest, losses can be 100%. Intervention with chemical treatments at early flowering suppresses white mold but does not completely eradicate the disease. Generally growers are delighted to obtain 50% suppression of white mold with a single fungicide application but of course, growers also expect to have a yield increase over untreated crops. An additional spray treatment can provide extra protection but more often than not, two applications of current fungicide products for dry bean is cost prohibitive. Identifying a novel fungicide that is cost-effective for two applications would be highly advantageous; especially for use in fields with a history of disease and during periods of prolonged and/or heavy rainfall particularly at time of flowering. Moreover, nearly all labeled fungicides are listed as carcinogens or suspected carcinogens and some have high chronic toxicity. Many are either highly toxic to fish/ aquatic life (Topsin, Blocker 4F, Switch) or have issues of pathogen resistance (Rovral, Endura and Switch). Topsin-M, Rovral and Ronilan are on the California list of  Known Carcinogens and Reproductive Toxicants . Blocker 4F is listed in California as a toxic air contaminant. Due to the serious health and safety issues related to these products, re-registration under the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) could be jeopardized or severe restrictions could be implemented. Hence, growers seek safer, less costly products to effectively control white mold infestations. It is anticipated that EPA registration for most, if not all, of the experimental ingredients will likely include acute toxicity testing and minimal (if any) chronic toxicity trials on animals; i.e., teratogenic and carcinogenic studies. Use of more environmentally friendly products by growers would lower consumer risk. The discovery of alternative chemicals that protect food safety would agree with some of the goals for sustainable agriculture and protect quality of life. Pesticides obtained from renewables and not derived from petrochemicals would also be in the public interest."

Major natural resource problems include drought, over-used rangeland, farmland highly susceptible to erosion, weeds, difficulty in grass and forb establishment, low fertility on farmland seeded to forages, and low forage quality from late summer through winter.  The challenge is to develop economic, energy-efficient grazing systems for the area while maintaining or improving the plant, soil, water, wildlife, and aesthetic resources.  The overall approach is to gather information on forage production and quality, and cattle gain on native rangelands, perennial forages growing in marginal farmlands, and annual farmed forages as affected by management, climate, and soils.  The information will be used to develop and test forage and grazing management strategies for red meat production systems."

Candidate markers will be clustered into a linkage group map.  Molecular markers will be developed that discriminate unambiguously between Race 1 and Race 2 of Aphanomyces euteiches that cause root rot in alfalfa.  Markers specific to each race will be converted into SCAR markers and will then be evaluated for their robustness using a test profile of DNA samples extracted from known race 1 and race 2 isolates of A. euteiches.  All candidate markers will be screened across a collection of other isolates A. euteiches collected from other states in the U.S.  The assay will be validated on total DNA extracts from alfalfa tissue infected with each race of the pathogen. If a SCAR marker is successfully developed early in the research plan, collaboration will be sought with industry or university breeding programs to identify sources of tolerance and eventually DNA markers linked to tolerance to this pathogen.  Sources of resistance will be identified in common bean germplasm with resistance to Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV).   Included in the screening assays will be four sets of bean germplasm: one set representative of each of 12 host groups used in the identification of strains of Bean common mosaic virus and Bean common mosaic necrosis virus; a second set of differential cultivars for identification of Bean yellow mosaic virus strains obtained from the Plant Introduction Station, Pullman, WA.; the third group will consist of reported sources of resistance to ClYVV which include US1140, UI-31, and Jolanda; and lastly, cultivars and breeding lines will be screened to identify sources of resistance already deployed in a snap bean background because this market class is currently at the greatest risk from this disease.

Over the next five years we will focus on the following objectives as determined by stakeholder input and ARS National Program 215 (Rangeland, Pastures and Forages) approval.Objective 1. Improve persistence, productivity, and quality of forage grasses and legumes for use in the transition zone of the Eastern and Midwestern U.S.Subobjective 1.A. Determine relative interactions between tall fescue (TF) and endophytes involved in regulating plant growth, forage quality, and persistence under a variety of environmental conditions.Subobjective 1.B. Identify, characterize, and manipulate useful traits (chemical, physical, genetic) to develop forages that are: biologically diverse, tolerant of biotic and abiotic stresses, competitive, high quality for animal production, persistent, and easy to establish and maintain.Objective 2. Improve animal and forage productivity on forage-based systems through optimal combinations of forages, supplementation and grazing systems tailored to animal needs and environmental conditions.Subobjective 2.A. Evaluate forage production characteristics relevant to plant and animal performance on pastures containing new novel endophyte-infected (EI) TFs.Subobjective 2.B. Develop a forage system for the upper transition zone that utilizes warm season perennial grasses to improve animal performance and profitability.Subobjective 2.C. Identify the abiotic/biotic components and mechanisms of the plant-animal-environment interface impacting pasture production and environmental quality factors.Approach:Forage systems provide low-cost feed, conserve soil and water resources, and mitigate manÆs impact on the environment. Limited basic biological information exists on how plant and/or fungal metabolites affect forage plant quality, persistence, and production. Even less information exists on the cross-talk mechanism between tall fescue (the predominant forage of the transition zone) and its endophyte. Furthermore, little is known about the impact that forage and/or fungal metabolites have on their pasture ecosystems. Gaps in our current knowledge are hindering researchersÆ abilities to predict and select best combinations of forages and management systems for use by various forage-animal production enterprises. Aiding researchers to develop new forage varieties, forage systems, and management recommendations will require an improved understanding of both metabolite (plant and fungal) profiles and their biological functions at the molecular and organismal levels. Such understanding of metabolites, molecular mechanisms, and whole-organism responses, and of their impact on plant quality, persistence, and production, is necessary for improving sustainability of forage-based enterprises. This Project Plan, through the development and utilization of cutting-edge technologies and real-world testing, proposes to decipher the complex interactions within the animal-plant-environment interface. In order to accomplish this task and improve sustainability of forage-based enterprises, the following two objectives are proposed: 1) Improve persistence, productivity, and quality of forage grasses and legumes for use in the transition zone of the Eastern and Midwestern United States; and 2) Improve animal and forage productivity on forage-based systems through optimal combinations of forages, supplementation, and grazing systems tailored to animal needs and environmental conditions. These objectives are focused on the predominant forage of the transition zone, tall fescue, as well as on its alternatives and companion species. Accomplishing these objectives will improve sustainability of forage-based enterprises through improved forages, forage management and systems, and basic understanding of the plant/fungal metabolite effects on forage plant persistence and production, as well as consequent effects on the structure and function of pasture ecosystems."

Develop open-pollinated advanced breeding lines of sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum) and Habanero-type peppers (C. chinense) highly resistant to root-knot nematodes.  Develop Habanero-type F1 hybrid pepper cultivars which are tolerant to heat stress and highly resistant to Tomato spotted wilt virus, Pepper mottle virus, and root-knot nematodes.Approach:The southernpea pinkeye-type cultivar GreenPack-DG and the high-yielding blackeye bean cultivar California Blackeye No. 46 will be used as the parental lines to initiate a plant breeding project with the major goal of breaking the apparent yield barrier in pinkeye-type southernpeas; the two cultivars will be crossed and pedigree and single-seed-descent breeding procedures will be employed to quickly advance progeny populations three generations per year (spring field cycle, fall field cycle, and a winter greenhouse cycle).   Efforts to identify sources of resistance to Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) in southernpea will involve the development of an efficient and effective methodology for evaluating germplasm and then the progressive evaluation of all available sources of resistance to other cowpea viruses, a collection of named southernpea and blackeye bean cultivars, and the 720 accession core of the USDA cowpea germplasm collection.  If a source of TSWV resistance is identified, the methods of classical genetics will be employed to determine the genetic control of that resistance.  A backcross breeding procedure will be used to incorporate a dominant root-knot nematode resistance gene into several non-bell, open-pollinated, sweet-type peppers; a similar approach will be used to incorporate a dominant resistance gene into open-pollinated Habanero-type peppers.  An effort will be initiated to develop a series of candidate F1 hybrid Habanero-type cultivars that are resistant to root-knot nematodes and the major viral diseases and tolerant to heat stress.  The USDA-developed, open-pollinated, Habanero-type cultivar TigerPaw-NR will be crossed with open-pollinated Habanero-type accessions from the Texas A&M University; TigerPaw-NR is a well adapted, high yielding cultivar that is homozygous for a dominant gene conditioning resistance to root-knot nematodes and the Texas accessions are homozygous for dominant genes conditioning resistance to Tomato spotted wilt and Pepper mottle viruses, compact plant habit, and the ability to set fruit during periods of high temperatures."

Evaluate Medicago truncatula and Medicago lines and accessions for disease resistance in order to identify molecular markers associated with resistance.  Determine host specificities of closely related pathogenic Stemphylium strains to M. sativa and M. truncatula lines relative to their host of origin.Approach:A species and strain phylogeny for fungi causing diseases of alfalfa, specifically Stemphylim and Pleospora, will be developed based on strains from diverse hosts based sequences of multiple loci.  The molecular phylogenies will be integrated with data that distinguish morphological characters to enable the production of keys to species.  New and existing strains or pathotypes from alfalfa or its associated rotation crops and weed hosts will be characterized and integrated into updated phylogenetic frameworks.  Once the molecular and morphological descriptions of new collections are complete, keys to groups of species will be prepared that can be used for the identification of species of Stemphylum and Pleospora.  Closely related strains identified as single species groups will be analyzed for further molecular diversity using two approaches: DNA fingerprinting (AFLP), and a new multi-gene approach which will type specific sequences from multiple loci (MLST).  Research will be developed to utilize resistant and susceptible M. truncatula lines models for functional genomic studies including research to map and identify resistance genes, determine mechanisms of defense, and investigate host-pathogen relationships.   Cultivar selection will be based on the presence and range of highly desirable agronomic traits, including fall dormancy, genetic diversity, winter hardiness, yield, and a variety of growth habits.  To determine the vulnerability of alfalfa to Stemphylium strains and species that cause disease in other crops, pathogens of alfalfa will be evaluated for virulence on M. sativa and M. truncatula cultivars selected for high and low susceptibility to leaf spot disease."

Subobjective 2B: Investigate effects of environmental factors on edible legume host-pathogen relationships and pathogen biology.Approach:Diseases and abiotic stresses (drought, low soil fertility) affecting edible legumes, such as beans, chickpeas, lentils, and peas, result in costly losses to farmers exceeding $100 million annually. Management of soilborne diseases is extremely challenging, because the same pathogens can affect several legumes grown in the same rotation, and the pathogens persist in the soil over many years.  Resistant cultivars provide growers with a cost-effective, safe and environmentally friendly way to control most disease and abiotic stress problems.  Breeding for resistance, however, is difficult due to the paucity of resistance sources, specifically for soilborne diseases, and lack of information concerning inheritance.  Improved management of problematic soilborne diseases is predicated upon a better understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of each pathogen. The objectives of this research are to integrate marker-assisted (MAS) selection with traditional breeding approaches to develop bean germplasm with enhanced levels of disease and abiotic stress resistance, and to improve disease management practices for several soilborne diseases of edible legumes.  Novel disease and abiotic stress resistance genes/QTL will be identified, characterized across environments, validated in different genetic backgrounds, and molecular markers with application for MAS of such resistance will be developed and used to breed edible legume germplasm with enhanced resistance.  A basis for the improvement of sustainable disease management strategies will be formed through the integration of genetic resistance, chemical and cultural tactics, and improved understanding of the epidemiology and population biology of several economically important pathogens of edible legumes."

The focus of the research will be on switchgrass for bioenergy and other warm- and cool-season grasses for grazing lands. Over the next five years, the following specific objectives will be addressed: (1)  Provide appropriate plant materials for use in pasture-based livestock systems; (2) Improve the economic viability of forage-livestock systems for the Great Plains and North Central States with improved plant materials and management; (3) Provide improved plant materials for harvested biomass used for bioenergy,  bioproducts, and forage; and (4) Develop sustainable production systems for harvested biomass and forage. Approach:Improved perennial grass cultivars that are adapted to the Central Great Plains and Midwest states that can be used as biomass energy crops or in grazed grasslands will be developed using conventional and molecular breeding technologies.  To fully utilize the genetic potential of the improved cultivars, improved management tools and practices will be developed with emphasis on improving establishment success, forage and biomass yield and quality, utilization by livestock, and all aspects of biomass energy crop production. This project is a continuation of a long-term perennial grass breeding and management program that has plant materials and management practices and tools in various stages of development. In this five-year period, focus will be on development of switchgrass cultivars for use in biomass crop production systems, developing cool- and warm-season grass cultivars for use in grazing systems, and native legume germplasm for potential future use in agriculture using conventional and molecular tools.  Management research will focus on improved establishment technology for perennial grasses, enhanced methods for evaluating and renovating degraded grasslands, and improved management practices for switchgrass grown as a biomass energy crop including harvest management.

The purpose is to develop low-input forage production techniques that are appropriate for resource-poor producers, and that will increase livestock carrying-capacity, improve early- and late-season forage production and reduce or eliminate expenditures for off-farm feed supplies. This purpose will be met by evaluating combinations of forages grown in mixtures or sequences, and by developing low-input management methods that will enable their use as a productive and persistent complement to, or replacement for, unimproved or degraded pasture. Specifically, we will focus on the following objectives:Objective 1.  Identify appropriate forage species and develop low-input techniques for increasing forage production and extending the grazing season on degraded or unimproved pastures to increase year-round availability of homegrown forage and provide economically and environmentally sustainable forage production systems for under-served, resource-limited livestock producers.Sub-objective 1A. Assess the productivity and persistence of non-traditional warm- and cool-season grass and legume mixtures for utilization under grazing.Sub-objective 1B.  Identify the most effective low-input establishment techniques (no-till drilling, broadcasting or self-seeding) for cool- and warm-season grass and legume forages established in mixtures with existing, unimproved pastures of native species or bermudagrass.Objective 2.  Determine the cause(s) of poor establishment of cool-season grasses and legumes following self-seeding or over seeding into established pastures, such as loss of seed quality, hydration/dehydration cycles, temperature or moisture stress, and adverse soil characteristics such as compaction or plant litter.Objective 3.  Determine the usefulness of accumulated temperature (degree days) as an aid to timing of pasture management operations such as fertilizer application and harvesting, in order to minimize competition in cool- and warm-season grass mixtures during seasonal transitions.Approach:Replicated experiments will be undertaken in controlled-environment or in small-plot field trials to measure management effects on establishment, production and persistence of cool-season forages grown in mixtures with warm-season pasture. Processes of regeneration and persistence in cool-season grasses and legumes established by minimal tillage in sequence with unimproved warm-season pasture will be studied. Low-input methods of sowing that will improve the efficacy and predictability of establishment of forage grasses and legumes and that allow improved early-season production from cool-season forages will be evaluated. Indicators of the onset and termination of forage growth will be determined to facilitate management and to minimize or eliminate interference between cool- and warm-season forages. Results from the project will identify forage management systems adapted to low-input farms and forage mixtures that enhance and extend the productive grazing period of pastures."

A trait-based index will be developed to relate pasture plant community composition (both species presence and abundance) to ecosystem function in grasslands. A multi-site field-plot trial will be conducted to test the hypothesis that mixed plant communities with greater species evenness produce more herbage and are more resistant to weed invasion than mixtures with lower evenness or monocultures.

Observational research will be conducted on pasture-based dairy farms feeding a range of supplementation strategies with varying pasture composition to characterize the effects of supplementation on grazing behavior and diet selection. Ingestive behavior will be quantified on during spring, summer, and fall grazing. Detailed feeding and milk production information will be collected from farm records and personal interviews. Continuous culture fermenters will be used to identify ruminal fermentation products that influence grazing patterns via post-ingestive feedback mechanisms. Sward-box studies will be used to evaluate cattle grazing behavior responses to monocultures and mixtures of selected grasses and legumes.2A. Multi-location field plot and farm-scale trials will be conducted to determine the greenhouse gas emissions and economics of perennial and annual crops grown for bioenergy.

The Green Revolution was the result of developing cereal crops that respond favorably to high rates of N fertilization and the infrastructure to supply this fertilizer and, in developed countries, the striking rise in cereal grain yields in the last half of the 20th century was directly linked to a 10-fold increase in N fertilizer use. Recent developments raise questions about the sustainability of this use. Since the reaction used to make ammonia uses methane and generates carbon dioxide, nitrogen fertilizer costs are directly tied to the price of energy and, in addition, fertilizer application is associated with soil pH changes and nitrogen accumulation in agroecosystems. Several studies have demonstrated that the successful manipulation of N inputs through the use of biologically fixed N can result in farming practices that are economically viable and environmentally sound. In most agricultural settings the primary source (about 80%) of biologically-fixed N is introduced via the symbiotic interactions between legumes and the soil bacteria collectively referred to as rhizobia. Legumes provide approximately 35% of the worldwide protein intake and contribute additional protein through their effect on subsequent rotation crops. Natural terrestrial ecosystems fix (1990 estimates) about 90 Tg N/yr, and an additional 30-40 Tg N/yr are fixed in agriculture. More nitrogen is used as fertilizer (85 N Tg/yr N) but only about a third of this fertilizer nitrogen is found in harvested crops. About 288 Tg of fuel would be required to replace the N fixed by legumes with ammonia produced industrially, at a cost of over $100 billion. Moreover, increased used of biologically produced nitrogen could displace some of the industrially produced N, providing a substantial saving to farmers and having desirable environmental impacts. An improved understanding of the symbiotic interaction may open up possibilities to increase the contribution that symbiosis makes to global nitrogen availability. This project is investigating the fundamental interactions that lead the symbiotic bacteria to fix nitrogen. We have implicated the nitrogen stress response in controlling nutrient exchange in the symbiosis and are pursuing this link to determine whether there is an opportunity to alter the symbiosis in a way that provides more nitrogen fixation and more benefit to subsequent crops grown in rotation. Related projects are exploring traits involved in field application of the symbiosis, including desiccation resistance of the bacteria, which is important in establishing the symbiosis, and salt resistance, which is important in some soils and often in improperly irrigated situations."

Species-dependent controls on plant chemical and physical composition, microbial community structure and activity, climate, and edaphic factors, all play a role in determining SOM stabilization and decomposition. Current concepts of the physical and biological controls over soil C and N storage emphasize that long-term stabilization of SOM results largely from the interplay among three factors: (i) physical protection within soil aggregates, (ii) inherent chemical recalcitrance of the organic matter, and (iii) association with mineral surfaces. This proposal will document and quantify how these protective mechanisms interact following vegetation change from C4 grassland to C3 woodland dominated by N-fixing tree legumes. The primary goal of this project is to determine the quantitative significance of microbe community structure and enzymatic activity, soil microfabric, and the specific chemical forms of organic C and N in the stabilization of SOM along a chronosequence from remnant grasslands to woodland. Specifically, a chronosequence (120 yrs) of C3 woody plant invasion into a subtropical C4 grassland will be utilized as a model system to investigate storage and dynamics of SOM in soil physical fractions. Natural C-13 and N-15 isotopic variations induced by vegetation change from C4 grassland to C3 woodland will be a key tool for tracing sources and fluxes of SOM in all phases of the project. The project will address the following questions: (1) How does soil physical structure determine C accrual and dynamics over time following woody plant invasion? (2) What is the chemical composition, source, and turnover rate of the plant and microbial carbon that is stabilized? (3) What is the role of shifting populations of soil microbes and enzyme activity in the respiration of litter and SOM fractions and how do they impact aggregation dynamics? (4) What is the relative accessibility of the new C3 SOM pools to microbial decay and can we relate physically identifiable SOM fractions with calculated mean residence time (MRT) to potential respiration in inoculation experiments? Innovative molecular, isotopic, and microbiological methods will be used to develop a more fundamental understanding of processes that control SOM storage and dynamics. This work has potential to benefit the SOM modeling community which is searching for biologically, chemically, and physically meaningful approaches to modeling of SOM dynamics. This work should yield an enhanced understanding of the role of soil processes in biogeochemical cycles and the earth system, which will be of immediate significance to both scientists and policy-makers as mankind considers the potential for manipulating the carbon cycle in order to mitigate the potential for global climate change."

During some years, environmental conditions generate foliar disease losses in excess of 15 to 20 percent on priority crops such as dry bean and onion, each of which has a direct value in excess of 40 to 50 million dollars annually to Colorado's economy and welfare. These pathogens can survive in previously infected crop debris and soil, be reintroduced annually via infested plant material or airborne particles or vectors, and be redistributed via water, implements and human activities. New crop infection and epidemic development are then dependent upon environmental conditions which persist during critical stages of the pathogen and its host plant throughout the year. Monitoring of the pathogen population, crop development and environmental conditions allow researchers to apply disease forecast models in support of timely scouting calendars and implementation of disease management strategies that are most economically effective and environmentally sensitive. The environmental component of this project is based upon continued access to and support of COAGMET which is a series of remote electronic weather recording stations situated in key irrigated production areas of Colorado. Disease management components that can be investigated and applied to each pathogen and its disease include crop rotation for 2 to 4 years, sanitation of previous crop debris, planting date, clean planting material, moderate plant density, fertility and irrigation practices, soil compaction alleviation, plant resistance, pesticide selection and timing, and harvest and post-harvest curing and handling. Results generated by this project will be utilized in integrated pest management programs that focus on foliar diseases of dry bean and onion in Colorado. Results will include: expanded understanding of the life cycle of each priority pathogen and disease in Colorado, e.g., white mold and bacterial wilt of dry bean, and viral diseases of onion; more effective and reliable disease forecasting models for each pathogen and its disease; more complete historical database of environmental variables from production regions in Colorado; COAGMET has generated continuous daily weather records at many sites since 1992; more timely disease management strategies, with emphasis upon the most selective pesticides when justified by disease forecast models, scouting and other IPM principles; more resistant and adapted cultivars of dry beans; and support for a timely technology transfer network (internet-based) that incorporates weather data, pathogen life cycle, disease sightings, crop development and other IPM components shared by researchers, extension personnel, crop consultants, and others."

Although pest populations may in some cases be  pre-adapted  to the new host, host shifts frequently require some genetic modification of key larval and adult traits. The potent evolvability of insect populations has long been evident in the rapid rate at which they become resistant to insecticides or overcome plant defenses produced by conventional or transgenic technology. Less well-studied are the mechanisms by which pest species shift to new food sources, even though the agricultural literature has many examples of pests that unexpectedly switch from non-crop hosts to crop hosts, or expand their host ranges soon after a crop is introduced to a region. Host-range expansions are difficult to anticipate, and are sometimes observed in only particular populations, which are commonly called 'biotypes' to emphasize their genetic differences from typical populations of the same species. Rapid evolution of biotypes is frustrating to growers, and may require the development of new pest management strategies. The research proposed here uses a seed beetle as a model system to examine the genetic changes that accompany adaptation to novel legume hosts. Grain legumes are a critical source of protein for much of the world's population, and are used to supplement low-protein cereal and root crops. Callosobruchus maculatus attacks several grain legumes, and is one of the most destructive post-harvest (storage) pests in the world. Experiments in our laboratory have demonstrated remarkably rapid adaptation to marginal or unsuitable legume hosts. These experiments now provide the opportunity to examine the relative importance of behavioral, physiological, morphological, and life-history traits in the process by which larval and adult beetles become more efficient in exploiting new hosts. Rapid adaptation to one particular host (lentil) will allow us to test whether genetic changes that improve performance on one marginal host simultaneously causes cross-adaptation to other marginal hosts, including those that are related to lentil but to which beetle populations have never been exposed. The C. maculatus-grain legume interaction also provides a model system to increase our understanding of the evolution of diet breadth in insects. Most studies of natural insect populations detect host shifts only after they have occurred. There are few cases to permit generalizations concerning the typical genetic changes (or amount of genetic change) accompanying host shifts by plant-feeding insects. Because C. maculatus is a storage pest that has attacked human stores for at least a few thousand years, the laboratory provides an close approximation of its  natural  habitat. Its short generation time and simple rearing requirements make it an ideal candidate for studies of experimental evolution. The research proposed here can therefore provide a realistic assessment of mechanisms by which insects modify their host ranges."

In 2006, more acres of soybean were harvested in the U.S. (74.6 million) than acres of any other crop, including corn (70.6 million). Soybean is produced in 31 states and 3 provinces in the eastern, central, and southern U.S and Canada, from Quebec to Florida, and Delaware to Nebraska. Given this large acreage and wide distribution, it is not surprising that soybean continues to suffer from insect pests that impact plant growth, grain quality, and yield. The populations of soil pests such as slugs, grubs, and millipedes, and foliar and pod feeders such as bean leaf beetle and stink bugs, are increasing in many regions. The distribution of other insects, such as Dectes stem borer and pyrethroid-resistant Lepidoptera (such as corn earworm), appears to be growing. Producers are encountering insect problems that they have never seen or managed like the newly discovered brown marmorated stink bug. From a research standpoint, changes in pest distribution and status require greater understanding of pest biology and movement, as well as the development or modification of scouting and control methods. New insecticide technologies are providing possible alternatives to more traditional insecticides. The recent registration of seed-applied insecticides offers new control options, but also encourages growers to use products as insurance treatments rather than basing applications on scouting in an integrated pest management context. Besides violating the principles of IPM, prophylactic use of insecticide adds to the cost of production and increases the potential for insecticide resistance. From a research perspective, the efficacy and economic viability of insurance treatments need to be addressed in a concerted way. As a part of this large multi-state and multi-region project, this program will contribute to the overall objectives to increase the understanding of insect population dynamics with relation to soybean development, and to develop new economic thresholds and sampling procedures. The recommendations that will result from better understanding of insect-soybean interactions and impacts on crop growth will significantly add to producer profitability by providing more precise decision-making tools and reducing unnecessary treatments. Refinement of economic thresholds for insect pests to account for newer varieties and natural enemies can minimize both crop loss and unneeded input costs. Improved understanding of corn earworm movement will help predict the spread of insecticide resistance and better maintain susceptible alleles in the population. Identifying new insecticides, and efficient use of current products will increase or refine control options for growers. Specific outputs will include species lists, identification guides, sampling methods, thresholds and control practices for stink bug species; recommendations for use and fit for new insecticides and seed treatments; and continued advisories relating to efficient management of corn earworm and other emerging important insect pests."

However, in the mountainous interior of the Island, characterized by severe unemployment and economically depressed living conditions, it is important that environmental conservation efforts contemplate not only soil and water quality but also the economic welfare of the rural population. One possibility is to incorporate high value timber species in reforestation programs, which can be selectively harvested at a profit without severely damaging the surrounding forest. However, newly planted trees are very sensitive to weed competition, drought and (in the case of severely eroded lands) soil nutrient and microbiological deficiencies, requiring adequate management to assure tree survival during the first years after planting. This can be difficult and costly, particularly in remote mountainous areas. Theobjective here is to develop and test a  plant and forget  system for establishing mahoe (H. elatus) and mahogany (S. macrophylla) in eroded acid soils of humid upland Puerto Rico, wherein all or most the management necessary for achieving tree survival to a self-sustaining stage is provided at planting. Strategies to be investigated are use of specially prepared compost mixes as nursery material, aggressive low-growing cover crops and tall etiolated tree seedlings to reduce weed pressure, inter-planting with legume trees for nitrogen availability, and water harvesting to reduce duration and severity of drought stress.

Unfortunately, the biological characteristics of cultivated alfalfa (polyploidy, out-crossing, and population diversity) severely limit the ability to carry out genetic analyses of agronomically important traits, including disease resistance. However, the model legume Medicago truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa, has the potential to serve as a surrogate species for genetic analysis of many economically important alfalfa traits and to provide new sources of host resistance. Thus, the goal is to use of M. truncatula as a model system to map and clone the counterparts of agronomically important genes in alfalfa, in particular, disease resistance genes.

It is not surprising that soybean continues to suffer from insect pests that impact plant growth, grain quality, and yield. Whether it is a result of accumulated years in soybean production, changes in cropping practices, or global climate change, the distribution and impact of native and established pests is increasing in soybean. Producers are encountering insect problems that they have never seen or managed. From a research standpoint, changes in pest distribution and status require greater understanding of pest biology and movement, as well as the development or modification of scouting and control methods. Although pesticides are often the easy first tools used to deal with new or growing insect problems, long-term sustainable solutions must include host plant resistance and biological control. As in many other production systems, invasive species in particular are also an increasing issue in soybean production. The discovery of the soybean aphid (SBA) in 2000 fundamentally changed soybean insect management. SBA feeding impacts all components of yield; under heavy aphid pressure, yield differences between treated and untreated research plots may reach 50%. From an economic standpoint, SBA infestation increases the cost of soybean production. Although scouting methods and an economic threshold (ET) for aphid control were developed under the previous multi-state project, these management practices are only applicable to soybeans in the R1 to R5 growth stages planted in 30-inch rows. The thresholds must be modified to account for plant maturity group and age, differences in planting systems, and populations of biological control agents. Specialty soybean production is a growing, profitable market for producers, including production of USDA-certified organic soybeans. Production practices and quality requirements of organic soybeans differ from those of conventionally-produced roundup-ready beans, thus insect management practices (scouting, thresholds, and control measurements) are also likely to differ. Chemical use has also changed dramatically in soybean production since the inception of the last project. In most soybean production areas, the introduction of soybean rust will change soybean disease management; this will influence the entire production system, including insect management. Preventive applications of fungicide made prior to infection may encourage growers to make unnecessary tank-mixes with insecticides. The recent registration of seed-applied insecticides also encourages growers to use products as insurance treatments rather than basing applications on scouting in an integrated pest management context. From a research perspective, the efficacy and economic viability of insurance treatments need to be addressed in a concerted way. To move beyond chemical use, particularly to control bean leaf beetle, soybean aphid, stink bug, and other chronic pests, alternatives are critically needed."

K.",,,108814179,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,NASHVILLE,TN,37209-1500,UNITED STATES,,,10.205,2008,,,"Living forms in soil use chemical signals to communicate among themselves or with each other to establish relationships. Some of the signaling occurs between adversaries while others are for fostering mutually beneficial relationships. One important mutually beneficial relationship is that between legume crops and bacteria, commonly called rhizobia. In this relationship, signals from the legume cause compatible rhizobia to migrate into the plants' roots where they fix atmospheric nitrogen for the plant. In return, the rhizobia are amply supplied with substrates that the plants produce through sun energy-driven photosynthesis. Although nitrogen is the most abundant element in the atmosphere (about 80% of the air we breathe), it cannot be used directly by biological systems to build the proteins and nucleic acids that are the basis of all forms of life. Rather, it has to be reacted with hydrogen before it can be incorporated into living systems. In spite of its abundance in the atmosphere, N is the nutrient that is most frequently limiting to crop production, which has necessitated dependence of chemically manufactured N fertilizers. Injudicious use of these synthetic fertilizers can pose threats to human and environmental health. Whether it is by chemical or biological means, the reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen requires tremendous amounts of energy. The chemical process for making N fertilizers relies on increasingly costly fossil fuels, which come from unstable regions in the world. In contrast, the biological processes (aka biological nitrogen fixation, BNF), rely on unlimited energy from sunlight. Furthermore, biologically fixed nitrogen is in a form that does not pollute the environment. The legume-rhizobia N2 fixation has been reported to account for 20% of global BNF. With increasing costs of fossil fuels and therefore increasing costs of nitrogen fertilizes, our ability to capitalize on BNF will become progressively crucial to agricultural production in the foreseeable future. This is further underscored by our current emphasis on sustainable agricultural production for protection of natural resources. It has recently been shown that legume-rhizobia signaling can be disrupted by man-made chemicals including insecticides. A number of new generation insecticides that were man-made to be similar to naturally occurring insecticides are currently used to treat nursery stock from Tennessee. They possess characteristics that suggest they could cause disruption in legume-rhizobia signaling; however, they have not been tested for this property. We recently began testing actual naturally-occurring insecticides (biopesticides) as safer alternatives to man-made ones. None of these have been tested for disruption of legume-rhizobia signaling. We plan to evaluate new generation conventional pesticides and biopesticide alternatives for impacts on rhizosphere signaling that is critical to agricultural and environmental processes. This will allow us to recommend pesticides and biopesticides that can be used without adverse impacts on the environment."

In 2007, 9.2 million acres of corn and 3.77 million acres of soybeans worth $16 billion were produced in Nebraska. Historically a great deal of research has been conducted on managing the major economic insect pests of these crops in Nebraska and surrounding states (corn rootworms, European corn borer, bean leaf beetle). Several regional USDA committees are responsible for coordinating this research (e.g., NCC205, NCERA 46, and S1010). However, pest complexes change over time. For example in 2000, an introduced species, the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, was first found damaging soybeans in the north central U. S. Its' distribution expanded over time and A. glycines was first found in Nebraska in 2003. A great deal of research is being conducted on this species in Nebraska and other states since its introduction. In other cases, the geographic range of a native pest species may expand. The western bean cutworm, Richia albicosta, has been a pest of corn and dry beans in Nebraska for many years, but since 2000 has been expanding its' range eastward, and now is a regionally important pest species. There is increased demand for information on its' biology and management due to its greater geographic range. The soybean stem borer, Dectes texanus, is native to states throughout the central U. S., but has historically been a pest primarily in the southeastern U. S. Its' distribution on soybean has been expanding into Nebraska, with the first documented damage in southern Thayer county in 2000. D. texanus has been expanding its range in south central Nebraska since then, with reports of damage in Fillmore and Thayer counties in 2007. More recently, several species of plant feeding stink bugs have been observed more frequently in Nebraska corn and soybeans. Other pest species may vary in density over time. A normally rare native species, the corn blotch leafminer, Agromyza parvicornis, was observed causing high levels of defoliation in corn fields in Phelps county Nebraska in 1995. After a few years, numbers dropped off. However, since 2004, this insect has become more common again, but with a wider distribution throughout south central Nebraska. Other states have also reported higher populations of corn blotch leafminers during this time period. Unfortunately, very little biological research has been conducted on this insect since the work of Phillips in 1914. In the absence of research-based recommendations, there is a potential for growers to react to an emerging pest with inappropriate insecticide use, not based on local conditions as assessed by scouting and use of valid economic thresholds. This reaction is more likely now with higher commodity values for many Nebraska crops, including corn and soybeans. There is a great need for more biological information on these pest species in Nebraska, with the ultimate goal of developing profitable, environmentally sound pest management programs. The research outlined in this proposal is designed to provide that needed information."

The mid-South has adopted an early soybean production system to allay late season drought stress and insect pressure (Baur et al. 2000). However, this early system has significantly increased three-cornered alfalfa hopper and southern green stink bug populations (Baur et al. 2000). One or more of these pests are significant annual problems and are responsible for limiting soybean yields in Louisiana. This is an evolving system and new management tactics are needed to combat a changing pest assemblage."

Forage legumes have the potential to improve on-farm nutrient cycling, nutrient management, soil health, and enhance pasture nutritive value. We expect that our proposed studies will ultimately lead to an increase in profitability of beef production in the southern US, enable producers to draw from our information generated on several subject matters, and link improved agronomic practices to enhanced environmental and economic benefits for beef producers and their communities."

A small percentage of insects use olfactory cues to identify humans as hosts and act as vectors for deadly diseases globally like malaria, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile encephalitis, filariasis etc. Other insect pests use the sense of smell to identify plant hosts and destroy a large portion of the global agricultural produce. Insects also use olfactory cues as pheromones for finding mates, escaping stressful situations, maintaining social organization, aggregation, etc. Yet very little is known about the molecular basis of olfactory coding in most insects. The control of vector and pest insects relies largely on insecticides. Extended use of these chemicals can not only have adverse effects on the environment and human health, but can also lead to insects that are resistant to these insecticides. Other methods of control that are used less frequently include traps and repellents. Trapping apparatus can be expensive and is often times less attractive than the human prey. There are few repellents that are effective against biting arthropods such as diethyl toluamide (DEET), and there is a need to identify other efficient compounds that may be safer to humans. The first goal of this proposal is to undertake a comprehensive functional characterization of olfactory receptor genes from significant vector and pest insect species. This information will greatly enhance our understanding of peripheral olfactory coding in diverse species of insects. It will also aid in designing novel behavioral disruption programs based on the identification and intelligent design of economically synthesized, environmentally friendly, insect attractants, repellents and masking agents. Use of such compounds may be useful in reducing vector-human contact or pest-plant contact. This proposal addresses the study of odor receptor genes from vectors like Culex pipiens (northern mosquito), Aedes aegypti (yellow fever mosquito), and Ixodes scapularis (deer tick); insect pests like Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle) and Acyrthosiphon pisum (pea aphid) and a pollinator Apis mellifera (honey bee). A second goal is to characterize odor guided behavior in insect larvae. Specifically we will identify a suite of odors that mediate chemoattraction, phagostimulation or repellent behavior in larvae of Culex mosquitoes. We will use high-throughput video imaging of larval behavior to screen a large number of compounds representing diverse classes of chemicals usually associated with their food or habitat. Upon identification of compounds that induce strong attraction or phago-stimulation, we will add them to larvicides and test their efficiency in a new vector management strategy of attract-and-kill. The final emphasis will be on characterization of genes and neuronal circuits for behaviors that are activated by specific odors. By looking at neural circuits in the brain we can begin to understand how the nervous system interprets signals from the outside world and how behavioral decisions are generated."

In 2006, more acres of soybean were harvested in the U.S. (74.6 million) than acres of any other crop, including corn (70.6 million). Soybeans are produced in 31 states and 3 provinces in the eastern, central, and southern U.S and Canada, from Quebec to Florida, and Delaware to Nebraska. Given this large acreage and wide distribution, it is not surprising that soybean continues to suffer from insect pests that impact plant growth, grain quality, and yield. Whether it is a result of accumulated years in soybean production, changes in cropping practices, or global climate change, the distribution and impact of native and established pests is increasing in soybean. The populations of soil pests such as slugs, grubs, and millipedes, and foliar and pod feeders such as bean leaf beetle and stink bugs, are increasing in many regions. The distribution of other insects, such as Dectes stem borer and pyrethroid-resistant Lepidoptera (such as corn earworm), appears to be growing. Producers are encountering insect problems that they have never seen or managed. From a research standpoint, changes in pest distribution and status require greater understanding of pest biology and movement, as well as the development or modification of scouting and control methods. Although pesticides are often the easy first tools used to deal with new or growing insect problems, long-term sustainable solutions must include host plant resistance and biological control."

Current energy-intensive vegetable production systems have well-known negative effects on the environment and have also detracted significantly from the economic viability of farming given rising fuel costs. Dependence on energy use can be reduced through adoption of reduced tillage systems and by replacing synthetic fertilizer inputs with nitrogen-fixing and nutrient scavenging cover crops. However, adoption of the systems is constrained by their complex and sometimes negative effects on management of pests. Weeds are particularly problematic in vegetable production and are often a major obstacle to adoption of alternative systems. The objectives of this research are to 1) optimize reduced tillage production systems and evaluate their impact on weed and nutrient management as well as yield and quality of vegetable crops; 2) identify low-cost strategies for integrating energy-saving cover crops into vegetable production systems; and 3) determine the impact of alternative cropping systems and environmental conditions on weed population dynamics and weed management in vegetable crops. Field, greenhouse, and growth chamber studies will be conducted to meet these objectives. Specific cropping systems to be examined in field studies include rye living- mulch in asparagus, and strip-tillage in snap beans and sweet corn production. Laboratory and growth chamber studies will examine the impact of changes in nitrogen dynamics on weed and vegetable seed germination and growth. Results from this research will be disseminated through a variety of forums including written publications in journals, newsletters and web-based bulletins, as well as oral presentations at grower meetings, workshops and scientific conferences."

Studies of vacuole biogenesis have major implications for human health because an important portion of our diet, including the essential amino acids found in beans and corn, comes from proteins stored in plant vacuoles. This organelle is involved in multiple functions such as the storage of proteins, secondary metabolites and hormones, sequestration of ions, maintenance of cellular turgor, osmotic potential, and protein degradation and recycling. The vacuole also has important roles during the response to environmental stress and it has been shown to be a dynamic organelle. In tobacco suspension cells for example, exposure to osmotic stress results in acute changes in vacuolar morphology. The vacuolar membrane or tonoplast is one of the largest membrane compartments in plant cells and is a major regulator for the transport of materials in and out of the vacuole. Aside from storage proteins, which are delivered by vesicle trafficking, membrane transporters of the tonoplast transport all of the molecules that are stored in the vacuole including ions, sugars, hormones, and defense molecules. The quality and quantity of these materials has a major impact in vacuolar functions, but also affects the viability of the cytosol. Even though the regulated delivery of these transporters are necessary to ensure proper vacuolar function, the mechanisms for tonoplast protein trafficking are largely unknown. Tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs) are good markers of the tonoplast membrane because of their important role in cell viability and the response to environmental stress. The goals of this research are to identify and study the trafficking machinery which regulates delivery of tonoplast proteins to the vacuolar membrane. A long term goal is to characterize the mechanisms required for protein transport, and dissect the interaction between these processes and environmental-stress or developmental signaling pathways. In general, results from our experiments will greatly improve our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate vacuolar biogenesis and protein sorting. Components of the endomembrane system that may be identified as a result of the proposed experiments include endomembrane proteins involved in the recognition and targeting of tonoplast proteins, the regulation of vesicle trafficking and fusion, as well as the maintenance of tonoplast integrity. An exciting possibility is that results from this research may be translated into crops with the goal of improving crop yield and human nutrition."

Certified organic acreage in North Carolina alone has increased by 96% in the past 6 years, not taking into account the many farmers who have chosen not to become certified, yet are using organic production methods. Despite this growth, the body of research and data to support organic farmers? specific management practices is still in its infancy. It is critical that we know how to design agroecosystems where nutrient availability from certified organic sources is synchronized with crop needs. Organic growers are limited to organic and microbially-produced N sources, such as animal wastes or by-products, or mineralization of N from existing soil organic matter. One common management practice in organic farms includes the use of legume cover crops. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) can be a major source of new nitrogen entering organic farming systems, typically through the inclusion of leguminous cover crops in the management plan. Synthetic nitrogen sources are prohibited under organic standards, and thus farmers are dependent upon the fixation of atmospheric N2 through the legume-rhizobia symbiosis to provide N for crop growth and development. While most organic growers inoculate their cover crop legumes with a recommended rhizobia inoculant, little is known about the efficacy and the efficiency of these rhizobia within fields under organic management. The roller-crimper is an implement technology that is showing success in allowing organic farmers in the Southeast to develop no-till grain systems that successfully terminate winter legume cover crops prior to spring planting, and control weeds without the aid of synthetic herbicides or cultivation. Cover crop plant material remaining after rolling can provide subsequent crops with a readily available source of N. This research proposal will investigate how rolling and surface decomposition of the cover crop residue influences N availability to the following corn crop. We will determine nitrogen fixation rates within newly-developed as well as commonly used varieties of legume cover crops. Nitrogen fixation will be assessed using 15N natural abundance methodology. Total biomass N of cover crop mulch will be measured. N release from decomposing cover crop mulch residue by using Plant Root Simulator ion resin probes and traditional NH4-N and NO3-N soil sampling. Further, diversity of root nodulating bacteria (rhizobia) among NC organic farms and research stations will be assessed using molecular methods. We hope that the outcomes of this project will serve to advance our knowledge of how legume cover crops can be used in farm rotations to improve N contribution to subsequent cash crops. The impacts will be far reaching and have the potential to reduce input costs and improve nutrient management of organic farms across the U.S."

Over 400 species of plants are susceptible to this pathogen.  Currently, there are no adequate resistance strategies against Sclerotinia diseases (culturally or chemically) and breeding for resistance to this fungus has not been successful.  Annual losses of crops from diseases caused by S. sclerotiorum in the U.S. are in the multimillion dollar range.  The fact that Sclerotinia is aggressive, broad in its host range, poorly controlled and causes significant economical damage, coupled with the lack of resistant cultivars necessitates the development of alternative control strategies.  A molecular based mechanistic approach will be used in this project to understand why the fungus is so successful; in particular the project will examine the roles that reactive oxygen species and oxalic acid play as key modulators of fungal disease.  The project is supported by recent observations that demonstrated that fungal secreted oxalate induces a programmed cell death in the plant host and recapitulates S. sclerotiorum disease symptoms.  Similarly oxalic acid induces increased reactive oxygen species levels in the plant which correlate with, and are necessary for, programmed cell death and disease.   Results from these studies will provide information for alternative disease control strategies based on interference with these key fungal pathogenicity determinants.Broader Impact     The experiments described in this project offer broad and comprehensive training for students encompassing a number of fields. Current approaches include microbiology, plant pathology, plant biology, high throughput gene silencing screens, molecular biology and genetics. The mechanisms underlying fungal induced plant disease are both fundamental and of practical importance. This is particularly noteworthy since food safety, food contamination and food security are critically important issues nationally and internationally. This is compounded by  Sclerotinia diseases since control measures (genetic and chemical) are largely ineffective. This research program will provide a unique and interdisciplinary training opportunity for a graduate student, postdoctoral fellows, and undergraduate students to participate in a critical area of stress signalling and cell death regulation, while conceptually addressing broader conceptual ideas as to how this particular group of important plant pathogens achieves pathogenic success.  The project also supports summer research activities for students from Hispanic Serving Institutions and a Land Grant University in Texas."

Immediately after its formation, a polyploid plant can be identified simply by counting its chromosomes, because it has twice as many as a diploid. However, after millions of years a polyploid may have as low a chromosome number as a diploid through a process called  diploidization.  Genomic studies can detect such cryptic polyploids, and the advent of high-throughput sequencing has made this approach increasingly feasible. Using this new technology, this project will estimate the frequency of polyploidy in the phaseoloid legumes, a group that includes soybean, common bean, cowpea, pigeonpea, and other less familiar crops, by sequencing thousands of transcribed genes from approximately 25 phylogenetically diverse species. Polyploid events will be identified by their characteristic signature, an excess of genes with two copies duplicated at the same time. The project has broad significance for genetics and systematics, given the importance of polyploidy as a genetic phenomenon, and also for agriculture, because polyploidy is so common among crop plants (e.g., soybean, wheat, maize, cotton). The large numbers of genes will be a resource for subsequent studies in this large and important lineage. A talented female postdoctoral associate will receive training in the generation and analysis of next-generation sequencing data."

Petrich from the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University will acquire a cyber-enabled accurate-mass liquid chromatography, quadrupole (LCMS/MS) mass spectrometer for the Department's Mass Spectrometry Laboratory. This spectrometer possesses a solution-based sample introduction, quadrupole/ion trap precursor selection, and a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer.  This instrument will accommodate several forms of atmospheric pressure ionization (API) and two ionization methods: electrospray (ESI) and chemical ionization (APCI). The spectrometer will support the efforts of a diverse group of faculty and scientists involved in fundamental research to developing solutions to complex chemical problems varying from biological chemistry to catalytic processes to improve processing of soy bean oil to production of new materials to capture the energy of sunlight and light emitting diodes. Students from research groups of professors Larock, Pohl, Kraus, Verkade, Jenks and Jeffries-EL will utilize the instrument as well as other research groups from departments including chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, agronomy, food science, botany, geology and entomology.LCMS/MS-TOF-mass spectrometry is an important technique for obtaining accurate molecular weights on very large molecules, with extremely high sensitivity. Use of a LCMS/MS-TOF mass spectrometer has therefore become a standard technique, especially in studies involving biomolecules. This research will have a significant impact in a number of areas, especially chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research."

By contrast, the precision, angular coverage and depth of astrophysical observations are increasing at an impressive rate. Crucially, a number of multi-color imaging and spectroscopic large scale structure surveys are taking observations, or are being actively developed.  Dr. Rachel Bean (Cornell University) will establish the required theoretical tools and observational requirements to ensure that the large scale structure cosmological surveys in progress, or being developed, in the coming five years will be optimally applied to decipher and constrain the full array of signatures that dark energy and inflation can leave. The work will also detail the observational implications of tightly delineated theories of brane inflation and alternative theories of gravity that promise distinctive properties, but which have not, as yet, been studied in the necessary detail. In combination, these approaches will yield an improved insight into the physical origins of these two, major, outstanding questions in cosmology.The research program to be carried out under this award actively involves training of undergraduate and graduate students. One emphasis is on increasing interaction between the Cornell Physics and Astronomy students, giving each opportunities to develop both an understanding of, and research experience in, the underlying theories and how experimental data are used to judge a theory's merit.  Dr. Bean will also develop a middle-school  Afterschool Universe  program in astronomy and cosmology, in collaboration with the Cornell Department of Astronomy education and public outreach (EPO) coordinator.  The joint goal of Dr. Bean and the EPO coordinator is specifically to increase opportunities and involvement in physical sciences for under-represented communities in the upstate New York region.  In addition, Dr. Bean will continue giving lectures on topics in fundamental physics and the  cosmos as the ultimate laboratory  for New York State school teachers with the Cornell Center for Nanoscale Science Institute for Physics Teachers. Dr. Bean will also make a second online lecture for the Cornell Adult University  Cyber-Tower . The materials associated with the lectures, and the online lectures themselves, will be available online to educators and the public."

Eisen (University of California - Davis)Collaborators: Venu Kalavacharla (Delaware State University) and Gurdev Khush (University of California - Davis)Plants grow in close association with large communities of microbes collectively called the microbiome.  Comparatively little is known about the diversity of microbes that associate with plants and their interactions and effects on performance and crop yields. Specific microbes have been extensively documented to provide beneficial effects to plants, such as those involving well-known symbiotic associations in legumes.  Previous studies utilizing a single beneficial bacterial species in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrate how plants actively recruit beneficial bacteria under biotic stress regimes.  While valuable insights can be gained from studies with single microbial species, preliminary studies show a wide diversity of bacterial species associated with field grown rice (Oryza sativa) plants, whose biological significance is completely unknown.  This project will utilize a combination of genomic and metagenomic approaches to dissect the impact of microbial associations on rice.  Specifically, a controlled experimental system will be established, in which microbial populations will be characterized by metagenomic rRNA profiling, and plant responses by transcriptomic profiling. The expression profiles for localized and whole plant responses will be analyzed for global changes in gene expression, as well as for changes in the expression of specific functional classes of genes that would reflect changes in nutrient availability, or establishment of plant immunity. The proposed research will provide the foundations for future investigations into the impact of the microbiome on plant performance.  All sequence and mapping data generated in this project will be accessible through a genome browser that will be developed specifically for this project.  Allsequence data will be deposited for long-term dissemination in GenBank, GreenGenes (http://greengenes.lbl.gov), the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), and NCBI's Short Read Archive (SRA; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/home/).   The broader impacts of this project stem, in part, from the interdisciplinary nature of the research.  Training for students and postdoctoral associates will integrate quantitative approaches with applications to experimental biology. The project will also have broader impacts in the professional development and educational arenas. Professionally, the students and postdoctoral researcher involved in this project will benefit from experimental design training, the acquisition of technical expertise and interdisciplinary communication. In addition, the project will conduct a robust internship program for outstanding students from Delaware State University (DSU), an 1890 Historically Black University, and Delaware Technical & Community College (DTCC), a two-year institution with substantial numbers of first-generation college and minority students. The  Field to Lab  program will involve training in agricultural sampling, gene expression, metabolic profiling studies and bioinformatics."

Many of these associations are obligate:  both partners are required.  This project will establish whether the obligate symbiosis between an insect, the pea aphid, and the bacterium Buchnera is underpinned by shared metabolic pathways, meaning that both animal and bacteria contribute to the synthesis of nutrients needed by both partners.  In these shared pathways, the nutrients are made using enzymes,  some of which are coded by bacterial genes and others by animal genes, with intermediates being transferred between the animal and bacteria.  This project will establish whether six essential amino acids are made by shared metabolic pathways in the pea aphid.  The investigators will analyze the protein complement of the symbiosis, isolate candidate enzymes contributing to the shared pathways, determine their function, and quantify the movement of intermediates in the shared pathways by stable isotope labeling.  The key results will be the identification of animal and bacterial enzymes that contribute to the shared metabolic pathways and the reactions they mediate, so that these shared metabolic pathways can be elucidated.  This research will provide the first definitive evidence explaining why an animal-bacterial symbiosis is required by both partners.  It will serve as a model to investigate the many other obligate symbioses in natural systems, and it will identify candidate targets for novel strategies to control aphid pests of crops.

Although many rhizobia provide their host plants with nitrogen, saving farmers billions in fertilizer costs, less beneficial strains cause problems in some areas.  Some hosts, including alfalfa and pea, make rhizobia swell up as they start to provide nitrogen.  Unlike the nonswollen rhizobia from soybean or cowpea nodules, swollen rhizobia apparently lose the ability to reproduce, but does rhizobial swelling somehow benefit the plant?  To find out, the investigators will map this trait on the family tree for crops and wild plants that host rhizobia, to see if causing swelling evolved more than once, suggesting a positive benefit to the plants.  Three dual-host rhizobia (plus mutants that differ in their ability to hoard resources) will be used to measure effects of rhizobial swelling on costs and benefits to the plants.  Plant defenses against rhizobia that provide little or no nitrogen, already demonstrated in soybean, will be tested in species that impose bacterial swelling.  This research will increase understanding of a symbiosis that supplies nitrogen to agricultural and natural ecosystems, with implications for other important symbioses.  Results could guide the development of crops that selectively enrich soils with the best rhizobia, decreasing future fertilizer requirements.

Intriguingly, these phytohormones are made not only by the plants in which they serve to regulate growth and development, but by certain plant-associated fungal and bacterial microbes as well. While gibberellin phytohormone biosynthesis has been largely elucidated for higher plants and fungi, which seem to have independently evolved/assembled the corresponding metabolic pathway, the basis for such biosynthesis in bacteria remains enigmatic. Even in higher plants, the origins of gibberellin metabolism remains obscure. Further, there have been recent discoveries demonstrating the existence of novel gibberellin metabolism (particularly catabolism) in higher plants, which have unexplored implications in plant biology. Building on previous NSF-supported studies, this project will both further investigate gibberellin metabolism in higher plants and also define the analogous biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. The bacterial pathway appears to represent yet a third example of a convergent evolutionary solution to the puzzle presented by such complex natural products biosynthesis. These studies will also provide insight into the evolutionary origins of gibberellin metabolism in plants. Thus, the planned wide-ranging studies will provide a comprehensive overview of gibberellin phytohormone metabolism in a phylogenetically diverse group organisms. Gibberellins have played an important role in agriculture, as it was alterations in such phytohormone metabolism that led to high yielding semi-dwarf varieties of rice and wheat, which were a critical component of the  Green Revolution . The biosynthesis of gibberellin phytohormones by plant growth promoting bacteria that are commonly applied to legume crop plants offers additional agricultural significance. Further, the absolute requirement for gibberellin production in higher plants has provided a genetic reservoir of biosynthetic genes, duplication of which has led to a vast super-family (~7,000 known) of related diterpenoid natural products, exhibiting various biological activities and physiological roles (e.g., as defensive antibiotics). Hence, this project, while specifically directed at gibberellin metabolism, will offer insights into a much broader group of natural products.Broader ImpactOn-going broader outreach efforts also will be continued and expanded. Beyond the inclusion of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in research, work will be continued with high school students and those from under-represented groups. In addition, the project includes presentations to junior and senior high school science teachers to provide concrete examples of how basic research underlies and informs technological advancements that improve the human condition. An important example is the relationship of gibberellin to the  Green Revolution  as noted above."

This activity led to the accumulation of genes that control a group of traits known as the  domestication syndrome.  These traits comprise visible changes in growth habit, organ size, seed dispersal, and environmental responses.  However, with the exception of a few species that were domesticated for their edible roots, root traits have been neglected in domestication studies. Yet, morphological differences between roots of wild and cultivated forms exist and can be considered the product of indirect selection.  This observation raises questions about both the number of genes responsible for these differences and their identity. The main objective of this project is the identification of the genes controlling the root morphological changes associated with the domestication of Phaseolus vulgaris, the common bean, a New World species domesticated 8-10,000 years ago.  The target genes and their chromosomal position will be identified through a statistical analysis of root traits (growth rates, branching, etc.)  in progeny obtained from a cross between a wild and a domesticated bean.   This analysis requires two pieces of information: a measurement of the root trait, and the genetic makeup of each individual in the progeny at previously mapped marker-genes covering all chromosomes.  Root traits will be measured via 2D scans using a root scanner, and 3D scans using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Tools to evaluate 3D MRI root images quantitatively have been developed and will be expanded to create a computer generative 3D root model.  The genetic makeup of the progeny will be obtained with the latest generation of high throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies.   The genes controlling the domestication-associated root traits will be identified and located on a chromosome when statistical tests show that progeny with the wild version of the marker-gene exhibit significant differences in root traits from those with the domesticated version. Identification of genes controlling root traits associated with domestication will have broader scientific and educational impacts.  Knowledge about these genes will improve our understanding of the carbon balance of ecosystems in which the carbon storage in root mass is a major concern, and will also facilitate the genetic manipulation of roots for crop improvement.  This project will produce a computer generative 3D root model, which will be a powerful teaching tool, and the starting point in the development of a gene-based root model.  The training of undergraduate and graduate students from both the University of Florida and Florida A&M University, an institution with minorities who are under-represented in the scientific research community, will be one of the major components of this project."

One model case is the benefit leguminous plants, like beans and clovers, receive from nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia that live in the plant's roots. Plants trade energy-rich photosynthetic sugars to bacteria housed in root nodules for bacterially-obtained nitrogen, a limiting nutrient for plant growth. This symbiosis has proven to be a highly effective strategy, and legumes can persist in a wide variety of habitats. The performance of a legume in any particular environment can depend on how well adapted both the plant and rhizobia are to the particular aspects of a site, since both partners are highly interdependent. However, very little is known about the relative importance of host plant versus rhizobia adaptations to the survival of either partner. This project addresses how interactions between a native and an invasive legume and their rhizobial partners differ on and off serpentine outcrops.  These outcrops harbor remnant pockets of California's native floral diversity, protected from most invasive plants by harsh soil conditions. Native or invasive legumes may be able to adapt to this harsh environment without the aid of specific rhizobia, or they may depend on having symbionts that are specialized for that particular environment. Understanding the nature of legume-rhizobia symbioses on and off serpentine soils is an essential first step toward managing and conserving these threatened plant communities. Undergraduate students will be involved in this research, and results will be made public via an existing webpage."

Symbiotic relationships are ubiquitous, and allow many plants and animals to thrive in diverse environments. For example, reef corals obtain most of their energy from algae that live inside their tissues. Almost all land plants rely on fungi to provide essential minerals, and most animals, including humans, rely on bacteria for nutrition and defense against infectious diseases. Despite the importance of symbiosis in the health of plants and animals, scientists understand little regarding the mechanisms that promote and maintain healthy long-term associations. Such knowledge could help ameliorate the impact of global climate shifts on animal and plant health and could lead to the discovery of new drugs that are produced by symbiotic partners for pathogen defense. Furthermore, symbiotic systems are fascinating, engaging, visually striking and relevant to our world. Therefore, symbiosis can help educate students on fundamental biological principles in evolution, ecology, molecular biology, cell biology, and physiology. Two critical steps toward realizing the potential of symbiosis research are increasing communication among symbiosis researchers in diverse fields and educating the public regarding the importance and elegance of symbiotic systems. The 6th International Symbiosis Congress project will support these efforts by allowing the participation of scientists, students, and teachers in an international conference to be held in Madison Wisconsin August 9-15, 2009. Presenters will discuss cutting edge research on the evolution, ecology, metabolism, and molecular biology of symbiosis in corals, legumes, flowering plants, forests, humans, and insects among others. Specific topics that will be addressed are how global climate changes are influencing symbiotic systems and how symbiotic associations evolve and are stabilized. This project also will promote professional development and symbiosis education workshops at the conference that are designed to encourage success among junior scientists and expand the integration of symbiosis research in education and outreach."

Media multitasking is a growing phenomenon observed among 8-18 year olds, yet little is known regarding how this behavior influences key cognitive, developmental and behavioral processes which affect the way young people learn, reason, socialize, think creatively, and understand the world. Previous research in the adult population generally shows that media multitasking negatively impacts productivity. However, little research to date has examined the processes underlying children's media multitasking or how such processes may affect cognitive development and learning. Clifford Nass of the Stanford CHIMe Lab and Roy Pea, Co-PI of the NSF LIFE (Learning in Informal and Formal Environments) Center, in partnership with the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop, will convene a symposium for an interdisciplinary group of leading scholars from neuroscience, child development, cognitive, communication, and education fields, and key policy leaders to advance our understanding of the potential implications of media multitasking for learning and cognitive development in children and youth. The primary goal of the symposium is to define a coherent agenda to stimulate needed theory-based research on the implications of media multitasking for learning and cognitive development.  The symposium will consist of three panels of multi-disciplinary experts to examine: a) media multitasking and cognitive development, b) media multitasking, learning and productivity, and c) design principles for leveraging media multitasking in educational contexts. A meeting report will be distributed on the symposium website and in print form. The symposium website will also facilitate communication and knowledge sharing among a newly defined research community and serve as a clearinghouse for information on the implications of media multitasking for cognitive development and learning. Overall, the activities associated with this grant will help activate a new special interest academic community, and encourage and facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration across institutional, intellectual and methodological disciplines. Through understanding how media multitasking may affect psychological processes underlying learning and cognition, practitioners will be better prepared to inform policy and to maximize educational impact in a broad range of learning contexts."

They use these signals to regulate almost every phase of plant development from seed germination through flowering, fruit development, and senescence. There are four known groups of plant photoreceptors: the phytochromes that can sense red and near-infrared light, and the cryptochromes, phototropins, and a family of three photoreceptor relatives of the phototropins, all of which can sense both blue and near-ultraviolet light. The phototropins are the photoreceptors that direct plant growth toward a light source (phototropism); adjust the leaf angle to maximize light capture for photosynthesis; adjust the positions of the small organelles that carry out photosynthesis (chloroplasts) to spread them out and minimize self-shading in order to maximize light capture in dim light (or to move into positions maximizing self-shading to avoid damage caused by too much light); and to induce the opening of small pores in the leaf surface (called stomata) to facilitate the uptake of carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis.  The phototropins contain two sequential segments of amino acids that form a pocket surrounding a molecule of a riboflavin derivative, a yellow pigment that is responsible for absorbing blue light. The segments are designated LOV domains for their similarity to domains that sense light, oxygen, or voltage. On absorption of blue light, the light-activated pigment alters the shape of the protein to initiate the steps leading to the eventual biological response - be it phototropism, leaf positioning, chloroplast movement, or stomatal opening. This light-absorbing protein pocket (the LOV domain) is also found in important proteins in lower plants, many different kinds of fungi, and a large number of bacteria. In the bacterium Brucella, a virulent animal pathogen, light absorption has been shown to induce a ten-fold increase in bacterial virulence. This response is mediated by a LOV-domain-containing protein. The present project has two foci: First, to continue to investigate how the change in shape of the LOV domain is transmitted into a signal that induces one of the several biological responses, using biochemical techniques to identify other proteins which interact with the LOV-domain-containing proteins on light excitation. The objective is to determine the complete chain of events from light absorption to response. Second, it will investigate, using biophysical and biochemical methods, the light responses of the bacterium Rhizobium, essential together with legumes for nitrogen fixation. Like the brucellosis pathogen, Rhizobium has a LOV-domain-containing signaling protein that affects its behavior on exposure to light. The research will investigate the previously un-described role of light in this agriculturally important bacterium using biophysical and biochemical methods to trace the steps from light absorption to alteration in the bacterial behavior. The project aims to elucidate the common mechanism by which a single small pigment-containing protein pocket can elevate pathogenesis in a bacterium on the one hand, and the opening of stomatal pores on a leaf on the other when activated by blue light.

However, genetic improvement of soybean is beset by a lack of genetic diversity leaving soybean open to threats of pests, pathogens and abiotic stresses. This project will develop a set of tools that will allow investigators to leverage the recently released draft soybean genome sequence to exploit genetic diversity in the genus Glycine and to begin to understand the nature of species/genome diversification in the genus. Important in this process is an understanding of the cycle of polyploidization followed by diploidization found in this set of species. The specific objectives are to: 1) overlay diversity maps onto the soybean genome sequence using genomic clones from a set of phylogenetically informative Glycine species; 2) explore genome evolution in the genus Glycine at the chromosomal/sequence level to understand the polyploidy/diploidization cycle; 3) sequence targeted orthologous regions across the Glycine species in order to understand levels of linkage disequilibrium and genetic diversity that can be exploited for genetics and breeding; and 4) integrate data with other legumes which is necessary to extend its usefulness to other so-called  orphan  legumes such as common bean. The broader impacts of this project will be the development of an infrastructure that will be generally accessible by the broader legume community to exploit diversity and understand genome evolution in this economically important genus. The project will continue and expand a successful outreach program targeted toward Native American and Hispanic undergraduate institutions in the Southwest (primarily New Mexico and Arizona) to provide summer research training opportunities and further develop interactions with these faculty and students.  All project data and tools will be accessible though SoyBase at http://soybase.org/.  Sequence data will be deposited and accessible through GenBank and BAC clone resources will be maintained and distributed on a cost-recovery basis by the Arizona Genome Institute."

May (National Center for Genome Resources)Legumes, the third largest family of flowering plants, are notable for their ability to form symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This symbiosis leads to massive amounts of biological nitrogen worldwide, providing a major source of organic fertilizer and vegetable protein for humans and animals. Medicago truncatula is a widely studied model species for legume genomics and one important question focuses on the identity of naturally occurring genes that control variation in symbiosis in legumes. This project will use association mapping techniques to create a Medicago  HapMap .  In brief, 384 diverse genetic lines obtained from collaborators at INRA-Montpellier, Ecole National Superieur Agronomique de Toulouse (ENSAT) and the Noble Foundation will be resequenced using next generation sequencing technology for sequence polymorphisms (SNPs) between the different Medicago lines. SNP discovery through genome resequencing is possible because a reference sequence for the gene-rich euchromatin of Medicago has already been created through previous NSF funding. The massive database of SNPs between Medicago lines enables the prediction of genome segments with shared ancestry (haplotypes), which can then be associated statistically with trait variation in symbiosis. Because of the  exceedingly high level of SNP density, association mapping can approach the resolution of a single gene.The broader community of scientists will access the Medicago hapmap platform through an intuitive web interface (to be established) that will be modeled on the human hapmap website (www.hapmap.org).  Seed for all lines included in the hapmap will be available by contacting project personnel or directly through INRA-Montpellier, ENSAT and the Noble Foundation (through the GRIN facility).  With access to the data and germplasms, scientists will be able to carry out their own association mapping experiments, including traits other than symbiosis. Because the development of a hapmap platform applied to the study of symbiosis in legumes is a naturally cross-disciplinary project, high school, undergraduate and graduate students will find numerous projects that integrate their knowledge of plant biology, microbiology, population genetics and bioinformatics. This project will partner with Hamline University to develop new undergraduate curriculum and will also reach out to undergraduates coming from Hamline University and the University of Puerto Rico, as well as high school students coming from institutions throughout the state of New Mexico to participate as summer interns in projects directly involved in the Medicago hapmap and symbiosis project.

Phaseolin is the most abundant protein stored in the seeds of the French bean, Phaseolus vulgaris. Genetically, it is encoded by a small family of similar but not identical genes, one of which (phas) has been studied in great detail. This NSF-funded research has the long-term goal of gaining an understanding of how specific genes are activated at certain times in defined tissues, and has led to major advances in plant molecular biology. These include the isolation and in vitro translation of plant mRNA, the first demonstration of introns in a plant gene, and the first functional transfer of a developmentally regulated gene (phas) from one species to another (bean to tobacco). Transcriptional regulation of phas is constrained both spatially and temporally. It was found that the establishment of a repressive chromatin structure and a rotationally positioned nucleosome over three phased TATA boxes of the phas promoter is responsible for the lack of phas expression in vegetative tissue. However, using an estradiol-inducible system for PvALF production and externally supplied abscisic acid (ABA), it was possible to induce activation of phas promoter-driven GUS reporter expression in leaves of Arabidopsis plantlets homozygous for two transgenes (pER8/XVEHA.PvALF). These experiments revealed that the activation of phas is a two-step process that involves nucleosome remodeling initiated by the seed-specific B3 domain transcriptional activator, PvALF, followed by abscisic acid (ABA)-driven activation of robust GUS transcription from the phas promoter that is easily identified by blue-colored leaves upon histochemical staining. Specific objective 1 of this project is to identify proteins that interact with the PvALF effector to achieve chromatin remodeling. In addition to yeast two-hybrid screening and immunoprecipitation with antibody against HA-tag, a novel approach will be to extract RNA from Arabidopsis leaves at specific time points during the potentiation and activation steps. High throughput sequencing of cDNA reverse-transcribed from the RNA samples will allow identification of the genes that are turned on in these steps, and the order in which they appear. In objective 2, further dissection of the various events governing the potentiation and activation of the phas promoter will be undertaken. Specifically, it will be determined if histone H3 depletion or substitution is intrinsic to effector-mediated activation of phas expression. The key role of PvALF and related effectors in initiating transcription from seed-specific promoters makes it imperative to search for the critical event that induces transcription from PvALF and its relatives (objective 3).Broader impactsIn addition to gaining new information on molecular processes of gene expression, this project has relevance to understanding how the production of the seed protein of an important food crop is regulated. This project will provide training for a postdoctoral research associate, a graduate student and will give undergraduate students opportunities for laboratory experience. Several aspects of the proposed studies (e.g. cDNA cloning, yeast one/ two hybrid screening and T-DNA mutagenesis experiments) are expected to provide exciting opportunities for undergraduate participation. Arabidopsis transgenic lines or mutants created from the proposed studies (e.g. transgenic line expressing Myc-tagged histone H3 or H3.3) will also be made available for researchers in the plant community. Students of different heritage and gender will be encouraged to participate."

Legumes range from giant rain forest trees to tiny herbaceous annuals of desert habitats.  Of the three traditionally recognized subfamilies, Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae, and Papilionoideae, the Caesalpinioideae is the most poorly known because it is largely confined to tropical habitats. As a consequence, evolutionary relationships among caesalpinioid legumes are poorly known and the recognition of particular genera is often in dispute.  Previous work by Dr. Herendeen and his colleagues in Canada and England has developed a general phylogenetic framework for Caesalpinioideae, which will be used to further research on morphology, taxonomy, and phylogeny.  Current morphological and molecular data show that several caesalpinioid lineages have more basal positions than either the Mimosoideae or Papilionoideae.  Thus a classification system for the family based on evolutionary relationships would not recognize the caesalpinioids as a single natural unit but as several early-branching lineages.  How many distinct lineages of caesalpinioid legumes are there, at what level should they be recognized relative to mimosoids and papilionoids, what are the relationships among caesalpinioid genera, and what can we discern about patterns of morphological evolution?  These questions form the core of the study. The primary goal of this research is to produce a classification that includes all ca. 160 genera of caesalpinioid legumes based on analyses of data from morphology and DNA sequence data.  To achieve this, field work will be conducted in Madagascar, South America, and SE Asia to obtain material of as many of the missing genera as possible.  The investigators will also study collections in herbaria and prepare anatomical samples to score morphological characters for all species included in the molecular data set.  They will use the phylogenetic results to produce a revised classification and identification key to subfamilies, tribes, and genera for all caesalpinioid legumes. With a robust phylogeny and a specimen-based morphological data set, they will be able to explore the implications of the phylogeny with respect to patterns of morphological evolution.  In addition, data on a diverse array of fossil legumes will be integrated with the results. The fossils may be used in documenting minimum ages of clades and as historical data points for biogeographic studies.  In addition, molecular clock techniques will be used to estimate ages of clades.  The data generated in this study will make the Leguminosae an ideal group in which to experiment with new methods in estimating ages of clades and assessing rates of taxonomic diversification and molecular evolution."

This studyshowed anomalous toxicity at the 13.5 g OTC/kg level (3X), with no toxicitydemonstrated in the control, 1X or 5X treatments. Thus, a margin of safety could not bedetermined. The present study is a repeat of the first with treatment levels of 1X, 1.5X,and 2X OTC in feed with a control group. A randomized block design will be used with8 blocks of 4 tanks each. Each tank will contain 12-15 animals depending on the size atinception. The treatments will receive medicated feed (or a control diet) at levels basedon preliminary consumption trials with age mates in similar tanks. The medicatedtreatments will be fed medicated diet for three 14 day periods. Each period will bebroken by a 5 day period on unmedicated diet. Random shrimp will be fixed forhistological examination at the end of the first medicated period, the second period, thebeginning of the third, the end of the third, and 14 days post medicated termination. Thefixed samples will be examined for lesions in the hepatopancreas and graded as toseverity of lesions seen. In addition, data will be maintained on the water quality,number of moribund and dead animals, consumption, and estimations of activity andappetite throughout the study. Growth will be estimated by determining the averageweight per shrimp in each tank at the beginning and at termination of the study. Thestudy will be conducted on the Good Laboratory Practice principles in 21 CFR 58. Finalbody weight by group, mortality, and feed consumption will be analyzed statistically forbetween group differences. Histological results will provide graded levels of lipidvacuolization, and lesion present in the hepatopancreas. These graded results will beanalyzed using contingency tables. These data should provide information allowingCVM to establish a margin of safety within the treatment levels of the study."

This has led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to classify ricin as a level B biothreat.  Indeed, evidence has been found suggesting that terrorist groups have attempted to develop it as a weapon, and there have been instances of domestic attacks.      The investigators have developed a non-toxic ricin vaccine, RiVax, from the A-chain subunit of ricin, by introducing two site-specific mutations that eliminate both its ribotoxic and vascular leak syndrome-inducing activities.  Once preclinical testing demonstrated that this vaccine, as a frozen sucrose/Tween formulation, was safe and immunogenic in mice and rabbits, the investigators conducted a Phase 1 study in 15 human volunteers and showed that it was safe and able to elicit ricin neutralizing immune responses.  In order to improve the efficacy of this vaccine, by increasing the degree and duration of the response, the investigators have developed an aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel) formulation and have shown that it greatly improves immunogenicity in mice.  The investigators now propose to conduct a dose-escalating Phase 1 trial, involving 3 groups of 10 healthy volunteers to determine if this new formulation is safe in humans and increases and prolongs the response.  Doses of 1, 10 and 100 micrograms - each with 0.5 mg Alhydrogel, will be given at weeks 0, 6, and 26 and serum will be assessed for anti-vaccine and neutralizing titers."

EE is thought to be mediated by both IgE and non-IgE mediated food allergy.  The majority of patients with EE (50-80%) are atopic based on the co-existence of EE with atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and/or asthma.  In addition, the vast majority of EE patients have food allergen specific IgE based on immediate hypersensitivity skin tests or measurement of allergen specific IgE in blood.  Approximately 75% of EE subjects had increased total IgE levels.  Approximately two thirds of children with EE have positive immediate hypersensitivity skin tests to at least one food allergen.  The mean number of positive food immediate hypersensitivity skin tests ranges from 3-6 positive tests per subject with EE.  The most common foods reported to be positive in EE by skin immediate hypersensitivity skin test included common food allergens (i.e. peanut, egg, milk, soy, wheat) as well as beans, rye, and beef.  Dietary therapy is considered an effective therapy in children diagnosed with EE.Objective/Hypothesis:  Although studies of the genetics of EE are in their infancy, the importance of genes to the development of EE has been demonstrated in studies showing an important association of EE with a SNP in the eotaxin-3 gene, a chemokine gene important to eosinophil chemotaxis into tissues such as the esophagus.  In this study, we are particularly interested in identifying genes in EE linked to a significant complication of EE namely esophageal stricture formation.  Esophageal stricture formation is a significant complication of EE resulting in food impactions and emergency room visits.  Thus, identifying genes which contribute to esophageal remodeling and esophageal stricture formation may lead to biomarkers to detect patients at risk of this complication, as well as potential novel therapies.Specific Aims:  The focus of the genetic studies in EE, we have proposed has two specific aims: 1)  Does expression of TGF-b and the TGF-b TT genotype promote the development of remodeling in EE? 2)  Does inhibition of AMCase reduce the development of eosinophilic inflammation, OVA food allergen specific IgE, and esophageal remodeling in egg induced EE ?Study Design:  We will characterize SNPs in two candidate genes of esophageal remodeling (TGF-b, acidic chitinase) in patients with EE (n= 200), as well as in controls (n= 200) matched for age, gender, and ethnic background.  Levels of esophageal remodeling and expression of TGF-b and acidic chitinase will be quantitated in esophageal biopsies.  The importance of TGF-b and acidic chitinase to the development of egg-induced remodeling of the esophagus will be studied in a mouse model in which either TGF-b signaling is inhibited or acidic chitinase activity is neutralized.Impact:  This study focuses on increasing our understanding of two genes associated with remodeling and stricture formation in the esophagus in EE.  If these genes contribute to esophageal remodeling and esophageal stricture formation, their identification may lead to biomarkers to detect patients at risk of this complication, as well as potential novel therapies."

SPECIFIC AIMS The aims of this proposed project are to identify and devise formulations ofnatural products, particularly the eremophilane sesquiterpene nootkatone, andevaluate their effectiveness for the reduction of questing nymphal Ixodesscapularis in the field in areas highly endemic for Lyme disease. This project willassist in developing new technology for the management of tick vectors of Lymedisease spirochetes, determine how to integrate natural botanical compoundswith a biological control agent, and ultimately provide an alternative tickmanagement option to conventional acaricides for individual stakeholders andthe land care industry. Within the project goal to evaluate the efficacy of naturalproducts for the control of the tick vectors of Lyme disease spirochetes, there arefive research objectives. We propose a study on the control of blacklegged ticksusing natural products as outlined in the funding opportunity announcement,including but not limited to nootkatone, repellency of these natural products to I.scapularis, and, in addition, test the compatibility and field efficacy of theentomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae Strain 52 with nootkatone andother natural products for a more integrated natural and biological approach.People prefer the use of natural compounds or biological agents for pest controland personal protection measures. Availability of natural alternative controlmaterials and agents may lead to increased acceptance of applications ofacaricidal agents to the landscape and increased tick control. The objectives are:Objective 1. Identify all-natural, low-toxicity chemicals extracted from botanicalsources, including the eremophilane sesquiterpene, nootkatone, toxic to thenymphal stage of the blacklegged tick, I. scapularis, and devise formulations(water miscible, emulsifiable, and microencapsulated or other slow-releaseformulations to extend residual activity) for aqueous application to vegetation andleaf litter for the control of host-seeking I. scapularis (FOA research objectives 1& 2).Objective 2. Field test formulations against populations (June peak >0.1/m2) ofthe blacklegged tick in Lyme disease endemic areas and determine whethercontrol of ticks using test chemicals is accomplished by direct toxicity to ticks infield plots via approach outlined in the proposal announcement (FOA researchobjectives 3 & 4).Objective 3. Test repellency of the natural products against I. scapularis in thelaboratory and in the field with treated and untreated flannel tick drags (FOAresearch objective 5).Objective 4. Test formulations of natural products, particularly nootkatone, inthe laboratory and field in combination with the entomopathogenic fungus, M.anisopliae Strain 52, for the control of I. scapularis nymphs. These objectives can be broadly divided into product development and fieldevaluation of natural products for repellency and control of the tick. The field trialswill be conducted in communities in Fairfield and Litchfield Counties ofConnecticut; areas highly endemic for Lyme disease. We will bring several addedcomponents to the proposed project that will enhance the outputs and outcomesof the research. In cooperation with the Department of Analytical Chemistry atThe Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES), we will providequantitative assessment of residual nootkatone after application in the field.Working with a scientist with the USDA Agricultural Research Service, slowrelease formulation(s) to extend nootkatone efficacy will be developed andtested. Preliminary tests show that germination of M. anisopliae is not affected by0.1% nootkatone. Therefore, M. anisopliae will also be incorporated into the testof natural product formulations to determine if the agents can be integrated into acontrol program and permit effective use of lower, economical concentrations ofthe natural compounds. Nootkatone will be obtained from commercial sourcesand Novozymes Biologicals, Inc. (Salem, VA) will provide the M. anisopliae.B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Lyme disease (LD) is the most important tick-borne disease in the UnitedStates. A record 23,763 human cases were reported in 2002, closely followed by23,305 in 2005 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2003; Centers forDisease Control and Prevention 2007), which probably represent only about 10-20% of diagnosed cases. The disease is caused by the bacterium, Borreliaburgdorferi Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt & Brenner, which is transmittedby the bite of the blacklegged tick, I. scapularis Say. There is a strong correlationbetween the abundance of infected I. scapularis, specifically the nymphal stagethat is most abundant in spring and summer months (Mather et al. 1996; Staffordet al. 1998), and the incidence of LD. Furthermore, this vector is responsible fortransmitting the agents of human babesiosis and human granulocyticanaplasmosis, two emerging tick-borne infections in the US. Connecticut has thehighest or among the highest rates for LD in the United States, with a rate of 136cases reported per 100,000 persons in 2002 (4,631 reported cases) and 53cases per 100,000 population in 2005 (1,810) (Ertel and Nelson 2003; Ertel et al.2006). The drop in cases from 2003 is largely because of changes in reporting.Fairfield County has the greatest number of cases, generally accounting forabout a third of Connecticut's total and Litchfield County has the highest rate ofLD (299 per 100,000 population). In addition, there were 49 confirmed and 154probable cases of anaplasmosis and 69 confirmed cases of human babesiosis inthe state in 2002 (Ertel et al. 2003; Ertel et al. 2003). In the northeastern states, individuals with the highest risk for tick bites andLyme disease are those residing in suburban residential developments withadjacent wooded tracts, and those with rural homes in a woodland environment,where hosts for the tick flourish (Falco and Fish 1988; Falco and Fish 1988;Stafford and Magnarelli 1993). Cases occur most commonly in children aged 5-14 years and those 45-54 years, which probably reflects outdoor activity in thesummer months when nymphal ticks are active. Most cases of LD appear to beacquired peridomestically. Therefore, control of ticks in residential locations,particularly in areas of high disease incidence, are expected to reduce thenumber of local LD cases. A variety of vector control approaches have been explored to determine theirefficacy in reducing tick abundance (Stafford and Kitron 2002; Ginsberg andStafford III 2005). These include personal protective measures, hostmanagement, habitat modification, acaricide applications, host-targetedacaricides, and biological control. While most of these approaches have met withmixed success and acaricides can provide excellent tick control over relativelylarge areas, environmental concerns have restricted their acceptance and broaduse. The acaricidal treatment of important hosts, such as white-footed mice andwhite-tailed deer also has a substantially reduced environmental impact and hasalso been shown to reduce tick abundance. Recently completed trials of therodent bait box in southwestern Connecticut by CAES have shown reduced tickdensities at residential home sites though little impact was observed at homes inmore rural northwestern parts of the state. However, the commercially developedrodent bait box containing fipronil is no longer being manufactured due to costissues. The 4-poster technology for the passive application of an acaricide todeer, though providing significant tick control (Pound et al. 2000; Carroll et al.2002; Carroll and Kramer 2003; Solberg et al. 2003), has not been widelyadopted in the northeast for control of the blacklegged tick amid cost issues,placement restrictions, and concerns by wildlife agencies of feeding the corn baitto deer and emerging chronic wasting disease of deer. Acceptance of chemical acaricides in some communities is low. Forinstance, a study of residents in the towns of Westport and Weston, CT in whichLyme disease attitudes and behaviors were surveyed (under CDC cooperativeagreements to the Connecticut Department of Public Health and CAES) foundthat only 22.5% of residents reported having sprayed a chemical pesticide for tickcontrol, and 69.5% indicated that the use of pesticides was not very likely orlikely at all. Several years of community education on how to target and minimizepesticide use has increased use of acaricides to 38% of survey respondents (CTDPH, unpublished data). Yet clearly, there is a strong niche for alternative controlmethods or compounds and new tools are needed. Biological agents such asentomopathogenic nematodes and parasitoid wasps have had limited success inreducing numbers of I. scapularis. Engorged I. scapularis females aresusceptible to fatal infection by steinernematid nematodes, but unfed femalesand younger (immature) stages are not. Furthermore, sensitivity of nematodes tolow fall season temperatures in the northeastern US limits their potentialapplication for control of this tick at present. Likewise, the blacklegged tick isparasitized by the chalcid wasp, Ixodiphagus hookeri, but only at high tick andhost deer densities. Thus, it is unlikely that a control approach using this waspspecies will be successful (Stafford et al. 2003). By contrast, natural productsand entomopathogenic fungi could provide safer, organically acceptable tickcontrol. A combination of these strategies may provide the least toxic options for tickcontrol in the residential landscape. People prefer the use of natural compoundsor biological agents for pest control and personal protection measures. Publicinterest in safer alternatives is reflected in a growing interest in and accreditationof landscape professionals in organic land care and the use and acceptance ofnatural, organic, and herbal products have been on the rise in recent years(Tanneeru 2006; Cunningham 2007). Repellent products containing natural,botanical ingredients have increasingly become available to the public. Botanicalcompounds have long been known to have repellent and/or toxic propertiesagainst arthropods. Until recently, information on the activity of natural productsagainst ticks has been relatively limited. Tick products currently are restricted tothose containing d-limonene for flea and tick control on pets, which has littleefficacy against I. scapularis (Panella et al. 1997). Not all botanical extracts orcompounds are effective against arthropod vectors or may offer some protectionagainst mosquitoes, but not ticks (e.g. citronella). Many botanicals offer only ashort duration of protection (3 to 30 minutes), a problem frequently due to highvolatility of the compound requiring frequent replacement. Some African plantshave strong tick-repellency (Kaaya 2000). USDA-ARS scientists have shown thattwo American beautyberry, Callicarpa americana, compounds, callicarpenal andintermedeiol, may be effective repellents against I. scapularis (Pons 2007). Theactive ingredient of extracts of lemon eucalyptus oil, citriodiol, has been shown ina few studies to provide some repellency and protection against tick bite (Gardulfet al. 2004; Garboui and Jaenson 2006; Jaenson et al. 2006), all against I.ricinus, the tick vector for Lyme disease in Europe. There does not appear to beany peer-reviewed studies evaluating the repellency of lemon-eucalyptus againstI. scapularis. The extracts or oils of several other plants have also been found tohave repellent properties against I. ricinus (Jaenson et al. 2005). The essentialoil from the heartwood of Alaska yellow cedar, Chamaecyparis nootkatensis, wasfound to be a highly effective toxicant against nymphal I. scapularis (Panella etal. 1997). Various components of the essential oil, especially nootkatone, aneremophilane sesquiterpene, were subsequently shown to have 10x greateractivity than the oil itself (Panella et al. 2005). However, a 1-2% rate appearsnecessary for control in the field (Marc Dolan, personal communication), a ratefar above the LC50 of 0.0029% (Panella et al. 2005). The nootkatone derivedfrom grapefruit oil and three other natural compounds were found to be highlyrepellent, comparable to DEET, in a screening assay against I. scapularis(Diethrich et al. 2006). Clearly, there is a large disparity in efficacy of botanicalcompounds against ticks, ranging from highly effective to no observable effect asa repellent or toxicant. The recognized safety of some compounds (e.g.;citronella and citronella oil, eugenol, garlic and garlic oil, geraniol, geranium oil,lemongrass oil, rosemary and rosemary oil, thyme and thyme oil) by the EPA (40CFR 152.25 - minimum risk pesticides) and their exemption from therequirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)has lead to their use in formulated products of unknown effectiveness againstticks. While no claim to control disease may be made, a few products do claim tocontrol  deer ticks . Active ingredients approved by the Organic Materials ReviewInstitute (OMRI) include neem products, Bacillus thuringiensis (BT), Beauveriabassiana (fungus), garlic, pyrethrin, rosemary oil, and insecticidal soap.Clarification of the efficacy of some compounds and the development of newones are badly needed. A number of fungi have been isolated from ticks, primarily from engorgedfemales collected off deer, although some fungal species have been found onlarvae, nymphs, and unfed females. These include Paecilomyces farinosus,Lecanicillium (formerly Verticillium) lecanii, Beauveria bassiana, and some otherspecies from these three genera in the Hyphomycetes family. Recovery ratesare low, however, generally less than 5%. Lecanicillium lecanii appears to be acommon fungal pathogen of I. scapularis and I. ricinus in nature.Entomopathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhiziumanisopliae have been reported to cause mortality in I. scapularis. Two products,BotaniGard (Mycotech, Butte Montana) and Naturalis T & O (Troy Biosciences,Phoenix, Arizona) provided effective tick control in the laboratory and in fieldtrials (S. Allan and K. Stafford, unpublished data), but are not labeled for tick use.Initial field trials in 2002 with the entomopathogenic fungus (Metarhiziumanisopliae Strain 52) provided high levels of control (80-85%, K. Stafford,unpublished data). This fungus was provisionally registered by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) for tick biocontrol. Metarhizium is a naturally occurringsoil fungus that is considered nonpathogenic to mammals. This fungus possesminimal risk to non-target organisms and does not harm many beneficial insectssuch as honey bees, green lacewings, lady beetles, parasitic Hymenoptera orearthworms at rates used. Field applications with M. anisopliae Strain 52 (Tick-Ex , Novozymes Biologicals, Inc., Salem, VA) in 2007 resulted in around 90%control for several weeks after a second application and overall seasonal controlof 77.8% at the higher rate tested (see preliminary studies/progress report). Fullregistration is now pending. It was clear however that applications must be madeduring nymphal tick activity. Nootkatone has excellent knock-down propertiesand the fungus could compliment the natural compound to provide improved tickcontrol. However, nootkatone appears to lack a long lasting effect in the field. Formulation technology can enhance the activity of many pesticideapplications by extending storage stability, improving dispersion in the spraytank, and extending residual activity after application. Nootkatone has twoadverse characteristics that may specifically be addressed by proper formulationdevelopment, and specifically by encapsulation. First, the nootkatone is insolublein water (Material Safety Data Sheet, Bedoukian Research, Danbury, CT).Second, applications of nootkatone have demonstrated a short period of residualactivity (M. Dolan, personal communication). Specific reasons for contributing tothe rapid loss of efficacy are not known, but likely are related to loss by volatilityor adsorption into the treated substrate (plants, leaf litter, soil, etc.). These lossesmay be reduced by encapsulation formulations that provide a barrier betweennootkatone and the air and/or treated substrate. There is high probability ofextending residual activity of nootkatone by the application of the appropriateformulation technology. Many encapsulation techniques including spray drying,polymer encapsulation and coacervation are being researched, often for use inthe food industry (Gouin 2004), and these techniques may be suitable forencapsulation of nootkatone. Likewise, when considering integrated applicationswith entomopathogenic fungi, encapsulating nootkatone may again provide abarrier that will allow mixing higher concentrations of nootkatone with spores forapplication without inhibiting spore germination. At this time, nootkatone isexpensive. If a lower rate of nootkatone acts in combination or synergisticallywith the fungus, then costs could be reduced. An encapsulated formulation maybenefit applications of nootkatone by extending residual activity or allow flexibilityto tank mix with fungal agents without detrimental affects on spore germination.Natural products alone or in combination with a Metarhizium formulation couldalso potentially be used in wild animal host-targeted applications. A natural, integrated tick management program will require a variety of toolsthat can be used under different circumstances and with different segments ofthe human population. We propose to develop, test, and refine natural products,especially nootkatone, as well as examine their compatible use with the fungusM. anisopliae (Tick-Ex) against the nymphal stage of the blacklegged tick, I.scapularis.C. PRELIMINARY STUDIES/PROGRESS REPORT Scientists at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) havebeen involved in studies of tick ecology and tick control technologies for 20years. Some tick control trials and testing of new technology is ongoing orrecently completed and has not yet been published. Other specialists in relatedfields chemistry, mycology, and wildlife biology, are also on staff and available forcollaboration or consultation. The principal investigator has a supervisorypesticide application license and the technician on the project has a pesticideapplication license. Strategies that have been evaluated for tick control, most of which haveinvolved CAES, include habitat modification, burning vegetation (Mather et al.1993; Stafford 1998), the use of parasitoid wasps that infect I. scapularis(Stafford et al. 1996; Stafford et al. 2003), chemical acaricides (Stafford 1991;Solberg et al. 1992; Curran et al. 1993; Schulze et al. 2000; Schulze et al. 2001),pesticide treatment of rodents and deer (Pound et al. 2000; Rand et al. 2000;Solberg et al. 2003; Dolan et al. 2004), exclusion of deer from defined areas(Daniels et al. 1993; Stafford 1993; Daniels and Fish 1995), and the reduction ofvertebrate host numbers (Wilson et al. 1984; Deblinger et al. 1993; Stafford et al.2003). The PI and CAES staff has extensive experience in conducting andevaluating tick control trials with natural (e.g., pyrethrin) and synthetic acaricidesand with entomopathogenic fungi. The application of entomopathogenic fungi totick habitat or vertebrate hosts to control ticks is a more environmentallyacceptable approach than chemical use, and fungi are one of the more promisingtick biological control agents that could provide a natural complement to botanicalcompounds. Initial field trials of a new commercial strain of M. anisopliae in 2002provided 80-85% control of nymphal I. scapularis (K. Stafford and S. Allan,unpublished data) and led the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) toprovisionally register this product for the control of ticks (Tick-Ex ) and otherpests. We have continued these evaluations in the laboratory and again in thefield in 2007 as product became available. Novozymes Biologicals, Inc. acquired Earth BioSciences, Inc. on September30, 2006, including the Metarhizium anisopliae insecticide product line. Theacquisition according to the press release fits into Novozymes position as aleader in the research, development, and manufacture of biotechnology productsand natural pest technologies. The company has made the additionalinvestments necessary to begin production and permit expanded field trials in2007. Additional studies were needed to examine field efficacy of the emulsifiableconcentrate (EC) formulation and timing of application for full registration andintegration into tick management program. Field trials to evaluate efficacy andspore longevity in the field were conducted by The Connecticut AgriculturalExperiment Station in summer 2007, May through August in northwesternConnecticut (CT). Trials were conducted at lawn edges at home sites in the threetowns of Salisbury, Falls Village, and Cornwall in cooperation with the TorringtonArea Health District. Treatments plots were established at the perimeters of theproperties in tick habitat ranging from 39-116 m2 at home sites (Table 1). The oil-based formulation (Tick-EXTM EC, Novozymes Biologicals, Inc., Salem, Virgina)with a concentration of 3.9x109 cfu/ml was sprayed by a commercial applicator(NaturaLawn of America, Danbury, CT) as directed by the principal investigatorsusing a high volume hydraulic sprayer at two application rates (2.6 fl oz /1000 ft2 lower rate  and 10.4 fl oz/1000 ft2  higher rate ) at 150 psi. A total of 20 homesites were sprayed - 11 sites were treated with lower rate (3.2x105 cfu/cm2 ) and9 sites were treated with five times higher rate (1.3x106 cfu/cm2). Based on thenumber of nymphs/100m2 recovered from these sites from 2003-2006, therewere no significant differences in nymphal abundance between the sites in thetreatment blocks. Control sites (n = 21) received no treatment. The fungus wasapplied two times; once May 8th and 9th and again on June 29th and July 2nd. Theeffective rates (viable spores applied) were 2.0x105 and 8.2x105 cfu/cm2 for lowand high rates, respectively, for the 1st application and 2.2x105 and 9.0x105cfu/cm2 for the low and high rates,respectively, for the 2nd application. After thefirst application 39.8 and 9.9 % control was observed from the lower and higherrate treated sites, respectively for the approximately 5 weeks post application.The percent controls obtained after the second application from lower and higherrate treated sites were 53.2 and 73.8%, respectively, for the period ending July30, 2007 and 36.5 and 77.8% for the 8 weeks ending August 20, 2007. However,percent control for the 3 weeks following the 2nd application was 87.1 and 96.1for the low and high rates, respectively. There was a significant difference in thetreatment groups in the number of nymphs collected for the whole samplingseason (DF = 2, F = 5.271, P = 0.005). In pair wise multiple comparisonprocedures, there was a highly significant difference between the nymphscollected from control and lower rate sites (t = 2.888, P = 0.004) as well asbetween the control and high rate sites (t = 2.319, P = 0.021). No significantdifference was observed between the low and high rate sites. Preliminary tests at CAES show that germination of the fungus is not affectedby 0.1% nootkatone, but there is inhibition at 1.0% (Bharadwaj and Stafford,unpublished data). As noted previously, a 1-2% rate of nootkatone appearsnecessary for control in the field (Marc Dolan, personal communication), a ratefar above the LC50 of 0.0029% (Panella et al. 2005). It may be possible to use alower economical rate of nootkatone when combined with M. anisopliae. In the course of the tick control research over the past 20 years, extensivecontacts have been developed with the Connecticut Department of Public Health,many local and regional health districts, people and businesses, such ascommercial applicators, and many stakeholders, such as homeowners, many ofwhom have provided access to their properties for tick surveys and controlstudies over many years. There is strong interest by the public in the continuationof these studies. The health departments will continue to work with us (see lettersof support). The principal investigator has provided information on ticks and tickmanagement to stakeholders through fact sheets, talks, lectures, workshops, andmost recently, a Tick Management Handbook (see Outreach below).D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSObjective 1. Identify all-natural, low-toxicity chemicals extracted from botanicalsources, including the eremophilane sesquiterpene, nootkatone, toxic to thenymphal stage of the blacklegged tick, I. scapularis, and devise formulations(water miscible, emulsifiable, and microencapsulated or other slow-releaseformulations to extend residual activity) for aqueous application to vegetation andleaf litter for the control of host-seeking I. scapularis (FOA research objectives 1& 2). Natural products evaluated against I. scapularis must include theeremophilane sesquiterpene, nootkatone, but need not be limited to thischemical. Other possible natural compounds for repellent and toxicity testinginclude nepetalactone (from catmint, Nepeta cataria) and curcumin with mustardoil (from turmeric, Curcuma longa, occasionally used as a tick repellent in India).Carvacrol, another component of the Alaska yellow cedar extract, has beenshown to have significant biological activity against I. scapularis, but has notbeen tested in the field. Some companies are using botanical or natural materialsfrom the EPA's 25b minimum risk pesticide list in mosquito and tick controlproducts. Products containing these active ingredients are exempt from therequirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).While products cannot bear claims to control disease or arthropods carryingspecific diseases, including ticks that carry Lyme disease, they are labeled forticks. Garlic-based products (e.g. Mosquito Barrier and Tick and Flea Solution)are already on the market and being applied for the control of I. scapularis.However, no data on its efficacy is available. The CDC project scientist willparticipate in the selection and approval of test natural acaricides. We will devise water miscible, emulsifiable formulations for testing the naturalproducts. The current emulsifiable formulation of nootkatone uses d-limoneneand EZ-Mulse (non-ionic surfactant for use with citrus terpenes) (M. Dolan,personal communication), but does not appear to possess sufficient residualactivity. Absorption by substrate, volatility, and degradation by environmentalfactors are common problems with a natural material. Dr. Robert Behle, NationalCenter Agricultural Utilization Research, USDA Agricultural Research Service,Peoria, Illinois, will evaluate the current EC for emulsification characteristics(ASTM standard E 1116) and determine if improvements are necessary toestablish a standard EC formulation to compare with subsequent formulationsamples. Slow/extended release or encapsulated formulation(s) to extendefficacy will be developed and evaluated in the laboratory for field testing in year2 and 3 of the project. We propose three techniques for encapsulatingnootkatone. These are: coacervation, an established technique in industry thatuses dilute solutions of carbohydrate and proteins to form a coating that can becured by crosslinking the shell material (Yeo et al. 2005), the FaneskTM process,developed in the USDA-ARS laboratory, that uses starch and a steam jet toencapsulate oils (Fanta et al. 1999) and spray dryer encapsulation using apolymer to encapsulate the oil emulsion in aqueous phase, then flash drying toform a dry powder (Gouin 2004). Storage stability of formulations for physicalcharacteristics, mixing characteristics, and loss of active agent at quarterly timeintervals for up to one year will also be examined and stored samples will beprovided for efficacy evaluation against I. scapularis. Efficacy Testing of Nootkatone Formulations - The extended releaseformulations will be evaluated in comparison with emulsifiable formulationsagainst I. scapularis nymphs in the laboratory using a modification of thedisposable pipette method (Barnard et al. 1981; Maupin and Piesman 1994).Nymphs will be exposed to inner surface of the pipette treated with the naturalproduct and extended formulation(s) for 24-h and observed for mortality. LC50and LC90 will be calculated using probit analysis. Suitable formulations will becandidates for semi-field and field trials. Nymphs of I. scapularis for thebioassays will be obtained by rearing female ticks collected in the field on NewZealand White rabbits in our tick rearing facility at Lockwood Farm, Hamden,Connecticut, as approved by the Experiment Station's Animal Care and UseCommittee (IACUC) (Protocol S01-05). Larvae hatching from the eggs laid by thefemale will be fed on laboratory mice to obtain the nymphs used in the trials.Objective 2. Field test formulations against populations (June peak >0.1/m2) ofthe blacklegged tick in Lyme disease endemic areas and determine whethercontrol of ticks using test chemicals is accomplished by direct toxicity to ticks infield plots via approach outlined in the proposal announcement. Based on laboratory results, we propose to evaluate selected naturalproducts in the field for acaricidal activity, repellency (see Obj"

Furthermore, as farming practices change, new biotechnologies are adopted, the number of degree-days per season increases with global warming, rate of invasions by exotic species increases, and new crops are introduced (e.g. as feedstocks for biofuels) it is likely that secondary pests or previously innocuous species from within the order will emerge as important pests. There is therefore an ongoing and pressing need to better understand the genetics, evolution and ecology of pest Lepidoptera. Meeting this need is often hindered by significant and well-known difficulties in obtaining satisfactory molecular markers for Lepidoptera. We have devised a technique that uses the power of massively-parallel, next-generation DNA sequencing to identify and assay genetic polymorphisms that we refer to as SIRRL (Sequencing Individuals in Reduced Representation Libraries). SIRRL has the potential to circumvent many of the problems that have limited and frustrated the application of molecular markers to the study of Lepidoptera. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated the soundness of the SIRRL method in principle. In this proposed project we will optimize SIRRL using the European corn borer (ECB) as a test case, including evaluating the utility of SIRRL for both linkage analysis and population genetics studies. Additionally, we will demonstrate its utility in two pest Lepidoptera for which little or no genetic resources are currently available. In addition to development, demonstration, and verification of this new type of marker for use in Lepidoptera, the particular markers generated in this project for the three pest species tested will be of immediate benefit to scientists studying them. Robust, co-dominant markers for ECB will be useful in efforts to map genes involved in resistance to Bt-toxins and to characterize gene flow between geographical populations, as well as between various races. Additionally, we will test the applicability of SIRRL to the western bean cutworm (WBC), a corn pest growing in importance as it invades the Midwest. Genetic markers for WBC will enable application of population-genetics tools to advance our understanding of the range expansion process and to characterize population structure in this species. Finally, we will test SIRRL as a tool to generate markers for Blastobasis repartella, a lepidopteran identified as a potential future pest of switchgrass with no prior genetic characterization. A likely early application of genetic markers in this species will be base-line population genetic structure and gene flow analysis to inform the development of management strategies."

Between control costs and crops losses, ECB has caused nearly $2 billion in losses each year. It is well known that the ECB consists of multiple population types that vary in a suite of fitness-related characters that determine patterns of gene exchange and outbreak dynamics in field populations. The work that we propose builds on our previous efforts to define the genetic structure of the ECB, and to map the genes that encode these ecologically-relevant phenotypes. Our immediate goal is to characterize the transcriptome of the ECB and to quantify gene transcript abundance. To accomplish this goal, we will use next-generation technology to sequence ECB transcriptomes derived from multiple tissues, developmental stages, and individuals differing in trait values. With respect to the stated priorities of the program we will utilize  newer-generation sequencing technologies for transcriptome analysis in order to address.key biological function[s] of.specific tissue[s] or life stage[s] relevant to future pest control.  At the same time, we will also provide the framework to  enable future studies on genome organization,  including mapping of genes, further characterization of gene families in Lepidoptera, and identification of targets of selection in the ECB genome."

Use of nitrogenous fertilizers has both economic and environmental costs. A mutually beneficial association between leguminous (bean-family) plants and a group of nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria collectively called ?rhizobia? enables the use of atmospheric nitrogen by plants. This association results in root nodules where rhizobia bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen for use by the plants and obtain carbon in return. Biological nitrogen fixation in root nodules of agriculturally significant legumes such as soybean can alleviate the use of chemical fertilizers and therefore is of high significance to US agriculture. Understanding the process of root nodule development might enable us to enhance biological nitrogen fixation and/or utilization. The first step is to identify and characterize novel cellular components involved in nodule development. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of recently discovered regulatory RNAs whose role in nodule development is largely unknown. This project aims to identify and characterize the role of selected miRNAs in nodule development by examining when and where they are expressed, what happens if they are mis-expressed, which targets do these miRNAs regulate and what roles those specific targets play during nodule development. Knowledge from the project might enable biotechnological manipulation of nodule development and biological nitrogen fixation and help sustainable production of food grains."

The meeting is held at 2-year intervals and for the last 30 years has been the premier forum for announcing and presenting the most compelling and novel scientific discoveries relative to the molecular events that mediate how plants and microbes interact. The meeting content considers both pathogenic and symbiotic associations. Reports will include those relevant to: fungal, bacterial, viral, and nematode pathogens; endophytic interactions; nitrogen-fixing and mycorrhizal symbioses; and even some unusual associations, like parasitic plant-plant interactions. Past Congresses have marked the announcement of seminal research breakthroughs, including but not limited to: the molecular basis of the Rhizobium-legume signaling system; identification of the role that Vir genes play in Agrobacterium T-DNA transfer, cloning and identification of pathogen avr and host resistance genes, Type III secretion system in pathogenic bacteria; molecular fundamentals of the innate immune response; complete genome sequencing of bacterial symbionts and pathogens, viral RNAi gene silencing, whole genome transcript analysis of the infection process; cloning and characterization of the mycorrhizal phosphate transport and symbiosis genes, and practical applications of fundamental knowledge in disease control. The Congress format will consist of international authorities contributing to overview plenary symposia, followed by invited speakers at more specific parallel (concurrent) symposia, and poster presentations. In order to maximize conference time and potential, an integrated conference style is proposed, permitting joint sessions of interest to microbiologists, geneticists, pathologists, biochemists, physiologists, and agronomists. Mornings will be devoted to Plenary Symposia, while in the afternoons concurrent sessions will be held. Poster sessions will take place in the evenings. Although focusing on the fundamental underpinnings of molecular plant-microbe interactions, the meeting will not overlook how fundamental advances can be translated into crop improvement, disease control, enhanced agricultural sustainability, and heightened understanding of plant development. An important and unique function of the MPMI Congresses is to bring together groups of scientists that otherwise do not cross paths. For example, researchers on symbiotic fungi (mycorrhizae) and symbiotic bacteria are both regular participants at MPMI Congresses, which is significant in light of the recent discovery that the same plant genes are involved in both interactions. Another example of interdisciplinary interactions that occur uniquely at the Congresses is between researchers in the areas of microbial/plant and invertebrate/plant interactions - the same class of plant genes that confer gene-for-gene resistance to bacteria and fungi are also involved in resistance to nematodes and aphids."

The repertoire of G-protein components in plants is relatively simple, with the presence of only two possible heterotrimers in Arabidopsis and rice, versus hundreds of possible trimeric combinations in animal systems. However the plant G-protein components are involved in diverse pathways including phytohormone signaling, cell division, ion channel regulation, environment sensing and biotic and abiotic stress responses of plants. These data have led to the hypothesis that the plant G-proteins integrate multiple signals to optimize overall growth and development under any given condition. Most of our knowledge of plant G-proteins comes from studies of gene knock-out mutants in Arabidopsis and a mutation in rice G alpha gene. Pharmacological evidence support the roles of G-proteins in soybean growth and development, defense response, nodulation and nitrogen fixation, however no biochemical or molecular-genetic data exist to date to validate these observations.

The bacteria role is to fix the nitrogen necessary for the legume host growth. To establish the symbiosis, the rhizobium must counter the plant defenses including toxic reactive oxygen species. The same molecules involved in plant defense also control the number of bacterial nodules and the extend of their productive useful life. The bacterial machinery that helps coping with the plant defenses is constituted mainly by secreted metallo-enzymes. Rhizobium species have an unusually large number of genes that code for metal transporting ATPases. These transport ions and heavy metals out of the bacteria. We hypothesize that these metal transporters are required to synthesize metal containing proteins essential for the interaction between rhizobia and plants. Consequently, these metal transporters would have a central role in the process of symbiosis likely affecting crop yields. This is relevant since pollutants such us cadmium, mercury, or nickel can easily inhibit these transporters. To study the roles of these enzymes we will use Sinorhizobium meliloti and alfalfa plants as experimental systems. The role of these proteins in nodulation and nitrogen fixation in alfalfa plants will accessed by measuring the plant growth and mass and the presence of these proteins in the bacteria during the plant growth. The metal transported by each particular protein will be determined using biochemical approaches. Finally, their role in metal loading of the secreted proteins and/or maintaining normal metal levels in the rhizobia will be established. Results from these studies will contribute to understanding not only the legume-rhizobium symbiosis, but also the mechanisms of plant defense that are critical during pathogen-plant interaction."

Surface-water nitrate concentrations routinely have been reported in excess of the 10 mg L-1 drinking water standard. This multi-disciplinary, multi-agency project, with over 50 years combined experience in water quality and organic agriculture research, aims to assist producers in developing systems that would facilitate access to the growing organic market while improving water quality on their farms. This is a long-term, integrated project encompassing research, extension and education, targeted at meeting Program Goals to improve water quality on organic and conventional farms through the development of science-based management practices identified as a result of state-of-the art water quantity and quality monitoring in replicated organic and conventional research station and on-farm sites. The hypothesis is that the use of integrated organic crop rotations with legume and grass crops will result in improved water retention and water quality by enhancing nutrient and water cycling in the soil-plant system. Our objectives include the development of nitrogen budget and water balance estimates from research sites and the identification of relationships between individual/integrative indicators of soil quality and water balance/environmental/productivity endpoints. Additionally, research results will be used to calibrate and validate the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) for organic grain cropping systems. Results will be presented in classroom and Extension programs and publications to facilitate producer involvement in self-development of water quality enhancement techniques. National environmental benefits include the reduction of crop nutrient losses, soil erosion, and pesticide transport; and improved security and quality of the food system."

Therefore, it is important for us to understand at the biochemical and systems levels how SNF works, what limits it, and how we might use molecular breeding approaches to improve it in the future. Transporters, especially those located in the symbiosome membrane (SM) surrounding nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, are believed to play key roles in SNF and may in some cases limit SNF. By deciphering the roles of SM and other membrane transporters in legume nodules, this project will help to identify which transporters limit SNF and, therefore, which will be good targets for biotechnolgy to enhance SNF and create superior legume varieties in the future."

This project focuses on the importance of N partitioning and interacting metabolic processes for biomass and seed production in soybean (Glycine max). In contrast to most plant species that acquire N from the soil, soybean and other legumes are able to directly utilize N2 from the atmosphere and fix it in special organs (nodules) in the root. Thus, they can grow even in absence of N fertilization. Following fixation in soybean nodules, the N is reduced to allantoin that is translocated to leaves and then to seeds for embryo development and synthesis of storage compounds. Ultimately, biomass and seed production are dependent on these N transport processes. Using molecular, biochemical, cell-biological and physiological approaches we will examine proteins that are involved in transport of allantoin throughout the plant and determine their importance for plant productivity, seed yield and seed quality. We have isolated two allantoin transporters from soybean that will be studied with respect to their cellular function. We will further analyze plants repressing and overexpressing the transporters in soybean to elucidate their role in N partitioning and their significance for biomass production. We aim to dissect the consequences of manipulation of N transport on biochemical processes and pathways, especially carbon and N fixation, assimilation and metabolism. The final goal is to develop tools for improving productivity and quality of important crop plants by manipulating organic N partitioning."

Plants are a rich source of basic sugars, proteins, and lipids essential for our normal growth and development, and supply vitamins and minerals required for many of the basic cellular processes necessary for life. Legumes are considered to be some of the healthiest foods in our diet. Although some provide the full complement of 15 minerals required for human metabolism), levels of the minerals vary among crops within the family. Among legumes, common bean are consumed by humans more than any other crop. Health benefits from eating beans are numerous and include reducing the blood cholesterol and sugar levels which in turn prevents or alleviates certain types of cancer, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Diets rich in zinc and iron, two micronutrients abundant in bean, can delay the onset of AIDS. Recent research has shown that beans significantly reduce the onset of breast cancer, colon cancer, and biomarkers for heart disease risk. PURPOSE. The Common Bean Coordinated Agricultural Project (BeanCAP) will strengthen the bean research, education, and extension communities by focusing on the genetics and genomics aspects of nutrition in this important food crop. The research component will translate current and newly developed genomic information into markers with broad utility to improve any trait of interest among the various bean market classes grown in the United States. The markers will be used in the first ever nation-wide project to define loci controlling a large collection of nutritionally important traits at both the species and market-class-specific levels. Each breeding program can then design the best strategy for the nutritional improvement of the market classes they work with. A genotyping service will support all public US breeding programs improving traits of local importance. Low cost markers that leverage the information from the high throughput marker screening will be developed for the long-term improvement of common bean. The marker and phenotypic data generated by this project will be organized along with all available genetic map, marker, and loci data into a database that is fully operable with other legume databases. The extension component will develop WWW-deliverable learning communities and learning sites that focus on the theme  Nutritional Genetics and Genomics: Healthy Foods from the Field to the Table.  These sites will inform educators and the public about the biology, genetics, and genomics of nutrition. High quality, narrated animations will be the primary learning tool. The educational component of the BeanCAP will also initiate a modern plant breeding training program focusing on early career recruitment and practical breeding/genomics training that illustrates, as an example, how the integration of genomic and phenotypic data can be used to improve nutritional traits in plants. This will provide a stream of students interested in filling the plant breeding human resource pool."

A major factor is the relatively high age of beef heifers at the time they have their first calf. To optimize productivity and economical returns, heifers should be bred to calve at two years of age. Age at puberty is an important factor if heifers are to be bred to calve at two years. Age at puberty is influenced by body weight and age which are primarily influenced by level of nutrition and cattle breed. The main pasture forages in Florida are too low in vital nutrients for adequate heifer growth development without supplemental feeding. In addition, due to hot and humid conditions, most cattle in Florida have some Brahman breeding. Brahman cattle typically reach maturity at a later age than other common breeds. Thus supplemental feeding would be of even greater importance for cattle with Brahman breeding. Supplemental feeding typically involves the use of high energy (i.e., corn, cereal by-products) and high protein feeds (i.e., various oil seed meals) which are imported into Florida and the Caribbean region at considerable cost. In contrast, locally grown legume forages may be able to provide the needed extra nutrition at a lower cost. Legumes are characterized by high concentration of protein and carbohydrates, and are highly digestible. Unfortunately, legumes that do well under the tropical/subtropical conditions encountered in Florida and throughout the Caribbean Basin are scarce. Several possible warm season legumes were recently evaluated as supplements to bahiagrass hay in trials with lambs at the University of Florida. Perennial peanut (Arachsis glabrata; PP) performed the best. Thus PP hay could be a good supplement feed for growing beef heifers. Two trials, done over consecutive years, are proposed to evaluate PP hay as a supplement feed to growing beef heifers fed free choice bermudagrass hay. The heifers will be place on experiment shortly after weaning (7 to 8 mo of age) and taken off the feeding phase at breeding (5 to 6 mo later). The PP treatment will be compared to a treatment with concentrate (corn and cottonseed meal mix; positive control) supplementation and a treatment with no supplementation (negative control). Blood samples will be taken weekly from all heifers to measure progesterone in order to determine attainment of puberty. We hypostasize that the supplementation of perennial peanut hay will result in similar or even better growth and attainment of puberty versus supplementation with a concentrate feed. It is anticipated that the reproductive productivity of young beef cattle females during the critical first three years of age can be improved by the use of locally produced perennial peanut forage as a supplementary feed. A typical beef cow in Florida will produce nine calves over her lifetime. Breeding heifers to calve as two year olds could increase that figure to 10 calves, an extra $500 gross income per cow."

It is based on the fact that all insects require sterols, and that plant-feeding insects typically obtain sterols from their food plants. Exploiting this need offers a novel, target-specific and environmentally friendly approach for controlling insect pests of agricultural crops. Currently there are few, specific strategies for controlling sap-feeding hemipteran pests. This proposal explores the potential of using plants with modified sterols. These sterols are not harmful to vertebrates (including humans), or parasitoids, but preliminary data indicate they are deleterious to sap-feeding hemipterans, particularly aphids. We have three objectives. The first is to identify sterols that negatively affect aphids. Here performance of green peach aphids reared on tobacco plants with modified sterols, and on artificial diets supplemented with various sterols, will be correlated with the profile of sterols consumed. Supplementary experiments will be conducted using soybean aphids and pea aphids. The second objective is to establish whether the modified sterols are deleterious for two major non-aphid hemipteran pests, whiteflies and tarnished plantbugs, by analysis of performance on modified tobacco plants. The final objective is to assess the range of hemipteran pests suitable for control by sterols by determining the sterol profile of some 20 additional hemipteran pest species, including glassy-winged sharpshooters and cotton fleahoppers. Our results will likely lead to the development of transgenic crops, containing modified sterols, needed to manage hemipteran crop pests."

Considering the high adoption rate and that virtually no ECB population recruitment occurred in Bt corn, there is a real potential for off-site suppression of this important insect pest. We propose here that there are significant off-site effects of Bt corn with indirect environmental, yield and productivity benefits on other crops that have not been determined. Using several lines of evidence, we will document and measure the off-site community effects of Bt field corn use on ECB populations and assess the environmental, yield and productivity benefits in terms of reduced insecticide use and environmental risks in vegetable crops, such as sweet corn, peppers, and snap beans that rely heavily on insecticides to control ECB as a major pest. Evidence to support our hypothesis of off-site suppression will be derived from analyses of new and existing databases, with metrics reflecting changes in ECB populations during periods before and after introduction of Bt corn. Information sources will include: 1) annual moth activity data from light trap monitoring; 2) annual fall survey data of overwintering larvae; and 3) larval infestation levels in the untreated controls of existing insecticide trials and current levels in sentinel field plots. To estimate the yield benefits for sweet corn, snap beans, and peppers due to ECB population suppression, a hierarchical model will be developed to link measures of ECB population density to crop damage and yield loss for both the pre- and post-Bt periods. Reductions in insecticide use will be based on ECB moth flight data comparing probabilities and frequencies that moth flight numbers exceed action thresholds for pre- and post-Bt corn years. Separate analyses will be performed for each state/region with varying rates of Bt corn use. To capture the environmental benefits of estimated reductions in insecticide use, we will measure environmental impacts using the environmental impact quotient (EIQ) and the more recent multi-attribute toxicity factor MATF. The proposed research addresses environmental assessment needs noted under Program Area 4 subsections of the BRAG FY2009 RFA, which includes assessment of benefits resulting from reduced environmental risks accrued by the adoption of currently commercialized Bt corn. It also will illustrate a methodology to help federal regulators address the comparative environmental assessment of costs and benefits of IPM systems involving Bt or other transgene technology that have similar off-site suppressive effects on target pests. Results will contribute significantly to our understanding of how the deployment of Bt corn has altered the population dynamics of a major target pest and impacted the pest management practices used in other crop systems."

These techniques will ultimately be incorporated into potato production systems. Outreach and education targeted specifically at biologically based IPM and ecosystem production methods are essential to promote adoption by growers. In Wisconsin we have developed the foundation for biointensive IPM education. We are now proposing to continue the educational efforts which will enable growers to integrate biointensive IPM strategies into existing production systems. The overall momentum of the Collaboration has been extremely strong with many accomplishments such as the continuation of the marketing effort, enhancements of the Collaboration standards, improvements of resistance management protocols, database implementation, grant coordination and expansion of the development and use of educational tools for growers. We have worked with numerous faculty, industry representatives, potato and other commodity organizations, and environmental organizations to export this agricultural model for targeted and industry-wide change. In Wisconsin, this work is expanding to other vegetable crops, such as carrots, peppers, beans and peas, and is now also expanding to fruit crops. Furthermore, we have enhanced the ecological portions of the Collaboration by working with national and local environmental organizations and expanding our research with University of Wisconsin faculty by involving their expertise, research and education into the project. We need to maintain this strength while exporting the model of industry-wide agricultural changes through the use of policy and communication efforts. The success of the adoption of biointensive IPM programs by growers will be measured utilizing the measurement system previously developed by the Collaboration. At the conclusion of this project we expect to have completed detailed performance evaluations for a range of reduced-risk pest management alternatives. We will use this information in the educational activities and materials to provide growers with detailed efficacy and economic analysis of various alternatives which can be used by individual growers to refine their pest management practices to more biologically based, less toxic practices. The marketplace rewards which have been generated through the eco-labeling project in Wisconsin have also created a favorable climate for our biointensive IPM strategies to be adopted throughout the region.

Although this disease is well documented, limited information is available concerning which species of Pythium and Phytophthora are most responsible for disease damage. Understanding the etiology of Pythium blight on snap bean and other hosts is necessary to achieve disease control. The first objective of this research is to establish the causal agent(s) of Pythium blight, examining variation in strains collected from different hosts and locations. To date, several isolates were collected on the Eastern Shore of Virginia and attaining additional isolates is necessary to establish the primary causal agent nationwide. Current isolates were identified to species using morphological characterization, and confirmed by molecular techniques. Most isolates were identified as Pythium aphanidermatum using both methods, and variation in virulence on multiple hosts will be determined. The potential variation in sensitivity within this pathogen population to fungicides will be evaluated. Sensitivity has not been reported in isolates from vegetable crops, and will be tested in vitro and in vivo. Preliminary research was conducted to develop field and greenhouse inoculation methods of Pythium blight on snap beans for fungicide sensitivity screenings. This research aims to increase our understanding of the causal agent(s) of Pythium blight and its possible variation in sensitivity to effective fungicides."

IR-4 priority settings, crop profiles, and Pest Management Strategic Plans are not available for summer fallow. As zero tillage practices become more common, herbicide use will continue to increase. Currently, mechanical tillage is the only practical alternative to chemical fallow. However, tillage decreases residue cover, resulting in increased soil erosion. Strategic grazing of grain stubble and weeds by sheep offers an alternative to traditional stubble and weed management, and no-till biomass reduction for seed bed preparation with the added benefit of not negatively influencing soil nutrient cycling or increasing erosion potential. In addition, sheep grazing summer fallow may significantly reduce use and thus selection pressure for glyphosate resistant weeds by precluding the need to control weeds with glyphosate. Our goal is the profitable incorporation of sheep into grain production systems to reduce pesticide and fossil fuel use in fallow and stubble management. Our objectives are: 1: Compare two cropping systems and three management systems on: Above ground and seed bank weed and volunteer crop community composition, The crop systems are 1) Continuous spring wheat. 2) Three year rotation, spring wheat ? spring planted forage pea/hay barley intercrop? summer fallow in a three year rotation with each component present every year. Within each crop rotation, the management systems are: 1) No-till with sheep grazing to manage summer fallow, crop residues, and to harvest the forage crop; 2) Minimum tillage with herbicides use to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage for seed bed preparation; 3) Conventional Tillage used to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage used for seed bed preparation. 2: Using production and input data, compare profitability and cash flow of our two crop rotations and three management systems. We will publish and communicate to both academic and producer clientele results and potential economic and biological advantages of incorporating sheep grazing stubble and weeds into sustainable grain farming systems. Our preliminary results indicate no differences for grain yield among summer fallow systems. Our interdisciplinary team of scientists anticipates a positive long term biological and economical outcome from the integrated system of weed management by sheep grazing, and significant reduction in herbicide use in the Northern Great Plains. The proposed system encourages profitable cooperation between diverse agricultural enterprises by linking a source of inexpensive feed for sheep producers with a successful pest control method for grain farmers."

One of the defining features of legumes is their ability to form a root symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia. A significant property of the symbiosis is its host specificity, which is controlled at multiple levels involving both rhizobial and host genes. Understanding of the host genetic control mechanisms involved in determination of host specificity will enable breeding for enhanced nitrogen fixation in crop legumes and facilitate the study of the molecular ecology of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. A number of single dominant genes (e.g, Rj2, Rj4 and Rfg1) that restrict nodulation with specific rhizobial strains have been identified in soybean since 1960s. These dominant genes restrict nodulation through recognition of incompatible rhizobial strains, resembling those `gene-for-gene' interactions between plants and pathogens. The observation that the Rj2 allele is located within a disease resistance (R) gene cluster on the soybean linkage group J has led to the speculation that the dominant nodulation restriction genes may encode plant R proteins that play an important role in limiting the host range of rhizobia. The goal of this project is to map and clone the soybean genes Rj2 and Rfg1, taking advantage of the availability of genetic and genomic tools in soybean. Cloning and characterization of these genes will not only provide novel insights into the evolution of host specificity in legume nodulation but also contribute to our understanding of the similarities and contrasts between pathogenic and symbiotic plant-microbe interactions."

Michigan is the number 1 producer of pickling cucumber and squash and ranks among the top 10 in the USA for the production of fresh market cucumber, snap bean, bell pepper, pumpkin and fresh market and processing tomato. Michigan cultivates 81,350 acres of Phytophthora-susceptible vegetables worth $143 million and 7,600 acres of Fraser fir worth $10.6 million. Phytophthora can be easily spread across and within agricultural regions via water. Phytophthora management is complicated by its large host range and lack of known disease resistance in vegetables. Phytophthora can last for 10 or more years in soil and it is common for growers to experience complete crop loss in some fields. Some strains of Phytophthora have mutated to become resistant to key fungicides and have colonized an estimated 25% of the acreage in the Michigan growing region. Disease outbreaks occur yearly and recent losses have become so large (up to $32.5 million) that the economic viability of these Michigan industries is at risk. This project seeks to reduce losses suffered by Michigan growers and stakeholders by developing integrated management strategies that emphasize cultural methods and environmentally friendly practices. Research will include investigating ways to limit the spread of Phytophthora; identifying and developing cultivars that are resistant to Phytophthora disease; investigating soil amendments, mulches, crop rotation and water management as new techniques for managing Phytophthora; and testing fungicides, biological control agents and new chemistries for disease control. Phytophthora management recommendations for growers will be developed from research results and demonstrated in on-farm trials and presented at extension meetings."

We will explore the potential to create effective mulches from pure preparations and mixes of shredded recycled newspaper and dried cover crop residues that can be grown on site. Our objective is to develop mulches using readily available materials and tools, that can be easily spread on the soil surface (i.e., around growing vegetables), and, which, after wetting, bond to themselves to create an impenetrable barrier against weeds. Shredded newspaper, when wetted, has been shown in previous research to have this tendency, but it is not known how to prepare a mulch to ensure that the mulch fragments will bond to each other, creating a solid barrier. We will determine the influence of different preparation methods on mulch cohesion including the width and length of mulch fragments and the amount and force of watering the mulch after it is spread on the soil. We will also determine if mixing shredded newspaper with plant residues that naturally suppress weeds through the release of chemicals that are toxic to germinating weeds (i.e., allelochemicals) increases weed control compared to newspaper alone. In addition, we will determine to what depth mulches need to be applied to control annual and perennial weeds that emerge from organs of different types and sizes (i.e., seeds, tubers, bulbs, etc.) so that appropriate mulch rates can be selected according to the types of weeds present. Mulches of different composition and with different physical characteristics can influence permeability to water and thus soil moisture, the spread of fungal spores to crop leaves through rain splash from the soil surface, and the availability of soil nutrients for crop growth as mulches are decomposed by soil microorganisms, which consumes nutrients. We will test the effect of mulches prepared from different materials on their overall effects on the growth of vegetables, including heirloom tomato, Edamame soybean, and sweet potato. These species have different growth habits (upright, trellised, or spreading), nutrient needs, and susceptibility to disease. Finally, we will do a budget analysis to determine the most cost-effective mulches, considering the costs of preparing, applying, and weeding (if needed) the mulches, and the expected return from crop sales. Our expected outcomes are 1) development of new sustainable, cost-effective, and user-friendly weed control strategies; 2) an improved scientific understanding of the physical characteristics required for a mulch to prevent weed emergence; and 3) the development of guidelines for the small farmer on how to prepare and apply mulches at a minimum cost to achieve good weed suppression and also build soil quality."

The most serious in the region are Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) and Bean leaf roll virus (BLRV) both of which are vectored virtually exclusively by the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Klein et al. 1991, Clement 2006, Clement and Eigenbrode, 2007). Aphid outbreaks and virus disease epidemics occur intermittently and unpredictably in pea and lentil in the region threatening the viability of the industry. The most recent epidemic occurred in 2005. Although occurring in 6- to 9-year intervals their cause is unknown. Virus prevalence among years in the Palouse is greater during aphid outbreaks but not consistently so. In non-outbreak years, severe injury from virus disease can still occur in individual fields. Current practice for aphid control and virus reduction is to treat aphids aggressively with dimethoate when virus risk is considered high. Growers currently have no quantitative way to assess this risk, however, and rely on inspection of plants for symptoms and their own perceptions of risk. Other growers, seeking to reduce inputs try to avoid treating for aphids, leaving the crop open to virus injury. When virus is not suspected, insecticides are often used to prevent direct injury by pea aphids and simultaneously to treat for pea weevil (Bruchus pisorum). Insecticide-use decisions currently depend on simple rules-of-thumb (Homan et al. 1992), based on opinion rather than quantitative guidelines. These recommendations do not provide producers with loss models or economic thresholds that account for crop value, insecticide costs and crop yield potential. Critically absent are economically justified recommendations taking into account the effects of pea aphid as a vector of viruses. The primary purpose of this project is to provide necessary economic information for formulation and implementation of coordinated, virus-forecast based, pea aphid control strategies with the goal of reducing the industry?s vulnerability towards PEMV and BLRV. The key for such management strategy is that if producers knew in advance when severe epidemics of PEMV and BLRV were likely to occur, and whether their particular fields were prone to infection, they would be forewarned of the need to apply recommended vector control measures to manage these viruses. Alternatively, if risks were known to be low, growers could manage the aphids as direct pests, reducing pesticide use and concomitant environmental and economic impacts. However, it is important that such forecast based conditional management strategy be economically justified. The model will be based on profit maximization framework and will produce optimal, cost minimizing, strategies for PEMV and BLRV virus control. The model will be used to provide answers to what is the economic value of virus forecast based strategies for controlling pea aphids as virus vectors. The model will also permit economic analysis of the value of information, risk management, economic interrelationships in production input usage, pest dynamics, etc. (McCarl, 1981)."

Many of Kentucky's farms are small, averaging 164 acres, compared to the U.S. average of 418 acres. There were 85,300 farms in the state in 2008. According to the 2007 census, 67 percent of all Kentucky farms sold less than $10,000 worth of agricultural products. Interest in alternative crops, including horticultural enterprises, has risen dramatically. This interest continues to increase because of the tobacco quota buyout. Horticultural crops offer Kentucky growers potential alternatives. A number of farms have successfully initiated commercial vegetable enterprises. Other farms are seeing the potential success of horticultural crops, but many lack the technical knowledge and management skills for immediate success with these production/marketing systems. Kentucky's grain producers are searching for ways to improve the market value of the crops they grow. Examples of potential specialty grain types include edamame (green vegetable soybean) and soft white winter wheat. An emphasis on bioenergy has increased the need for research on a variety of crops that have potential for energy production, including hulless barley, sweet sorghum, and biomass crops such as switchgrass. Growth in the organic food industry has led to a need for research on organic production of both horticultural and grains crops. This project is designed to develop and deliver Kentucky farmers the knowledge they need to assess new crop opportunities. Eleven horticulture and specialty grains projects will be conducted by researchers at the University of Kentucky as part of this overall New Crop Opportunities, KY, project. The New Crop Opportunities Center will feature a Web site for 24-hour access to information on new crops for Kentucky, including the horticultural and specialty grains crops that are the focus of the Center's research. Center staff will answer questions from Extension agents and farmers, and will distribute new crop information at field days and conferences. The Center will facilitate the packaging of information from its research and other sources for dissemination. The expected outcomes/impacts of this project will be an increase in knowledge among Kentucky farmers and county extension agents about production and marketing systems for a variety of new crops. This increase in knowledge should allow farmers to make informed decisions about which new crops to try, and how to market those crops, based on information available on the Center's research projects, as well as through its crop and marketing profiles. Anticipated benefits include greater profitability for Kentucky's farmers as they successfully transition to a variety of crops that are new to them."

The proposed and recently initiated research will explore areas to improve sustainability of various production systems. Some will be organic, others will be conventional production. Several cover crop studies presently underway will be continued on several farms. They will be continued through the end of 2008, the termination date for a NE SARE Partnership project that was secured to provide additional support for this work. The focus of cover crop studies will be to reduce weed pressure on cash crops in the rotation and improve soil fertility. Increasing nitrogen production from legumes in an age of increasing energy costs will be a necessity. The OFR coordinator will continue to provide guidance to a county extension educator for a dairy feeding study begun in 2007. The focus of this effort is to demonstrate that through reducing the amount of protein fed lactating dairy cows, animal performance can be maintained and possibly improved while reducing the feeding cost of milking cows. The project is being conducted on ten farms. A Pennsylvania Soybean Promotion board funded project will be initiated during 2009 to develop a soybean network in PA of growers who seek to conduct their own on-farm evaluations. They employ some of the latest computerized planting and harvesting mapping capabilities. Coupled with aerial photography, these tools will aid in the identification of yield and profit-limiting factors in soybean production. Researchers from Penn State and Rodale Institute will continue a project that seeks more consistent performance for farmers who want to grow heavy cover crops and use the relatively new concept of crop rolling to control them. The OFR program is supporting this project through three on-farm sites in PA, NY, and MD. Proven and experimental practices/treatments will be utilized on these private farms to demonstrate the potential for this technology to reduce or eliminate the use of herbicide in a subsequent corn or soybean crop. The recent large increase in fertilizer prices, especially nitrogen, has prompted strong promotion of several products that are added to N fertilizer to reduce losses to volatilization and leaching. Two on-farm studies will be conducted during 2009 to complement one being conducted at the experiment station to quantify relative efficiencies of N utilization when urea is treated with commercially available products. A dairy cropping systems trial, supported by NE SARE, will commence during 2009 at the Agricultural Experiment Station at Penn State. Components of this study, overseen by the OFR program, will be tested on several smaller dairy farms. The OFR coordinator will assist project leaders in recruiting farmers to serve on a project advisory panel. Other areas of research are identified as the on-farm research coordinator continues to discuss production problems and possibilities for collaborative research with producers, county and state Cooperative Extension personnel, PASA organizers, and representatives of other agencies."

There are the Three Sisters: corn, beans, and squash, grown together by the Haudenosaunee, and lodgepole pines, used as the framework for dwellings in the West. Less well known are the varieties of sage and cedar used in the blessing ceremonies of the Potawatomi and Ponca, or the medicinal herbs used by the Creek or the Cherokee. Many of these native plants are in decline. The threats are numerous: introduced pests and diseases, habitat destruction, competition from exotic weeds, misuse of pesticides, inappropriate harvesting. USDA's website, www.plants.usda.gov, lists several thousand plants that are threatened or endangered at the federal or state level. There are 260 plants listed as culturally significant. A comparison of the two lists finds several dozen that are both culturally important and threatened or endangered. Many native plants receive scant attention from breeders and growers. There is little incentive for commercial ventures to put research dollars into projects that have low potential return. Many plants, however, have more than monetary value. They are part of the natural and cultural heritage of this nation and they serve an important part in maintaining the integrity of the ecosystems that sustain native wildlife. The benefit of diversity is one of the cornerstone concepts in ecology. An ecosystem made up of many different species provides stability and a synergistic energy to a habitat. For instance, differences in the timing of plant germination, growth rates, flowering, and fruit/nut/seed production among different species, provides food for a wide variety of wildlife across the growing season. The loss of a wide diversity of plants in favor of a few opportunistic growers diminishes our natural landscapes. This two-year study will investigate new techniques for the propagation of red elm, gray alder and russet buffaloberry. All three of these plants are of cultural significance to Native American tribes because of their medicinal properties. All three of these species have low reproductive rates and subsequent declining populations. Red elm is an upright tree of 60 to 70 feet. It is used to treat skin conditions such as boils, burns, and inflammation. Poultices made from the gummy secretions from the elm's bark were applied to infected wounds. Red elm is also used in traditional medicine to treat respiratory conditions, coughs, and as an eye wash. Gray alder is a tree or shrub used to treat anemia, as a compress or wash for sore eyes, for internal bleeding, sprains, bruises, flux and piles. Russet buffaloberry is a shrub or small tree with dark gray, sometimes spiny branches. The fruits are red and berrylike. It has therapeutic value in treating amoebic dysentery, angina pectoris and malaria. This project will apply cutting-edge propagation techniques to try to improve seed germination or cutting establishment success for these three species. The success of this propagation enhancement project will be determined by the development of new techniques that will help ensure the long term survival of these culturally significant species."

Further, to have an even greater impact on students and to directly benefit producers in the US, the proposed project involves a US component using the same methods and a systems approach to understand 1) food system-disease interactions and 2) barriers to supply and value chain development supporting agriculture. Both issues concern agricultural producers and processors locally. Finally, the African and US field experiences are integrated with training in the new Community, Environment and Development major in the College of Agricultural Sciences at Penn State.

ND is number one in US production of 10 crops - durum wheat and hard red spring wheat, barley, oats, flax, all dry edible beans, dry edible peas, lentils, sunflower, and canola - is third in sugar beet, fourth in potato, and ninth in soybean (ND Ag. Statistics No. 77, 2008). The value of all crops ranges from $ 4 to $ 6.5 billion/year (ND Ag. Statistics No. 77, 2008). Pest problems may severely impact yield and quality any given year, threatening the economy of the state and region, and export capacity. Examples: Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley resulted in several billion dollars loss to the state's economy from 1993-2005 (Nganje et. al., 2004; McMullen, 2005); other pests impact crops each year (Sugarbeet Research and Extension Report, http://www.sbreb.org; ND Crop and Pest Report (http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/aginfo/entomology/ndsucpr/index.htm). ND producers use pesticides as one management tool to combat pest outbreaks. For example, in 2004, 45.4% of cropland was sprayed with herbicides, 2.3% with insecticides, and 5.4% with fungicides (Pesticide Use and Pest Management Practices Survey in ND, 2004). This survey also showed that ND producers increased their use of IPM practices, such as use of field scouting and forecasting models, between 2000 and 2004 surveys. ND has a short growing season and a harsh winter climate. Citizens place high value on urban plantings which can survive the winter and which are relatively free of pest problems. A recent electronic questionnaire about urban IPM needs, sent to extension educators in 8 states of the High Plains region, including ND, indicated that almost 40% of their pest questions. This IPM project addresses those critical needs, by coordinating a statewide IPM program, providing collaborative efforts in pest management education across two states for two key crops, wheat and soybean, by demonstrating the value of integrated strategies for controlling a key disease of wheat, Fusarium head blight, by supporting the valuable resource of the NDSU Diagnostic Lab that services agriculture, homeowners, and the ornamental industry, and by increasing the outreach capabilities of the Urban IPM programs."

These core skills include pest identification, crop staging, scouting techniques, and general management practices. Some information is applicable to more than one cropping system (i.e. agronomic and vegetable crops). However, growers and consultants in several cropping systems need customized training. To achieve these trainings, educational programs for scouts, growers, and consultants that utilize classroom training, in-field, hands-on training, field days and demonstration plots will be delivered by the UW IPM Program. 2) Advanced IPM Knowledge: Growers and consultants need crop-specific IPM information to implement daily pest management decisions. A few current examples of needed management information include information on western bean cutworm, foliar fungicide use on corn, insect management in cucurbits, weed management and reduced reliance on organophosphate insecticides in cranberries, and pest management training in nursery settings. 3) Efficient IPM Programming: Cost effective and safe pest management is essential to the profitable production for all of the diverse crops grown in Wisconsin. The UW IPM Program efficiently coordinates IPM activities by providing leadership with industry groups including WI Integrated Pest and Crop Management Technical Advisory Committee, Wisconsin Association of Professional Agricultural Consultants, and Certified Crop Advisors to advance IPM educational opportunities in Wisconsin. The UW IPM Program also collaborates with other University of Wisconsin campuses to teach IPM scout training classes and other training programs. The overall benefits of the IPM Program are to increase agricultural profitability while minimizing environmentally hazardous pest management practices. Benefits include basic education that provides the skill set necessary for students and crop advisors to implement IPM practices. Applicator training will reduce pesticide spills and mishaps, which will directly reduce environmental impacts and improve applicator safety. The core IPM educational programs will provide the basic skills necessary for all crop consultants and growers to improve/protect profitability and limit the environmental impacts of pest management. Advanced training sessions provide decision making tools to make economically sound decisions; information on pesticide use timing and proper selection to ensure greatest economic benefit if/when used; and resistance management techniques that reduce overall amount of pesticides used."

The primary Reservation population centers include the communities of Worley, Plummer, Tensed and DeSmet. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe has an abundance of natural resources such as lakes, streams, timber and farmlands. The Tribe established a Farm Enterprise in 1970, their current operation includes about 6,000 acres and produces wheat, peas, lentils, rapeseed and bluegrass. The local educational system faces many challenges. In 2007-2008, the graduation rate for Native American youth on the Reservation was only 28% (Idaho State Department of Education). The school district has failed to meet Adequate Yearly Progress on state achievement tests for five consecutive years and is now dealing with state sanctions. Tribal leadership is concerned about keeping the youth involved in land-based and environmentally related activities and careers. Among American Indians 25 years and older on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation in 2000, 26 percent had no high school diploma and 6 percent had a bachelor's or college degree. However, the Tribal Department of Education has seen an increase in tribal members enrolling in education, and there are currently 60 tribal members receiving financial support for their pursuit of associates', bachelors' and graduate degrees. Only one of these recipients is pursuing a degree in an environmentally-related field. Anticipated Outcomes by Objective: The overall goal is to increase the quality of life on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation primarily through agriculture and natural resource education and life skills development for youth and adults. 1. Youth will have improved workforce skills that will increase their competitiveness in the job market; youth will choose careers in science, technology and natural resource fields and continue their education beyond high school; Youth will have increased cultural competence. 2. More families will grow their own food; families will have increased income from their land; improved natural resource and environmental stewardship will be demonstrated by community action. 3. Indian people will not lose their land; fractionation of Indian land will be reduced; there will be an increase in the number of individuals who have a will or estate plan. 4. Communities will have improved economic stability as reflected in population demographics, higher employment rates, planning, laws and ordinances that ensure long term community sustainability; communities will have completed a comprehensive plan; increased University outreach activities on the reservation. 5. Community leaders will be more inclusive in decision making process; reduced demand for community services (low income); families will have reduced expenses related to maintaining a home/property; youth and adults will reduce their debt (credit) load; there will be an increase in community collaborations, networking, and partnerships; improved communication among community residents, organizations and agencies."

From such a suite of models it should be possible to assemble modules capable of simulating many other crops with appropriate parameter changes and additional rate equations to fill up the gaps.  The existing models for weeds, diseases, and insects will be further developed and integrated with crop models.  In instances where mechanistic models to describe some processes do not exist, or are inadequate, new models of those processes will be developed.

(Pullman)NP216 Cross-location project associated with Pendleton, OR 5356-13210-003-00D(Long).Approach:1A&B.  Several multi-year field studies will be conducted in numerous locations in the low to intermediate rainfall zones to evaluate seeding date, rate, and methodologies for winter and spring canola in order to improve crop establishment. Data collected include seed-zone water, soil profile water storage, weed populations, crop yield, and oil and meal content.1C.  A multi-year study will be conducted in the high-rainfall zone to compare grain yield and wild oat suppressive ability of facultative wheat planted in late fall with that planted in April/May the following spring. Within each time of planting, wheat will be grown non-treated or treated with recommended or half the recommended rate of a wild oat herbicide. Wild oat population and seed production will be measured prior to grain harvest and crop yield and quality (dockage) will be determined. Consumptive water use will be determined with gravimetric soil profile samples before planting and after harvest.1D. Spring forage triticale will be planted in a naturally infested field of Russian thistle in a 2 to 3-year study. Half the plots will be sprayed with a herbicide to control Russian thistle and the weed will be allowed to grow in the remaining plots. Forage quality of the triticale will be analyzed with and without the weed and the total weed and crop biomass will be weighed. Total systems production costs will be determined and crop water use will be calculated.2A&B. Field experiments will be conducted to evaluate the performance of diversified cropping systems in the low, intermediate, and high rainfall zones. A 3-yr rotation of winter wheat, spring canola, and forage winter triticale will be compared to a rotation of winter wheat, spring barley and spring pea in the high rainfall zone while a 3-yr rotation of winter triticale, spring canola, and fallow will be compared to a rotation of winter wheat, spring barley, and fallow in the intermediate rainfall zone. The bioenergy and forage potential of two perennial species grown along stream channels will be evaluated within all rainfall zones. Biomass, grain yield, and economic and risk analyses will provide insight into overall performance.4B.  Specific themes will be defined that can be flexibly used to derive Agroecological Zones (AEZ) based on criteria that are relevant to the question asked. Three basic steps to design and develop relevant AEZ will be used: 1) Generate raster surfaces of biophysical and socio-economic variables through spatial interpolation of data; 2) Generate a spatial framework of AEZ by combining basic raster themes into more integrated variables; and 3) Characterize spatial units in terms of relevant themes such as zones separating commonly practiced cropping systems. After AEZ development, model calibration, and long-term field studies synthesis, what-if scenarios will be developed and current and future cropping systems will be evaluated. In collaboration with scientists directly involved with specific modeling we will apply calibrated models to long-term data sets to corroborate these models under a wide-range of regional conditions.

While farmers may consider moving to an organic system, continuity of economic viability during the transition from conventional to organic farming systems is a serious challenge. There is little scientific, organic-based information for farmers as they choose among the options available for the build-up of soil organic matter, maintenance of soil fertility, crops and cultivars, and disease and insect pest management practices.

However, their adverse effects show the clear need to change production methods to achieve sustainability, economic success, conservation of natural resources and avoidance of adverse disturbances to the agroecosystem and neighboring centers of human population. Plant-associated microbes can help to increase grain yields world wide without compromising food production to accommodate population growth by improving the success of sustainable agricultural practices that use biological processes to enhance the crop's output without irreparably damaging the natural resource base where the crop can be grown. Some soil microbes are admirably suited for use in  biofertilization  programs that boost crop yields while reducing chemical fertilizers in biosafe and sustainable ways. Cereals are the major source of food for human nutrition. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is most prominent staple diet for the world's population. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is 2nd in importance as a major carbohydrate source. Their high grain production has only been possible with high N fertilizer inputs. The environmental problems associated with inorganic fertilizer usage could be mitigated if the cereal crops established a more direct and intimate association with beneficial bacteria that promote their growth and increase their grain yield while simultaneously reducing their dependence on chemical N-fertilizer inputs. Although some agricultural biofertilizers (e.g., Rhizobium for legumes, Azospirillum for wheat, and cyanobacteria for rice) are already used in crop production, none till now have satisfactorily replaced the full fertilizer N demand to maximize yield potentials under field conditions. Therefore, discovery and development of more effective biofertilizers that can reduce the dependence on chemical N-fertilizer inputs to maximize cereal crop yields is a high priority area to help achieve the goals of sustainable agriculture worldwide. Our development of new, reliable agricultural biofertilizers addresses the important real-world problem of limited biologically available N in cereal crop production and shows that exploitation of natural beneficial plant-microbe associations is environmentally sound and has high intrinsic probability for success. We will continue basic research to increase knowledge of beneficial plant-microbe interactions of agricultural importance, especially those involving Rhizobium and cereal crops, and utilize this knowledge in real-world, sustainable agroecosystems. The expected outcomes will provide crucial information needed to succeed in implementing environmentally sound, biofertilizer inoculants into sustainable agroecosystems. Major beneficiaries of the applied information are Ag extension agents, low-income farmers in developing and 3rd-world countries who commonly produce cereal crops on marginally fertile soils but cannot afford to utilize chemical fertilizers, and worldwide manufacturers of biofertilizer inoculants in both the general and private sectors."

An example of non-host resistance is the immunity that a pea has for a bean pathogen. My major objective is to totally analyze the basis of this resistance at the gene expression level. This information will probably be required by pathologists and plant breeders to harness this strong form of resistance or to manipulate it in crop plants. We previously have utilized individual components involved with enhancing disease resistance to increase yields and the natural immunity of plants in the field. That is, the fungal component, chitosan, can enhance resistance to the root rotting fungi of wheat and consequently also increase the yield of wheat. Chitosan has been used in other agriculture applications such as weed control and plant protection. Although many laboratories are progressively locating disease resistance genes on the chromosome of crop plants, the mode by which they become active in the environment of the nuclei in which they reside remains speculative. My research is focusing directly on understanding the conformation changes of the chromatin that are involved in regulating these genes."

Legumes are also unique in their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, a property that is important both in plant nutrition and environmental quality. Nitrogen fixation results from a novel symbiotic relationship between legume roots and soil bacteria known as rhizobia. My lab is interested in the genes that control how legumes interact with other living organisms, both beneficial ones like symbiotic rhizobia as well as disease causing pathogens. Previously, we developed genetic mapping resources for locating and characterizing disease resistance genes, primarily in soybean. These resources have proven especially useful as tools for marker-assisted breeding. More recently, research in the lab has shifted to genome sequencing as a framework for gene discovery and the development of tools for genetic analysis and breeding. As part of this shift, we have focused on a model legume, Medicago truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa. Medicago exhibits typical legume biology but also has several characteristics that make it favorable for genetic analysis. This research has led to the nearly complete genome sequence for Medicago and the characterization of numerous symbiotic and disease resistance gene families. In the next few years, we will exploit genome sequence data in soybean and Medicago to discover new genes of agriculture importance and develop improved tools for legume improvement. Specifically, we will focus on sequence-based markers known as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that provide exceedingly powerful capacity to identify and isolate genes of interest. We will begin by discovering many thousands of SNP markers in M. truncatula and then translate this technology to alfalfa. In M. truncatula, we will use SNPs primarily to map and clone genes that control the capacity of legumes to form symbiotic relationships with rhizobial bacterial. In alfalfa, we will use SNP markers to develop enhanced disease and stress tolerance along with increased biomass. In soybean, large numbers of SNP have already been described. We will use these SNPs to create a large relational database that integrates the genetic marker data for Minnesota adapted germplasm together with results of field and greenhouse experiments. In the process, we will develop the capacity to identify pairs of soybean lines that are most favorable as parents for new breeding populations, as well as faster and more efficient markers for selecting disease resistant cultivars during the course of the breeding program."

Michigan ranks in the top 10 nationally for nine vegetable crops in spite of the fact that we are limited to summer production only. These rankings include 1st in pickling cucumber and squash production; 2nd in celery production; 3rd in asparagus and snap beans; 4th in processing carrot and fresh market cucumber production; sixth for pumpkins; and 9th for potatoes. Commercial vegetable production in Michigan, including potatoes, is valued at >$350 million/yr. Along with our diversity of vegetable crops comes equally diverse vegetable insect pests, pest/crop situations, pesticide registrations, and pest management systems. Control of insect pests is particularly critical on vegetable crops where appearance is a major consideration and crop value and risk of loss are high. For example, in 2000, average gross value of celery harvested in Michigan was $6,800/A, peppers were valued at $8,600/A, onions were valued at $2,300/A, cabbage was valued at $4,800/A, and potatoes were valued at $2,940/A. Insecticide use in vegetables is primarily aimed at preventing cosmetic injury or contamination and is often much higher than would be required to protect from yield loss. However, unlimited use of pesticides is no longer a practical or desirable alternative for pest control. Costs of pesticides continue to rise (the result of increased costs of petroleum products and increased research and development costs) and the regulation of pesticides under the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act continues to become more restrictive in response to increased concern for public health and safety and increased knowledge about the effects of pesticides on non-target systems. In addition, insecticide resistance problems are severely limiting the effectiveness of insecticides for control of insect pests in Michigan vegetables. To avoid severe economic losses and serious conflict between agricultural, environmental, and public health needs in the future, we must identify cultural and biological controls that can be integrated with or substitute for chemical controls to manage insect pest problems in Michigan vegetables. The benefits derived from such research will include: 1) Increased efficiency and effectiveness of pest control, 2) Decreased costs and numbers of pesticide applications, 3) Increased safety for agricultural workers, 4) Decreased potential risk to consumers and the environment, and 5) Increased sustainability and stability of pest/crop systems. EXPECTED OUTCOMES/BENEFITS AND ANTICIPATED BENEFITS Outcomes of this research will be directly applicable to the efficient and economical production of vegetables in Michigan. Expected benefits are reduced control costs and losses to insect pests and reduced need for insecticide applications to control pests."

F. graminearum causes head blight of wheat and barley and stalk and ear rot of corn. The severe economic effect of this disease on Midwestern growers is due to the reduced grain yield caused by the fungus, and the presence of the mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol, in contaminated grain. The fungus is spread during the growing season by the forcible ejection of spores (ascospores) from small fungal fruiting bodies (perithecia) on the surface of the crop residues. When the airborne spores land on flowers, they infect and begin to colonize the developing grain. Elimination of the ascospores would result in vast reduction in disease. There are several other fungal diseases of Michigan crops that rely on forcible ascospore discharge to initiate the disease cycle. These include apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), white mold of beans (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), brown rot of peaches (Monilinia fructicola) and purple spot of asparagus (Stemphylium vesicarium), as well as others. The mechanism of forcible discharge is not clear in any fungus, but we have used Fusarium graminearum as a model system to develop an understanding of how small cellular cannons called asci function to fire their spores. We have made progress in this arena and have identified several methods to inhibit discharge in this fungus. We are beginning to explore the common effects of these methods on other fungi that similarly launch their spores. This project will investigate the mechanism of forcible ascospore discharge and how the phenomenon can be inhibited. MAES delineated 5 target areas that are the major research foci for the experiment station. This research directly impact 3 of these areas. Since F. graminearum produces two major mycotoxins, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol, elimination of the disease would result in better food safety and health to the people of Michigan. In addition, the severe economic consequences of the disease through low grain weight and mycotoxin contamination, which impact grain value, would be reduced by this research, enhancing the profitability of the grain. Finally, knowledge of how to control ascospore discharge could be potentially applied to all pathogens which rely on this dispersal mechanism. This information would help to control the spread of invasive pathogens."

Compound leaves occur in a number of plant species across many orders and in some very primitive families. Unfortunately, little is known about development of compound leaves. So far, two different patterns have emerged that are exemplified by two model crops: tomato and pea. In tomato, an interaction between KNOX1 (a homeodomain transcription factor) and the hormone gibberellic acid (GA) control the level of  compounded-ness  or dissection. GA suppresses leaf dissection and antagonizes KNOX1-induced increases in dissection. Auxin also suppresses dissection in tomato leaves. In contrast, the LEAFY gene (=Unifoliata (Uni) in pea), auxin and GA promote the development of larger and more dissected leaves in pea. In addition, GA and auxin regulate Uni expression, and our hypothesis is that this is the primary regulating pathway in pea leaf morphogenesis. Other researchers have shown that this gene plays a role in the development of compound leaves of California poppy, and suggested that it may be involved in the development of dissected leaves in many plants, including many crop plant families. It appears that two redundant pathways, KNOX1 and LFY/UNI, controlling leaf dissection is the ancestral condition in dicotyledons. Both mechanisms have been retained in some lineages, whereas one or the other has been lost in others. I wish to understand the gene and hormonal relationships that regulate leaf development and why they differ in tomato vs. pea so we can identify genes to modify. Pea provides the best a model system for studying the role of LFY/UNI in the development of compound leaves because the physiological, genetic, and molecular resources and transformation technology are better developed than for other species. Mechanistic processes from pea could provide valuable information on the evolution of compound leaves in the flowering plants as a whole, as well as for other legumes. My hypothesis is that changes in expression domains of auxin are a driving force controlling the diversity of leaf form in plants, and in determining which regulatory pathway is used to make compound leaves in different plant lineages, like legumes. These data will accelerate the long term bioengineering impacts."

Unfortunately, diseases impact these crops annually. The objectives described in this project have the goal of understanding the biology and spread of pathogens to develop improved management strategies for vegetable diseases. Basic research in understanding pathogen biology and plant-microbe interactions has made incredible gains in the past decade; however few of these advances have been translated into improved disease management strategies. We have been utilizing multiple technologies to better understand three serious vegetable diseases. 1) New York State is one of the nation's leading producers of fresh market and processing cabbage. Black rot, caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, is generally considered the most significant and serious disease of cabbage and other crucifer crops around the world. 2) Fresh market tomatoes are essential to the expanding number of farm stand and community supported agriculture growers in New York. Bacterial canker, caused by Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm), has been the most common bacterial disease problem on fresh market tomatoes over the past five years. This pathogen has not been well-studied, in part because of the difficulty in working with Gram-positive bacteria. 3) Phytophthora blight, caused by the pathogen Phytophthora capsici, is a devastating disease of many solanaceous (pepper, eggplant and tomato), and cucurbit (squash, melon, cucumber, gourd and pumpkin) crops. The disease has also been found on snap and lima beans. In recent years, the disease has increased in importance in New York and eastern states, causing severe losses in a short period of time during heavy rainfall events. The experiments described in this proposal will utilize all available technologies to develop improved management strategies for these three significant diseases."

In plants proline is important for adaptation to stress such as drought, heat, and high salt. Proline also stimulates the synthesis of phenolic phytochemicals in plants that have therapeutic applications. In insects, proline is stored in flight muscles and is a primary fuel used during flight.

The fixed nitrogen produced in these nodules acts as an internal source of fertilizer for the plant, and enables legumes to grow vigorously even in nitrogen-poor soils. Environmental conditions have profound effects on the ability of a plant to nodulate. In order to develop sound agricultural practices, we must increase our understanding both of the effects of different environmental conditions as well as the mechanism of the plant response. Light is one of the most important aspects of a plant?s environment. Preliminary data from our lab indicates that different wavelengths of light have the ability to increase or decrease nodulation in Medicago truncatula. Further, we demonstrate that the effect of light on nodulation may by mediated by the plant hormone ethylene. We propose to further characterize this regulatory network composed of light signaling and the ethylene pathway. Our goals are to determine how these two pathways interact, and how they function together to modulate nodulation. Ultimately, this research could result in recommendations for farmers of legume crops that could improve nodulation."

Despite US national air quality regulations aimed at controlling ground level ozone pollution, it continues to be of major concern for crop production and forest health especially in the northeastern US. Many counties each year are in violation of the current National Air Quality standard. There is an ongoing need for research and assessment of ozone effects on crops and forests to determine severities of impact, estimate economic costs, project future effects, provide needed justification for regulatory changes, and possibly improve plant tolerance to ozone damage through breeding. Current rough estimates are that ozone alone causes $3-5 billion in crop loss annually due to injury rending the crop unmarketable (e.g. spinach) and reducing plant productivity. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Science Advisory Committee (CASAC), the quantitative evidence linking specific ozone concentrations to specific vegetation effects must continue to be characterized as having high uncertainties due to the lack of data for verification of those relationships. Intended outcome of this project is increased knowledge of the impact of ambient ozone on plant productivity. The research plan for NY is to participate in the multi-state, multi-year experiment to assess impact of ambient ozone on plant productivity by growing under open field conditions the ozone sensitive and tolerant snap bean cultivars and white clover lines developed for this work. These were selected for this project because they grow similarly except when exposed to elevated concentrations of ozone due to their differing sensitivity to ozone. They will be exposed to ambient ozone. The information obtained on impact of ambient ozone on productivity of the sensitive plants will provide justification for changes in regulatory policies. Science will be advanced when the data from investigating impacts in several US locations is combined to model spatial-temporal aspects. The intended beneficiaries of the research findings include US EPA, USDA (especially Agricultural Air Quality Task Force), US National Park Service, US Forest Service, crop growers, horticulture and forest production/management sectors, urban planners and industries contributing to emissions of ozone precursors. At the local level, audiences include home and Master Gardeners, landscape and nursery managers, crop producers, arborists and managers of public parks and recreational lands. Additionally, vegetable crops known to be sensitive to ozone that are grown on Long Island will be routinely examined for symptoms of ozone injury and resulting impact on the plant. Research results and observations on ambient ozone affecting Long Island agriculture will be shared as appropriate with members of the media, legislators, air quality surveillance staff, other public and private organizations, and educators. Field tours of ozone impacts on plants will be provided when possible."

AM fungi are beneficial symbionts that colonize roots of most plants, including grain crops and legumes. They are well known for their role in improving plant mineral nutrient uptake. AM fungi also have the ability to form simultaneous associations with multiple plants of different species. We postulate that the ability of AM fungi to interconnect different crop species may allow direct translocation of nitrogen from legumes to corn in mixed cropping system. We want to understand whether such connections could help reduce nutrient losses from cornfields and improve the economic viability of corn-for-biofuel production. Corn is a significant part of the agricultural economy of NYS. With the rise of interest in biofuels, markets for corn are expanding. However, a major concern about the viability of corn-for-ethanol production is that energy inputs to grow corn may exceed the energy obtained from it, and one of the proposed solutions is to grow mixtures of other crops besides corn. Other concerns include nutrient losses through leaching of nitrate to groundwater, and release of greenhouse gases from excess nitrogen applied early in the growing season. We propose that AM fungi, by interconnecting corn and legume plants in mixed cropping, may permit the same nitrogen benefit from fewer legume plants in comparison to rotating corn and legume crops. The ability to achieve the benefit of rotation with legumes, without the need to take a field out of corn production, could allow more corn could be grown with less fertilizer. Fungal facilitation of direct nitrogen translocation from legumes to corn could also prevent the loss of nitrogen, which is generally applied to a field before the time that the corn needs it most. Since these losses impact groundwater quality and greenhouse gas emissions, the economic benefit to the farm would be also ecologically sound. We believe that the pairing of corn and bean in agricultural fields in NY can perform well. This type of intercropping yields more than individual monocultures of each plant in diverse regions of Central America, the Midwestern US, and African highlands, and has been used historically by native peoples of NYS. To understand the dynamics of nutrient translocation in mixed corn-bean cropping system, we will grow corn and bean plants together in greenhouse experiments with AM fungi collected from NYS fields. We will trace carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus movement in the fungi and between the plants by using isotope labeled compounds fed to the roots or leaves. Knowledge generated by this project will expand scientific understanding of how AM fungi and plants interact. This information will be available for extension to improve the viability of NY farms in the expanding corn markets. Agricultural research and extension will also benefit from AM fungal isolates generated by this project. The AM fungal isolates will be available for field trials, and to growers."

The goal of this study is to isolate and characterize genes (cDNA) for disease resistance from leucaena. Leucaena-specific cDNA fragments will be isolated by subtractive hybridization, using cDNA fragments of a closely related genus of tree-legume, Acacia confusa as the driver cDNA. After subtraction, the resulting fragments will be cloned and sequenced. It is expected that some clones will have no similarities with any known protein sequences, representing unique genes specific for leucaena. It is also expected that genes with partial similarities with some known genes will also be identified through this method. Sequences encoding pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins) such as glucanase, chitinase, thaumatin-like protein, trypsin inhibitor, and cysteine proteases will be selected. PR proteins are known to play a significant role in the defense mechanism against pathogens and insect pests, and also provide tolerance to abiotic stresses. Isolation of full-length cDNA for these PR proteins and their introduction into susceptible plants should be a useful strategy for developing disease resistance in agriculturally important crops."

Agricultural management procedures can exercise some control over some of these factors, and only to some extent. However, a long term and sustainable approach to maintain and increase crop productivity is through the genetic manipulation of crops in ways that allow them to maximize the utilization of available resources, to adapt to particular environments and to resist pathogens. Accordingly, the objectives of this project are: 1) To characterize genetic mechanisms involved in disease resistance in plants, and 2) To identify genes that control growth and developmental responses to the environment. These objectives will be accomplished by analyzing progenies from crosses between cultivars that differ in their responses to particular pathogens, or environmental factors. The location of genes that encode resistance to pathogens, or favorable responses to the environment, can be identified when genetic analyses are carried out with the aid of genetic markers from known locations on the chromosomes of the crops. These markers can be used to select for particular traits in a breeding program, or can be used physically isolate the target genes for more detailed examination, and possible molecular manipulation before they can be re-introduced into the plant. This project aims to isolate up to five genes involved in resistance to plant viruses. These genes can potentially be used in other crops that are attacked by the same viruses. In addition, aims to identify a yet to be determined number of genes involved in controlling growth and development in the common bean. The association of these genes with molecular markers will be used to modify an existing computer model. It is expected that the gene-based model will be able to predict crop performance under a range of environments. The usefulness of this model is that it will help select the best cultivars for specific zones based on their genetic makeup, and eventually could be used to direct breeding efforts, not only of the common bean, but any other crop that has a map of molecular markers (most do) and a computer simulation program."

R.",,,002236250,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,FL,32611-0110,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2009,,,"Nematodes are very important pathogens of most agronomic and horticultural crops produced in Florida. The state has both an ideal environment and suitable hosts for most of the major plant-pathogenic nematodes. Nematode life cycles are short thereby enabling them to generate multiple generations within a cropping season resulting in large population densities in a short period of time. Without doubt, some of the most severe crop damage that occurs in Florida is a result of plant-pathogenic nematodes. Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are among the most important soilborne pathogens in Florida. There are currently 14 species of Meloidogyne known to be present in the state. Many crops are subjected to parasitism by more than one species including most , e.g. solanaceous, cucurbits, and crucifer vegetable crops, as well as cotton, peanut, soybean, tobacco, field corn, and many leguminous forages and cover crops. The sting nematode (Belonolaimus longicaudatus)is a very damaging pathogen of cole crops, strawberry, soybean, cotton, field corn, sorghum, sesbania, turf grasses, and many other grasses including digitgrass, Bermudagrass, and limpograss. Other important nematodes with wide host ranges include stubby root (Paratrichodorus and Trichodorus spp.), lesion (Pratylenchus spp.), lance (Hoplolaimus spp.), awl (Dolichodorus spp.), and ring (Criconemella spp.). In cotton, the reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis) has become a widespread problem in Florida. Estimated statewide losses from nematodes include: vegetables (strawberry, snap bean, sweet corn) 10%; soybean 9%; sugarcane 4%; potato 10%; field corn 15%; peanut 15%; tobacco 4%; and cotton 7%. In local situations, nematode damage can be completely devastating in individual grower plantings of many crops, e. g., squash, cucumber, eggplant, pepper, strawberry, okra, and peanut. Crop losses from nematodes are further compounded by nematode and soilborne disease complexes such as Verticillium wilt, Fusarium wilt, and bacterial wilt. It must be emphasized that losses on most agricultural crops would be many-fold higher if it were not for nematode management programs already in existence. For example, nearly 100% of tomato, pepper, eggplant, melon and strawberry plantings are treated annually with multipurpose-soil fumigants. Almost all soybean cultivars grown in Florida are root-knot and cyst nematode resistant. Production costs for most agricultural crops are rapidly rising. This has become particularly important recently since many agricultural inputs are petroleum-based. Hence, there is a continuing need to maximize crop production by reducing the influence of factors that limit yields. Also, greater emphasis is being placed on environmental issues regarding agricultural production. This has encouraged widespread support for developing agricultural practices designed to preserve and enhance environmentally-sound and sustainable methods for managing plant-pathogenic nematodes."

Our desert clientele see dairy and beef as alternatives that allow them to diversify and maintain profitability. However, hot summers induce alfalfa to suffer a  summer slump  that slows growth and reduces forage quality. The most common annual summer crops to supplement forage demand, sudangrass and maize, produce lower quality forage, require more fertilizer, and often have adverse effects on subsequent rotational crops. Growers have asked that we find potential solutions that would sustain forage production and improve crop diversity and productivity. We will investigate the potential of several legume crops as forage, their fit in current production systems, and intercropping these legumes with maize in Arizona. Alternative legume forage crops, such as lablab (Lablab purpureus), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) will be planted in early summer and regularly harvested to evaluate quality and yield. A bare ground treatment will also be included in the study as a control, and all treatments will be followed by a fall planting of wheat. Pre- and post-plant soil nitrogen will be measured, as well as the nutrient status of the wheat crop. Field experiments at research stations in the 1st and 2nd year will quantify yield and quality of these forage crops and their effects on the following rotational crop. We will work with participating growers to conduct an economic analysis to help choose the best alternatives for farms typical of the region. After legumes with high quality and yield are identified in the environment of Arizona and southern California, on-farm trials will be conducted in the 2nd and 3rd year with participating growers to investigate the potential of the legumes crops alone and intercropping these legumes with maize to improve the quality of grass forages. Research findings will be disseminated to growers and other agricultural professionals by field days, presentations at grower meetings, one to one communications, and extension publications. Growers will participate by providing fields for trials, helping develop experimental plans and give feedback on results, and advise research scientists on the future direction of the project. We expect that growers will adopt more annual legume forage crops into their current cropping system to increase sustainability of by improving soil fertility, increasing growers&#39; profitability, and increasing system diversification in the region."

When present in high concentrations, nitrate in drinking water can be toxic to infants under 6 months and may contribute to human and livestock health problems. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has estimated that the water from 10% of Wisconsin wells exceeds the state public health standard for drinking water. Legumes are distinguished by their unique property of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in association with bacteria called Rhizobia. This symbiosis provides one of the major sources of available nitrogen in the biosphere and produces, every year, a quantity of available nitrogen that is equivalent to the amount synthesized by the fertilizer industry throughout the entire world. In the US alone, legumes are grown on over 80 million acres, where they fix approximately 6 million metric tons of nitrogen worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The aim of this project on DRPs in Medicago truncatula is to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to the establishment of this nitrogen-fixing symbiosis in order to avoid, in the long term, drawbacks associated with the intensive use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers, such as the greenhouse effect and water pollution by nitrates. Legumes are one of the most important families of plants worldwide. Together with cereals, legume species have been fundamental to the development of modern agricultural systems, with soybean and rice in Asia and maize and beans in the Americas. Legumes are also the third largest family of flowering plants. On a worldwide basis, this plant family contributes 33% of humankind's protein intake, while also serving as an important source of fodder and forage for animals, and of edible and industrial oils. In response to the need for a tractable genetic system in legumes, scientists have developed M. truncatula as a model species. Of particular significance, M. truncatula is amenable to efficient molecular, genetic and reverse-genetic analyses, unlike the major crop legumes. Recently, the Nitraginc Company has commercialized a mix of Nod factors and Rhizobia under the name of OptimizeTM LCO Promoter TechnologyTM for soybean, peanut and alfalfa. The effect of this product on the yield can be correlated with the stimulation of root development. We intend to develop the use of Medicago truncatula as a model plant to study biological and agronomic issues important to legumes such as biomass yield and, in the long term, to develop improved legume crops for sustainable food, feed and Biofuel production. Therefore, this proposal is relevant to meeting the national strategic Goal 4 (Improve the Nation's Nutrition and Health) and Goal 5 (Protect and Enhance the Nation's Natural Resource Base and Environment) established by the REE Mission Area and the USDA CSREES. This project is also relevant to Wisconsin Goals 5 and 6 for research on more sustainable agricultural production that provides improved environmental protection and economically viable communities but also for research on enhanced productivity for food and bio-fuel crops in a sustainable manner."

Some of this nitrogen comes from soil organic matter, but the majority of the nitrogen is produced by a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria living on the plants roots. (Lindemann and Glover, 2003; Tien et al., 2002). This bacterium, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, fixes nitrogen from the air to produce ammonium which can be used by the plant (Balatti and Pueppke, 1992). Inoculating soybean seed with B. japonicum is widely used to ensure that adequate levels of healthy bacteria are present near the seed to facilitate N fixation. In fields where native rhizobia levels are low due to lack of soybean in the rotation or environmental stress, inoculation can increase yields by 50% or more. (Duong et al., 1984; Seneviratne et al., 2000). After an initial inoculation of a field, B. japonicum will survive for many years and future inoculation will not increase yields as much as the initial one. There is a mixture of results on the efficacy of successive inoculations after initial use of B. japonicum products. Some evidence that successive inoculation can increase yields is presented by Beuerlein, 2005 and Conley and Christmas, 2006. However a number of trials did not see yield increases (Abendroth and Elmore, 2006; Pedersen, 2003; Vitosh, 1997). In another study, use of soybean inoculant raised soybean yield in 6 of 14 site-years in fields that had been in soybean rotation in a Michigan study (Schulz and Thelen, 2008). Soybean inoculants are inexpensive and fairly convenient to use. The commercial inoculant industry in Wisconsin and the Midwest is vibrant and very competitive. Newer inoculants from several of these companies contain multiple improved strains of B. japonicum and claim better nitrogen fixation efficiency leading to higher yields. Recently, inoculant manufacturers have added lipochitooligosaccharide nod factors to their inoculant products. These products are meant to elicit responses which increase infection and nodule formation (Smith et al., 2004). Inoculation of soybean, while relatively inexpensive, can be very important to the profitability of a soybean crop. Understanding the environmental conditions when inoculation should be used would greatly benefit WI soybean growers and make crop input decisions easier. Previous research has not looked at a matrix of environmental factors that might affect the performance of inoculants."

Small grain cereals (winter and spring wheat and spring barley) account for more than 80% of the acreage annually. Traditional rotation crops are pea and lentil. This has prompted many of the region's growers to investigate alternative crops to avoid the disease build up and other problems associated with monoculture cereal production. Brassicaceae crops such as canola, rapeseed and mustard have shown potential as good rotational crops. The reasons behind high cereal yield following Brassicaceae crops is as yet not fully understood, and are almost certainly a combination of several factors, including; a break from monocot crop production; long tap roots that break up soil compaction; improved water percolation; high plant biomass that improves the soil physical structure and water holding capacity, and reduces erosion; and these crops have glucosinolates, which break down in the soil to produce toxic pesticidal substances . Breeding efforts resulting from this proposal will develop superior Brassica oilseed and mustard cultivars that are highly adapted to a wide range of dryland and irrigated regions of Idaho and other U.S. regions. Availability of these crops will offer growers greater flexibility and alternatives to include in crop rotation, help to reduce crop inputs, improve profitability and sustainability, and make growers more competitive in international markets."

This project will use comparative and experimental studies, in both field and laboratory, to build on our existing base of coccinellid research and explore various aspects of the life history and ecology of these species that relate directly to their efficacy in biological control of cereal aphids. 2) Mitigation of Yield Losses to Dectes texanus in Cultivated Sunflowers. Among the management tactics to be explored in field experiments are: (1) reduced plant spacing to increase stalk girth and 'standability' while delaying stalk desiccation (and hence onset of girdling), (2) use of a late-season irrigation pulse to delay stalk desiccation relative to seed desiccation, (3) use of 'soft' desiccants such as glyphosate to accelerate seed desiccation relative to stalk desiccation, (4) use of the 'stay-green' stalk trait to delay stalk desiccation relative to seed desiccation, and (5) characterization of resistance factors in wild sunflower. 3) Integrated Management of Multiple Insects Attacking Late Season Soybeans in Kansas. A series of on-farm yield-response experiments will address a complex of key insect pests impacting late-season soybeans. We will monitor densities of key insect pests (e.g., bean leaf beetle, corn earworm, stink bugs, soybean looper, soybean aphid, etc.) and generate a range of insect infestation levels using insecticides and exclusion cages. We will then measure yield responses and calculate damage thresholds for these pests alone and in combination. 4) Adapting a Mechanistic Growth Model to Generate Field-Specific Economic Thresholds for Soybean Aphid. We will adapt a mechanistic growth model to describe soybean aphid population dynamics, improve our ability to forecast population growth rates, and increase the effectiveness of econmic thresholds. 5) Evaluating Biocontrol and Host Plant Resistance Strategies for Managing Soybean Aphid in the North Central U.S. Using field experiments, we will assess chemical control/resistant variety interactions in the context of controlling soybean aphid and evaluate resistant soybean varieties and their interactions with biological control agents. 6) Integrated Pest Management of Multiple Insects Attacking Sorghum in Kansas. We will re-evaluate long-standing treatment recommendations for key sorghum pests with a focus on caterpillars attacking whorls and seed heads. We will delineate yield-loss relationships for economically relevant sorghum pests using exclusion cages in commercial production fields and small-plot experiments, and also identify key parasitoids of economically important species. 7) Evaluation of Pesticides for Managing Arthropod Pests in Kansas Field Crops. Field spray trials will be used to test efficacy of existing and novel materials against three major arthropod pest groups that threaten corn production in this Southwest Kansas, corn borers, rootworms and spider mites. In addition, small plot trials will be used to identify insecticides with activity against D. texanus in soybeans."

In Idaho and the USA, pinto bean occupies more than half of the acreage. Pinto (and other market classes of race Durango) dry bean cultivars are highly susceptible to white mold [caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary], an endemic and widely spread disease. Moreover, Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV, aphid-vectored potyvirus) and Beet curly top virus (BCTV, leafhopper-vectored curtovirus) are endemic to Idaho and other western states, and broadly adapted cultivars also would require resistance to rust [caused by Uromyces appendiculatus (Pers:Pers.) Unger]. Most pinto cultivars are of full-season (taking 100 days or longer to maturity) and have a prostrate growth habit Type III, which enhances white mold and is not suitable for direct harvest. Early maturing upright multiple disease resistant cultivars would minimize yield losses, reduce pesticide use, and facilitate direct harvest thus reducing fuel use, farm labor, and production costs. We aim to (1) identify sources of upright growth habit and early maturity in pinto bean germplasm and cultivars, (2) pyramid resistance to the four diseases, and (3) combine the upright growth habit, early maturity, and pyramided multiple disease resistance into slow darkening (i.e., taking longer than six months for an appreciable change in seed coat color) high yielding broadly adapted pinto bean breeding lines and cultivars. Multiple-parent crosses, gamete selection, and direct disease screening will be used. Also, greenhouse nurseries may be complemented with field crops to facilitate and expedite selection for seed yield, upright plant type, and early maturity. New pinto breeding lines will be evaluated in the greenhouse for reaction to multiple diseases and in the field for seed yield, early maturity, upright plant type, and adaptation within and outside (through the Western Regional Bean Trial and national Cooperative Dry Bean Nursery) of Idaho to identify broadly adapted pinto bean breeding lines and cultivars."

Over 40% of agricultural cash receipts in Texas are from cattle and calf production, and cash receipts accounted for $7.6 billion in 2007 (ERS, 2009). Texas is the primary sheep and goat producing state in the USA, and the value of sheep and goat product sales was $107 million in 2007 (NASS, 2008a). Approximately 70% of the lifetime diet of beef cattle is forage (Heitschmidt et al., 1996), and this figure is slightly less for dairy cattle and much greater for sheep and goats. In the South Texas Plains, ranches are large and the primary profit is shifting from beef cattle production to wildlife hunting leases. This change is driving a desire for renovating pastures from introduced to native forages. Besides providing nutrition for grazing livestock, forages in the region are also important for maintaining water quality and providing erosion control along waterways and near the Gulf of Mexico. Using forages for soil remediation caused by salt contamination and in rotation with traditional row cropping systems also have potential for this region in the future. The present push towards production of sustainable bioenergy through the cultivation of cellulosic feedstocks may also present new opportunities for forage use. The large quantity of forage utilized for livestock production throughout the USA and the South Texas Plains indicates that improving the efficiency of forage production, management, and utilization can improve the efficiency of livestock production. This forage management research program will focus on: 1) evaluation of newly introduced and native forages and unique methods of managing readily available plants, including forage and row crop species, to improve the efficiency of livestock production; 2) assessing parts of the forage-animal-soil system as a whole to determine how production and management changes may improve the sustainability, and thus, productivity of forage-based livestock production; and c) simultaneously evaluating the value of forages for other uses such as wildlife, cellulosic biofuel production, land remediation, green manure crops, or cover crops for erosion control. The goals of this program are broad, but must be inclusive of the issues within the South Texas Plains physiographic region. Unifying this program of interest is the use of legumes and forbs with a systems research approach. Information gathered with this program may provide sustainable remedies for problems facing livestock production, bioremediation, biofuels, and crop production practices."

The most common broadleaf rotation crops in these cereal based cropping systems are grain legumes: dry pea, lentil, and chickpea. Acreage of grain legumes is decreasing and alternatives are needed. In addition, many of the lower rainfall areas (16 inches of annual precipitation or less) of Washington are not suited to grow grain legumes, and do not have acceptable broadleaf crop rotation options. If an acceptable broadleaf rotation crop was available in the lower rainfall areas, it could be incorporated into the cropping system with minimal impact on wheat production. Furthermore, if that broadleaf rotation crop is a biofuel crop, the conundrum of food versus fuel associated with biofuel production from crop plants could be minimized. Camelina is an oilseed crop of interest that meets much of these criteria and has been recently grown on substantial acreage in Montana, and is starting to be produced in Washington and other Pacific Northwest states on a very limited basis. Information about cultural practices and adaptation of camelina in Washington is needed by growers to make decision about utilization of this crop in rotation with wheat. With a good technical knowledge base supporting adoption of camelina, the overall productivity and production of this useful oilseed will support a Washington biofuel industry and crop agricultural in general. This project will produce field based production information about adaptation and cultural practices for camelina. Needed information includes: cultivar performance, fertilization requirements, planting practices, adaptation to different growing environments, and integration of camelina into a wheat cropping system. Project studies will address these information needs, and together with information from other similar areas, should provide the technology to rationally utilize camelina in Washington wheat based crop production systems. Complementary efforts from the private and public sectors to contract camelina acreage providing growers have a place to sell camelina, registration of herbicides, approval of camelina meal for animal feed purposes, and a grower support network should facilitate adoption of camelina as a biofuel rotation crop for wheat based production systems in Washington."

The common goal that binds together the projects in this proposal is the search for novel approaches to pest management that avoid can hazards of both kinds. The diversity of these sub-projects reflects the necessity to explore as many aspects of insect biology as possible, in order to find new ways of suppressing pest populations. The specific studies to be conducted are as follows. (1) We will test the three main hypotheses that have been advanced to explain the fact that trees in landscape plantings which have been treated with the systemic insecticide imidacloprid are often subject to devastating outbreaks of spider mites. Discovery of the underlying mechanism should help identify ways to avert these mite outbreaks, and help us better understand and control pest outbreaks in general. (2) We will conduct a genomic analysis of geographic variation in the progress toward specialization and speciation on different hosts of an introduced pest of forage crops, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum,Homoptera: Aphididae). Understanding the ecological and genetic mechanisms of specialization can help to discover management tactics that can derail the evolutionary processes that lead to host plant specialization in pest species. (3)We will investigate the viability and efficacy of entomopathogenic (insect-attacking) nematode worms as a sustainable non-chemical means of controlling root-feeding pests of field and turf crops in Maryland. (4) We will test new approaches for preventing contamination of the environment by entomopathogenic (insect-attacking) fungi (EPFs) which have been genetically engineered for increased ability to kill pest insects, thereby alleviating biosafety obstacles to widespread application of this promising new pest management technology. We engineered the gene for an insect toxin from a scorpion into the fungus, in such a way as to have the toxin produced only when the fungal cells are inside the pest insect. This prevents the toxin from contaminating the environment. We now need to develop technology that can block both spread of the engineered fungus in the environment, and its possibility for interbreeding with wild counterparts. (5) We will investigate an apparent case of genetic differentiation and speciation in progress in a native holly leaf miner fly (Phytomyza glabricola; Diptera: Agromyzidae), driven by the recent separation of its host plant into two species. An understanding of the process of population divergence and speciation is central to understanding how agricultural and horticultural insect communities have evolved, and hence how they are likely to change under selection imposed by pest management practice. We will use both genetic analysis and cross-mating and cross-rearing experiments to determine the the degree and kind of differentiation that has thus far developed between the two putative ?host races? of the holly leafminer and their host plants."

It is a high yielding, protein-rich perennial, with well defined agronomic practices, seed industry support, and extensive translational genomics resources in the closely related model species Medicago truncatula. A major disadvantage, however, is its potential for causing pasture bloat due to excessive rumenal fermentation of dietary protein to methane. Bloat occurs when ruminants are fed high protein forages such as alfalfa that lack proanthocyanidins (PAs) in their aerial portions. By binding to protein and slowing its rate of rumenal fermentation, modest amounts of PAs in forages reduce the occurrence of bloat and at the same time promote increased dietary protein nitrogen utilization in cattle and sheep. The economic impact of the development of a  bloat-safe  alfalfa will be enormous for ranchers and producers in the US. However, classical breeding approaches have failed to introduce PAs into alfalfa foliage, and the problem will likely require a biotechnological solution. This is, unfortunately, limited by our lack of understanding of PA biosynthesis and assembly. The present proposal attempts to overcome this limitation by translating molecular genetic discoveries on PA biosynthesis in the model legume Medicago truncatula to alfalfa. In particular, we will test novel hypotheses for the mechanisms underlying the transport of the PA building blocks to their site of polymerization (the cell vacuole), and their subsequent polymerization into PAs."

The program priority addressed is the molecular mechanisms of communication between symbiotic, nitrogen-fixing bacteria and legume plant hosts. These bacteria, rhizobia, invade the roots of legume plants, induce these plants to form a nodule to house them, and establish a symbiotic interaction. In this symbiosis, the bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that the plant can utilize and the plant provides the bacteria with fixed carbon compounds produced by photosynthesis. This symbiosis is critical for agricultural productivity in crops such as alfalfa, soybean, and pea. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which this symbiosis develops is required for improving the symbiotic interaction and ultimately for transferring the plant symbiotic genes to non-legume crops, such as rice and wheat. We are probing the molecular mechanisms of communication between the bacterial symbiont and its plant hosts by studying mutants of the bacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti, that are unable to produce the important polysaccharide succinoglycan, and as a result are unable to invade host plants. We will focus on the role of exoK, a glycanase that is required for succinoglycan modification and specifically required for invasion of one host (Medicago truncatula) but not another (alfalfa). We will also study M. truncatula mutants to determine how the plant responds to succinoglycan to facilitate invasion. These M. truncatula mutants are being screened as part of a collaborative effort to establish genetic tools in this plant, in which our laboratory is participating."

Identification of several bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and a contig that spans the disease resistant region. BAC end sequences and new markers closely linked to resistance. DNA sequences for the region that includes the 'Gasaway' resistance gene for use as markers in breeding. A partial DNA sequence of the Anisogramma anomala genome, and molecular markers able to distinguish isolates of the pathogen. Identification and better characterization of sources of EFB resistance. Greatly enhanced US collection of C. americana and wild C. avellana from northern regions, which will provide the base for the genetic improvement program. Identification of superior hybrid hazelnut selections in NE and establishment in replicated trials in NE and NJ, and eventual distribution to ADF members for evaluation over a wide geographic range. Microsatellite DNA fingerprints of accessions of C. americana and selected hybrids and an assessment of level of genetic diversity in the UNL/ADF hybrid population. Phenology data (dates of flowering and budbreak) which will allow selection of genotypes most likely to reliably produce nuts in harsh climates. Data on chemical composition of kernels of hazelnut hybrid selections. Data on economics of hazelnut production in the eastern and midwestern US. Additional expected outcomes. We expect to release new cultivars with EFB resistance derived from 'Gasaway' for planting in Oregon hazelnut orchards, and for trials elsewhere. New sources of genetic resistance to A. anomala. New seedling populations segregating for EFB resistance from several sources within C. avellana, and populations segregating for resistance from other Corylus species. We will identify and propagate new selections with EFB resistance from various sources and establish trials. New information on the genetic control of disease resistance from various sources. We will integrate Extension and outreach activities by our four institutions, and more effectively deliver outcomes to stakeholders across the US. Economic analyses will answer on-going questions concerning the feasibility of growing hazelnuts for various end uses. Numerous other synergistic activities will arise from this program. For example, Arbor Day has an extensive network. By joining forces with OSU, Rutgers, and UNL, ADF will be able to enhance the science-based information they relay to their members, which will lead to a more knowledgeable membership base and likely will help increase membership. This will further support and promote the public's interests in hazelnuts, hazelnut growing, and perennial agriculture. Increased interest in hazelnuts, including hazelnut consumption (ADF has nearly one-million members) will help support the existing hazelnut industry."

As zero tillage practices become more common, herbicide use will continue to increase. Currently, mechanical tillage is the only practical alternative to chemical fallow. However, tillage decreases residue cover, resulting in increased soil erosion. Strategic grazing of grain stubble and weeds by sheep offers an alternative to traditional stubble and weed management, and no-till biomass reduction for seed bed preparation with the added benefit of not negatively influencing soil nutrient cycling or increasing erosion potential. In addition, sheep grazing summer fallow may significantly reduce use and thus selection pressure for glyphosate resistant weeds by precluding the need to control weeds with glyphosate. Our goal is the profitable incorporation of sheep into grain production systems to reduce pesticide and fossil fuel use in fallow and stubble management. Our objectives are: 1: Compare two crop systems and three management systems (in 3 year rotation only) on: a) Grain and forage production b) weed composition, c) Population dynamics of two problematic weed species, d) Nitrogen cycling, e) Abundances and diversity of pest and beneficial insects associated with different crops, bordering crops(annual, perennial, and fallow), and fallow treatments, g) Abundances and activities of pollinators associated with alfalfa and flowering weeds. The crop rotations are 1) Continuous spring wheat - long term project control. 2) Three year rotation, spring wheat - spring planted forage pea/hay barley intercrop- summer fallow in a three year rotation with each component present every year. Within the three year rotation the management systems are: 1) No-till with sheep grazing to manage summer fallow, crop residues, and to harvest the forage crop; 2) Minimum tillage with herbicides use to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage for seed bed preparation; 3) Conventional Tillage used to manage summer fallow, forage crop harvest for hay production, and tillage used for seed bed preparation. 2: Using production, input data, and peer reviewed published results to compare profitability and cash flow of our two crop systems and three management systems. 3: Conduct `on campus' field demonstrations and cooperate with local high school to include student field and lab work in sustainable ag in the biological sciences. Publish and communicate results and potential economic and biological advantages of incorporating sheep grazing of stubble and weeds into a sustainable grain farming system. Our interdisciplinary team of scientists anticipates a positive long term biological and economical outcome from the integrated system of weed management by sheep grazing, and significant reduction in herbicide use in the Northern Great Plains. The proposed system encourages profitable cooperation between diverse agricultural enterprises by linking a source of inexpensive feed for sheep producers with a successful pest control method for grain farmers."

Export of U.S.-grown lentils to Sri Lanka was chosen as the focal point for this proposed project since recent research and data indicate that there exists a greater potential for expanding lentil exports to this country market in the South Asia due to the increasing income and greater preference for lentils. Although U.S. lentil growers have increased their share of the Sri Lankan market (valued at $52M in 2007), they have not fully exploited it. Given this potential export opportunity, this project aims to understand the value chain and develop appropriate marketing strategies that are crucial in achieving a competitive edge in the Sri Lankan market."

This symbiosis leads to the formation of root nodules inside which the rhizobia transform air nitrogen into forms assimilable by the plant.  Every year, in the United States, this symbiosis saves around $4.5 billion in fertilizer costs and prevents ecological and health issues associated with the excessive use of chemical fertilizers.  The rhizobium-legume symbiosis presents a high level of species specificity which means that specific legumes only associate with specific rhizobia.  This specificity mechanism is mostly controlled by the structure of LCO (Lipo-Chito-Oligosaccharide) signals produced by the rhizobia and recognized by their host plants. LCOs also mediate associations with symbiotic fungi which occur in legumes but also in many other non-legume crops such as corn, wheat and cotton. LCOs are now used by farmers as plant growth promoters for legume and non-legume crops. Genetic analysis in plants allowed the identification of LCO receptors and proteins such as HMGR1 (3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase 1) that interact with LCO receptors and are required for the establishment of symbiotic associations.  This project will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms allowing legumes to recognize symbiotic LCOs and of the downstream pathways allowing LCO receptors and HMGR1 to mediate the development of root nodules with rhizobia and associations with symbiotic fungi.  In the short term, understanding these mechanisms can have a direct impact on yield improvement through a more efficient use of LCOs as plant growth promoters.  This knowledge will also help improve the establishment of plant-microbe associations, with especially high impact under suboptimal and stressful field conditions.  In the long term, engineering new symbiotic associations through these mechanisms may help improve the sustainability of our agriculture for food, feed and biofuel production."

They are considered to be an emerging threat because of recent outbreaks that caused wide-spread famine in Uganda (cassava) and other parts of Africa (corn) and economic hardship in Pakistan and India (cotton). They are a threat to the US because of the recent introduction of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus from Israel and the possible introduction of Old World geminiviruses infecting cotton or corn. Although resistance genes for different geminiviruses have been identified in bean, tomato, corn, and other crops, none of them has been sequenced. Sequencing of a potyvirus resistance gene in Arabidopsis was a breakthrough for plant breeding because it allowed the identification of naturally occurring resistance genes in several different crop plants and also shed light on exactly which host factors were important for RNA virus infection. An Arabidopsis gene has been identified that confers resistance to two very different types of DNA virus. Such broad-based resistance would be an important complement to genetic engineering methods, such as RNAi, that are powerful but virus-specific. The goal of this project is to identify and sequence the Arabidopsis geminivirus resistance gene by determining which DNA fragments correlate with resistance in a mapping (F2) population. A cloned gene corresponding to this DNA fragment will be transformed into a susceptible plant and challenged with both geminiviruses. If the gene behaves as expected (resistance is conferred), information about the new function of the gene will be submitted to the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) and then published. This project will support a Hispanic postdoctoral student for one year."

The NJs are found in some soil dwelling bacteria (Bacilli and Streptomyces) and in some plants.  The initial and notable observation about NJ and various homologs are that these compounds often exhibit selective and potent inhibition of glycosyl hydrolases and glycosyltransferases.  Despite over 40 years of recognition, the biosynthesis of these important natural products remains undefined to date, apart from knowledge that glucose is the biosynthetic precursor.  Further, the reason or reasons for the NJ's occurrence in Nature remains unknown, but their function as inhibitors of glycoside hydrolase/transferase enzymes suggests that these compounds may serve as part of a complex chemical ecology of soil bacteria, plant host and other interacting species via perturbation of glycosylation states.  The studies set forth in this project seek to identify the complete set of genes coding for the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of nojirimycin and deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) in the bacteria B. amyloliquefaciens and B. atrophaeus.  The genes will be cloned and expressed in E. coli for production of recombinant biosynthetic enzymes.  The enzymes will be characterized in terms of their substrate specificity and other steady state kinetic parameters.  Finally, knockout strains of B.amyloliquefaciens will be produced and compared to wild type strains in microcosm experiments with pea seedlings and plant pathogens and perturbations in the populations as a function of the presence of DNJ will be identified.  A correlation between DNJ production and changes in the microbial ecology of the rhizosphere would provide new evidence for the natural function of the nojirimycins.Broader ImpactsThe research project will involve undergraduate and graduate students, and provide them with a multidisciplinary research training experience.  An important part of the project will include outreach to secondary schools. Floridian secondary school science teachers will be recruited to participate in summer research.  The teachers will be provided the opportunity to develop learning/teaching modules based on their research experience that can be brought back to the classroom.  The science developed in this research project may have broad impact in terms of providing new catalysts for  green  synthetic reactions, and provide new insight into manipulating interactions among members of microbial communities."

During an infection, the nematodes penetrate the roots and establish permanent feeding sites that compromise normal root function, including moisture and nutrient uptake by the plant. Infected plants suffer restricted growth, reduced yield and premature death. The goal of this project is to examine the plant-nematode relationship on a genetic level. The overall question addressed is: How does the genetic makeup of the nematode influence gene expression in its host plant? This question will be answered using a modification of a genetic analysis tool called expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping. Advanced DNA sequencing technology will be used to measure both gene expression levels in the plant and to identify genetic markers in the DNA of the nematode. Connections between the DNA of the nematode and the gene expression of the plant will be made using eQTL mapping strategies. Additionally, various traits related to pathogenicity will be described during the course of the project. Ultimately, genetic markers in the nematode, gene expression levels in the host plant and in the nematode, and pathogenicity trait measurements will be used to infer entire plant-nematode genomic networks. It is estimated that global losses due to plant-parasitic nematodes exceed $125 billion annually, placing nematodes among the top most economically damaging plant pathogens. Developing new control methods will require a more thorough understanding of the nematode-plant interactions, which is a major goal of this project. All of the sequence data produced by the project will be released to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive for immediate access and long term storage. Processed data, including genotypes and summarized transcript abundances, will be made accessible for graphical visualization and download at the Legume Information System (http://comparative-legumes.org/) and on Nematode.net (http://www.nematode.net/). A key component of the project is the inclusion of undergraduate students from St. Augustines College in Raleigh, a college that historically serves minority students.

Roosevelt's administration, a flurry of new legislation was passed in the hopes that the economy and people's lives would turn around.  The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a government sponsored corporation, was targeted to improve the livelihood of those living in the rural Tennessee River Valley.  In the first six years of its existence, the TVA accumulated assets of over $3 trillion in year 2000 dollars.  These assets included budgeted monies from Congress, spending on construction projects such as dams and reservoirs, electric distribution equipment, and land (1939 TVA Annual Report).  With such large amounts of money being pumped into the Tennessee Valley it is natural to try and measure the benefits of the project relative to the cost.  Between 1933 and 1939, per capita retail sales spending at the county level increased 68% across the entire country and 72% in the Tennessee Valley.  Part of this increase may be due to the natural turnaround in the economy, but with such significant spending the turnaround might also be attributable, at least in part, to the TVA.The TVA provided electricity, flood control, recreational facilities, malaria control, and improved river navigation. During construction at some reservoirs, the TVA constructed towns and schools.  The first director of the TVA, Arthur Morgan, began to implement other practices, such as fertilizer experiment stations, agricultural experiment farms, replanted forest, and bean canning operations.  The TVA had a hand on almost every part of the Tennessee Valley in some shape or form.Today, similar river management projects have been established around the world.  The most notable being China's damming of the Yangtze River, which includes a series of eight dams controlling the flow of water along the river system. The most notable of these dams is Three Gorges Dam.  The entire project has boasted claims of improving navigation, reducing the impact of floods, and generating hydro electricity.  However, the construction has raised issues over the removal of families from the land, and has the potential to change the disease environment in the construction zone.  By studying the TVA, which experienced many of the same concerns during its construction, insight may be gained on the long lasting economic effects of these projects that are being considered or currently brought online.   The long range goal of this research is to examine the impact of the TVA on the American economy using cost-benefit analyses.  The broad range of TVA activities requires the assessment of its impact in several key areas and then the aggregation of measures of its impact.  The PI's initial research examines specific features of the TVA that can be merged into the longer term goal.  These include studies of the TVA's program for purchasing or using eminent domain to acquire property, measuring the impact of the TVA on broad measures of economic activity, and determining the number of lives saved by the TVA program to combat malaria.  These initial studies serve two purposes. They provide new empirical tests of the impact of specific types of policies while also serving as building blocks for the long range study of the overall impact of the TVA.Intellectual Merit: The TVA provides a backdrop to study many problems in the economics literature.  These fields include multilateral bargaining, long term contract analysis, and public health program evaluation.  Data that are available only in paper form will be computerized into usable files.  This will include 1930's individual level survey data, 1930's and 1940's historic property purchases, 1920's and 1930's war mobilization plans, disease specific county level mortality and morbidity data between 1925-1950, and county level financial data over the same period.Broader Impact: The TVA provides a long standing history of regional water management.  Many of the current concerns existed during the creation of the TVA: removal of residents from flooded areas, property purchase practices, the broader economic impact of dam construction, and unintended consequences, such as increases in infectious disease rates.  By examining the TVA, light will be shed onto whether or not comparable massive projects are economically justified over their lifetime."

It focuses on four topics: the distribution and interpretation of plural marking, the semantics of classifiers, the interpretation of the indefinite article, and a description of quantifier structure and meaning. Several languages distinguish mass nouns (e.g. English 'honey') from count nouns (e.g. English 'dog'). Mass nouns do not combine directly with numerals while count nouns do. A cross-linguistic tendency is that nouns that refer to substances are mass nouns, while nouns that refer to delimited objects are count nouns. However, some nouns behave like mass nouns despite the fact that they refer to delimited objects (e.g. English 'furniture'). The grammatical distinction between mass and count nouns is thus not entirely determined by extra-linguistic factors, and to some extent it is arbitrary and subject to linguistic variation. Tarascan is particularly revealing in the empirical investigation of the mass-count distinction since it distinguishes not two but three classes of nouns: count nouns, like 'wichu' (dog), mass nouns like 'tékwa' (honey), and a third class, which we call  count-mass  nouns (Doetjes 1997). This third class includes items like 'purhú' (pumpkin) and 'thatsïni' (bean). They share some grammatical properties with mass nouns, some with count nouns and in other respects they constitute a class of their own. The tripartite distinction in the mass/count domain calls for a revision of the semantics of some functional categories within the Tarascan noun phrase. For instance, while mass nouns reject plural morphology and count nouns referring to more than one entity need it obligatorily, the precise contribution of plural marking with count-mass nouns cannot be accounted for by canonical theories of plurality. Moreover, classifiers and plural marking in Tarascan can co-occur in a noun phrase, a fact unexpected under well-known typological generalizations. This investigation elucidates the role of classifiers in individuating the denotation of count-mass nouns.             This research is based on semantic and syntactic judgments collected on site by Co-PI Vázquez-Rojas under the supervision of Dr. Chris Collins. The data will be obtained by elicitation and in natural occurring discourse from four consultants in Michoacán, México. Co-PI Vázquez-Rojas will also be involved in training young researchers in Mexico to undertake similar investigations in several indigenous languages spoken around the country."

The fundamental goal of this project is to identify and characterize novel genes responsible for triterpene saponin biosynthesis, in important class of plant secondary compounds, in Medicago truncatula using revolutionary technologies.  The plant species Medicago truncatula has emerged as an important experimental model for leguminous crop species such as alfalfa.  Triterpene saponins are a class of structurally diverse plant natural products with a wide range of demonstrated bioactivities including allelopathic, antifungal, antibacterial, antiinsect, anticancer, antinutritive activities. The antinutritive properties of triterpene saponins in legume forages such as alfalfa and soybean are of particular and substantial economic importance.  However, the biosynthesis of triterpene saponins is poorly characterized and this pathway is absent from most textbooks. This project will use cutting-edge metabolomics, genome wide association mapping, correlated gene expression profiling, and traditional molecular validation approaches for gene discovery and characterization related to triterpene saponin biosynthesis in M. truncatula. The goal of this project will be accomplished through the following specific aims: 1) Metabolome analyses of a large and diverse M. truncatula germplasm collection to identify hyper- (high) and hypo- (low) saponin accumulating lines and to enable genome-wide association mapping between specific loci with saponin content 2) Comparative gene expression analyses of hyper and hypo saponin accumulating lines to identify putative genes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis and regulation, and 3) Molecular and biochemical confirmation of select targeted saponin biosynthetic genes prioritized based upon multiple levels of evidence. Preliminary data document substantial metabolic diversity in saponin accumulation which is a necessary prerequisite for successful association mapping and comparative microarray analyses.Broader Impacts: This project will identify and characterize specific genes involved in legume triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis. Specific genes identified in this project have the potential for future metabolic-engineering of crop varieties with: 1) improved fitness and defense, 2) decreased bloat and antinutritive properties resulting in optimized livestock weight gain performance, and 3) potential plant neutraceuticals and adjuvants related to human and animal health. High resolution biochemical phenotype data generated for a large number of M. truncatula accessions core collection will be generated and will be made publicly available via an anonymous FTP server (ftp://sumnerftp.noble.org/pub). This data will highlight specific germplasm critical for further molecular and biochemical dissection of saponin biosynthesis. More importantly, the copious metabolomics data generated will provide substantial community value in that it will enable association mapping with a wealth of other metabolites (both known and unknown) and related fitness traits including, but not limited, to symbiosis (flavonoids, isoflavonoids, dicarboxylic acids), drought/salinity tolerance (proline, manitol, and other osmoprotectants), and/or aluminum tolerance (malate). Funding of this project provides multidisciplinary training for two postdoctoral researchers and one undergraduate summer intern/hourly worker in advanced technologies, plant molecular biology, large-scale integrated systems biology, and largescale analytical biochemistry. A postdoctoral researcher is being mentored in scientific writing, scientific presentations, publishing, grant applications, constructive peer review, project management, time management, and personnel management to further mold a great scientific mind more towards the realistic and professional expectations of modern academic and commercial research. A series of enrichment workshops focused upon local high school students is being provided. Participating groups include Oklahoma Upward Bound Science/Math Program, Ardmore High School AP and Science Club, and Southern Oklahoma Technology Center Biotechnology Program. These annual enrichment opportunities  stimulate student interests in science, plant biology, and natural product biochemistry. An international symposium is being be hosted in year three of the project.  This will provide a forum for the latest advances in saponin research and serve to highlight the outcomes of this project. Postdocs funded by this proposal are serving key leadership roles in organizing and executing the workshops."

At a basic level, there is a serious challenge: with a growing population, and persistent malnutrition in the developing world, a more than doubling of world production is required by 2050. For some this leads to a policy discourse of doom for the poorest countries in the world: with persistently low yields, and the threat of global warming, population growth and its resulting land pressure will simply make any economic progress there impossible. Currently, many of these countries are agricultural-based, but nevertheless fail to provide sufficient food and nutrition for their populations. The World Development Report (WDR) 2008 team echoed this view but with a positive agenda: investing in agriculture is a necessary condition for development in the poorest countries. At a global level, this must be correct, as current high food prices may well push millions of (especially Asian) recent escapees from poverty back under the poverty line, putting pressure on a model of growth based on investment in relatively cheap manufacturing jobs. The emergence of biofuels as a realistic alternative for fossil fuels adds further pressure, and even if they are currently largely fuelled by trade distortions in the US and Europe, their role is likely to grow in the long-run. The WDR 2008 argued that for countries that are currently agricultural-based (i.e. most of the poorest countries in the world), agricultural progress, including via a  green revolution for Africa , are then necessary for any meaningful growth. The African Economic Research Consortium (AERC), the International Growth Center, and the US National Science Foundation jointly will sponsor a workshop devoted to research on the economics of agriculture in Africa. In particular how can agricultural productivity be improved, rural poverty be reduced, and productive interactions between agriculture and the rest of the economy be generated and strengthened? A priority focus for this conference will be on the economics of technological innovation and adoption. Despite much study, it remains striking that, despite the available off-the-shelf technology, yields and yield growth in Africa continue to lag behind the rest of the world, while adoption of new technologies is slow. A study of the interaction of different existing market failures (including in credit, insurance) as well as the behavioural foundations of technology adoption (the role risk and ambiguity, and the process learning) will remain crucial, as well as its institutional foundations, such as the nature of land rights and other constraints on accumulation. There are several innovations that could lead to increases in agricultural growth and will be the focus of research under this theme. The first would be a move into higher-value, or cash, crops - e.g., from maize/sorghum/basic staple or cereal crops into vegetables/horticulture (e.g. French beans, snow peas). Such crops are often export crops. The second is changes in physical inputs - in particular water/irrigation, but also fertilizer, seed, pesticides, etc. (see above). For example, in Kenya only 6% of plots use any irrigation at all (most plots are rain fed). Third are changes in the organization of production and land ownership - from small, uncoordinated single-family holdings to larger farms, or cooperatives of small farms. Fourth is the opening up and expansion of domestic and foreign markets for the outputs of agriculture, either through improvements in road and air networks and other infrastructure, or through the development of links between producers and traders (contract farming mentioned above). Fifth is the reduction of financial market imperfections, including opportunities for saving and improvements in formal insurance as well as improved access to credit markets. Sixth is the more rapid commercialization of agriculture. While there are unlikely to be relevant increasing returns to scale in production, there are likely to be increasing returns in marketing, storage, transport, input provision, retailing (supermarkets), etc. The organizing theme of the collaboration is to build relationships for collaborative research on agriculture in Africa. This is why the participants will remain for the following three days of the associated AERC conference, to build in time and space for developing the research collaborations. The discussants from the US will be paired with likely papers from Africa-based researchers based on the declared interests in potential joint work by both parties.  Further, early career scientists from the US will be participating in the conference.The Social, Behavioral, and Economics Directorate's Social and Economic Sciences Division and by the Office of International Science and Engineering's Africa, Near East and South Asia program are providing funding for this award."

These associated benefits select for hosts to maintain these symbiotic partners over generations. While accepting and maintaining beneficial microbes, hosts must also try to attenuate the effects of pathogenic ones. To better understand how animals accomplish this goal, this research characterizes the responses of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, to acquisition of beneficial and harmful bacteria. These insects are ideal candidates for this research because they have a well-studied association with symbiotic bacteria but are also hampered by bacterial pathogens. In this project, variation in susceptibility to pathogens and acceptance of symbionts will be assessed by experimentally measuring these traits in different aphid lineages. Immunological assays will be used to investigate cell-based immune responses, and sequencing technology will be employed to investigate expression of immune response genes. Results will significantly advance our understanding of host susceptibility, immunity and stress in relation to beneficial and harmful microbial associates. Generation of large amounts of genetic data, which will be deposited online at AphidBase and GenBank, will facilitate ongoing annotation of the pea aphid genome, thus providing resources for future studies of a significant agricultural pest. This project will fund training of one graduate student, one postdoctoral researcher, a middle school teacher, and several minority undergraduates. Additionally, results of the research project will be used as the basis for a novel art and science collaboration, in which scientists will work with student artists and minority-serving after school programs to explore how artistic interpretations of scientific results can be used to make research publicly accessible."

Barneby, world-renowned expert on legumes. It will comprise a digital monograph of identification keys, species descriptions, and illustrations excerpted from Barneby's scholarly publications and a database of plant specimens upon which the publications were based. Information in the Catalogue will be particularly valuable because it derives from Barneby's scholarly studies and from accurately identified specimens.Leguminosae are ubiquitous and the second most economically significant plant family. Many of the species studied by Barneby are abundant in the United States and in Latin America. Many are of conservation or regulatory concern because they are rare and endangered, toxic to livestock, or aggressive weeds. Some have commercial uses in medicine or soil stabilization or as forage, ornamentals, or timber. The Catalogue will be useful in scientific studies of species' evolutionary relationships and geographic distributions, the spread of exotic species, species' responses to environmental changes, conservation of rare or endangered species, and management of toxic species. In addition, however, it will provide a useful identification tool for conservationists, policy makers, resource managers, regulators, educators, students, and the interested public who wish to identify specimens of  Barneby's  legumes. Furthermore, the Catalogue will contribute data to initiatives to compile and share biodiversity information (e.g., National Digital Biological Collections Resource and Global Biodiversity Information Facility).The images and digitized data from this project will be integrated into the online national resource as outlined in the community strategic plan available at http://digbiocol.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/digistratplanfinaldraft.pdf."

In the case of the relationship between the legume plant M. truncatula and its bacterial partner, a major plant regulator of the number of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing nodules that form is a protein called SUNN.  SUNN regulates the interaction systemically (throughout the plant) and thus must communicate regulation through other proteins not yet identified.  This project addresses the question of what proteins interact with SUNN by taking the critical first step of creating a tool to answer the question.  The investigators will create a plant carrying a version of SUNN with a tag to allow retrieval of SUNN and interacting proteins from whole plants for analysis.  The tag is a short piece of protein for which commercial antibodies are available, allowing the investigators to isolate SUNN through standard techniques and then identify the interacting partner proteins.  The investigators will prove that this tagged protein behaves like the normal version of SUNN by a genetic technique called complementation, in which the tagged SUNN placed in a mutant plant with no SUNN protein restores the mutant plant to normality.  Because legumes contribute to 33% of humankind's protein intake and serve as an important source of fodder and forage for animals as well as a source of edible and industrial oils, understanding the signaling involved in regulating legume symbiosis will allow scientists to develop strategies to maintain soil quality and sustainability while protecting the environment over the long term, reducing costs for food and biofuel production.  Undergraduate students, including members of under-represented groups, will be trained as part of this project, and will be recruited every year through existing programs."

Using systems bioinformatics approaches to decipher plant transcriptional regulatory networks, specific aims include: 1) developing graphical models to model and simulate plant transcriptional regulatory networks; 2) developing novel computational algorithms to infer large-scale gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from high throughput functional genomics data in model plants; 3) constructing Arabidopsis Gene Regulation Networks (AGRN) focusing on hormone-related regulatory networks; 4) constructing legume gene regulatory networks (LGRN) involved in regulation of nodulation in three model legumes: Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus, and Glycine max; and 5) developing integrated web systems to host AGRN and LGRN along with supportive genome-scale data, and network discovery, search and curation tools as plug-ins of popular Cytoscape-based open-source network visualization software linked to AGRN and LGRN web services. Integrating these systems will not only fulfill the needs of the plant biology research community and plant breeders, but will ultimately lead to the development of better engineered economically important crops, e.g. forage legumes. The proposed work is trans-disciplinary and requires the application of genomics, computational biology, and bioinformatics to the classical disciplines of genetics, molecular and cell biology, and plant physiology. By providing a single training ground at the Noble Foundation, this project will empower postdoctoral fellows, visiting scientists, students, and technical staff to acquire many of the research skills that are essential for cutting-edge biological research.

Swarms are shaped by an interaction of endogenous social forces with exogenous environmental ones. A kernel describing the social forces is a key element of swarm models. To improve the mathematical understanding of these models, to clarify how exogenous and endogenous forces interact to influence aggregation pattern and morphology, and to provide biological insight into aphids and locusts, we carry out three projects. (1) We analyze and simulate a broadly applicable differential equation based model describing organisms whose movement is due to endogenous and exogenous forces. We connect properties of swarm patterns to properties of the two forces. (2) In experiment, we measure trajectories of pea aphids moving within a group. Using the model from (1), we quantify the social kernel. (3) We generalize the study from (1) by incorporating a dynamically evolving kernel that models social and antisocial behavioral phases in desert locusts. This work will suggest swarm control strategies to minimize aggregation and hence ameliorate some of the negative economic and humanitarian impacts of locust swarms.Turing patterns arise from a competition between reaction and diffusion in diverse chemical, biological, and physical systems. To contribute to the mathematical and chemical understanding of forced patterns, we perform experiments on the chlorine dioxide - iodine - malonic acid (CDIMA) Turing system. Specifically, we force Turing patterns with a time-periodic light source and measure how the resulting pattern suppression scales with forcing parameters.These projects incorporate education through research involvement of twelve undergraduate student researchers, including women, other underrepresented minorities, and post-baccalaureate students bound for graduate study. To forge links between experiment and theory, some students will perform experimental work and all will train within the PI's experimental/theoretical lab. Students will interact with theorists and experimentalists at other universities and undergraduate colleges. Lab and curricular enhancements will provide benefits beyond the term of the grant."

Interactions between plants and these microbial symbionts influence the diversity, structure, and function of terrestrial plant communities.  In many such interactions the microbe provides host plants with nutrients in exchange for carbon from the plant.  Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, a soil fungus that specializes in the acquisition of phosphorus, and rhizobia, a nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium are two common nutritional plant symbionts of legume plants.  The manner in which each of these symbionts benefits or antagonizes their plant partner varies and is partially determined by soil nutrient levels.  Moreover, plants can allocate resources to multiple partners, allowing for the presence of simultaneous interactions to influence the costs and benefits of the interaction.  This project evaluates the relative importance of biotic (i.e. co-occurring symbionts) and abiotic (i.e. soil nutrient levels) factors on the consequences of plant-microbial interactions.The majority of investigations on plant-microbial interactions have focused a single host and a single symbiont.  Yet in nature plants simultaneously interact with many symbionts.  This project experimentally examines the importance of this feature of natural plant-microbe interactions.  Results of this project are applicable to many goals of ecological restoration.  Because of their ability to fix nitrogen, legumes are important members of plant communities, and are often priority species in restoration management.  Many restoration projects begin in post-agricultural fields.  While the soils of natural areas are often nutrient limited, disturbed environments are often subjected to high levels of anthropological nutrient deposition.  Thus this project aids the success of restoration efforts by shedding light onto the consequences of both unnatural nutrient levels and the soil community the legume-rhizobia interactions.  We will incorporate work from this project into a special program at a local children's science museum that elucidates below-ground biological process and organisms."

Varshney (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics [ICRISAT], Patancheru, India)Collaborator: Eric von Wettberg (Florida International University) Senior Personnel: R. Varma Penmetsa (University of California - Davis)Legumes are the third largest family of flowering plants, and second only to the grasses in agricultural importance. On a global scale, legumes contribute 1/3 of humankind's protein intake, a fact that is directly related to their unusual capacity to access atmospheric nitrogen through symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Provision of reduced ( fixed ) nitrogen represents a key challenge in all modern agriculture. In the developed world, intensive agriculture depends on the input of industrially-produced nitrogen fertilizers, derived from the energy of fossil fuels. In resource poor areas of the world, however, the cost of nitrogen fertilizers is prohibitive to their use, and crop yields and soil fertility suffer proportionally. Despite the important implications, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie efficient symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes, or how and to what extent domestication and breeding has impacted the ancestral capacity for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. This project will characterize the genetic mechanisms that underlie efficient symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the agricultural context, and contribute knowledge and resources to a new round of knowledge-driven legume crop improvement strategies that will benefit developing-world and developed-world agriculture alike.In agricultural systems crop rotation with legume species is an important means to maintain soil fertility and crop productivity. Increasing the efficiency of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume crops - overcoming the genetic bottleneck of domestication - has great potential to improve the livelihoods of resource poor farmers. The goal of this project is to simultaneously satisfy the curiosity that drives basic science, while providing understanding that can lead to new tools for applied agriculture. This project will enhance quality and visibility of international agricultural research, and provide for the training of young scientists as undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students.  Information about the project will be available through a project website (http://www.icrisat.org/gt-bt/ICGGC/homepage.htm).

Small-holder farmers in Africa and South America are responsible for more than 95% of cacao production, providing economic benefits to millions of cacao farmers and their dependents, as well as important ecological benefits such as rain-forest preservation. Fungal and oomycete diseases have devastated cacao production in South America and West Africa, dislocating populations of farmers and resulting in destruction of the rain-forest sheltering the cacao trees in favor of large-scale open farmland. This project will test two novel approaches to protecting developing country crops against a broad-spectrum of oomycete and fungal pathogens, using cacao as the initial target. The first involves targeting anti-microbial proteins to pathogen feeding structures called haustoria, using RPW8, an Arabidopsis protein that has a natural affinity for these feeding sites. The second approach involves blocking the entry of virulence proteins (effector proteins) that pathogens secrete into host cells to suppress the plant host's immune system. The most effective strategies will be identified first using fast growing Arabidopsis and tomato plants before being tested in cacao.Broader Impacts: The novel technologies that will be tested in this project are potentially applicable to an extremely broad array of crop diseases important to the developing world. The most destructive diseases of broad acreage staples such as rice and wheat are potentially amenable to this approach, as are many of the most limiting fungal and oomycete diseases of crops of importance to smallholders, such as yams, cassava, groundnuts, pearl millet, finger millet, sorghum, maize, potato, bean and cowpea. The project includes visits from scientists from developing countries, a colloquium in Ecuador, and regular communication with scientists from cacao-producing countries.  Project outcomes as well as access to biological resources that include DNA constructs and germplasm will be disseminated through a project website (accessible via https://www.vbi.vt.edu/faculty/research_groups/brett_tyler) and through publications."

With the highest-energy collisions ever created in a laboratory environment, the CMS collaboration (about 1600 physicists world-wide) will study some of the most fundamental questions of our time, such as the origin of mass, the possible existence of supersymmetry, and the hypothetical existence of extra spatial dimensions. The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), one of two general-purpose detectors at the LHC (the other detector is called ATLAS and has a similar number of collaborators), has been designed to discover the new physics of this energy scale. At the heart of CMS is the silicon pixel detector. The current device took years to design and build and represents the state-of-the-art for this type detector. However, it is well known that it will eventually fail due to radiation damage and a new device with enhanced characteristics must be designed and built to take its place. This award funds Professor Alice Bean, Professor of Physics at the University of Kansas, and a consortium of six universities (Kansas, Kansas State, Illinois at Chicago, Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, Rice, and Rutgers) to develop a detector that will serve as a research instrument for the design of the phase 1 upgraded silicon pixel detector for CMS.The broader impacts can be divided into two categories - those related to the development of the research and training infrastructure at collaborating institutions and those related to the impacts on the field of high energy physics as a whole. In particle physics the capability to design and build instrumentation is crucial to the success of any university group in this field. This award provides the means for the collaborators to enhance the prestige and capability of the respective institutions at an international level. In addition, the development activities will allow recruiting undergraduate students, especially women and minorities, to help build this instrument and participate in the physics studies  and should help attract more students into physics and engineering."

In fact, an important portion of our diet, including the essential amino acids found in beans and corn, comes from molecules stored in the vacuole. The integrity of the vacuolar membrane is important for the storage of metabolites and hormones, the sequestration of ions and the maintenance of cellular turgor. To improve plant stress tolerance and ultimately increase the nutritional value of plants for human consumption, it is essential that we understand how to regulate vacuolar membrane biogenesis. The long-term goal of this research is to identify and characterize the trafficking machinery for vacuolar membrane proteins. An integrated strategy of genetic, biochemical and cell biological approaches will be utilized to identify and characterize mutations and chemical inhibitors that disrupt the trafficking of membrane proteins to the vacuole. The specific aims are to: 1) Identify mutants impaired in the targeting of membrane proteins. 2) Identify small inhibitors that induce mis-localization of vacuolar membrane proteins. Both mutants and inhibitors will uncouple the distinct targeting pathways of membrane proteins to the vacuole. This research will have a major impact in the understanding of vacuole biogenesis and the ability to improve plants with enhanced vacuolar content.The broader impacts of this project include the training of minority undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art techniques in molecular biology and microscopy. In addition, a teacher and minority high-school students from the Wake County public schools system will be engaged as part of this research program."

The formulation and testing of the hypotheses presented in this proposal will build the foundations for making further advances in the prevention and/or cure of amyloid diseases. The proposed research is divided into five tasks: 1) Formulation of the model and adaptation of a MC suite already developed in our laboratory; 2) Use of the simulation package to study the aggregation of peptides in bulk and at solid liquid interfaces; 3) Synthesis of a family peptides and fabrication of biological membrane mimics; 4) Experimental studies of the stability of the peptides in bulk under different solvent conditions; 5) Experimental studies of the formation of amyloid deposits at the solid/liquid interface. The following questions will be addressed: 1) Is the formation of amyloid deposits a truly universal phenomenon 2) Does the surface function as a nucleation site and 3) What features of the surface are more likely to induce the formation of aggregates and secondary structure within those aggregates Should the surface be hydrophobic or hydrophilic? Do specific sites on the surface play a dominant role in the formation of the aggregates. Is the presence of a particular pattern at the surface needed for the formation of aggregates To address these questions, the PI will continue with the philosophy that only partial answers can be obtained by research compartmentalized in either experimental or theoretical beans. A well integrated approach consisting of both theoretical (Monte-Carlo simulations) and experimental work (synthesis of new peptides, use of dynamic light scattering, and atomic force microscopy) is more likely to achieve success in answering of these questions. Intellectual Impact Pursuing and achieving the goals of this project will impact science and engineering by advancing the knowledge of debilitating diseases and by improving the understanding of protein stability. The overall philosophy of our approach will set standards for the construction of model systems to study biological processes. The development of computer codes and the fact that the codes will be freely available to the rest of the community will advance computational biology. The experimental work proposed will stretch to its limits current experimental techniques, promoting the development of more adequate techniques. The conviction that research in the biological sciences must consist of a combination of carefully planned experiments and sophisticated machine simulations that transpires from the approach will motivate other researchers to take similar avenues. Broader Impact This research will lay the foundations for a better understanding of the formation of amyloid fibrils. Because of that, human health sciences and society will benefit from the findings. The P.I. has a solid record as an educator of undergraduate students in his research laboratory. Therefore, relatively heavy undergraduate participation in this project is expected. The P.I. has also been able to attract most (if not all) the minority students that joined the graduate program at the Chemical Engineering Department of Missouri S&T. The P.I. will personally recruit minorities from minority institutions to participate in this project. The project will produce two Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering educated in state of the art techniques and with the necessary expertise to become the educators and researchers of the future. The P.I. will visit regional high schools with the purpose of showing that Chem. Eng. is not a dry discipline by establishing a bridge between biology and engineering. This project is particularly well suited for that purpose because of the clear connection with disease. The P.I. will use return of indirect funds to invite science high school teachers from local schools to work in the P.I. lab during the summer months."

Specific reasons for this alarming rise in food allergies are not completely understood at present. Whether genetically engineered (GE) foods contribute to this problem is largely unknown. Assessment of allergenic potential of GE foods is a major challenge facing the international and national regulatory agencies and the agro-biotech industry (Selgrade et al. 2009). Although expert panels suggest the use of animal models as one of the methods for assessment of allergenic potential of GE foods, widely accepted and validated animal models are not available at present (Ladics and Selgrade 2009).This project was conducted during the period September 15, 2010, to September 14, 2014. Currently, validated animal models to assess the allergenicity of novel dietary proteins, such as those present in GE foods, are not available. We previously published a novel mouse model of near-fatal food allergy that involves transdermal allergen sensitization followed by oral elicitation (TS/OE) of systemic anaphylaxis (Birmingham et al. 2005, 2007; Navuluri et al. 2006; Parvataneni et al. 2009; Gonipeta et al. 2010). The data collected during a previously funded U.S. EPA project (R833133) demonstrated that: (1) the allergenicity readouts in this mouse model are dependent on the number of exposures to the allergenic protein; (2) seven human allergenic proteins (hazelnut, cashew nut, sesame seed, milk, shellfish, egg, fish) produce all three readouts of allergenicity in this mouse model (Birmingham et al. 2005, 2007; Navuluri et al. 2006; Parvataneni et al. 2009; Gonipeta et al. 2010); (3) six human non-allergenic proteins (kidney bean, Pinto bean, blueberry, sorghum, pigeon pea, mung bean) were non-allergenic in this model based on clinical scores and hypothermia readouts; (4) amaranth seed protein, which has no history of human allergenicity and is therefore presumed to be non-allergenic, tested positive for all three readouts of allergenicity (Fig. 1); (5) hazelnut allergy in this mouse model once established is long-lasting similar to human hazelnut allergy (Gonipeta et al. 2010); and (6) food allergy is genetically controlled in this model similar to human food allergy (Parvataneni et al. 2009).<img alt=   src= data:image/png;base64,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"

This proposal is in direct response to thatneed and will support a State laboratory's full participation within the FERN ChemistryCooperative Agreement Program (cCAP). This participation includes instrumentation, training,method enhancement activities and analysis of surveillance samples. The Department ofAnalytical Chemistry at The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) has a 115year history of food safety research and over the last five years as a cCAP laboratory, hasdemonstrated the expertise and analytical capacity required to meet FERN goals. The currentproposal is divided into four distinct project areas, all of which are inherently flexible dependingon Forensic Chemistry Center (FCC) and FERN National Program Office (NPO) input: (1) The use of Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) for the analysis ofunknown compounds in foods. We have used GC-MS to detect melamine in food productsfrom China and pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables. We have enhanced the FDA FERNT021 methodology by developing the use of a Programmed Temperature Vaporizing (PTV) inletfor the GC-MS. In this proposal we look to continue our advances with this methodology bylooking at new toxins and poisons, by expanding to new matrices such as alcohol and seafood,and to explore the potential use of Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) with GC-MS. (2) The use of Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) for the analysis ofunknown compounds in foods. We have used LC-MS to analyze toxins in surveillancesamples and pesticide residues in produce, as well as honey bee related matrixes. We haveadded new toxins to the FDA FERN T022 method and evaluated many matrixes. We proposethe use of new chromatography columns to expand the capabilities of the FERN methodologyand also to expand to additional matrices such as alcohol and seafood. (3) The use of Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for theidentification of toxic metals in foods. Our elemental experience has ranged from thedetermination of lead in maple syrup to cadmium in fish tissue to nanoparticles in vegetables.We have used the FERN methods for the analysis of food surveillance samples. We propose tofurther enhance methodology by optimizing the High Matrix Introduction accessory for the ICP -MS. We also propose to use LC prior to elemental analysis instrumentation so as to speciatemetals and separately analyze multiple oxidative states. (4) The use of Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the identification oftoxins in foods. We have used ELISA methods for surveillance samples, proficiency tests, andto determine peanut allergens in foods. We evaluated Tetracore Ricin kits and are developingtechniques for Abrin analysis. We propose to use ELISA kits and lateral flow devices (LFDs)for matrixes specified by FDA as well as studies on the rosary pea, the source of Abrin. The explicit goal of this opportunity is to enable the analysis of food in the event thatredundancy and surge capacity is need by FERN. The CAES Department of AnalyticalChemistry has demonstrated the expertise, capability, and adaptability to fully meet and exceedthese program needs."

EE is thought to be mediated by both immunoglobulin (IgE) and non-IgE-mediated food allergy.  The majority of patients with EE (50%-80%) are atopic based on the co-existence of EE with atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and/or asthma.  In addition, approximately two-thirds of EE patients have food allergen-specific IgE based on immediate hypersensitivity skin tests or measurement of allergen specific IgE in blood.  Approximately 75% of EE subjects had increased total IgE levels.  Approximately two-thirds of children with EE have positive immediate hypersensitivity skin tests to at least one food allergen.  The mean number of positive food immediate hypersensitivity skin tests ranges from 3-6 positive tests per subject with EE.  The most common foods reported to be positive in EE by skin immediate hypersensitivity skin test included common food allergens (i.e., peanut, egg, milk, soy, wheat) as well as beans, rye, and beef.  Dietary therapy is considered an effective therapy in children diagnosed with EE.Objective/Hypothesis:  Although studies of the genetics of EE are in their infancy, the importance of genes to the development of EE has been demonstrated in studies showing an important association of EE with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the eotaxin-3 gene, a chemokine gene important to eosinophil chemotaxis into tissues such as the esophagus.  In this proposal, we hypothesize that in EE there is a gene polymorphism (transforming growth factor beta 1, or TGF-b1) environment (IgE food sensitization) interaction that contributes to increased IgE-mediated TGF-b expression in the esophagus and increased esophageal remodeling in a subset of EE subjects.  As esophageal stricture formation is an important complication of remodeling in EE (6%-12% of children; 33% of adults), resulting in food impactions and emergency room visits, identifying genetic polymorphisms in TGF-b in EE may allow the early identification of food sensitized children at risk for the development of this significant complication of EE.Specific Aims:  The focus of the genetic studies in EE we have proposed has two specific aims, namely:  (1) Do food-sensitized EE subjects with the TGF-b TT genotype have increased levels of esophageal expression of TGF-b and pSmad?  (2) Do food-sensitized EE subjects with the TGF-b TT genotype have increased levels of remodeling?Study Design:  We will characterize SNPs in a candidate gene of esophageal remodeling (TGFb) in patients with EE and food sensitization patients with EE and no food sensitization (n=381) matched for age, gender, and ethnic background.  Levels of esophageal remodeling and expression of TGF-b and pSMAD will be quantitated in esophageal biopsies.Impact:  This study focuses on increasing our understanding of a gene (TGF-b) environment (food IgE sensitization) associated with remodeling and stricture formation in the esophagus in EE.  If this gene environment interaction contributes to esophageal remodeling and esophageal stricture formation, their identification may lead to biomarkers to detect patients at risk of this complication, as well as potential novel therapies."

These viruses occur and cause economic impact wherever these and similar crops are grown. In addition to its economical importance, viruses described here use an array of unconventional tools to express encoded genes. Little is known how carmo-, panico-, and umbraviruses are able to recruit translation machinery in the absence of canonical modifications in their genome. Even less is known of how they are able to break resistance encoded by natural recessive resistance genes. The success of plant breeding for improved avirulence determinants depends on how much we know about virus gene replication and expression. The purpose of this study is to determine the roles of RNA sequences from these three different viral genera in cap-independent translation initiation, their interaction with the protein synthesis machinery and how these interactions modify RNA structure using combination of structural and functional methods such as X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis. A detailed understanding of mechanism of cap-independent translation employed by these plant viruses will make it possible to 1. identify key regulatory steps and find common themes for viral translation shared with other economically important plant viruses that will ultimately suggest new ways to control viral disease and reduce crop losses in US and world; and 2. use the RNA translation signals to control expression of nonviral genes in transgenic plants expressing any gene of agricultural interest."

This project attempts to tease apart how an aphid-Buchnera integrated metabolism functions in diverse aphid species and within a species (obj.1), and with and without facultative endosymbionts (obj.2). This research will contribute broadly to scientific knowledge relevant to agriculture, insect ecology and evolution, and symbiosis. All sap-sucking agricultural insect pests (e.g. psyllids, whiteflies, scale insects) possess obligate endosymbionts, analogous to Buchnera, in addition to facultative endosymbionts. The aphid-endosymbiont symbiosis, particularly the symbiosis of pea aphid and its Buchnera, is a model insect-endosymbiont system that is revolutionizing our understanding of endosymbiont evolution, regulation, and functional roles in hosts. Our proposed project will elucidate whether and how pest aphid species with different feeding ecologies interact with their obligate endosymbiont, Buchnera using a functional genomics approach. Additionally, a greater understanding of how mutualistic facultative endosymbionts metabolically interact with Buchnera and their aphid host will be accomplished from this research. Ultimately, this fundamental knowledge is required to understand which insect and bacterial genes are important for insect nutrition and aphid survival."

The Papilionoidaea legume subfamily includes the majority of legumes of agronomic value, such as alfalfa, soybean, chickpea, garden pea, and lentil. Estimates of the dietary intake of legumes show that this family is responsible for ~1/3 of the total protein intake in the human diet. In addition to their human dietary importance, certain legumes (e.g. alfalfa) are major forage crops important in sustaining livestock agriculture worldwide. Most legume species have the ability to form symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This is an unusual yet important feature, shared among few plants outside the legume family, enabling them to thrive in environments with minimal nitrogen input. Due to their nitrogen-fixing ability, they are also used as a rotation crop to enhance available soil nitrogen. Barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) has been studied extensively as a model legume since the 1990s, and work on this plant and its associated microbiota has resulted in significant advances in understanding of the basic biology of the legume, mechanisms of plant-microbe communication, and the biology of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. It is now recognized that bacteria and fungi accumulate in large, diverse populations at the plant root-soil interface (the rhizosphere). This microbial community accumulates to take advantage of the rich collection of nutrients secreted by the plant roots (plant root exudate). Some plant root exudate chemicals are demonstrated to act as signals to specific microbes. These signals can result in alterations to the rhizosphere microbial community that enhance plant nutrient uptake, aid in suppression of plant pathogens, and enable a symbiotic relationship between plant and microbe resulting in nitrogen fixation by certain bacteria in legume plant root nodules. We aim to identify genetic features of the plant that enable optimal microbial community assembly in the Medicago truncatula rhizosphere. While our work will be done with a legume, we strongly believe that the research will be relevant to rhizosphere microbial community assembly and function in all agriculture crops. This work will result in an increased knowledge of signaling pathways between plant and microbe that enhance plant health, plant productivity and sustainability of the agricultural system. Ultimately, crop breeders and plant genetic engineers will use knowledge generated from this research to select for crop varieties that will optimize their rhizosphere microbial community to enhance these features."

As such, understanding seed development in soybean is of paramount importance. Gene expression studies in Arabidopsis seeds imply that epigenetic mechanisms involving the modification of DNA or histones play a role in seed development. Studies in Arabidopsis and maize also show that transposable elements (TEs), which are targeted by endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), influence the expression of nearby genes through DNA or histone modifications. We hypothesize that changes in endogenous siRNAs targeting TEs and repeats in the genome influence gene expression during soybean seed development. The goal of the project is to determine whether the flux of endogenous small RNAs and the resulting changes in epigenetic states play a role in regulating gene expression programs during seed maturation and germination when storage reserves are being accumulated and remobilized, respectively. The proposed research is the first to focus on the role of endogenous siRNAs in seed filling and seed germination and will lay the foundation for a full appreciation of new regulatory mechanisms that program gene expression in the seed."

We will focus on the sustainable integration of diversified perennial-based cropping systems that supply feedstock for bioenergy and bioproducts as well as offer ecosystem services including those that offer crop protection for other crops such as soybean. Our goal is to 1) develop an agronomically-realistic platform for the production of perennial bioenergy crops, and 2) support a knowledge-based strategy for integration of bioenergy cropping systems in a way that supports ecosystem services that lead to reduced pest pressures in surrounding crops. The ecosystem service that we are targeting is biological control of the soybean aphid, a devastating invasive pest. We will focus on four bioenergy cropping systems; a polyculture mix comprising forbs, legumes, and tall grass prairie species, a monoculture of willow, a mix of willow and herbaceous polyculture crops in an alley cropping configuration and a monoculture of soybean that will serve as the control. The study emphasizes two main objectives. First, we will compare crop growth and productivity of the various bioenergy cropping systems. This information will be used to estimate net energy balance and biomass conversion rates. Second, we will compare biological control of soybean aphid adjacent to three classes of bioenergy plantings and the control site. This will be done using a combination of sampling to determine the abundance of soybean aphids and their natural enemies, determinations of the extent of resource use in the biofuel plantings, and estimation of a biocontrol services index, which defines the contribution of surrounding landscapes to biological control. The biological control objective will also include releases of approved, exotic parasitoids of the soybean aphid. An understanding of the implications of diversified multi-species bioenergy cropping systems in the context of providing crop protection and ecosystem services benefits is critical to the long-term sustainability of multi-use landscapes. This research will provide information that will help make decisions on biomass cropping systems design, placement, and potential scale of influence as it relates to the surrounding landscape. We will conduct workshops through a partnership with the University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment to provide information to farmers, landowners, lawyers, business professionals and policy experts that will lead to more effective planning as it relates to the long-term sustainability of agricultural systems in the future."

Formal apprenticeship in managed dairy grazing using the framework the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development has utilized for years. This model uses classroom education through the Wisconsin Technical College System as well as on-farm employment by master farmers.Despite increased public interest in local food systems and sustainable farming, the dairy industry continues to lose small and mid-sized farms. Young people are not entering dairy farming at rates that offset the loss of retiring producers. At the same time, family farmers who utilize  managed grazing  in their dairy operation are profitable but have few opportunities for investment and growth. In managed grazing systems, livestock are rotated through paddocks of high quality legumes and grasses, which are then allowed to rest and re-grow. This cost effective farming method works with biological processes to build natural resources and to ensure that animals are healthy and productive. Biological constraints, however, such as the distance a cow can walk from the pasture to the milking parlor, limit the size of managed grazing farms. Confinement dairy operations have expanded to meet industry milk supply needs by increasing the number of cows on a single site. The trend toward consolidation and expansion leads to highly capital-intensive farming, which essentially prohibits young or beginning farmers from entering into ownership. Formal apprenticeship in Managed Dairy Grazing as an alternative way to farm that will keep building the dairy industry and keep the dairy processing sector flush with enough milk to meet its needs. The long-term goal of GrassWorks Apprenticeship Program is to establish more small and mid-sized sustainably managed dairy farms in Wisconsin and the region. To accomplish that goal, the program will meet the following supporting objectives: 1.) establish formal apprenticeship as a new career path for entrant and beginning dairy farmers and 2.) create new models of investment and/or transition for established managed grazing dairy farmers that gives beginning farmers a stake in farm ownership. The program will prepare young people to become owners and operators of managed grazing dairy farms through a formal apprenticeship established by the Department of Workforce Development, GrassWorks as the Industry Sponsor, and the Wisconsin Technical College System. Apprentices will become Journeymen and finally Masters in a career path similar to that of electricians, plumbers and comparably skilled workers in other industries. Dairy Grazier Apprentices will work on-the-farm under an established Master Grazier, who has had training in mentoring an apprentice. Concurrently, apprentices will be enrolled in related courses at the Wisconsin Technical College System or University of Wisconsin."

Approximately 20,000 of the tribe's 28,000 members live on the main section of the Tohono O'odham Reservation. The community is American Indian, rural, and economically poor. In 2004, employment was found to be 24 percent lower than the Arizona state average, with 363 per 1,000 residents employed (CCPR-WPC 2008). The 2000 Census reports that 50.6% of Tohono O'odham households with children live below the poverty level (compared to the U.S. average of 13.6%). For over a thousand years, the Tohono O'odham were a self-sufficient farming society, producing all of their own food in the Sonoran desert. As late as the 1930s, traditional water harvesting techniques, known ak chin (monsoon flood plain) farming, enabled the cultivation of more than 20,000 acres. Traditional agriculture had dwindled to 2,500 acres by 1949. By 2000, this number was further reduced to fewer than 10 acres of traditional crops. The diagnosis of type-II Diabetes among the Tohono O'odham correlates with the demise of their traditional agriculture. In 1960, type-II diabetes was virtually unknown within the community. Today, more than 60% of adults suffer from the disease, the highest rate in the world. In the 1990's, the crisis intensified, with the childhood onset of type -II diabetes becoming common. Tohono O'odham children as young as six years old suffer from the disease. Currently 76% of Tohono O'odham 6th- 8th graders are overweight or obese (+85 %ile). Tepary beans and other traditional foods have been proven to regulate blood sugar levels and may delay the onset of type-II diabetes. Regaining food self- sufficiency -- producing local, nutritionally-appropriate crops in the community -- can help disrupt the diabetes epidemic.  A New Generation of O'odham Farmers  can support this effort through training that will increase access to traditional foods in the community. The  New Generation  program will implement two activities. 1) Training, Professional Development, and Capacity Building: Over three years, the  New Generation  program will provide multi-site internships, workforce training, and preparation for farming as a career. All 65 trainees will learn farming skills, conservation practices, crop technologies, and basic farm safety. The  New Generation  program has three training tracks to prepare a variety of beginning farmers: a) One-year Agriculture Apprenticeships - 3 per year/ 9 total; b) Professional Development for Agricultural Workers - 32 Tohono O'odham who are currently employed in low-level agriculture jobs will participate in multi-year, ongoing workforce development; and c) Summer Youth Internships - 8 high school students per summer: 24 total. 2) Establishing a Learning Center & Teaching Farm: A working traditional farm will become a center for training, education, outreach, and technical assistance. The Learning Center will enable recruitment, youth participation, and a setting for farmers-in-training to apply what they are learning. It also will provide a model for culturally- and environmentally- appropriate farming."

The large travel distances increase both cost and time required and the relatively few extension specialists at MSU in the IPM area are primary constraints to IPM implementation. Therefore this proposal addresses this need with Extension IPM Associates and funding for travel and program support. Primary Coordination Program Emphasis will include: IPM Implementation for Agronomic Crops: wheat, barley forage crops (alfalfa), oilseeds (safflower, canola and camelina) and seed legumes ( dry peas, lentils and chickpeas);; IPM Implementation for Specialty crops (seed potatoes, sugarbeets, and dry beans); and IPM Training for Consumer and Urban Environments (consumers, home landscape businesses, public facilities (parks, city forestry) and Master Gardner training). Secondary coordination program emphasis includes: IPM Support for Pest Diagnostic Facilities; IPM education for Pesticide Applicators: IPM Training and Implementation in Schools; and IPM Partnerships in Wide-Area Pest Monitoring and Reporting Systems (weather-based pest prediction, cutworm prediction, NPDN) These programs are built on the expertise of the MT IPM team and state needs in terms of pest problems, technical assistance and IPM education with overall goals driven by the National Road Map for IPM. New emphasis will include: IPM Training and Implementation in Schools, IPM, building a web-based weather-based IPM information system linked to regional assets for Montana and continued expansion of the web-based High Plains IPM Guide cooperatively with IPM specialists in Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Outcomes will be better educated growers, landscape and turf businesses and public building mainatinance personnel.

The goal in all production systems is to tip the competitive balance to favor the crop over the weed. The choice of crop variety is of utmost importance in this battle. If a variety is  competitive  it will emerge well under stressful conditions, capture moisture, light, and available nutrients, suppress weeds, and be tolerant of insect pests and diseases. For centuries plant breeders have been selecting for varieties that have the highest yields under pest-free and nutrient-rich conditions. Organic farmers need varieties that perform well under their production systems which may differ in nutrient availability and pest pressure compared with conventional systems. In conventional production systems navy bean cultivars yield more than black bean cultivars. However, black beans produced greater yields than navy beans in organic trials. These yield differences in dry bean class and variety may in part be due to differences in nitrogen fixation and uptake by bean root systems. Nitrogen availability in organic systems is largely dependent on the crop rotation, including the planting of cover crops. Red clover is a common cover crop which when tilled into the soil supplies an available form of nitrogen for the following crop. Rye and oilseed radish are not legumes, but both may increase nitrogen availability to dry beans by mineralization of nitrogen during the summer months. By researching the incorporation of cover crops into organic dry bean production systems we will determine which cover crop (or lack thereof) supports the nodulation and uptake of nitrogen for optimum seed yield in organic dry bean production systems. Including cover crops prior to planting dry beans may help in weed suppression. Some cover crops such as cereal rye suppress germinating weed seedlings due to release of allelopathic compounds. However, weed suppression by these compounds is short-lived and therefore producers must manage emerging weeds by other means, including rotary hoeing and cultivation. The vigor of the dry bean variety is very important because it is difficult to cultivate weeds when the crop is not growing vigorously. Furthermore, cover crop residues may assist or hinder weed management by mechanical methods in the weeks following dry bean planting. On-farm trials will provide much needed information on how to manage weeds in cover crop/no cover crop residue situations in organic dry bean production. Organic dry bean producers must also manage insect and disease pests. In this regard cover crops can be either a help or a hindrance. For example,  Colonel  oilseed radish is a well known variety that suppresses nematode pests. On the other hand, if beans are planted too close to the incorporation of a cover crop insects like seed corn maggot can become a problem.

It is currently unclear what role dry bean variety and cover crops play in negating or enhancing the infestation of this pest."

Native people in general are less educated than their general United States counterparts. The North Dakota American Indian (AI) population, primarily the Spirit Lake Nation, shares many of the same issues regarding academic achievement and these are based in poverty. Poverty stricken community members, regardless of urban or rural status, are less like to attempt education and less likely to complete education if they are to start. The lack of participants in the Agriculture and Natural Resources Management Program of Studies are affected due to the historical trauma experienced by AI. The land allotted to Spirit Lake enrolled members was in heavily treed or land that was not conducive for planting. Excess land not allotted and land that was more suitable for farming was sold to non-Natives; thus, a checker board reservation with the good land going to non- Natives. Mni Wakan Dakota Oyate (Spirit Lake Dakota People) were historically agriculturists in that they planted 19 varieties of squash as well as corn, and a variety of beans, to supplement the hunting and gathering for which they are more widely known. The Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota, are also known as keepers of the land in that they cared for Unci Maka and she in returned cared for us. Unci Maka also provided a variety of medicines that were used in our daily lives in order to maintain good health. Vision Statement: Revive the Dakota perspective of caring for the land through the education of the next generation(s)."

Research needs to address the issues currently facing growers so that they can achieve competitive yields in a sustainable manner. The proposed research will benefit Michigan dry bean growers by reducing yield losses caused by potato leaf hopper, and the use of pesticides to control the pest. Enhanced levels of potato leaf hopper resistance in future dry bean varieties would facilitate the transition from conventional to organic production practices of dry beans in Michigan, and reduce the need and costs of expensive pesticide control. The savings from improved productivity due to lower yield losses and the reduction in pesticide use, would contribute to sustained productivity of a vital commodity and an important industry in Michigan. Breeding for adaption to the local growing environments has proven extremely successful to meet challenges worldwide over time. On-going work has identified unadapted sugarbeet germplasm with good germination in over 150 mM NaCl salt solutions as well as good field emergence, however these results and germplasm selections need to be validated under highly saline field conditions, a project being done with colleagues in Egypt. We propose to apply molecular transcription profiling tools to better understand the genetic basis for salt tolerance in beets, with particular effort to discover genes differentially expressed under varying salt levels and between germplasm showing tolerant and intolerant phenotypes. The resulting knowledge and materials will be further developed in the form of new germplasm and molecular genetic markers. The sugarbeet cyst nematode is considered the most important soil-borne pest of sugarbeet worldwide, and has recently been identified as a serious pest for many Michigan sugarbeet growers. Historically, this pest has been managed through crop rotation and limited use of fumigant and non-fumigant nematicides. The goal of this aspect of the proposal is to introgress these newer sources of nematode resistance into a well-adapted Great Lakes genetic background suitable for release to the sugarbeet seed industry. Management of weeds in sugarbeet production continues to be a challenge. The 2008 growing season was the first wide-spread commercialization of glyphosate-resistant (Roundup Ready) sugarbeet. The acceptance of this technology has simplified weed management in Michigan sugarbeet fields. However, the development of glyphosate-resistant weeds is a major concern with the increased use of glyphosate for weed control in most crops grown in rotation. Incorporating other weed management strategies including the use of cover crops to suppress initial weed emergence and growth may reduce the need for relying only on glyphosate for weed control in sugarbeet. In current production systems glyphosate will need to be applied three or more times to control weeds and maximize sugarbeet yield. Incorporating cover crops into sugarbeet production systems may reduce the number of glyphosate applications for summer annual weed control."

Maine farms produce a wide variety of agricultural commodities including grain crops such as corn, soybeans, and canola, fruit crops such as apples, strawberries, and blueberries, as well as broccoli, dry beans, peas, and multiple other vegetable crops. The potato industry, however, is the top agricultural sector in the State of Maine with a total economic value to the state of over $500 million, including farm-gate receipts of $100 million, and employing over 6,000 individuals. In order to ensure the sustainability and economic viability of Maine's potato industry, timely and efficient management of pests is crucial. A successful IPM program can not only potentially reduce production costs through decreased pesticide applications but, through the use of effective monitoring techniques, can ultimately save growers millions of dollars in potential crop losses. Integrated pest management programs, such as those offered by the University of Maine Cooperative Extension Service, play a pivotal role in supporting the Maine potato industry by offering assistance directly to growers. The University of Maine Cooperative Extension's Potato Integrated Pest Management Program impacts approximately 56,000 acres of potatoes. The program employs 18 seasonal program aides, maintains nearly 150 specialized insect traps, coordinates a statewide network of electronic weather stations, and surveys 100 potato fields on a weekly basis for weeds, insects and diseases. The data produced helps IPM scientists track potential pest outbreaks and helps provide growers with current information on specific and timely treatments in order to minimize the number of pesticide applications and maximize potato yield. The current market demand for perfect, pest and damage-free produce and crops, combined with the public's desire to decrease pesticide use for human health and environmental reasons, creates a difficult challenge for Maine potato growers. Homeowners and growers are increasingly at odds over the application of pesticides on farms adjacent to new or existing housing developments. The Potato IPM Program plays an integral role in ensuring that Maine's potato crop is pest and damage free while attempting to minimize the amount of pesticides that are applied. The presence of late blight in Maine during the 2009 crop year has produced the potential for inoculum to be widespread in 2010. Although, potato late blight does not typically survive Maine winters, early snow cover, could facilitate the proliferation of volunteer potatoes, which could serve as a host for late blight. This potential inoculum source, combined fungicide resistance of the late blight organism, and the confirmed presence of both the US-8 and the US-14/17 late blight strains, have the potential to create a considerable threat to the Maine potato industry's 2010 crop. For the 2010 crop year and beyond, it will be imperative for growers to eliminate all inoculum sources by controlling volunteers, cull piles, and by planting only late blight free seed."

Specially, canopy management and irrigation management of orchard and vineyard crops were identified as the most critical needs of the industry. To address these needs we have assembled a team of trans-disciplinary, multi-state researchers, industry leaders, and cross-commodity groups and developed this project. It addresses three legislatively mandated areas - (i) efforts to improve production efficiency, productivity, and profitability over the long term, (ii) new innovations and technology, and (iii) potential food safety hazards. This project uses proximal sensors mounted on a mobile platform to provide the information desired by stakeholders. These include information on canopy architecture and light interception using Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) sensors (- enhance yield and/or quality by proper canopy management), plant-soil water status using a sensor suite consisting of a thermal IR gun, ambient temperature, humidity and wind speed sensors (- improve water use efficiency). Moreover, this project aims to develop a data visualization software and a decision support system to assist with management decisions. Variable rate water application using a wireless network to address spatio-temporal variability in plant-soil moisture status is also being addressed (- enhance yield, improve quality and/or conserve water). Finally, this proposal addresses the socio-economic implications of proposed senor technology. Four states in the western region - Arizona (pecans), California (almonds, grapes, and walnuts), Oregon (hazelnuts), and Washington (tree-fruits and grapes) - will participate in this project. The expected outcomes of this project are - (i) field verified sensors mounted on mobile platforms for measuring canopy architecture and plant water status, (ii) a decision support system to implement canopy management and irrigation management based on sensor data, (iii) development of a technology to apply water to individual or block of trees based on soil and plant water status, and (vi) determination of socio-economic implications of the developed technologies. Outreach has been integrated into the project plan and each state will implement various activities (i.e., webinars, presentations at commodity group annual meetings, demonstrations at field days, etc.) starting with the second year of the project. An advisory board has been setup to ensure that stakeholders continue to play a key role during the course of the project."

While there are many well developed oilseed crops none are efficient sources of these high value oils. Many undomesticated crops, particularly those adapted to harsh environments such as the desert, produce high levels of high value oils and waxes. The jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) shrub is one example. Jojoba  beans  can contain up to 70% by weight of a high molecular weight liquid wax that has been utilized as a replacement for sperm whale oil. There has been a long standing interest in developing renewable sources of high molecular weight oil products including the wax esters produced by jojoba, carnauba palm (Copernicia cerifera), and other species to meet this need. The high molecular weight oils and waxes produced by these plants have a variety of uses including as industrial lubricants, food additives, cosmetics, and as renewable stocks for synthesis of compounds such as various adhesives, emmoliants, PEG's, natural plastics, nylons, and more. In spite of considerable efforts in the past decades to develop efficient production schemes for native oil-bearing desert plants such as jojoba efficient production methods capable of meeting demand have not been devised. Conventional oilseed crops could potentially provide a natural and renewable resource for high value oils and waxes. Characterization of the wax biosynthetic pathway in jojoba led to the discovery of a wax synthase capable catalyzing high molecular weight wax formation. Homology searches of other plant genes identified 11 candidate wax synthase genes in A. thaliana that are similar to the jojoba wax synthase. We hypothesize that high value wax ester production in conventional Brassica oilseed crops like rape seed can be increased by altering regulation of genes already within these Brassica spp."

First, the high cost of implementing manure management strategies, such as installing and operating anaerobic digesters and therefore the need to optimize return on investment by developing value-added products from the residuals. Second is that biomass (particularly large quantities of agricultural residue like wheat straw, pea vines, and other residuals) has the potential to play a significant role in the future of combustion or co-combustion power plants. However, a drawback is that the overall energy yield of these materials is modest when compared to other potential sources. The project will develop a value-added industrial absorbent product from anaerobically-digested bovine manure fiber. In preliminary studies, fiber treated post-digestion to improve certain properties has shown significant promise as a superior absorbent for petroleum products. We will characterize and optimize these properties for several types of digesters. The optimized fiber absorbent will be delivered to test customers in order to evaluate its efficacy under industrial conditions and to survey customer satisfaction with the product. Following use, the fiber will be picked up from the customers and tested to determine its energy (BTU) content. This information will determine the potential of the product following use to absorb petroleum spills to augment the energy content of agricultural residues, thus making them a more efficient source of renewable energy."

A study conducted at five locations across the state that included irrigated and non-irrigated sites found that tall wheatgrass and grass mixtures that contained tall wheatgrass provided superior quality for ethanol production compared to several other species evaluated including switchgrass. Tall wheatgrass also contained higher cellulose and had lower lignin amounts which would increase ethanol production efficiency. In a separate study, grass plots harvested every other year produced approximately 25% less biomass yield than grasses harvested annually. Several experiments were seeded in spring 2009 to evaluate the potential biomass yield of kenaf, sunnhemp, sorghums, and millets. Initial results found sorghum and kenaf have the potential to produce above 10 ton/acre of dry matter in one season and could be used as annual feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol production in ND. A study to evaluate production potential of 22 varieties of sorghum that included BMR (Brown Mid Rib) hybrids was conducted at two locations in ND. The BMR character confers reduced lignin content which increases digestibility with a resulting increase in ethanol production. Unfortunately, varieties that contained the BMR character had less biomass production than the same variety without BMR. Studies are in progress to evaluate to yield potential of grass and grass legume mixtures compared to grasses grown alone. The long-term goal is to produce more biomass and thus more ethanol per acre with reduced inputs. Examples of mixtures include intermediate and tall wheatgrass, wheatgrass, alfalfa and sweet clover, or basin and alti wildrye. Sugarbeet pulp is used as a feedstock for ethanol production. A solids fed batch approach has shown that loadings up to 12% solids allowed near maximum yields with increased sugar concentrations for subsequent ethanol conversion compared to higher or lower percentages. Invasion of cool season perennial grasses into established switchgrass fields has become a serious problem and decreases potential ethanol production. A total of four pre-emergent and 23 post-applied herbicides have been evaluated for efficacy on switchgrass, quackgrass, and smooth bromegrass. Of these nine were chosen for further evaluation for weed control in an established switchgrass field. Pyroxulam, sulfosulfuron, and aminocyclopyrachlor provided the best smooth bromegrass control while sulfometuron and propoxycarbazone were most effective for quackgrass control. None of these herbicides injured switchgrass. An empirical model based on a mathematical programming algorithm was developed to determine the optimal number, location, and size of cellulose ethanol plants in North Dakota to maximize the use of biomass produced in the state. The goal is to minimize transportation costs of biomass to the plant and of ethanol from the plant to blending facilities."

Additional support is being sought to increase the detail of cover crop study and the breadth of application of lessons learned. The focus of cover crop studies will be to reduce weed pressure on cash crops in the rotation and improve soil fertility. Increasing nitrogen production from legumes in an age of increasing energy costs will be a necessity. A Pennsylvania Soybean Promotion board funded project will be continued during 2010 to develop a network in PA soybean growers who seek to conduct their own on-farm evaluations. They employ some of the latest computerized planting and harvesting mapping capabilities. Coupled with aerial photography, these tools will aid in the identification of yield and profit-limiting factors in soybean production. Supported with a NE SARE Research and Education grant, researchers from Penn State, USDA-ARS Beltsville, and Rodale Institute will continue a project that seeks to improve the sustainability of dairy cropping systems for the northeast. Manure injection, increased use of cover crops, controlling cover crops with a roller/crimper, and the possible inclusion of canola into the cropping rotation for purposes of producing liquid fuels for farm use will be included. A project supported with funding from the USDA-OREI program, recently begun and to continue through 2013, will include researchers from Penn State, USDA-ARS Beltsville, and University of Delaware. The goal is to improve the sustainability of organic grain production by reducing the amount of tillage normally practiced. Making use of varieties with shorter growing season needs to enable more intensive usage of cover crops is the focus of the project. Weed and insect pest management techniques will also be tested. The recent large increase in fertilizer prices, especially nitrogen, has prompted strong promotion of several products that are added to N fertilizer to reduce losses to volatilization and leaching.

To accomplish this goal, three new scientists will be added to the current staff at the Institute for Environmentally Integrated Dairy Management, located in Marshfield, WI. The research efforts of these scientists will focus on assessment of gaseous emissions from dairy farms operating with current (typical) management strategies, and then to develop new and improved management systems that reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. These new management strategies will be focused on offsetting emissions of greenhouse gases via carbon sequestration, collection of biogases, and on-farm energy production. Within this initiative, other research will seek to reduce emissions of particulates and non-greenhouse gases, continue to conserve and/or improve environmental quality, and to assess the potential of biomass legume crops in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Overall, these efforts will seek to improve dairy productivity, and to create a more environmentally benign dairy industry."

Within the native grasses, little effort has focused on their breeding, selection, and cultivar development. Until improved native plant materials have been developed that are competitive with invasive weeds, easy to establish, and persistent, it is critical to continue to improve introduced plant materials with increased seedling vigor and drought and defoliation tolerance with increased persistence. Failure to do so will result in increased fire frequency, loss of soil structure, increased soil erosion, and economically unproductive rangelands.

It is estimated that 70% of Texas cotton is exported and must be marketable, both in terms of price and quality to compete in global markets. Producers must increase efficiencies by utilizing new technologies including improved transgenic varieties, tillage systems, and irrigation technology. Advances in genetics have improved fiber quality, however other quality parameters related to crop maturity vary due to weather and crop management. Integrated production systems must be developed to optimize yield, profitability and more importantly, lint quality. An economically and environmentally sustainable cropping system must optimize soil and water resources, manage insects, weeds, and diseases, and respond to changing commodity markets. Two trends which influence cropping systems include the adoption of conservation/no till systems and herbicide-tolerant crops. The Texas Southern High Plains (TSHP) is a semi-arid region with approximately 50% of crop acreage irrigated from the non-recharging Ogallala aquifer. Improved irrigation technology, such as low-energy precision application (LEPA) and more recently sub-surface drip (SDI) has made irrigation more viable where water is limited. These systems have replaced furrow irrigation and allowed producers to use water more efficiently, but have not reduced the quantity of water pumped. Returns are higher from cotton than from alternative crops leading to a cotton monoculture. Crop rotations, when combined with conservation tillage can have significant impacts on soil, crop yields and profitability. Cover crops, including small grains or legumes have been investigated to provide crop residue in cropping systems which do not produce sufficient residue to provide adequate cover, such as with cotton or soybean. The use of conservation tillage to maintain crop residues on the soil surface offers great potential for reducing soil erosion by wind and water, which is especially important for the sandyland areas of the Southern High Plains. Cotton seedlings are extremely susceptible to abrasion damage. Studies have attempted to identify amounts of crop residue needed to protect soil in the Northern Great Plains from wind erosion, and to estimate losses under various tillage systems and crop residue combination. Previous research has established effective weed control programs in conventional tillage cotton for the Southern High Plains. In several states, including Tennessee and Arkansas, intensive glyphosate use has led to the development of glyphosate-resistant horseweed. New and improved GR crops continue to be developed with multiple herbicide resistance genes to meet changing weed management needs to help sustain the efficacy of glyphosate. Widespread development of Palmer amaranth resistance to glyphosate has been reported in numerous states. The control of volunteer GR crops is an increasing problem. Control of volunteer GR cotton in GR cotton has been investigated with postemergence directed herbicides."

San Juan Bioenergy built an oilseed crushing plant in Dove Creek and began processing sunflower and safflower seeds in December 2008. Safflower has been grown in southwestern Colorado and particularly in southeastern Utah longer than sunflower has but its acreage rarely exceeds 2,000 hectares. Both safflower and sunflower have root systems that are capable of extracting soil moisture from great depths e.g., 2.0 m for sunflower based on the literature. This is a concern because of the low and erratic precipitation in southwestern Colorado. Long-term average annual precipitation in most of the farming area is 300 to 400 mm, 35 to 40% of which comes in the form of snow. Thus, a primary objective of this project is to determine the agronomic and economic feasibility of sunflower in rotation with more traditional crops such as winter wheat and dry bean. An important question that will be addressed is how often (e.g., every third or fourth year) can sunflower be grown in the same field while maintaining or enhancing the overall cropping system's profitability. Since sunflower is a relatively new crop in southwestern Colorado, we will also develop other best management practices such as optimum planting dates to maximize oil production for example. Most of the sunflower grown in southwestern Colorado is rain-fed, which given current production levels (a little over 1.5 million liters of oil in 2008) will not satisfy the Dove Creek Plant's capacity of 9.45 million liters of oil per year, unless dramatic increases in planted acres or oil yield occur. Consequently, we will experiment with limited but well targeted irrigation water applications as a way to boost oil production. In addition we will continue testing varieties and hybrids of sunflower and safflower for their adaptation and yield potential. Other oilseed crops of interest are canola and camelina. Canola has done well at the Southwestern Colorado Research Center under irrigation while camelina is a promising crop for dryland cropping systems given its short season and low input requirements. The information generated by this project will be shared with growers and recommendations will be made to enhance oilseed production in particular and agricultural sustainability in general, in southwestern Colorado."

Soilborne diseases perennially remain among the primary disease problems in Arizona agriculture. The work especially will be of importance in controlled environment agriculture, which increasingly will be of commercial importance in arid lands. (2) Needs the project will fill: Border cells potentially can be used to deliver small doses of chemicals directly to the site where it is needed to control disease, without polluting vast acreages. The promoters of genes expressed in border cells can be linked to structural genes encoding products such as antibiotics, pesticides, and nutrient-solubilizing enzymes. The use of border cell specific promoters that are expressed only after the cells separate from the root minimizes problems inherent in overexpressing such products within plant tissue. (3) Ways the public welfare and scientific knowledge will be advanced: Potential applications include altering physical properties of the environment such as pH to facilitate nutrient uptake,  bioremediation  or detoxication of contaminated soils, and establishment or inhibition of specific microbial relationships. As more genes encoding metabolites that influence plant-microbe recognition are characterized, more opportunities to design border cells for specific environments will become available. Our primary model system has been the garden pea, P. sativum, with alfalfa used for comparative analysis. Pea remains among the principal food crops in the U.S. with significant increases in production in the Northwest in recent years (usda.gov), and alfalfa remains the nation's top hay crop, with 10-12 harvests annually in southwestern Arizona (epa.gov). The research applies generally to crop species including cereals, legumes, and cotton."

Climatic models indicate that drought will become increasingly common in the future. For example, 2009 was the worst drought in 50 years, with record-high temperatures and record-low rainfall in south/central regions of Texas causing $3.6 billion losses in crop and livestock production. Therefore, understanding plant and crop responses to drought, high temperature, wind, and nutrient balance is critical to develop sustainable cropping systems and tolerant genotypes to maintain or improve crop productivity and increase product quality. In Texas in 2008, major vegetable crops for fresh market and processing were grown under conventional systems across 74,400 acres (not including potatoes), with a total value of $276 million for fresh market and processed types and an economic impact of about $1 billion. In terms of value, the major crops for Texas are watermelon, onion, cabbage, and chile/jalapeno pepper and spinach. In the Wintergarden region, predominant spring crops are watermelon, cantaloupe, cucumber, pepper, green bean, and potato, while fall-winter crops are onion, cabbage, spinach, carrot, broccoli, cauliflower and more recently romaine lettuce. Other small scale specialty crops grown commercially, or on experimental basis, are tomato, eggplant, habanero pepper, cilantro, turnip, collards, kale, mustard, herbs and more recently artichoke. This project will address environmental constraints during seedling establishment, crop development and maturity. It will also focus on adaptation of new cultivars known to possess high yield potential and high levels of phytochemicals. Emphasis will be on the morphological and physiological characterization of root/shoot responses in order to better understand plant acclimation. This understanding is a pre-requisite to develop improved production strategies under those limited environments."

In those experiments supplements providing minerals and vitamins in quantities known to be essential for good health (e.g. provided known daily recommended intakes (DRI)) and a source of protein derived from kidney or similar beans, improved growth and other markers of nutritional status. Moreover, the immune status was also improved by the nutritional supplement! For children receiving highly active anti-retroviral drugs and eating the supplement, the CD4 cells (immune cells that are usually destroyed by the virus) increased, there was less drug resistance, and the children could be treated with a lower cost drug for a longer period of time. In the second study children that were not being treated with anti-retroviral drugs were provided with the nutritional supplement. Again the nutritional and immunological status of the children improved. The improved immune status was such that the children did not need to be treated with anti-retroviral drugs. This research has tremendous implications regarding the quality of life and medical treatment for people living with HIV infection. The preliminary trials were not controlled and randomized, so a large scale, randomized, controlled study is required to verify the previous results and to increase our knowledge concerning how nutritional support mitigates some of the adverse effects of HIV. HIV+ positive children aged 2 to 15 years will be randomly assigned to receive supplements containing minerals and vitamins and protein from (a) fish and corn, (b) kidney beans and corn, or (c) cowpeas and corn. Beans and cowpeas are commonly consumed sources of protein in much of Africa. The results from this research is expected to ultimately change how people living with HIV are fed and medically treated and in the long term improve quality of life and reduce medical costs."

The primary crucifer vegetables and common bean crops in NY State are cabbage (15,000 acres), snap bean (33,000 acres) and light red kidney beans (15,000 acres). The NY State combined farm-gate value of these crops is approximately $150,000,000. Additionally, NY State produces several thousand acres of cauliflower with a farm-gate value of approximately $10 million, and is restricted in broccoli production primarily through brief seasonal heat waves causing damage to the crowns. On a global scale, crucifer vegetable crops (Brassica oleracea) are grown on over 300,000 acres in the U.S., with an estimated value in excess of $1 billion and on several million acres worldwide especially throughout SE Asia and Europe. World common bean production is in excess of 22 million tons with over 4 million tons of snap beans. Snap beans are an important crop for the northeast and Great Lakes region where approximately 200,000 acres are grown for processing and 50,000 acres for fresh market. Several diseasea and environmental stresses reduce cole crop and common bean yield and quality. The most effective long-term solution to these problems is through enhancing germplasm and breeding new varieties. Host plant resistance to pests and physiological stresses can improve the uniformity and quality of snap bean yields when introgressed into an acceptable plant type. The primary constraints to common bean production are environmental stresses and diseases. New cultivars that are adapted to US markets would be of importance to growers, particularly if value added traits are introgressed. The development of segregating populations that can be selected for yield, quality and other important traits will enhance the development of new cultivars. Molecular markers could also allow selection of pest resistance while other characters are being screened for (simultaneous selection could otherwise lead to erroneous results). Developing marker-assisted selection for new sources of resistance will be a valuable tool in breeding new commercially viable host plant resistant cultivars. Selection for germplasm with resistance will be valuable for breeding superior lines, which require lower pesticide use. Support of this work will enhance the development of Brassica and Phaseolus crops that will subsequently benefit growers through improved cultivars with increased host plant resistance. Resistant germplasm will be important to the future development of cultivars by both the program and the seed industry."

It not only provides an economically viable alternative to wheat, barley and canola but also helps condition the soil for these other crops through its ability to add nitrogen, its low water use, and its alternate pests, weeds, and diseases. Relatively few public breeding programs service the region. In addition, the recent sequencing of the genome of barrel medic greatly increases the potential for rapid and dramatic improvement in the pea varieties available and our ability to manipulate the crop. The current project will take advantage of the recent developments in our understanding of the legume genome to develop new pea varieties specifically adapted to conditions in Montana and the Northern Great Plains. In addition, it proposes to address certain of the bottlenecks and vulnerable aspects of the pea crop by widening the genetic base of the crop and tagging and identifying several genes critical to our ability to cultivate the crop in the United States. As a species, pea possesses a high genetic diversity, and a wide range of products can be generated by traditional breeding techniques. One novel pea type that will be released as an output of this project is a dry pea that has a high content of slow digesting starch. Such a starch content is particularly suitable for type II diabetics or other individuals who desire to avoid high blood sugar levels. Soup or other products made from such peas is digested gradually, and has a much lower glycemic index than other grains or starchy vegetables. Other genes that will be investigated include several that provide resistance to specific diseases of pea, including powdery mildew, enation virus and fusarium wilt. Each of these diseases is common in pea growing regions, and the loss of their effectiveness would greatly reduce our ability to grow this crop."

Producers have the option of mechanically harvesting forage biomass and storing it for feeding to livestock during forage deficit periods or selling it to other livestock producers as a feedstuff. Forage Biomass can also be harvested by grazing livestock and converted into body weight gain, which can be sold. More recently, harvested forage biomass can be used as a Ligno-Cellulosic-Biofuel (LCB) feedstock. Most forage producers are diversified and have a livestock component within their operation. Annual warm season grasses are an essential element in assembling a diverse forage biomass production component within a livestock-cropping enterprise in the southern Great Plains. Annual warm season grasses afford producers flexibility in the amount and location of forage biomass production. However, production of annual warm season grasses as a forage biomass requires relatively large amounts of N. The cost of purchasing inorganic N can limit the amount of forage biomass produced. The production process that yields inorganic N fertilizer uses atmospheric N, but also large amount of fossil fuel, which may be expensive or of limited availability in the future. Forage biomass production systems based on inorganic N inputs are not sustainable. Forage biomass producers must develop on farm sources of N, such as legumes. Legumes also use atmospheric N, which is captured via a symbiotic relationship between legume roots and nodule bacteria. Because legumes accumulate N in above and below ground compartments, incorporation of above ground legume biomass into the soil will increase the amount of N in the soil pool. Mechanical incorporation of above ground biomass requires additional fossil fuel inputs, while grazing livestock can harvest the above ground biomass, extract about 20% of N for growth and maintenance, and deposit the remainder on the soil surface for incorporation by water infiltration, soil disturbance, and beetles (Coleoptera). However, the impact of above ground legume biomass management on the amounts of N available for a second crop of annual warm season grass is not known."

Both chronic and currently undermanaged, and emerging plant diseases are a continual threat to New York field crops and can reduce the already narrow profit margin for producers. This project addresses the most critical and timely crop disease management issues and directly supports several extension education initiatives. The project provides basal support for the plant pathology research component of an integrated field crops management program. It offers both fundamental contributions to disease epidemiology and management, and short-term research results on disease management tactics that can be recommended to extension educators, agribusiness, and growers. Methods employed include farm survey; experimental field plot assessment of cultivars, fungicides, biological control agents and cultural practices; controlled environment experiments; molecular genetic evaluation of pathogen populations; and aerobiology methods for studying fungal spore dispersal. Research efforts in the next 3 years will be focused on the biology and management of mycotoxin producing fungi in corn and wheat; viruses and foliar fungal diseases of wheat; brown root rot of forage legumes; disease management with resistant culitvars and clean seed programs in biofuel feedstock grasses; and optimized use of fungicides in the protection of corn, soybean and wheat. Intended outcomes include guidelines for disease management tactics that have been validated under New York conditions. Field crop producers will benefit financially from more efficient production of their crops (less disease-induced losses and savings from unnecessary application of control measures). Animal producers; feed, food, and biofuel processors; farm service providers; rural communities; and all consumers will benefit from the contributions of disease management to sustainable field crops production.

They treated the whole field uniformly when they applied nutrients, water, pesticides, etc., regardless of the variability. However, with the advances of technology, site-specific crop management (SSCM) or precision agriculture is becoming possible, and different locations in a field can be treated differently based on the site-specific conditions. Precision agriculture is defined as  managing each crop production input - fertilizer, limestone, herbicide, insecticide, seed, etc. - on a site-specific basis to reduce waste, increase profits, and maintain the quality of the environment  (Ess and Morgan, 2003). To implement precision agriculture for efficient crop management, growers need to know the status of crop and soil throughout the crop production periods from planting to harvesting. Once the crop status is known, growers can make correct management decisions, so that they can save time, labor, and money and thereby increase yield and profit. However, currently there are not many sensing systems commercially available for detecting crop status. Those existing ones are mostly for grain crops and tailored for grain production, and cannot be easily applied to crops grown in Florida. In 2007, Florida's major crops were oranges, grapefruit, snap beans, tangerines, sugarcane, fresh market tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers, and watermelons in terms of total value of production (Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, 2008). Certainly Florida has its uniqueness in crop varieties, and thus different sensing systems need to be developed to fit the crop situations in Florida. During the next five years, we are planning to develop different sensing systems that could help site-specific crop management for Florida's major crops, including citrus, sugarcane, and other high value crops. The sensor systems will have to be very user-friendly, so that growers could utilize them easily without much prior training or experience. These sensing tehnologies will be transferred and disseminated to Florida growers, and we would like to encourage them to adopt these developed technologies in their crop production so that they could implement precision agriculture, maintain competitiveness, overcome potential farm labor shortage, and increase overall yield and profit, while maintaining the quality of the environment."

Inclusion of the maximum amount of forage in an animal's diet reduces the use of purchased feed ingredients (concentrates) and makes a large contribution to the overall profitability of the operation since feed costs usually constitute at least 50 percent of the cost of producing milk. These purchased feed ingredients are often imported from other states and represent a drain on the Maine economy; a drain that could be reduced by the increased use of home-grown forages. Improvement of forage quality is particularly important in Maine because the dairy industry is the largest component of animal agriculture and together with beef and veal operations is probably the largest agricultural component of the Maine economy. In the northeastern United States, and particularly in Maine, the climate, topography, soil type, and soil drainage in many areas are more suitable for growing forages rather than row crops. Consequently, although corn for corn silage is a profitable crop in some areas, many areas are more suitable for the growth of grasses and legumes as forage crops. Work under previous Hatch projects (MAES 8306) examined the effects on silage fermentation, chemical composition, rumen digestion, and nutritive value of a range of forage crops ensiled with various biological and chemical additives. Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to investigate the interaction of these additives, primarily enzyme and enzyme-bacteria mixtures, with forage type since carbohydrate composition and silage fermentation is markedly affected by forage species, its maturity, and its dry matter content. Some of these additives, both biological and chemical, were then evaluated at the farm level. The purpose of the proposed project is to evaluate some of the additives currently available to the Maine producer in an attempt to slow the decline of the Maine dairy industry. Many of these products have little or no scientific research to support their claims of improved forage preservation, greater animal performance or  improved bunk life  and rely on testimonials from other users. The current economic problems of the Maine dairy industry require that Maine milk producers have better information on which to base their purchases and forage management practices. These products will be evaluated in both laboratory-scale mini-silos and in farm-scale bunker silos. Previous research with corn silage showed that fermentation in a laboratory produced a different fermentation profile than that in the farm bunker due to differences in fermentation temperature profile and to the presence of a different microbial population on the forage fermented in the lab. These experiments will attempt to refine this data with first, second, and third crop mixed grass-legume forage to more accurately predict silage quality from mini-silo fermentations that cost less to perform, thus providing information to Maine producers more economically and faster than is possible from farm-scale experiments."

In addition, overall demand outlook for pine pulpwood in the near future is not encouraging. Since landowners receive no income during the early years from pine plantations, the production of cattle grazing forage that has been improved under these pines can provide some annual income while the trees are growing. Silvopasture systems are designed to provide short-term cash flow from the forage-livestock component while producing a high-value timber component. Overall, silvopasture systems can provide economic returns while creating a sustainable, biologically diverse system with many environmental benefits. Well-managed silvopastures also offer a diversified marketing opportunity that could stimulate rural economic development. Surveys of southern USA public land-use professionals have revealed that pine-cattle grazing practices dominate southern agroforestry and that increased economic diversity and higher total monetary returns were perceived as the primary tangible benefits of these silvopastoral practices. In 2000, scientists predicted that with higher lumber prices and environmental concerns relative to loss of wildlife and land degradation, silvopasture would be an agroforestry practice that would be expected to receive greater interest from landowners. The expansion of silvopasture research in the South U.S. Region since 2005 (as outlined in the CRIS Retrival Summary done for this project) supports this prediction. New areas of interest include the use of indigenous grass and legume species within the silvopasture configuration for enhanced wildlife habitat, hunting leases, and bioenergy production. Further investigation of forage-soil-animal interactions is needed during all phases of southern-pine silvopasture system development to provide information on how to manage both exotic and indigenous forage communities for plant productivity, as well as soil quality, with economically sustainable practices that enhance ecosystem health and services throughout the lifespan of the tree component. The research proposed herein falls within both the 1) Enhancing Agricultural Production Systems and Value-Added Processing, and 3) Environment, Ecosystems, and Natural Resources Priority Areas by addressing the need to promote long-term sustainability within agricultural systems through application of farming approaches that ensure the sustainability of rural communities and agricultural and forestry production systems, and the need to understand how management practices within these systems enhance the plant-root environment, soil productivity and quality, and improve water infiltration and water use efficiency."

South Dakota's unique geographical location allows crops, normally separated by location or cropping season, to be grown simultaneously and creates a continuum of living hosts that favors many plant viruses. Surveys of South Dakota winter wheat concluded that wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) is an endemic virus problem with an average of 47% of all winter wheat fields containing plants infected with WSMV. WSMV-infected winter wheat loses from 5% to over 70% of its yield depending on the cultivar and environmental conditions. Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) has a heavy impact on South Dakota small grains during years with strong flights of BYDV carrying aphids from southern states. BYDV caused reductions of grain yields in infected plants range from 47 to 81% in South Dakota. Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) has been demonstrated to cause yield losses up to 56% in certain lines and to cause greater yield losses when the infection occurs at early dates. New viruses, such as High Plains virus or Triticum mosaic virus, are new threats that will impact the future crops. Clearly, plant viruses impact the economic potential for South Dakota agriculture. Management of plant viruses relies on preventative actions rather than therapeutic treatments, such as pesticides. Thus, this project promotes management of plant viral diseases through monitoring, identification, detection, and interactive studies with agricultural crops, vectors, and alternate hosts to address the environmental and epidemiological roles of plant viruses, resistance evaluation to identify resistant, tolerant, and susceptible plants for management of plant viruses through prevention, and studies to define how viruses interact with the cellular level of their plant hosts. Information developed will be vital to producers/farmers, plant breeders, extension educators and specialists, entomologists, and other researchers. Communication to stakeholders and scientists will be developed through publications, interaction with national disease databases and platforms, and with stakeholder presentations."

This has resulted in a ranking of third for principal crops harvested, but only a ranking of eleventh in cash receipts for crops, and twenty-eighth in net farm income. Thus, even though producers in North Dakota lead the nation in the production of at least eight crops, they struggle to make a living. The reasons for the low net farm income could include lower yields and higher production costs. However, regardless of the reasons, producers need to discover ways to combat low profit margins per unit of land. Increasing farm size generally is not an option due to high land costs. A viable alternative requiring higher management, but also providing increased income potential, is high-value crop production. These products are typically perishable, of high quality and specific value, and increasingly sold through specialized markets. This production alternative may help diversify farming operations and increase net returns. In addition, numerous communities have developed farmer's markets due to the increase in demand for locally produced food. The United States Department of Agriculture reported that between 1994 and 2006, the number of U.S. farmers' markets more than doubled to over 3,700, and the value of U.S. agricultural products directly sold increased thirty-seven percent from $592 million to $812 million. North Dakota's large diurnal temperature differences during the growing season are ideal for high-quality and high-yielding specialty crops such as vegetables, herbs, and small fruits. Many producers are experimenting with small fruits and vegetables, utilizing limited production information available from nearby states and learning from personal experiences. Sustainable production practices are desperately needed to avoid costly mistakes at a time when financial stability is already a concern. With the introduction of Roundup Ready crops in the 1990's and the explosion in the adoption of glyphosate-resistant crops, the acreage receiving more than one application of glyphosate has increased dramatically nation-wide. Glyphosate label additions allowing pre-harvest applications to several non-glyphosate-resistant crops has further increased the acreage treated with glyphosate. Currently, glyphosate is the largest-selling single crop-protection chemical product in the market. Nontarget injury from glyphosate drift to non-glyphosate-resistant crops has been a concern since the introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops. Most research has shown detrimental effects when drift occurred early in the growing season and that nontarget monocot crops are more sensitive than dicot crops. However, since this chemical is translocated within a plant, there is potential injury to the current season growth as well as tubers used for seed the following year. Potato seed producers as well as commercial producers need to be educated on the potential risks associated with glyphosate applications near a potato field."

From the total 665,000 acres harvested in ND in 2007, 10.5 million hundredweight (cwt) of dry bean were produced, which represented an approximate value of $241 million. Most of the production is located in the Red River Valley, which includes ND and MN (the third largest producer in US). Several cultivars released by the NDSU dry bean breeding program have been intensively used by the growers in the region due to their attributes. Therefore, this project will continue offering dry bean cultivars that are adapted to the region and have high yield, seed quality, disease resistance/tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, which has been key for the success of the crop in the area. An active dry bean breeding program at NDSU will allow growers to remain productive and competitive in the global economy, delivering high quality beans to consumers throughout the world. In addition, the scientific community will be also benefited with the discovery and utilization of new genes of interest."

Among these crops, dry beans and peas are excellent sources of protein, fiber and other nutrients such as iron, zinc and folate. Their versatility has resulted in their inclusion in two food groups in the USDA food pyramid (vegetables as well as meats and beans) with the recommendation that they be included in the diet for all people including those who eat meat. Emphasis on the new USDA pyramid has become a driver for the industry and has further supported the production of these crops. North Dakota is the largest producer of both dry beans and field peas in the US with 660,000 acres planted to dry beans in 2008 and over 620,000 acres planted to chickpeas, peas and lentils. The ability of these crops to fix atmospheric nitrogen and the positive rotational benefits associated with these legumes has further enhanced their popularity. The large acreage under dry beans and pulse crops, shorter rotation between legumes and reduced tillage practices all favor disease development. Some of the diseases affecting these crops, have the potential to cause complete crop loss over a very short period of time and the pathogens can survive in the residue for several years. According to a 2007 dry bean grower survey, the most commonly noted diseases in dry beans in North Dakota and Minnesota include white mold, root rots, bacterial blight, rust and anthracnose. Meanwhile, in field peas and lentils, root rots and ascochyta blight are considered to be most damaging diseases in the state. Even though there have been some efforts to identify major diseases of these crops in ND, a sustained effort to gather adequate data on the amount of losses due to each of these diseases has not occurred, particularly in this state. Moreover, changes in pathogen population and disease development in this region need to be studied for development of adequate management practices. Considering the susceptibility of these crops to pathogens, their ability to develop resistance to fungicides and the amount of revenues invested in disease management, a thorough understanding of diseases of dry beans and pulses in this region is very important for developing effective control measures. This project aims at addressing these issues with the use of conventional and molecular plant pathology techniques. The research to be conducted would include identification and evaluation of economically important pathogens affecting production of dry bean and pulse crops in ND, monitoring for new pathogens entering the region, identification of sources of resistance to these pathogens, development of effective disease management strategies and studying the biology of these pathogens to assist in identifying factors that can be used as targets for control. Overall, this work is expected to assist in reducing losses due to disease in dry beans and pulse crops grown in ND, assist in avoiding disease epidemics, facilitate development of improved varieties with better disease resistance and enhance understanding of host pathogen interaction associated with infection and spread of disease."

Greater N is removed by mechanical harvesting but the same problem occurs when the forage is fed: the animals consume forage N but then excrete most of this N into the environment. Because N is usually the primary limitation to plant production in temperate ecosystems, significant manure and inorganic fertilizer N is applied to agroecosystems. Nitrogen fixation by legumes and purchased feed supplements contribute additional N to the system. Unless soil organic matter increases significantly, there is little potential for highly mobile N to accumulate in soils, so the fate of this surplus N is deposition in waterbodies, groundwater, the atmosphere, and adjacent terrestrial ecosystems where it can have undesirable effects. The magnitude of N loss and subsequent negative impacts on ecosystems are influenced by the frequency, intensity, and timing of management practices within the agroecosystem. Mechanisms and pathways for N transformation and loss have been determined for grasslands and pastures, but major gaps exist in our knowledge of the relationships between management and harvest strategies and N pathways on managed cool-season pastures of the central US and elsewhere. Many scientists are focused on improving N use efficiency (NUE) by forages and livestock in order to reduce the amount of N going to the environment and to reduce fertilizer costs to farmers. Current research directed at improving NUE of livestock centers on manipulating the ratio of urine to feces N because urine-derived N is more volatile and labile in the environment. Mounting demand from consumers in the last decade has pushed ranchers and farmers to produce high quality foods at low prices with fewer environmental impacts while remaining profitable. Hence, there is a pressing need for scientifically sound information to make decisions about how best to manage rural landscapes to simultaneously produce agricultural commodities and maintain, and develop ecosystem services such as biodiversity and soil, water, and air quality. Our project will quantify the effect of pasture management on both within-system and downstream environments, and the ability of those environments to provide ecosystem services that optimally benefit human well being. We also will determine the effect of these pasture management practices on NUE in terms of animal production and economic returns. Realization of these objectives will help farmers, policymakers, and agency personnel manage for better quality of life in rural areas. Our expected outcomes include ranking of management strategies in terms of NUE, particularly as it relates to the capture and excretion of N in the environment, ultimately with the goal of adopting strategies/practices that ensure efficient use of N in order to positively influence environmental quality. In addition, this work will facilitate the identification of management strategies and forage systems that minimize N inputs and production costs."

High-value fruit and nut crops for farmers? markets, on-farm markets, CSAs, locavore cooperatives, and restaurants are of great interest to small farmers. This proposal was developed through stakeholder input through conversations with individual growers, interaction with grower associations, and focus groups conducted as part of a 2004 SARE planning grant. Growers indicated an interest in identifying new high-value crops for farmers? markets, on-farm markets, CSAs, locavore cooperatives, and restaurants. Small farmers were interested in growing pawpaw, primocane fruiting blackberries, muscadine grapes, and eastern filbert blight resistant hazelnuts as new or alternative crops for Kentucky. This proposal will develop both fundamental and applied knowledge for scientific and lay publications for organic and conventional production methods and techniques to grow new niche fruit and nut crops in Kentucky and the surrounding region. Field days and tours of field plots will provide demonstrations that will improve skills, increase knowledge, and improve decision-making ability of small and limited resource farmers. Based on the results of this study, recommendations for cultivar selection and conventional and organic production practices will be developed and distributed via print, presentations, field days, and the internet to farmers in Kentucky and beyond. Organic production practices developed could positively impact public health and the environment by reducing pesticide use and enhancing agricultural biodiversity. Organically produced fruit crops will promote economically viable, environmentally sound and socially responsible production practices that reduce synthetic chemical inputs and can protect human health and the environment. Facilitating the local production of fruits and nuts could lead to improved economic opportunities in the south eastern United States, reduced energy inputs and transportation costs, and improve the health and quality of life of youth and adults in rural communities and people in urban settings."

This agricultural system is undergoing rapid and unprecedented change in terms of increasing crop prices (e.g., corn, soybeans, small grains and alfalfa), the proportion of Wisconsin acreage planted to each of these crops, and resulting state and regional forage supplies. In 2007, alfalfa prices increased sharply, partly due to tight hay supplies and partly in response to rapid increase in corn costs exerting upward pressure on forage value (Mintert 2008). Although refined to incorporate the use of glandular haired, potato leafhopper-resistant alfalfa varieties (Lefko et al. 2000), land-grant university economic threshold recommendations for potato leafhopper on standard, leafhopper-susceptible varieties have not been validated or updated with field research data to reflect the current high value crop market.

This region accounts for 33% of the nation's beef cow herd. The states of Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota have 25% of the nation's beef and dairy cows. This region finishes over 53% of cattle marketed for meat. Forages account for 80% of the feed units consumed by beef cattle and, therefore, represent an extremely important resource to the industry. Perennial forages occupy 31% of land classified as farmland in the NCR. Improving the quality and utilization of these forage resources would contribute significantly to the productivity and profitability of livestock production. Production of ethanol from corn and high crude oil prices have caused an increase in prices of livestock concentrate feeds and forages from hay and pasture. From 2003 to 2007 cropland and pastureland values in the Northern Plains region have increased by 58 and 75% respectively. Because of high grain prices, producers are shifting acres of forage production to grain crops, which has caused a tightening in hay supply and pasture availability. In addition, the prices of commercial fertilizers have increased. In order to cope with the high cost of livestock concentrate feeds, hay, and pasture rental rates, sustainable forage-based production systems must be pursued. We propose to 1) evaluate legume-based pasture systems to reduce the use of high-cost commercial fertilizers and 2) evaluate the use of biofuel co-products in forage based diets to optimize utilization of forage resources. Beef cattle producers could decrease the use of fossil fuels, enhance environmental quality of their land, and increase net profit by incorporating legumes into their pastures and feed more co-products derived from the ethanol industry. We hypothesize that the sustainability and profitability of the beef industry can be improved by increasing the proportion of total cattle feed that is harvested directly by grazing cattle and by balancing the diets of grazing cattle with cost-effective supplements. The likely impacts from successfully completing the work include 1) elucidation of impediments to legume establishment in existing grass swards, 2) development of successful establishment techniques for a diverse set of legume species over a wide geographical area, 3) knowledge of grazing strategies to maintain legume persistence, 4) widespread adoption of legume interseeding into pastures throughout the Great Plains, 5) reduced nitrogen fertilizer demand, and 6) increased economic returns. Likely impacts from successfully completing biofuel co-product research will include 1) development of guidelines for optimum storage and feeding of co-products mixed with low quality forage, 2) knowledge of optimum feeding of co-products to grazing livestock and the replacement value of grazed forage, 3) knowledge of nutrient cycling of co-products fed to grazing livestock, 4) widespread adoption of feeding co-products by producers, and 5) improved profitability of producers throughout the Great Plains."

Surplus N from agroecosystems throughout the Midwest has been identified as the primary cause of periodic hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico (Rabalais et al. 2002, Turner and Rabalais 2003). Gaseous N emissions from soils contribute to the greenhouse effect (Robertson et al. 2000, Mosier 2001) and eutrophication of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Vitousek et al. 1997, Carpenter et al. 1998, Ferm 1998). The magnitude of N loss and subsequent negative impacts on ecosystems are influenced by the frequency, intensity, and timing of management practices within the agroecosystem. Forage quality and animal nutrition research is targeting ways of improving N use efficiency by plants (Singer and Moore 2003) and livestock (Scholefield et al. 1991). A previous project (NC-189 Forage Protein Characterization and Utilization for Cattle) of this committee focused on the ruminal degradation characteristics of forage proteins in commonly cultivated forages and also provided a solid understanding of the protein degradation characteristics of native prairie and range grasses found throughout the northcentral region. While mechanisms and pathways for N transformation and loss have been determined for grasslands and pastures (Ledgard 2001, Kroeze et al. 2003), major gaps exist in our knowledge of the relationships between management and harvest strategies and N pathways on managed cool-season pastures of the central US and elsewhere. For example, while empirical relationships between N applied as fertilizer and N loss from the ecosystem exist (Rotz et al. 2005), tradeoffs in N retention and carbon (C) cycling, hence forage production, are less well understood. OUTCOMES OR PROJECTED IMPACTS  Adoption by producers of strategies/practices that ensure efficient use of N, which will have a positive influence on environmental quality in the NCR.

Because of the specific genotypes produced and the upper Northern Plains environment for production and storage, there is a need to continue to understand the fundamental characteristics of these legumes to facilitate food product utilization. Value-added food processing is one of the major new economic initiatives of the state of North Dakota campaigned by Governor Hoeven. This research project will contribute to the development of the value-added food utilization in the state of North Dakota. Therefore, it helps to fulfill one of the cornerstone objectives of the North Dakota Higher Education to promote the economic development. Each year our research program assists growers, breeders, scientists and traders in the characterization of the quality of various legume samples for ensuring high quality legumes for trade. Understanding the quality characteristics of legumes will provide valuable information for promoting trade in the domestic and international markets, thereby providing a positive economic impact for the state of North Dakota. Legumes have undesirable factors such as antinutrients and beany flavor that need to be eliminated from the end products. Other other hand, legumes have biochemical components that may help prevent cancers, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. We will use scientific methods for improving the quality of legume foods for enhancing human health. From this research, we expect to generate new information on science and technology for utilizing legumes. Furthermore, our program will continue to host the visitations of various groups of buyers and inform them the characteristics of legumes produced in the region in the future. The continuation of this program would ensure NDSU and the state of North Dakota as a leader in legume food research in support of providing the highest quality of food and agricultural products to the world."

Participants have access to experimental pastures, livestock handling and feeding facilities, and laboratories at their respective institutions. The 5 year project will allow for adequate time to evaluate the testing of legume establishment and persistence under livestock grazing. In addition, researchers at the participating institutions are well respected and have demonstrated their expertise in evaluating the feeding of biofuel co-products to livestock. The advantages of a multistate effort include synergistic relationships among multi-disciplinary colleagues at the different institutions, ability to evaluate legume establishment and persistence over wide north to south and east to west climatic gradients, and the ability to disseminate research findings to a broad regional audience. A number of the faculty have cooperative extension appointments and will assist the dissemination of research findings. The production of co-products is widespread in these states, and thus potential implementation of co-products findings by a large number of producers is high in each state. Furthermore, because perennial grass forages encompass nearly 100 million acres of the NCR, the land area potentially affected by legume research and the number of producers benefitted is extensive. Collaborative extension efforts will aide in reaching this broad audience. The likely impacts from successfully completing the work include 1) elucidation of impediments to legume establishment in existing grass swards, 2) development of successful establishment techniques for a diverse set of legume species over a wide geographical area, 3) knowledge of grazing strategies to maintain legume persistence, 4) widespread adoption of legume interseeding into pastures throughout the Great Plains, 5) reduced nitrogen fertilizer demand, and 6) increased economic returns. Likely impacts from successfully completing biofuel co-product research will include 1) development of guidelines for optimum storage and feeding of co-products mixed with low quality forage, 2) knowledge of optimum feeding of co-products to grazing livestock and the replacement value of grazed forage, 3) knowledge of nutrient cycling of co-products fed to grazing livestock, 4) widespread adoption of feeding co-products by producers, and 5) improved profitability of producers throughout the Great Plains. Increased use of legumes on just 1% of the 106 million acres of NC perennial forages could replace 50,000 tons of synthetic N. In addition, more efficient utilization of low quality roughages through the incorporation of high quality distillers grains in cattle diets could potentially save $10-20 per cow, which could increase the profit to the beef industry in the NCR by $80-160 million."

Growers treat their seeds with fungicides to protect the emerging seedlings, but these chemicals only provide a short period of protection and will lose their efficacy even faster under conductive environmental conditions, such as high soil moisture, lower soil temperatures, and increased microbial degradation. In comparison, biological control agents (BCAs), mainly bacterial and fungal organisms with the ability to produce antibiotic-like compounds and compete for nutrients and space with the pathogens, can survive for a long time by colonizing the root. Depending on the degree of colonization, this can protect the plant throughout the whole growing season. This project is aimed to identify suitable BCA and fungicide combinations for the control of certain soil-borne diseases under conditions prevalent in southern Idaho. Laboratory and greenhouse experiments, conducted under conditions mimicking environmental conditions during the spring, will screen existing BCAs for their ability to colonize and protect sugar beet roots against individual fungal pathogens and for their compatibility with existing and new fungicides. Finally, suitable combinations of BCAs and fungicides will be tested in fields with a known history of crop losses caused by soil-borne pathogens. The gained data will help to improve the protection of not only emerging sugar beets, but also other crops such as beans, wheat, etc. The utilization of BCAs in combination with chemical seed treatments or as standalone treatments has the potential to reduce pesticide utilization and therefore reduce health risks and environmental contamination."

Tillage practices affect the types of weeds in a field. While winter annual, biennial, and simple perennial weeds do not survive primary (plowing) and secondary (fitting) tillage operations associated with conventional tillage systems, these weeds can become a problem when tillage is eliminated. Because they live for many years, simple perennials like dandelion are among the most problematic. Dandelions are considered simple perennials because they only spread by flowering and setting seed unlike many perennials that spread both vegetatively and by seed. Perennial forages, most commonly legume/grass mixtures, are a key component of crop rotations on NY dairy farms and are commonly infested with dandelions. Dandelions produce abundant seed and each seed has a tuft of hairs that facilitates wind dispersal to adjacent fields. While dandelions have always been a problem with continuous zone/no-tillage corn and soybean production, the potential for dandelion problems has increased with the growing popularity of glyphosate-resistant (GR) corn and soybeans. Since their introduction in 1996, acceptance of GR soybeans has been overwhelming. More than 95% of soybeans grown in NY and other northeastern states were GR varieties in 2008. Acceptance of GR corn has been slower and more variable among northeastern states than for soybeans. In 2008, GR corn acreage in the Northeast ranged from 52% in NY to an average of 78% for the states of DE, MD, and VA. All too often, glyphosate, a non-residual herbicide, is used alone on these GR crops. Residual herbicides that might prevent dandelion establishment are not routinely used, especially in GR soybeans. As the zone/no-tillage acreage of these GR crops increases, dandelions will become a greater problem than in the past. This project would demonstrate the value of residual herbicides in preventing dandelion encroachment into zone/no-tillage fields and determine whether this can be accomplished with less than labeled rates of residual herbicides. This would provide economic benefits for growers and environmental benefits for the public. The economic benefits for growers come from increased yields compared with yields from dandelion infested fields. In addition, if reduced rates of residual herbicides prevented dandelion encroachment, growers could realize cost savings from these reduced rates and/or reduction in costs associated with control of established dandelions. While environmental benefits are difficult to document, it is generally assumed that reduced rates of residual herbicides would minimize the potential for herbicide runoff into surface waters and for leaching into groundwater. Additional research is proposed to evaluate new herbicides and/or herbicide combinations for control of existing dandelion infestations in zone/no-tillage corn and soybeans. Incorporation of residual herbicides into weed management programs for zone/no-tillage cropping systems with GR crops would also delay or prevent development of GR weed populations."

First, biochar is an attractive alternative for mitigating the negative affects of greenhouse gas emissions via long-term carbon sequestration and, second, biochar can be a promising approach to improving soil quality, crop productivity, and the overall sustainability of our food production system. The practical value of biochar as a soil amendment to address global climate change and sustainable soil management hinges on whether it produces significant increases in crop yields and soil quality. However, the agronomic value of biochar and its potential to enhance soil quality has not been adequately studied especially at the field scale. The overall goal of this integrated research and extension project is to gain a better understanding of how pyrolysis conditions affect the physico-chemical properties of biochar and its interactions with soil to impact chemical and biological processes in relation to crop yield. To achieve this goal the project has the following objectives: 1) to evaluate the effect of biochar on soil properties and crop growth on a Histosol (organic soil) and Andisol (volcanic ash soil); 2) to develop science-based information on the agronomic value of biochar for Hawaii's unique environment; 3) to educate growers on the use of biochar as a soil amendment. We will install field experiments at the Mealani and Waiakea Research Stations on the Big Island consisting of a 3X2 factorial with three rates of bichar (0, 20, and 40 T/ha) and two fertilizer treatments (with and without conventional fertilizer) with four replicates. Biochar impacts on crop productivity will be measured on a winter lettuce crop followed by a summer bean crop. Treatment effects on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties will be assessed following each harvest. Outreach and extension activities will consist of website development, extension publications, and annual workshops and field days highlighting results from the field experiments."

An important contribution of this project for society at large will be the application of this information to the breeding of crops with superior performance under soil stresses. In this project, we will create knowledge that permits increased stress tolerance of crops, especially maize and common bean. We will provide physiologically validated phenotypic traits, germplasm sources, and phenotypic and molecular markers that could be used directly in breeding. Our ongoing collaboration with plant breeders in maize and bean production regions of Africa and Latin America will ensure that useful results will have impact in developing nations. This project therefore addresses novel scientific issues that are of demonstrable relevance to human welfare."

In addition to the chemical cues from both partners, the effectiveness and maintenance of many bacterial-eukaryotic symbioses depend on post-transcriptional regulatory cascades. In S. meliloti-Medicago symbiosis, a potential role for post-transcriptional regulation is strongly suggested by the lack of a substantial overlap between symbiotic transcriptomes and proteomes. We have recently observed that a mutation in the S. meliloti hfq gene causes alterations of several cellular functions including symbiosis. Hfq is a RNA-binding protein and a post-transcriptional regulator in many bacteria. Our observation suggests that Hfq and Hfq-dependent small RNAs may mediate important post-transcriptional gene regulation in the S. meliloti-M. truncatula symbiosis. It also implies that there is a large Hfq-mediated sRNA network in this bacterium which is largely unexplored so far. The proposed studies are expected to determine functions of Hfq in controlling post-transcriptional regulation in this symbiotic nitrogen fixation bacterium. Working with other research groups, this will be a jointed effort to examine the mechanisms by which post-transcriptional gene regulation contributes to the establishment and maintenance of a host-rhizobia interaction. Recent advances in functional genomics of S. meliloti, the development of the Symbiosis GeneChip and in vivo expression technology will help achieve our goal efficiently and define functions and mechanisms of Hfq-mediated post-transcriptional regulation."

Since the 1970's, this investment has been viewed as a form of insurance against yield loss from N limitation, and there has been widespread reliance on yield-based N recommendations. In these recommendations, an expected yield goal is multiplied by 1.2 and the product is then corrected, if appropriate, by applying estimated credits for a previous legume or the use of manure for the current growing season. The usual result is overfertilization beyond what the crop needs, which not only reduces profitability for the farmer but also leads to air and water pollution and even degrades the soil itself. Clearly, the use of N fertilizers should be matched to crop N requirement, but in a humid region such as Illinois, this only becomes feasible if there is some means to estimate the soil's N-supplying power. The Illinois Soil N Test (ISNT) was developed for precisely this purpose, and has been used successfully in several field trials to predict yield response by corn to N fertilization. There have, however, also been negative evaluations, suggesting the need to improve ISNT interpretations by accounting for other factors that can affect soil N availability or crop N requirement, such as soil series, cropping system (continuous corn versus corn-soybean), planting rate, tillage, residue management, and weather conditions. In the present project, these and other factors will be evaluated for improving the calibration of the ISNT in optimizing N fertilizer rates for corn. The expected outcome is a more accurate fertilizer N recommendation that enhances profitability for producers while reducing the adverse environmental effects of overfertilization."

New and versatile uses of soybeans such as soyfoods, vegetable soybeans (edamame), animal feeds, pharmaceutical products, and industrial products such as biodiesel fuel generate increased domestic and worldwide demand for U.S. soybeans, soybean meal, and soybean oil. Nevertheless the U.S. currently faces issues which limit U.S. export shares of the global soy market including increased competition from expanded soybean production in Brazil and other regions of South America, and competition in world markets from expanded production of other oil producing crops. The increased competition puts extra pressure on U.S. producers to maximize production from optimized inputs. The broad array of uses and the world demand for soybean, soybean oil, and soybean meal coupled with the projected expanded use for soy products in the future provides an optimistic outlook for soybean. Innovative research will provide new genetic lines and knowledge allowing U.S. soybean producers to compete in a global market. Genetic gains will be accomplished through plant breeding research, leading to increased soybean production potential. The methods will include hybridization of genetically diverse parental stocks which are complementary in genes for desirable attributes. Parent stocks will be chosen from breeding lines from the University of Tennessee program, breeding lines and varieties from other public and commercial breeding programs, and from the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection. The inheritance of genes affecting various traits deemed to be important for plant growth, seed yield, or seed quality will be investigated with classical genetic and molecular genetic analyses. Specific populations will be analyzed for protein, amino acid composition of the protein, oil concentration, fatty acid composition of the oil, and other seed quality traits (eg. isoflavones) in order to identify and develop superior new value-added soybean lines. New advances in quantitative trait loci detection and molecular genetic marker assisted selection will accelerate genetic gains. The goals, objectives, and anticipated outputs are 1) the development of high-yielding soybean varieties that are resistant to pests of economic importance and are adapted to the climatic and cultural practices of Tennessee, the Mid-South, and Southeast regions of the U.S., 2) the development of superior soybean lines or varieties with modified oil quality, enhanced protein concentration, improved vegetable soybean nutrition and flavor, or other value-added traits, and 3) the discovery of new information on soybean genetics and breeding methodologies to enable new technologies which will enhance the science and effectiveness of plant breeding."

As a result of these concerns and a rise in production costs, including that of fertilizer N, the sustainability of the Michigan beef cattle industry is in question. One way to address these challenges is to develop production systems that maximize forage utilization and maintain a long-term legume to grass biomass ratio in pasture. An important component to this production system is low-pressure irrigation. The Michigan GAAMPS for Irrigation reports that Michigan is the driest state east of the Mississippi during the important forage-growing months of July and August. However, annual rainfall easily surpasses water requirements for crop and plant growth, thus replenishing surface and underground water. To the author's knowledge no reliable data are available regarding utilizing pasture irrigation with Midwest beef cow-calf systems. Impact Quantitative Our hypothesis is northern Michigan beef production can be increased two-fold in an economically feasible, environmentally sustainable manner using irrigation, thus a positive impact on income is expected. Along with this, legumes can potentially replace up to 200 units N/0.40ha., a tremendous cost savings due to less need for purchasing and applying fertilizer N. Qualitative By N fixation, legumes can lower need for fertilizer N and provide a sustainable option for pasture-based production by lowering nitrous oxide emissions, positively impacting water quality, fossil fuel consumption, and climate change. As well, this cow-calf trial is crucially important to our team's goal at the Lake City Experiment Station and establishing a year-round pasture based production system."

We will focus on identification and functional characterization of taste receptors that are involved in detection of various appetitive stimuli and investigate their roles in feeding behavior. We will then characterize the function of similar receptors in other insect species that have relevance for agriculture or human disease. We will include insects such as the pea aphid, Asian citrus psyllid and the red flour beetle, which are responsible for damage to crops or stored products, and three species of mosquitoes, which are responsible for transmitting disease such as West Nile fever, dengue fever and malaria. Specifically, we propose to examine the function of sugar receptors in insects and identify compounds that enhance or inhibit their activity. We will test whether the presence of these compounds alters feeding behavior. Our research may offer insight into new mechanisms for control of pests or insect disease vectors, which rely on chemical cues to find and identify their hosts. We also propose to develop a novel strategy for introducing deleterious genes in natural populations of insects. Such a strategy may allow the introduction of genes that affect the insect's reproductive potential, or viability, or ability to transmit disease and could be used as part of an integrated pest management program."

Changes in cropping practices, or global climate change, the distribution and impact of native and established pests is increasing in soybean. Producers are encountering insect problems that they have never seen or managed. Changes in pest distribution and status require greater understanding of pest biology and movement, as well as the development or modification of scouting and control methods.

In the northern U.S. and eastern Canada, the discovery of the soybean aphid (SBA) in 2000 fundamentally changed soybean insect management. SBA feeding impacts all components of yield; under heavy aphid pressure, yield differences between treated and untreated research plots may reach 50%. Although scouting methods and an economic threshold (ET) for aphid control were developed under the previous multi-state project, these management practices are only applicable to soybeans in the R1 to R5 growth stages planted in 30-inch rows. The thresholds must be modified to account for plant maturity group and age, differences in planting systems (for example, varying row widths), and populations of biological control agents. Specialty soybean production is a growing, profitable market for producers, including production of seed, non-GMO, identity preserved (IP) and USDA-certified organic soybeans. IP soybeans are sought for traits such as high protein, high isoflavone, or improved flavor or texture in the case of tofu (bean curd) and edamame (vegetable soybean). By volume, soybeans make up the largest segment of organic legumes in the U.S. Production practices and quality requirements of specialty beans differ from those of conventionally-produced roundup-ready beans, thus insect management practices are also likely to differ. The introduction of soybean aphid resulted in an increase in pesticide use on soybeans in the Midwest. Industry recommendations to customers now routinely include tank mixes of insecticides and fungicides for plant health benefits, even in the absence of pest pressure. The recent registration of seed-applied insecticides also encourages growers to use products as insurance treatments rather than basing applications on scouting. The efficacy and economic viability of insurance treatments need to be addressed in a concerted way. To move beyond chemical use, particularly to control bean leaf beetle, soybean aphid, stink bug, and other chronic pests, alternatives are critically needed. These alternatives include both biological control and host plant resistance, preventative tactics which form the foundation of IPM, and which must be integrated with therapeutic tactics such as insecticide use."

Yield losses due to weeds in chickpeas have been estimated at 23-87% (Bhan and Kukula 1987) and up to 100% for lentils (Makowski, 1995). Additional losses include added cost for harvest aid herbicide applications or swathing, and reduced quality (McKay et al. 2002). Because there are no labeled postemergence broadleaf herbicides for chickpea and only metribuzin in lentil, broadleaf weeds severely limit productivity. Thus, preemergence herbicides must be applied at timings which provide effective weed control long enough to reduce or eliminate the impact of weeds on chickpea or lentil yield. This period is referred to as the critical weed-free period. While the critical weed-free period for chickpeas has been studied, the results have been quite variable (see Table). Moreover, most of the work defining the critical weed-free period in chickpeas has been done in Asia and none has been done in North America. There has been much less research on the critical weed-free period for lentils than for chickpeas. Thus, there is a need to determine the critical weed-free period for both chickpeas and lentils in the Pacific Northwest. Knowing the critical weed-free period for chickpeas and lentil is of little value without effective weed control measures. Since tillage and hand weeding options in chickpeas and lentil are limited or not cost effective, there is a need to evaluate herbicides for use in chickpeas and lentil. Most importantly, there is a need to evaluate pre- and postemergence broadleaf herbicides for use in chickpeas and lentil. Once identified, herbicides could be entered into the Interregional 4 project which assists in labeling pesticides for use in minor crops. Previous research to evaluate herbicides in chickpeas and lentil has identified a few potential products. These products need further evaluation for rate, timing, and duration of weed control."

An invasive species, whether it is a plant or animal, is a species that has been introduced to an area to which it is not native and subsequently disrupts the natural balance in that habitat. While there are both plant and animal invasive species in Delaware, many of the hardest to control are weeds. For example, invasive Canada thistle and Johnson grass are two noxious weeds in Delaware according to the USDA's list of noxious weeds. While these are not the only invasive weed species in Delaware they are prime examples and methods of effective control need to be evaluated. Animal grazing is a very effective tool for managing weed and brush growth. Goats, sheep, cattle, and horses have all been previously used to control brush and weeds. In addition, goats have been successfully used for the control of abandoned farmland pastures invaded by herbaceous weeds, vines, multiflora rose bushes and hardwood saplings for years. When goats are used to manage defoliation this has been shown to result in a substantial increase in vegetative cover by favorable grass and legume species while reducing or eliminating unwanted shrub species (Luginbuhl et al., 1995). Concurrently, goats are becoming increasingly important contributors to the income of many producers in Delaware as indicated by a 43% increase in goat numbers from 2002 to 2007 (Delaware Census of Agriculture, 2007). Therefore, due to increasing goat numbers in the state of DE combined with environmental concerns of herbicide use and the inefficacy of other control methods, the proposed study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of goats as a biological control agent for the control of invasive weeds in DE. This project is in collaboration with the Delaware Department of Transportation and hopes to promote a sustainable and environmentally friendly means of invasive weed control to the citizens of Delaware."

Drought-tolerance proteomic signatures: A major challenge to crop productivity in the Northern plains is the consistent availability of water throughout the growing season. It is important to identify parental lines with enhanced tolerance to water stress and them in breeding programs to maintain crop productivity during adverse seasons. It is also important to identify regions of the parental genome (`loci') that contribute to such desired traits. A novel and complementary approach to identification of parents and loci with desired traits is the use of `proteomic signatures'. These signatures can be identified by profiling proteins in parental lines and their progenies with desired traits. The current project aims to develop such proteomic markers for identifying loci contributing to drought tolerance using soybean populations as an example. 2. Novel rhizobium-responsive miRNAs: Sustainable production of food grains demands the use of renewable inputs in agriculture. Nitrogenous fertilizers are an important agricultural input and their increased use has economic and environmental cost to the farmers and the nation. Biological nitrogen fixation occurring in root nodules of legume (bean-family) crops can alleviate the use of chemical fertilizers. Therefore, understanding this process can enable us to develop crop plants with increased fixation and/or utilization of nitrogen. This project is aimed at identifying microRNAs that play a role in nodule development using soybean as a model. microRNAs are regulatory RNAs that govern a number of developmental processes."

D.",,,555456995,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,LINCOLN,NE,68588,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2010,,,"This project contains experiments designed to answer critical questions pertaining to livestock grazing and forage systems on native rangeland, subirrigated meadow, and seeded cool-season perennial grass pasture. These resources are essential to the beef cattle industry. Rangeland and pasture ecological status, productivity, and overall health are governed by dynamic interactions of biotic and abiotic factors. Of these factors, grazing management and water availability are considered the most important factors. Grazing systems are designed to manage botanical composition and production of vegetation for a variety of ecosystem services with livestock production having the greatest economic impact. The importance and potential for other services, such as carbon sequestration, is critical as well. Carbon storage in soils is impacted by plant community vigor, productivity, soil fertility and soil conditions, all factors that are influenced by grazing management. Managers of range and pastureland are evaluating grazing strategies and are very interested in grassland response to these various practices/technologies as they attempt to sustain their economic base. Rotational grazing strategies/methods that are increasingly management intensive and infrastructurally demanding have been promoted as beneficial for the maintenance or enhancement of range condition, herbage production, and livestock gain and production even though experimental evidence does not support such conclusions. Legumes grown in combination with grass pastures have been shown to be very beneficial for increased livestock production through increased forage production and improved quality of forage. Forage legumes can reduce annual nitrogen fertilizer requirements of grass pastures through their ability to fix nitrogen. Despite these known benefits, efforts to develop management practices that assure establishment and persistence of forage legumes in the northern and central Great Plains have largely been unsuccessful, especially under the diverse management systems and environments of this region. As a result, managers in this region have not widely incorporated legumes into pastures. Irrigated cool-season grasses have been successfully used to extend grazing or complement native pastures. In central and western Nebraska, irrigated cool-season grasses are ideally suited for use in extending grazing, and also offer flexibility within livestock operations. However, an issue of significant economic importance has been the report of poor reproductive performance of cows when grazing irrigated pasture. This problem can also occur in subirrigated meadow or other seeded pastures that offer excessively high protein levels at the time of breeding. Development of grazing management strategies that reduce this occurrence is needed. This research addresses agricultural and environmental needs of landowners and livestock producers."

L.",,,555456995,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,LINCOLN,NE,68588,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2010,,,"Pinto beans were selected for this project because studies have shown the presence of several dietary food components linked to anti-inflammatory properties, most notably the phenolics (in the form of flavonoids and phenolics acids. Despite the health promoting potential of pinto beans, direct links of their consumption to anti-inflammatory responses remain limited. The objective of this proposal is to establish a metabolomic platform based on targeted and not-targeted metabolic techniques for characterizing cellular phenotypic switches in macrophages (M1 to M2) in response to pinto beans. As an outcome to this research, it is expected that multiple beneficiaries will be impacted, most notably the producers and distributors of dry edible beans. A significant issue facing the United States dry edible bean industry is the current price of competing field crops, such as corn, and the influx of dry edible beans from international sources. Considering that Nebraska is the No. 3 producers of the pinto bean in the United States, many counties throughout our state have been affected by this decline particularly those in the Panhandle, i.e., an area already adversely affected by decreasing populations and low income growth. As the number of acres of dry edible bean production declines, so too does their economic viability, which, in turn, has disrupted the rest of the economies in this region. Therefore, the rationale for this research is that by characterizing the anti-inflammatory properties of pinto beans based upon their ability to modulate cellular metabolomes towards a healthy phenotype we will be better positioned to provide consistently safe and efficacious food systems derived from dry edible beans. This research thus supports Nebraska and US dry edible bean agriculture by promoting the consumption of pinto beans for improved and sustained human health."

Based on our current knowledge, these changes may require only a few genes. The response of the plants with modified phytoalexins to pathogenic fungi will both test the importance of phytoalexins in disease resistance and help to predict whether engineering the structures of phytoalexins could provide resistance to most of the pathogens of that plant. Importantly, this new form of resistance will be based on naturally occurring plant compounds."

As new faculty have replaced retired faculty, the expectations of graduate student training has changed. All new faculty are expected to hire and train graduate students in each of these disciplines, thus creating a need for more office and laboratory space. In addition to office and laboratory space shortages at TFREC, there are no greenhouse facilities either. A small 30 by 40 foot greenhouse at KREC has been recently dedicated to the faculty needs beyond the dry bean breeding program that had been using all available space.

Recent genetic and molecular studies in higher plants have led to identification of genes affecting the various steps of pollen development. Our knowledge about the mechanisms underlying pollen development and germination control is incomplete, particularly at the biochemical levels. We have recently identified several mutants defective in various steps in pollen development in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These mutants contain defective genes encoding a receptor-like protein kinase, a novel Rhomboid-like protease and various callose synthases. We plan to take advantage of these available genetic materials and molecular probes to investigate how the process of pollen development and pollen germination is regulated at the molecular level. We will take the classic forward genetic approach to isolate new mutants defective in pollen germination control. We will conduct a systematic investigation on physiological factors that may trigger premature pollen germination in closed flowers. We will take biochemistry and molecular biology approach to purify a potent inhibitor of pollen germination from the anther tissue of flowers. A better understanding of pollen germination control and pollen viability would potentially help develop new crop varieties with improved yield and agronomic performance."

Market demand for organic produce has expanded at almost 20 % per year for the last fifteen years. Although adoption of organic farming systems has shown strong growth, obstacles to adoption remain, including high managerial costs and risks associated with changing production systems; limited awareness of production costs and benefits; a perceived lack of markets; and inability to capture economies of scale. Major production barriers include soil fertility, pest management, and livestock health and nutrition. In addition, organic production systems have the potential to be more sustainable, in terms of both energy demand and environmental impacts. Organic systems rely on soil-building practices such as crop rotation, legume cover crops and application of compost rather than synthetic fertilizers. Pest management practices include biological and cultural controls, physical measures and resistant cultivars rather than synthetic pesticides. The major constraints limiting organic growers from maximizing profits and productivity are the costs associated with energy, labor, soil fertility, and pest management, as well as the overall complexity of organic farming systems which rely on application of information-intensive ecological management. Several recent analyses of long-term organic systems trials demonstrate that organic systems can improve soil quality compared to conventional practices, however, multiple years are required to observe statistically significant improvements, and yield responses may be obscured by differences in weed management or other differences in farming systems. While many organic growers insist that livestock production is essential for an organic system, little research is available to test this assumption. Major constraints to organic livestock production include concerns about herd health and the need to provide adequate, low-cost feeds. Preventative approaches to managing diseases and parasites are essential. This project will evaluate long-term impacts of management practices designed to mitigate the major constraints to organic production (soil fertility, energy, labor, and pest management) within a whole farming systems context. This whole farming systems approach is critical to organic agricultural research, because organic farming inherently relies on the ecological feed-backs and interactions to sustain agricultural productivity and minimize adverse environmental impacts. Specifically, we will compare the long-term effects of supplementing soil fertility using legume-intensive cover crops versus compost amendments, in combination with cropping systems with livestock versus systems without livestock. The rate of organic matter accumulation in soils will be correlated with biotic indicators such as crop yields, pest populations, and interactions with beneficial organisms such as earthworms, pest biocontrol agents, and soil microorganisms. Increased complexity from adding livestock enterprises to the farming system will be evaluated against increased efficiency of resource utilization and production of high market-value products."

Since HIV is the best studied lentivirus and information generated from studying HIV can provide useful information about animal lentiviruses such as BIV. One of our goals is to determine if what is observed in HIV can also be observed in animal lentivirus in terms of genetic sequence variations with time, and its correlation with disease progression. Since we have been studying HIV infected individuals and have obtained specimens from these individual longitudinally, we want to determine whether what was observed with HIV in the infected host can be reflected in animal lentivirus infected animals. SIV is most closely related to HIV and we have generated chimeric virus between HIV and SIV, known as SHIV. Through collaboration we have also obtained specimens from macaques infected by SHIV from the same patients, we plan to determine whether similar changes occur in the SHIV in macaques have occurred in HIV in the patient. If successful we can then create similar chimeric viruses with BIV to study genetic variations and disease progression in cattle. Such study will lead to a better understanding of how lentivurses such as BIV and HIV cause disease in infected hosts."

Research will try to improve our understanding of these areas with the expectation that cultural control strategies may be developed to exploit these parts of its life cycle. All stink bugs feed by piercing the pod and seed coat to extract nutrients from the seed. During feeding they open a wound that can be exploited by pathogens. The relationship between stink bugs and soybean diseases is poorly understood, so we will conduct a series of studies to examine the interaction of stink bug and Phomopsis seed decay, one of the more common soybean diseases. The outcome of this research could alter stink bug thresholds or the timing of insecticide or fungicide applications. Bollworm is a major pest of many crops, including soybeans and is known to travel long distances. Proposed research will indirectly try to estimate movement based on trends of larval hosts, pyrethroid resistance, and cropping patterns so we can better predict future problems with this pest.

Since 2005, there has been a 20% loss in the number of farms and 29% loss in number of acres of farmland. Fewer and fewer farmers are producing food, further and further from the regions consumers. And less than 1% of the farmers represent a minority race. In addition, high rates of unemployment continue to plague the area, mostly affecting minorities and people with disabilities. And increasing rates of chronic disease exacerbated by the abundance of urban food deserts speak to the need for healthier food options for all residents. Despite these challenges, the development of new economic development strategies, such as farming, holds much promise in reversing these trends. The increasing number of immigrants and refugees with strong agrarian roots, greater interest by many in locally grown foods, and widely accepted knowledge that urban areas are the food production hubs of the nation provide further testament to the need for small scale farming enterprises. Cleveland, with 3,300 acres of land available and 89% of residents purchasing local foods, is a national innovator in urban land use planning and urban agriculture. Urban garden district zoning, small livestock legislation, grants for urban farmers, and the creation of an agricultural overlay district are just some of its more recent accomplishments that portray a committed community and political will that supports agriculture as a means of transforming the once rust belt into a thriving green belt. The BEAN Project plays a key role in building capacity to create and sustain economically viable small farm enterprises in the Greater Cleveland area through its unique outreach to socially disadvantaged residents (minorities, immigrants, refugees, and limited resource adults with developmental disabilities) and its ability to educate beginning farmers using methods sensitive to ones culture, language and learning style. Innovative models of teaching and learning lay the foundation. Hands-on learning modules, field trips, specialty workshops, educational materials in plain and native languages, mentorship opportunities, and model land lease agreements are some of the key strategies to create an effective learning continuum. This continuum aligns to the projects overall goal to contribute to the local food economy and promote social change by increasing the number of minority and underserved farmers who own and/or operate economically and environmentally sound small farm enterprises. Participants can and will become a part of a communitys social capital and add value to the overall health and well-being of the community. This project also has the potential for long range impacts that can inform a regional food system, enhance the self-sufficiency of traditionally underserved populations, and provide a platform for further replication that expands its scope and reach in a culturally and linguistically congruent manner."

The value of tobacco sold in Kentucky in 2008 was $382 million, down from $784 million in 1999. Interest in alternative crops has risen as tobacco income has fallen. This project is designed to develop and deliver Kentucky farmers the knowledge they need to assess new crop opportunities. Biofuels, sustainable organic production, and novel new crops projects will be conducted by University of Kentucky researchers as part of this project. Kentucky has enormous potential for sustainable biomass-based energy production. A shift toward using abandoned agricultural or nutritionally depleted land for production of non-food crops to produce energy, rather than using corn, is the choice for second-generation biomass industries. Kentucky has one of the highest proportions of arable marginal lands in the U.S., about 20%. Supporting an integrated biofuels and bioproducts industry will enhance revenue and value-added processing income for farmers and foresters. As for organic research, increased acreage in organic production nationwide is aligned with an increase in direct marketing of organic products through Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), farmers markets, etc. Kentucky ranks in the top 10 states with the fastest direct market growth. There has been little systemic study of the economic, environmental and social benefits direct markets are touted to produce. This project will use the model CSA system at the university as a case study for diversified organic vegetable production. This study will be used to create a conceptual model for direct-marketed vegetable systems representative of the scale and types of operations used across the state. The results could have a significant positive impact on grower acceptance of organic agriculture. Meanwhile, potential new crops for Kentucky include edamame, hops, and stevia. Previous research focused on growing edamame as a stand-alone crop; it has greater potential when incorporated into a production system such as minimum tillage. Hops offer potential for marketing to microbreweries, and also for value-added products; however, no research on hops has been done as yet in Kentucky, so there is a need to develop a production system. Although currently a niche market, the potential for expansion is great with stevia, an herbaceous annual with high leaf concentrations of sugars. Overall, the New Crop Opportunities Center will feature a Web site for 24-hour access to new crop information. Staff will answer questions from Extension agents and farmers, and will distribute new crop information at field days and meetings. The Center will facilitate packaging of information from its research and other sources for dissemination. Expected outcomes/impacts will be an increase in knowledge among farmers and Extension agents about production and marketing systems for new crops. This should allow farmers to make informed decisions about which crops to try, and how to market them. Anticipated benefits include greater profitability for Kentucky farmers."

Organic farmgate sales for 2008 were estimated at $280 million in Washington State, with forage, processed vegetables, and tree fruit the main crops. The state is the leading national producer of organic apples, pears, cherries, sweet corn, green peas, snap beans, and onions. Acres of organic apples have nearly doubled since 2005 and represent 10% of all apple acres in the state. Continued growth of the sector occurred in 2009, but at a slower rate due to the recession. Organic farming offers growers a form of production and market diversification and the potential for increased returns, all of which are needed in light of current economic conditions. In addition, organic systems generally lead to improved environmental performance (Reganold et al., 2001) and farm worker safety, thus lessening the need for the public sector to bear these costs. Conventional growers also benefit from the development of organic practices because they are increasingly adopting these practices to deal with pesticide resistance and regulatory constraints and because adoption of these methods may lead to reduced costs, improved biological performance, and enhanced environmental protection (A. McErlich, pers. comm.). This special grant project will enable Washington State University to continue to address the priorities listed above and assist organic growers to improve their profitability, agronomic performance, and environmental stewardship. This will provide economic benefits to growers and their rural communities, fulfill consumer demand for organic products that bring environmental benefits to the farm and watershed, and develop techniques that conventional farmers can use to meet the regulatory challenges of the federal Food Quality Protection Act and other public environmental initiatives. The region&#8223;s climatic diversity provides biophysical characteristics that favor organic production, especially in the semi-arid zones where there is high quality irrigation water. Additionally, the region has a high level of consumer awareness and demand for organic products as well as support for organic and sustainable production systems, especially in the urbanized maritime region. This special grant will help the agricultural sector to capitalize on these advantages."

The  Cool Season Food Legume  pulse crops are those that  fix  or generate their own useable nitrogen. Peas, lentils, and chickpeas, all high in protein and rich in vitamins and minerals, let producers replenish nitrogen in the soil, change disease cycles, and help control grass weeds. Suited best to cool growing conditions in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Plains, these specialty crops offer producers alternative markets, environmentally friendly practices, and more sustainable farming. Five key research focus areas of the CSFLRP include breeding/genetics/germplasm, plant protection, crop management, human and animal nutrition, and technology transfer. New knowledge in these areas of study are of paramount importance in reducing production input factors for these cropping systems and in meeting consumer demand on a local, state, regional, national, and international basis. This grant is administered by the University of Idaho in Moscow, in the heart of the Pacific Northwest's pulse growing region. The overarching objectives of the three-year CSFLRP are: 1) To establish research and extension priorities for the Cool Season Food Legume Research Program (CSFLRP) to improve the efficiency and sustainability of cool season food legume production. 2) To develop cooperative multi-disciplinary research to enhance cool season food legume production between Land Grant universities, United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) and the private sector in high priority areas affecting the cool season food legume industry. 3) Manage the Cool Season Food Legume Research Program following an efficient and effective organizational structure."

These techniques will ultimately be incorporated into potato production systems. Outreach and education targeted specifically at biologically based IPM and ecosystem production methods are essential to promote adoption by growers. In Wisconsin we have developed the foundation for biointensive IPM education. We are now proposing to continue the educational efforts which will enable growers to integrate biointensive IPM strategies into existing production systems. The overall momentum of the Collaboration has been extremely strong with many accomplishments such as the continuation of the marketing effort, enhancements of the Collaboration standards, improvements of resistance management protocols, database implementation, grant coordination and expansion of the development and use of educational tools for growers. We have worked with numerous faculty, industry representatives, potato and other commodity organizations, and environmental organizations to export this agricultural model for targeted and industry-wide change. In Wisconsin, this work is expanding to other vegetable crops, such as carrots, peppers, beans and peas, and is now also expanding to fruit crops. Furthermore, we have enhanced the ecological portions of the Collaboration by working with national and local environmental organizations and expanding our research with University of Wisconsin faculty by involving their expertise, research and education into the project. We need to maintain this strength while exporting the model of industry-wide agricultural changes through the use of policy and communication efforts. The success of the adoption of biointensive IPM programs by growers will be measured utilizing the measurement system previously developed by the Collaboration. At the conclusion of this project we expect to have completed detailed performance evaluations for a range of reduced-risk pest management alternatives. We will use this information in the educational activities and materials to provide growers with detailed efficacy and economic analysis of various alternatives which can be used by individual growers to refine their pest management practices to more biologically based, less toxic practices. The marketplace rewards which have been generated through the eco-labeling project in Wisconsin have also created a favorable climate for our biointensive IPM strategies to be adopted throughout the region. We are confident that growers see the potential for value-added marketing as a mechanism to offset declining commodity returns in traditional markets. The WWF/WPVGA/UW Collaboration will continue its outreach, stakeholder participation, and national policy efforts to increase dialogue on using market-based incentives to advance growers' use of biointensive IPM and reduce reliance on high-risk pesticides."

It can infect cucumber, melon, squash, pumpkin, tomato, pepper, eggplant, lima, snap and wax bean crops, and has recently been found to infect Fraser fir, a Christmas tree crop. Michigan is the number 1 producer of pickling cucumber and squash and ranks among the top 10 in the USA for the production of fresh market cucumber, snap bean, bell pepper, pumpkin and fresh market and processing tomato. Michigan cultivates 79,210 acres of Phytophthora-susceptible vegetables worth $163 million and 7,600 acres of Fraser fir worth $10.6 million. Phytophthora can be easily spread across and within agricultural regions via water. Phytophthora management is complicated by its large host range and lack of known disease resistance in vegetables. Phytophthora can last for 10 or more years in soil and it is common for growers to experience complete crop loss in some fields. Some strains of Phytophthora have mutated to become resistant to key fungicides and have colonized an estimated 25% of the acreage in the Michigan growing region. Disease outbreaks occur yearly and recent losses have become so large (up to $32.5 million) that the economic viability of these Michigan industries is at risk. This project seeks to reduce losses suffered by Michigan growers and stakeholders by developing integrated management strategies that emphasize cultural methods and environmentally friendly practices. Research will include investigating ways to limit the spread of Phytophthora; identifying and developing cultivars that are resistant to Phytophthora disease; investigating soil amendments, mulches, crop rotation and water management as new techniques for managing Phytophthora; and testing fungicides, biological control agents and new chemistries for disease control. Phytophthora management recommendations for growers will be developed from research results and demonstrated in on-farm trials and presented at extension meetings."

Recent losses have become so large that the economic viability of the vegetable industries in many states is at risk. Therefore, the Phytophthora/Capsicum interaction is an excellent approach and crop model to understanding durable host resistance.

Objective 2: Determine the effect of bollworm ecology (corn earworm) on resistance to pyrethroid insecticides by developing and utilizing genetic markers linked to resistance traits, stable carbon isotope analysis, gossypol detection in adult insects, and insecticide resistance monitoring. Objective 3: Develop pest control strategies for the U.S. Mid-South?s Early Soybean Production System by determining accurate treatment thresholds, understanding the impact of changing cropping systems on farm-scale pest ecology, and developing effective insecticide resistance management practices for the stink bug complex, three-cornered alfalfa hopper, bean leaf beetle and soybean looper. Objective 4: Improve low input systems of pest control for sweet potato by evaluating the efficacy and proper use of newly registered insecticides to enhance their integration with crop rotation and other low cost control strategies.Approach:   We plan to improve tarnished plant bug control and insecticide resistance management by gaining new information on the pest?s ecology and biology using multi-disciplinary approaches. Analytical techniques, such as stable carbon isotope analysis, will be used to determine the influence of C4 host plants, such as field corn or pigweed, on populations of tarnished plant bug adults infesting cotton fields. This information will identify sources of tarnished plant bugs that may lead to alternative control measures prior to infestations into cotton fields. Tarnished plant bug populations will be monitored for resistance to various classes of insecticides commonly used by mid-South producers. This will provide real-time information to decision makers that will allow them to adjust their control recommendations based on the type of resistance that is found in their area of the mid-South. Detoxification enzyme activity surveys will be conducted in an effort to correlate and quantify insecticide resistance levels in field populations of the tarnished plant bug. Molecular genetics techniques will be conducted on tarnished plant bug populations that could lead to assays to evaluate the extent of field resistance in tarnished plant bug populations and provide input for insect management decisions. We also plan to determine the effect of bollworm ecology (corn earworm) on resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. Analytical techniques, such as stable carbon isotope analysis and a gossypol detection technique, will be used to determine the impact of bollworm larval plant host on pyrethroid resistance levels measured in adults collected from pheromone traps. Molecular genetics tools will be used to identify candidate genes and biological pathways associated with insecticide resistance in bollworm populations. Successful identification of loci associated with insecticide resistance and the development of genetic markers for those will provide a method to obtain quantitative estimates of field evolved resistance by estimating the allele frequencies via population studies. We will also develop pest control strategies for the U.S. Mid-South?s Early Soybean Production System by determining accurate treatment thresholds and developing effective insecticide resistance management practices for the stink bug complex and bollworm. Field studies will be conducted to evaluate treatment thresholds for stink bugs and bollworms in early season soybeans. Stink bug populations will be monitored for potential resistance to various classes of insecticides, and this effort will provide real-time information to decision makers regarding the proper use of insecticides for control of these pests. We also plan to improve low input systems of pest control for sweet potato by evaluating the efficacy and proper use of newly registered insecticides to enhance their integration with crop rotation and other low cost control strategies.

The PCEM is designed to utilize the properties of a photoniccrystal (PC) biosensor surface that is designed to produce narrow bandwidth optical resonancesfor two distinct purposes. First, the resonant coupling condition of the PC is modified by cellattachment, and the PCEM is capable of producing images of the spatial distribution of cellattachment with sufficient resolution to quantify variations in the strength of attachment withinindividual cells. Second, the PC surface enables efficient coupling to laser illumination, resultingin the ability to enhance the output of fluorescent molecules in close proximity to the PC by twoorders of magnitude, using a technique called  PC Enhanced Fluorescence.  The PCEM will bean enabling tool for a broad range of life science research and pharmaceutical screeningapplications that require characterization of the interaction between extracellular matrixmaterials and cell membrane-expressed proteins in response to cell growth, pro-apoptoticstimuli, forced differentiation protocols, chemotaxis, ion channel activation, transmembraneprotein activation, and proliferation. PCEM offers the ability to perform assays with a limitednumber of available cells for applications involving primary cells or stem cells. The proposedsystem builds upon the successful implementation and demonstration of the first PCEM system,which was designed and built for applications involving DNA microarrays and proteinmicroarrays. The proposed instrument incorporates objective-coupled illumination from aboveand below the PC for simultaneous label-free imaging, bright field imaging, and enhancedfluorescence imaging with optics designed to optimize the sensitivity and resolution of eachmodality when the PC surface is immersed in cell media. The system also incorporates a CO2environmental chamber to facilitate continuous monitoring of cells for extended periods of time.Broader ImpactsBiologists are developing a more sophisticated understanding of how cell membraneinteractions with surfaces, chemical stimuli, and other cells are modulated, and the role ofintegrins, ion channels, G-coupled transmembrane proteins, and filapodia in fundamentalprocesses such as migration, wound healing, differentiation, and apoptosis. Yet, there are fewtools currently available that allow visualization and quantification of these processes. While theinitial set of demonstrated applications for PCEM will include cancer cell cytotoxicity, T-cellinduced apoptosis, stem cell differentiation, and cardiac cell stimulation, the system'scapabilities extend to any cell type and any process that can be carried out upon a surface. Theenvironment at Illinois, in which the PI is an investigator within the NSF-sponsored Center forCellular Mechanics (CCMB) IGERT, and the NIH-sponsored Cancer Nanotechnology traininggrant, and the location of the system within the Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory'sBioNanotechnology Laboratory assures that the system will be included in multidisciplinarytraining programs. Users of the system will be comprised of faculty, graduate students, andundergraduate students from Engineering, Pharmacology, Animal Sciences, Microbiology, andImmunology. The project will develop general-purpose methods for studying cell-surfaceinteractions that can be used broadly in pharmaceutical screening and life science research -extending the applicability of photonic crystal biosensors. The PI has a successful track recordof biosensor instrumentation invention, development, and commercialization.The proposal also describes an education plan that is closely linked with the program'stechnical goals with impact upon graduate student research, undergraduate research,undergraduate classroom/laboratory learning, and teaching biosensing/photonics concepts to aUniversity-based all-girls middle school. The PI has a strong track record for involvingundergraduate students in his research, and for making the technology developed under NSFfunding available in his ECE416  Biosensors  course, both in the form of lecture topics andhands-on laboratory experience."

This unexpected observation could be explained if the Universe is pervaded by dark energy, which could be in the form of a cosmological constant.  Although particle theories, including string theory, can accommodate a cosmological constant, they generally require a much larger value than is compatible with the nature of the Universe revealed by cosmological observations.  As a result, the ultimate cause of the acceleration of the Universe remains obscure, and other theoretical possibilities exist. The research of Wasserman, Flanagan, and Bean will examine these important issues in various different studies.  One study will examine how accurately it can be established that the dark energy is indeed a cosmological constant.  The PI's will also investigate phenomenological implications of higher dimensions for the expansion of the Universe.This research will also have broader impacts, primarily via the training of Cornell Ph.D. students. The proposed research is multidisciplinary in nature, and will further develop already-existing ties between the particle physics, string theory and relativity groups at Cornell. In addition to disseminating their work via conventional academic channels (journal publications, seminars, conferences), the three investigators are deeply involved in programs aimed at communicating the latest scientific results to the general public."

The ABI 3500xL DNA Analyzer is a fully automated capillary electrophoresis system with a capacity of sequencing up to 400,000 base pairs per day. The requested equipment will be used by at least eight faculty members in biology, biotechnology and environmental science for their research activities as well as for research training of undergraduate and graduate students. The DNA Analyzer will be utilized to detect pesticide resistance-associated gene mutations in Rhipicephalus microplus, to study essential amino acid biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula, to study molecular mechanisms of environmental stress in soft corals, to study molecular mechanisms involved in the maintenance of zinc homeostasis in plants, to study microbial populations in Galveston Bay, and to study regulation of human inducible nitric oxide synthase.  Acquisition of the high-throughput DNA Analyzer will enhance faculty research and advance student learning by enriching courses in genomics and through integration of hands-on exposure for independent research projects using modern instrumentation. Faculty and student researchers will use the equipment to address important problems in the areas of biology, biotechnology and environmental science. For example, the DNA Analyzer will be used to determine the genes responsible for pesticide resistance in the Texas cattle tick, which has led to major loss to the cattle industry. The Analyzer will be used to address problems related to human welfare, such as the role of nitric oxide in the human body, and how to improve the nutritional quality of plant foods, such as legumes, to address the worldwide problem of malnutrition from plant-based diets. The Analyzer will also be used to determine the effects of environmental stress on soft corals, to characterize the microbial community of Galveston Bay, and in other projects important to the environment. This equipment will greatly enhance the generation of research publications and grant proposals from UHCL and enhance ongoing collaborations with regional and national organizations such as the USDA Children?s Nutrition Research Center, USDA-ARS-Livestock Insect Research Laboratory, Nalco Chemical company, and Baylor College of Medicine. Acquisition of this equipment will address both local and national needs for well-trained B.S. and M.S graduates with research skills in biology, biotechnology and environmental science.  At least 50 B.S. and M.S. students per year will use the instrument in independent studies and thesis research and another 30 students in formal training courses. A high percentage of these students will be from groups underrepresented in science.

NMR is a powerful tool for the chemical characterization of the thousands of diverse metabolites found in all living organisms.  Identifying and chemically characterizing metabolites is a fundamental step in understanding their biological, physiological, and ecological roles.  The NMR instrument will be combined with existing ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to parallel mass spectrometry detection and solid phase extraction (UPLC-MS-SPE) which will enable semi-automated metabolite purification and concentration prior to NMR analysis.  Access to this instrument will enable and greatly enhance productive, cutting-edge, and emerging plant programs centralized in southeastern Oklahoma.  The requested instrumentation will be located and supported by the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, a nonprofit research institute whose mission focuses upon the enhancement of humanity through advancements in agriculture. A significant proportion of the group?s metabolomics prior efforts focused on mass spectrometry based approaches and integrated functional genomics of the model legume Medicago truncatula. However, the scope of current and future studies have substantially expanded to include other plant species such as Arabidopsis thaliana (MCB 0520140 Arabidopsis 2010: MCB 0520283 Arabidopsis 2010), alfalfa, tomato, tobacco, hops, cotton, horse/hedge apple, switchgrass biofuels, fescue and related alkaloid producing plant fungal endophytes, and devastating fungal plant pathogens such as cotton root rot.  As the diversity of the group?s programs and staff expands, so does the number of unique metabolites.  Currently, it is estimated that there are over 200,000 metabolites throughout the plant kingdom, and over half of these still remain unidentified.  Accordingly, the participating groups have identified a critical and urgent need for the acquisition and incorporation of NMR technology into their metabolomics and plant biochemistry technology base to advance their ability to systematically identify, structurally characterize, and comparatively profile plant metabolites.  Many of the currently funded studies are focused on high anatomically resolved experiments and limited quantities of spatially distinct plant organs and cell types (i.e. pollen, trichomes, border cells).  As a result, biological materials and corresponding metabolites are of very low abundance.  Thus, a NMR equipped with a cryoflowprobe and coupled to on-line mass directed solid-phase extraction provides critical sensitivity enhancements that are absolutely necessary for obtaining structural data for minute quantities of metabolites in a semi-automated mode to enhance throughput.  The NMR instrumentation  will advance the understanding of fundamental plant metabolism and biochemistry through the identification of important novel metabolites in key model and crop species.  It will also increase the biological context of our metabolomics programs through increased annotation and depth-of-coverage which will proportionately enhance gene discoveries, functional annotation of genes, and more efficient metabolic engineering of beneficial plant traits. The enabling instrumental resource will be used to recruit one new permanent staff member.  Long term support for this instrument and staff will be provided by the Noble Foundation.  Funding will also enhance the recruitment of future faculty, retention of current faculty, the international competitiveness and leadership of the participants in plant biochemistry and metabolomics, and used to leverage future state and federal research funding for plant biochemistry and agriculture.  The proposed instrumentation will be eagerly incorporated into the existing and productive educational and training programs at all the participating institutes which serve a large number of diverse postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.  These specifically include: multiple hands-on, in-depth, week-long instrumental training courses of national recognition such as our metabolomics and proteomics user training programs; undergraduate instrumental analyses courses; high school Science Carnivals; an instrumental  Nut & Volt  interest group; the prestigious Noble Scholars Intern Program; and high school cooperative programs with the Southern Oklahoma Technology Center, Ardmore High School AP Chemistry, Ardmore High School Science Club, and Oklahoma Upward Bound."

However, only certain microbial species are capable of converting ( fixing ) elemental nitrogen into a biologically useable form; multicellular organisms can only utilize nitrogen that is already fixed. Legumes are able to obtain nitrogen by forming an intimate symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia. Because of this unique ability to acquire nitrogen symbiotically, legumes play a critical role in agriculture and in natural environments.The interaction between legumes and rhizobia is by far the best characterized model for studying symbiosis. It is also a highly complex system: the bacteria enter the host, differentiate inside the host cell, fix nitrogen, and exchange the reduced nitrogen for photosynthate provided by the host. The host provides a specialized host root organ, the nodule, in which physiological conditions are accurately controlled. Nodule formation, development, and function depend on a suite of cellular programs which are triggered by highly specific molecular dialogs between the two partners. Recent years have seen major advances in our understanding of the initial recognition between legumes and rhizobia. On the other hand, the genetic components and biochemical mechanisms further downstream remains to be elucidated.  This EaGER project will address this need and develop a novel genetic screen to identify legume genes required for host-bacterial signaling during the intermediate and late stages of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.  If successful, this project may provide technical approaches for researchers in all legume symbiosis systems. Contributing to the field of host-microbe interactions, this body of information will be published and materials will be made available to interested groups from the scientific community. The project will provide research training for postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate students. In addition, the project will provide research opportunities to undergraduates and local high school students."

The intellectual merit of this project is that more safe and effective dispersants are needed to help mitigate the impacts of oil spill disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon incident. The PIs have effectively used funds from the NSF RAPID program to identify a class of dispersants that are macromolecular aggregates of natural cellulose polymers and soy bean lecithin. A clear case is made that these compounds do not allow oil to foul bird feathers, and it is presumed that since they are natural in origin, they would be a safer alternative to the current petrochemically derived dispersants. The PIs have a strong record of expertise in this area, and are uniquely suited to this work. They clearly outline a detailed list of scientific and business-related questions that must be answered to push this product to the marketplace. The broader impact of discovering more effective and non-toxic oil dispersants is clear. The PIs have a strong record of incorporating others into their work, such as the local junior college students and instructors, some of whom are included as inventors of the disclosed technologies.

BéninSweet potato is among the most important food crops in the world and an extremely important food crop for subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is grown throughout the African continent and currently around 34.5% of global sweet potato area is in Africa. One major limitation in sweet potato production is cultivar decline, mostly due to the cumulative effect of virus infection on this vegetatively propagated crop. Thus, viral diseases are considered a major limiting factor in sweet potato production worldwide, and particularly in SSA. The objective of this project is to evaluate a novel approach, deep sequencing of small RNAs from field-grown sweet potato samples collected throughout Africa, to systematically and efficiently identify known and novel virus genome sequences. A total of around 1750 geo-referenced field-grown samples of sweet potato will be collected from more than ten countries in Africa. Small RNA populations of these samples will be prepared and sequenced using high throughput next-generation sequencing technology, and then assembled to identify known and novel sweet potatoviruses.Broader Impacts: Food security remains a huge challenge for millions of Africans, particularly for those in sub-Saharan regions, who depend on agriculture for their subsistence. Emerging and reemerging pathogens, including many viruses, continue to cause devastating losses of food production in Africa. Current knowledge of crop viruses in Africa is limited and sporadic at best. Novel virus genome identification technology through deep sequencing of small RNA population is potentially applicable to continental surveys as its efficiency in virus identification has been proven with both greenhouse and field grown samples. This technology can then be applied to systematically determine the total virus genome sequences (virome) on a number of other major crop plants in Africa such as maize, rice, tomato, bean, and cassava. Public availability of such information will provide the scientific community and government unprecedented possibilities to understand crop virus distribution in Africa, guide phytosanitary requirements, predict risks of future epidemics, and suggest regional disease management strategies. Data generated under this project will be disseminated through the project website (accessible via http://bti.cornell.edu/ZhangjunFei.php) and raw and processed small RNA sequences will also be available through EBI Sequence Read Archive and NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, respectively. Novel virus genome sequences will be deposited into GenBank."

Considering its economic and ecological impact, it is surprisingly understudied. This project will integrate the efforts of citizen scientists, graduate and undergraduate students, and collaborating scientists from four Asian countries to examine the evolutionary history, taxonomy, and genetic diversity of the genus Pueraria in an effort to understand invasiveness in the kudzu species complex and determine how Pueraria species relate to other legumes, including several of economic importance such as soybean (Glycine max) and jicama (Pachyrhizus erosus). Extensive fieldwork will be integrated with genetic and geographic analyses to determine how many introductions of kudzu have taken place in the U.S., from what genetic source(s), and how genetic diversity and interplay within and among Pueraria species and populations have influenced range expansion.  This work will integrate education and research to provide educational opportunities for K-12, post-secondary students and the public through programs connected with Earth Day Activities, A Time for Science Nature Center, citizen science, and an innovative ecotourism venture within Great Smoky Mountain National Park.

This process represents a major pathway for conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into reduced ammonia, which is a biologically usable form of nitrogen.  The symbiosis is established by the infection of legume roots by rhizobia soil bacteria, resulting in the formation of the nitrogen-fixing organ, the root nodule.  Rhizobia bacteria are enclosed within a specialized plant organellar compartment, the symbiosome.  The symbiosome membrane mediates the exchange of metabolites between the bacterial symbiont and plant host, and is critical for a successful symbiosis.  NIPs belong to an ancient family of channel proteins that mediate the flow of water and metabolites across cellular membranes.  Nodulin 26 (Nod26) is a NIP that constitutes the major protein component of the symbiosome membrane and has two important roles in nitrogen-fixing symbioses.  First, as a rapid transporter of ammonia, Nod26 is proposed to facilitate the release of this fixation end product from the symbiosome.  Further, Nod26 forms interaction complexes with glutamine synthetase which is a critical nitrogen assimilation enzyme.  This interaction is postulated to prevent accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia gas by allowing its rapid incorporation into the nontoxic amino acid glutamine.   In a secondary role, Nod26 facilitates the bulk movement of water across the symbiosome membrane and is proposed to be part of an osmoregulatory network that controls the diffusion of oxygen gas within nodule tissues.  This provides a finely tuned regulation of nitrogen fixation rates in response to metabolic need and environmental stresses.  The aim of this project is to investigate the multifunctional symbiotic role of Nod26 in soybean and a model legume, Medicago truncatula.    The specific objectives are: 1. To define the structural basis for water vs. ammonia transport of Nod26 and its interaction with glutamine synthetase; 2. Investigate mechanisms that regulate Nod26 selectivity for water and ammonia, and its overall transport behavior in response to environmental cues (e.g., soil drought and water logging) that affect nodule gas diffusion and fixation rates; and 3. Address the impact of Nod26 on the establishment and maintenance of the rhizobia-legume symbiosis by using the molecular genetics tools available in Medicago.  This project should contribute fundamental insights into the molecular basis of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume/rhizobia associations as well as its regulation.   In addition, since Nod 26 is the structural archetype of the NIP transporter family, the project will shed light on the molecular basis for differences in transport selectivity and biological functions of NIPs in other plant membrane systems.    Broader significance and importance This project will serve as a training vehicle for multiple graduate students and undergraduate student research scholars, as well as a postdoctoral associate, in fundamental aspects of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.  In addition, this project will provide support and promote the following STEM initiatives at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK):  1. The P.I's involvement as scientific director of the Tennessee Junior Science and Humanities Symposium (TJSHS), which is a state-wide program designed to foster basic science research by high school students.   The TJSHS is held annually and involves a three day symposium during which the very best high school students from throughout the state of Tennessee are convened and are given an opportunity to present their research.  2.

At the core of theprotocol is the ability to solve a set of hard computationalquestions, which are the focus of the research plan. The computationalchallenges require the study of novel combinatorial optimizationproblems, the development of innovative time- and space-efficientalgorithms, and ultimately the implementation and deployment ofuser-friendly web-based software tools.  The new combinatorialsequencing protocol is going to be tested to the cowpea genome. CowpeaVigna unguiculata, also known as China bean or black-eyed pea,is one of the most important food legume crops in the semi-aridtropics covering Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. Adrought-tolerant and warm-weather crop, cowpeas are well-adapted tothe drier regions of the tropics, where other food legumes do notperform well.  Its modest genome size makes it an excellent candidateto demonstrate the utility of our protocol. We expect the finalassembly to provide a sufficient depth of knowledge to support mostdownstream applications including map-based cloning of traitdeterminants, development of markers for marker-assisted breeding,microarray development for gene expression studies and analysis ofsynteny with related species.This project will advance sequencing techniques for complex genomes,using cowpea, an essential food source in developingcountries. Software tools and the assembled data will be placed intothe public domain, which will benefit researchers and the publicworldwide, and potentially lead to new international and industrialcollaborations. This project will directly support one graduatestudents in a highly interdisciplinary environment, building on UCR'sstrengths in Computer Science and AgriculturalSciences. Undergraduates will have opportunities to participate inresearch through a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) siteat UCR, a collaboration with a nearby community college, and a new USDepartment of Education Title V Hispanic Serving Institution grant(UCR is an accredited HSI).More details and information about this project will be available athttp://www.cs.ucr.edu/~stelo/dbi.htm"

Rhizobia are soil bacteria that are known to greatly benefit plants in the legume family by providing them with nitrogen-rich nutrients. Rhizobia are of great agricultural importance, since they dramatically reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers on legume crops such as soybean and alfalfa. This project investgates naturally occurring strains of rhizobia that behave like pathogens on some legume species, and like beneficial symbionts on others. This variation in outcome is dictated by a limited set of genes that have been detected but not fully sequenced. These genes define an important but mysterious biological process that determines whether rhizobia will harm or help the plants that harbor them. The investigators are using molecular-level analysis to define the precise biochemical process that is governed by these genes. The research goals are integrated with an educational plan that will allow undergraduate and high school students to participate in the discovery of more of these outcome-determining genes, through a combination of outdoor collection activities and laboratory-based molecular analysis of bacterial isolates. The project will support the training of high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students and will inform directly the development of more effective strategies for using rhizobia to enhance crop productivity. At a more fundamental level, it will result in a clearer understanding of how closely related bacteria may have radically different effects on the plants or animals in which they reside."

Pea aphids, for example, harbor maternally transmitted symbionts that defend them against parasitic wasps, which are used as biological control agents against these crop pests. When assessing variation in resistance to the wasp Aphidius ervi, it appears that inherited differences are driven by the presence of bacterial Hamiltonella defensa symbionts and the types of toxin-encoding bacteriophages (viruses) they harbor.

Predictions of reduced symbiont frequencies in response to high temperatures and infrequent parasitism will be tested through extensive field-based and molecular studies that quantify temperature and both symbiont and parasite prevalence over space and time. Similar approaches will be used to test the benefits of symbionts under natural conditions.  Additionally, the investigators will elucidate the mechanisms of defense, focusing on the bacteriophage toxins that are expected to drive variation in resistance.

The business was the salon Haircut 101. Phase I research was designed to show proof-of-concept. In Phase I our objective was to demonstrate that a biological treatment system, or &ldquo;living system&rdquo;, would be able to lower the concentration of contaminates in salon graywater coming from the sinks where hair treatments and shampooing occur. In addition we wanted to start the process of designing the actual prototype system that would be installed in Haircut 101. To this end we had the following objectives:Determine and cultivate appropriate plants for a living system.Collect and determine the chemical composition and quantity of salon graywater.Perform batch tests on plants using salon wastewater samples to determine removal efficiency and effects on plants.Prepare, operate and determine removal efficiency of pilot-scale living system.Design prototype systems for installation in the actual salon business site.Education and outreach about biological on-site graywater treatment systems.Research was conducted to ascertain the type of plants best suited for a &ldquo;living system&rdquo;. Plants where purchased and grown in a hydroponic system within one of the University greenhouses. Our research utilized an existing &ldquo;living system&rdquo; constructed at the University&rsquo;s biodiesel processing laboratory in a small greenhouse. The greenhouse was built with previous funding from the EPA P3 grant program to biologically treat wastewater from a biodiesel production facility. Due to upgrades at the facility, however, the system was available for research purposes. This system was ideal for the proposed research and testing purposes, offering a very efficient startup.The tanks and ponds of the &ldquo;living system&rdquo; were cleaned out entirely in August 2011, and new plants and plumbing was installed. Wastewater collected from the salon in Objective 2 was the influent wastewater for the living system. The pilot-scale living system had the following configuration: 1) Salon wastewater was collected in a 350 gallon settling tank as it passed through a low maintenance filter to collect hair and larger solids. 2) Gravity flow then fed water from the settling tank through a fine screen into an open aerobic tank. This 120-gallon tank was filled with Lemna, commonly known as duckweed, which helped to encourage catabolic degradation of organic compounds and surfactant removal from the salon wastewater. 3)The water then flowed by gravity into a secondary open aerobic tank occupied by Pontederia cordata. 4) After leaving this tank water flowed by gravity into the first wetland cell which contained a diverse ecosystem of Juncus effuses, Typhaangustifolia, Loliummulti florum, and Medacago sativa. Water flowed vertically into the top of the wetland via distribution piping and simultaneously flowed horizontally via gravity as it filtered its way through a pea gravel substrate with this mixture of species. 5) Finally water flowed into the final open pond filled with floating aquatic plants including Pistia stratiotes (water hyacinth) and Eichhornia crassipes (water lettuce).In addition to testing the removal efficiency of the overall system, individual plants were batch tested to determine their ability to reduce concentrations of contaminants in salon graywater. Plant health during these tests was monitored using qualitative criteria (e.g. color, size and robustness) and fluorescence measurements. Concentrations of co"

This proposal is in direct response to thatneed and will support a State laboratory's full participation within the FERN ChemistryCooperative Agreement Program (cCAP). This participation includes instrumentation, training,method enhancement activities and analysis of surveillance samples. The Department ofAnalytical Chemistry at The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) has a 115year history of food safety research and over the last five years as a cCAP laboratory, hasdemonstrated the expertise and analytical capacity required to meet FERN goals. The currentproposal is divided into four distinct project areas, all of which are inherently flexible dependingon Forensic Chemistry Center (FCC) and FERN National Program Office (NPO) input: (1) The use of Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) for the analysis ofunknown compounds in foods. We have used GC-MS to detect melamine in food productsfrom China and pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables. We have enhanced the FDA FERNT021 methodology by developing the use of a Programmed Temperature Vaporizing (PTV) inletfor the GC-MS. In this proposal we look to continue our advances with this methodology bylooking at new toxins and poisons, by expanding to new matrices such as alcohol and seafood,and to explore the potential use of Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) with GC-MS. (2) The use of Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) for the analysis ofunknown compounds in foods. We have used LC-MS to analyze toxins in surveillancesamples and pesticide residues in produce, as well as honey bee related matrixes. We haveadded new toxins to the FDA FERN T022 method and evaluated many matrixes. We proposethe use of new chromatography columns to expand the capabilities of the FERN methodologyand also to expand to additional matrices such as alcohol and seafood. (3) The use of Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for theidentification of toxic metals in foods. Our elemental experience has ranged from thedetermination of lead in maple syrup to cadmium in fish tissue to nanoparticles in vegetables.We have used the FERN methods for the analysis of food surveillance samples. We propose tofurther enhance methodology by optimizing the High Matrix Introduction accessory for the ICP -MS. We also propose to use LC prior to elemental analysis instrumentation so as to speciatemetals and separately analyze multiple oxidative states. (4) The use of Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the identification oftoxins in foods. We have used ELISA methods for surveillance samples, proficiency tests, andto determine peanut allergens in foods. We evaluated Tetracore Ricin kits and are developingtechniques for Abrin analysis. We propose to use ELISA kits and lateral flow devices (LFDs)for matrixes specified by FDA as well as studies on the rosary pea, the source of Abrin. The explicit goal of this opportunity is to enable the analysis of food in the event thatredundancy and surge capacity is need by FERN. The CAES Department of AnalyticalChemistry has demonstrated the expertise, capability, and adaptability to fully meet and exceedthese program needs."

It is the 4th most important oilseed crop in the world, ranked by production, exceeded only by soybean, rapeseed, and cottonseed. The US accounts for approximately 6% of world production and is a major exporter. Peanut has the unusual reproductive habit of above ground flowering and below ground fruiting. Its subterranean reproductive strategy poses additional plant health problems not encountered by most seed crops. Of particular concern is invasion of underground pods by fungi that can produce highly carcinogenic aflatoxin. Aflatoxin biosynthesis is induced when the host tissues attain a permissive physiological state under drought stress and elevated temperatures, conditions almost certain to be increasingly encountered in this era of climate change. We hypothesize that molecular indicators of host plant stress response are correlated with induction of aflatoxin biosynthesis and that genotypic variation for aflatoxin contamination is associated with variation in stress response. The objectives of this study are to use physiological and gene expression tools to determine the pre-harvest stress threshold at which aflatoxin biosynthesis is induced in developing peanut seeds and to map quantitative trait loci for indicators of this stress response. Advancing phenotyping protocols and associating phenotypes with nucleotide sequences will have an immediate impact on conventional breeding for preharvest aflatoxin contamination resistance that will eventually translate to improved farm efficiency, sustainability, profitability, and food quality."

While Wolbachia is normally associated with various reproductive manipulations that allow this symbiont to invade and persist in host populations, recent evidence indicates this symbiont can also invade by conferring protection to the host from pathogenic microbes. We have discovered that Hawaiian populations of Pentalonia aphids are infected at high rates by Wolbachia. Since sub-tropical environmental conditions present in Hawaii prevent the sexual reproduction of these aphids, we hypothesize that Wolbachia confers net fitness benefits to these hosts rather than acting as a reproductive manipulator. Here we propose to explore the prevalence and evolutionary relationships of Wolbachia infecting aphids from the genus Pentalonia. We also seek to determine whether Wolbachia protects aphids against a range of microbial pathogens and influences the transmission of an aphid vectored plant virus. The latter has important implications for the management and control of plant viruses for which aphids are exclusive vectors. We will also conduct transfection experiments to study the effects of Wolbachia infection in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, which has emerged as a model system for studying bacterial symbionts. While our initial findings will provide key information on the nature of Wolbachia -aphid interactions, the broader scope, which is in line with the long term goals of the USDA AFRI foundational programs, intends to address the extent to which Wolbachia may be exploited to interfere with the spread of aphid-vectored plant viruses."

For thousands of years, American Indians lived healthy lifestyles. American Indians have developed very sophisticated agricultural systems that gave us beans, corn, potatoes, squash, and other foods. Maintaining a traditional diet appears to be beneficial and the main reason for the project is to motivate American Indian families to return to a more traditional diet. This study has the potential for measurable outcomes based on results that will empirically establish the efficacy of community based participatory research for food science; demonstrate the important role of culture in determining and changing people's food behaviors, and the effect of a multi level ecological approach to food interventions. Impacts and outcomes include; multi systemic change in Lummi nutrition; multigenerational knowledge sharing; infrastructure development across tribal, local, and state agencies; scientific advancement in the food and nutrition fields related to Native North Americans. Participants will benefit from shared and increased knowledge of traditional foods, they will experience the benefits of a collaborative research process, they will feel ownership of the research and its products, they will have a renewed sense of pride for the culture, they will increase their fruit and vegetable intake, learn about and integrate locally grown foods, increase amounts of traditional foods, decrease amounts of processed foods, learn healthy food preparation. Other outcomes include: increased collaboration between NWIC, WSU, and Growing Washington, increased collaboration with local community partners, and increased interest in ecological and agricultural science. Overall, this project is designed to help Lummi families return to a more healthy and traditional diet by incorporating healthy, local, and traditional foods into their daily diets."

Currently, BMSB is well established throughout DE, MD, PA, NJ, VA and WV and has been officially detected in 33 states and the District of Columbia. BMSB is a polyphagous pest of numerous specialty crops in Asia. In 2010, BMSB populations increased dramatically and attacked many high-value specialty crops in the mid-Atlantic region. Damage in commercial orchard crops reached critical levels with some growers losing entire blocks of stone and pome fruit. In addition, extensive damage and crop losses were reported for peppers, tomatoes, sweet corn, caneberries and grapes. Damage to woody and herbaceous ornamentals also was severe. The risk to other specialty crops such as snap and lima beans is considered high, and questions of potential disease transmission and post-harvest issues continue to arise. As the threat to U.S. agriculture posed by spreading BMSB populations continues to increase, there is no established detection method, treatment threshold, or control strategy for BMSB in any cropping system. Therefore, we propose to: (1) establish biology and phenology of BMSB in specialty crops; (2) develop monitoring and management tools for BMSB; (3) establish effective management programs for BMSB in specialty crops; and (4) integrate stakeholder input and research findings to form and deliver practical outcomes."

The primary obstacle to achieving this goal is the lack of high quality adapted germplasm, because thus far hazelnuts in the region have been primarily seed-propagated. Our objectives are to develop viable methods of vegetative propagation of native and hybrid hazelnuts, to use plants propagated by these methods to develop a germplasm improvement program for the region, and to develop best management practices for growing native and hybrid hazelnuts. We will build on expertise and relationships that have been developed between the project team, extension, and hazelnut growers for the past decade or longer. Over the five years of this project we propose to host annual regional hazelnut conferences, train-the-trainer workshops, and at least one field day per state per year. Results from the research will be distributed through Extension and organizational partners, and through an Upper Midwest Hazelnut Website, which will be a low-cost method of getting results to growers quickly, and will offer growers a way to share their observations with others. Native and hybrid hazelnuts could provide growers with a way to make income from land that would otherwise be unsuitable for agriculture. With prices of $10/lb for shelled nuts, and relatively low input costs, their economic potential is excellent. Woody perennials such as hazelnuts have been shown to reduce soil erosion, enhance water quality, increase soil carbon sequestration, improve N cycling efficiency, reduce N leaching and nitrous oxide emissions, and increase numbers and diversity of beneficial soil organisms, beneficial insects, and birds, while reducing on-farm energy expenditures. There are an estimated 129 hybrid hazelnut growers in the Upper Midwest region. Surveyed growers have identified the extreme variability in the available seed-propagated germplasm, as their main challenge. To address this, the Upper Midwest Hazelnut Development Initiative/Hazelnut Improvement Program was launched in August of 2009, with growers and researchers working closely to aggressively screen hybrid hazelnut plantings for superior material and populate performance trials. Growers are also coming together at the state level to form growers associations to address challenges in processing and marketing."

Pyrethroid insecticides are inexpensive and have activity against a wide range of pest arthropods. However, these are not selective compounds and are toxic to many beneficial organisms. In the past, corn pest management in the upper Midwest has not relied heavily on these powerful tools as foliar treatments. However, the emergence of a new insect threat, the western bean cutworm (WBC), has led to large increases in rates of application in areas where this pest is found. Only selected varieties of Bt corn are effective against this pest. As a result, these hybrids are often in short supply in the area of infestation. Pest managers have a viable alternative, however: it has been demonstrated across its native and expanded range that the combination of scouting and application of insecticides timed to coincide with peak oviposition can manage WBC effectively. Although scouting and threshold guidelines have been available for decades, more information about possible intersections between this insect pest and fungal pathogens are needed as this pest continues to expand its range. While pyrethroids are long-established in the corn pest management arsenal, a notable class of fungicides have entered the marketplace in recent years: the QoI or strobilurin group. These compounds have proven to be effective at reducing disease development of yield-limiting pathogens in susceptible varieties of field corn. In contrast with pyrethroid use in corn, which is driven by a novel pest, growers typically apply fungicides not in response to disease pressure, but in the hopes of preserving yield or obtaining plant health benefits that have been widely promoted with these fungicides. Prophylactic use of fungicides is in direct opposition to IPM principles of disease management, and the benefits are not at all clear: research has indicated that there could be negative or limiting factors to the extent that fungicides can alter plant chemistry to promote yield. The nature of these powerful tools dictates that we exercise caution and apply science-based rationale to their use. The often-cited potential pitfalls of widespread use of any pesticide include the threats of resistance development and negative impacts on non-target pests (including beneficial insects and fungi). Our project will use research-based results to improve management options for these important pests and increase awareness through multiple platforms and tools that will be available and updated in the future."

Additionally, we will study the interactive effects of variety characteristics with management practices. We will conduct on-farm research and improved variety evaluation. Our education plan will be facilitated by our team of organic farmers, researchers, and Extension staff in Minnesota who are interested in optimizing organic soybean and dry bean production systems. We will conduct field days and develop publications and use eOrganic to allow stakeholders to review the progress and provide input. Enhanced efficiency of soybean and dry bean production will provide greater economic return for producers, and a greater supply of healthy organic foods for local and national markets. These impacts will be measured with crop production statistics from NASS and Minnesota Department of Agriculture. Our large stakeholder group, an on-going organic team that includes producers, educators, and researchers, has helped identify our objectives.

This is currently the case in the North Central region, where an insect pest, the western bean cutworm (WBC), is driving increases in application rates of pyrethroid insecticides. The insecticides themselves are relatively inexpensive, however, they are usually applied by air and are commonly coupled with fungicides in a combination that is promoted as a  one-pass  preventative approach to pest-management and yield preservation. Prophylactic use of fungicides is in direct opposition to IPM principles of disease management, and the benefits are not at all clear: research has indicated that there could be negative or limiting factors to the extent that fungicides can alter plant chemistry to promote yield. Questions remain as to how WBC and fungicide applications impact development of Gibberella ear rot, a fungal disease capable of causing yield loss and producing mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) and zealeranone, which are toxic to both humans and livestock. Because of the potential for WBC to exacerbate ear rot problems, combined with the fact that producers are combining fungicides (with no demonstrated efficacy against these pathogens) with insecticide applications, it is clear that these pests should be considered together when developing management plans. Our research objectives seek to both identify the relationships between the insect and the fungal pathogens and identify management practices that will address both problems effectively. Field experiments will be designed to quantify the relationship between the two pests and determine if prophylactic pesticide applications have an impact on disease development and mycotoxin production. We will develop Extension programs based on these research findings led by a web-based  smartphone  application that will allow clientele to take the research findings and recommendations (along with existing diagnostic tools and pest identification resources) into the field. Web-based video resources, field demonstrations, and workshops will be developed to ensure that stakeholders have the information and tools needed to implement improved pest management recommendations for WBC and Gibberella ear rot."

Hypothesis: Examination of the many genes involved in plant-pathogen interactions will reveal critical molecular networks with specific modes of action that are essential to resistance in soybean and to virulence in soybean pathogens. These networks may share commonalities to networks in other plants and pathogens.Objective 3: Engineer and evaluate new methods for obtaining resistance, such as gene silencing, over-expression and protein antagonism, and chemical inhibition of host and pathogen processes, with special emphasis on soybean rust and the soybean cyst nematode. Hypothesis: Expression of gene silencing constructs or of proteins inhibitory to important aspects of pathogen infection, development or maintenance can result in increased tolerance or resistance to a particular pest or pathogen.Approach:We have soybean genotypes resistant to one or more rust isolates, but susceptible to all others. These soybean genotypes will be challenged with specific pathogen isolates to study the resistance and susceptible response. Gene and protein expression in both plants and pathogens will be monitored using microarrays, membrane arrays, expressed sequence tag analysis, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR. Proteins will be detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS). Cell fractionation, laser capture microdissection, and subtractive hybridization will be used to isolate specific tissues, organelles, or materials involved in disease processes or responses. Other methods such as antibody localization, gene silencing, plant hairy root transformation (for SCN studies) and mutant analysis will be used to determine the function of genes and proteins and toevaluate their importance in resistance and susceptibility.The disease and pest resistance responses to infection in soybeans will beelucidated systematically using microarrays, proteomics and metabolomics to resolve the biological network evoked. A comparison of differential gene expression and protein accumulation in the resistant and susceptible response of soybean to pathogens will identify components of the network. These networks will be built, examined, and perturbed to confirm function of components using an array of tools, including bioinformatics, yeast two-hybrid screens, mutation analysis, immunolocalization,immuno-precipitation, affinity purification, protein tagging, geneover-expression, phage library display, and other methods that will resolve proteinprotein interactions and interactions among molecules. Based on these data, we can identify candidate members of pathways and networks involved in signaling and evoking the resistance response. Other plant systems, including common bean and Medicago truncatula, will be used as needed in parallel investigations studying host-pathogen responses and interactions to take advantage of the knowledge and specific traits of the resistance response in these systems.Approaches for achieving pathogen control include engineering transgenic plant tissue and organs to express genes that boost the natural defense system of the plant or to provide the plant with a new trait that confers resistance by blocking pathogen attack or survival.  Genes shown to have important roles in plant defense may be over-expressed in transgenic plants.  Likewise genes that are critical to survival of the SCN in the host or that make the plant susceptible to SCN may be silenced in transgenic roots using hairy root transformation techniques.  Additionally, genes that express antibodies or protein antagonists will be engineered into soybean to block the survival and development of the pest or pathogen."

Such storage, called hermetic storage, goes back to the days of the Romans and earlier. Hermetic storage works because insects require oxygen to thrive. Without oxygen they don't grow and reproduce normally and eventually they die. Practical and useful as hermetic storage may be, we don't fully understand how it works. We know too little about the best conditions for storage, how long to store, and how various storage conditions affect various life stages of the many different insects that are pests of stored products. Better understanding of hermetic storage and its effects on insects may lead to better methods or conditions of storage, reduced use of insecticides on our food and stored grain, plus significant economic returns. Goal 2: Cowpea, also known as black-eyed pea, is damaged by many different insects. Plant breeders have tried for years to make cowpea plants insect resistant, but with little success. One new approach involves genetically engineering resistance into cowpea. This has already been achieved by bringing a  Bt  gene into cowpea from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, an insecticidal bacterium widely used by organic farmers. Field tests are beginning with Bt cowpea, and will be carried out over the next several years. Unfortunately the Bt in cowpea protects only against pod borers, but there are other pests of cowpea that Bt probably won't protect against, including pod-sucking bugs and flower thrips. By targeting these insects and studying the genes expressed in their guts, we may be able to identify genes that are vulnerable to a new approach called RNA interference (or RNAi). RNAi works to knock out the products of important genes, and may lead to new, highly-specific ways to control insect pests of cowpea as well as other plants. First, however, it will be necessary to discover the best targets, demonstrate that they are vulnerable to interfering RNAs, and demonstrate that the approach has the potential to provide new, safer and flexible means to insect control."

A key outcome is to develop practical methods for corn growers to monitor for western bean cutworm in corn to initiate field scouting at the proper time, and avoid economic loss. Another outcome is a better understanding of WBC biology in its eastern range, so that thresholds and management guidelines can be tailored to the Great Lakes region and growers can protect yield better. A third practical outcome will be to determine the effect of seed mixtures on WBC populations and damage in refuge-in-a-bag corn. A viable insect resistance management strategy that incorporates seed mixtures for the refuge component - and takes non-target Lepidoptera like western bean cutworm into consideration - will directly benefit growers because refuge will be easier to deploy, not only ensuring compliance, but saving growers money. Another outcome related to basic biology is the testing of western bean cutworm populations from Michigan with genetic markers developed in the project. This will help us better understand how and why western bean cutworm moved from west to east in the first place, and perhaps allow us to detect a biotype unique to dry beans. The presence of several biotypes would suggest differential management of the two strains. A final overarching outcome is faster, more efficient extension of knowledge developed in the project to clientele, particularly using modern electronic means. More and timely knowledge increases clientele capacity to implement IPM for corn Lepidopteran pests, and creates efficiencies through IPM decision support to reduce costs to growers."

European corn borer (ECB) accounts for over $1.85 billion in control costs and grain losses annually. Southwestern corn borer, sugarcane borer, corn earworm, fall armyworm, and black cutworm can cause significant damage regionally. Western bean cutworm increasingly is a pest of corn ears across the north central region. The long-term goal of our research is to develop sustainable ways to manage lepidopteran corn pests. This is a high regional priority, and in the context of demonstrating sustainable practices, it also is an important national priority. _____Implications of GM corn in the landscape and pest management. Since the commercial release of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn in 1996, a revolution in corn insect pest management has occurred. To preserve this valuable technology, insect resistance management (IRM) must be implemented. Bt corn acreage has increased dramatically and new Bt technologies have emerged, increasing the potential for resistance evolution, generating new demands on IRM, and revealing new knowledge gaps about ECB and other corn pests. Our research was used to develop IRM models which led to the IRM approach using a 20% non-Bt corn refuge. However, recent developments have stretched our ability to provide sound, timely knowledge. In addition, because of the widespread use of Bt corn, there has been an area-wide suppression of ECB populations, the extent and consequences of which need to be quantified. Another issue has been the need to more fully understand the impacts of GM technologies on non-target organisms. Never before in the history of pest management has there been as much pressure placed on the scientific community by the general public to understand the ecological impacts of new pest management tactics. _____Adaption of IPM systems for changing pest complexes. Climate change has important implications for corn IPM. Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns may be in part responsible for a host of new corn pests. Range expansion of four major corn pests, including corn earworm and ECB, has been predicted by analyzing pest overwintering thresholds and degree-day requirements along with climate change projections. These range expansions could have significant economic impacts via increased yield loss and management costs. Corn IPM will necessarily have to adapt to these changing conditions. _____Ecology, evolution, genetics, and behavior. Despite nearly a century of research on ECB, spatial and temporal aspects of ECB movement and mating behavior have proven difficult to characterize. A clear understanding of mating behavior is important for IRM modeling and policy development. Enhancing natural control is the first line of protection in IPM. Even though the biology of most of the natural enemies associated with corn has been described, the effects and value of these natural enemies in the landscape is not well understood. Information gaps include understanding patterns of variation in natural enemy communities in a corn and soybean agroecosystems."

With more than 60,000 hectares of vegetables in New York, it's conservatively estimated that more than 15 million kilograms of nutrients are added annually (NY Agric. Stats., 2008). Fertilizer prices have skyrocketed in recent years as energy costs have risen, worldwide production has leveled off, and developing countries have increased the use of synthetic fertilizers. Vegetable crops are a high value crop, with a net value of $500 to $10,000 per acre, depending on the commodity. As such, fertilizer is one of the cheaper inputs in vegetable production and is often added as insurance to guarantee a high yield. It is estimated that at least 30% to 50% of the applied nitrogen goes unused by the plant (Robinson et al., 1991). This is unfortunate as vegetable growers are likely using amounts in excess of what is needed for sustainable yields, reducing their profits while potentially increasing environmental problems. Do to the lower prices normally received for field crops, there has been greater interest in reducing fertilizer costs in these crops. As a result, much more research has been conducted on field crops, as well as grower adoption, on soil testing methods to reduce nitrogen applications. As prices have risen, some vegetable growers are working with consultants and CCE to increase testing and eliminate insurance applications. In 2008, one western NY cabbage and winter squash grower saved $20,000 by performing the Presidedress Nitrate Test (PSNT) . Nitrogen sidedress applications were reduced 33% and 66% on 210 and 50 acres, respectively, and eliminated on 240 acres. Despite this success, few vegetable growers use the PSNT, likely because it does not meet criteria needed for widespread adoption. First, the test must be a reliable indicator of a crops N needs, 2) it must be easy to obtain soil samples (timing and depth of sampling cannot interfere with normal farming operations), 3) the test must provide information to farmer before decisions need to be made regarding purchase or application of N, and 4) the test must be economical. The need to conduct the PSNT during the busy growing season and get results before the crop window closes limits its use, as does the need to sample to 30 cm, very difficult to do in rocky soils. Soil testing is routinely used to guide applications of lime, P, and K while N applications are often based on yield goals with adjustments to allow for N input from legume or manures. It is complicated by the dynamic nature of soil nitrogen, owing to the effects of soil moisture and temperatures. A preseason nitrogen test that can provide a an estimate of the labile organic fraction that supplies the plant through mineralization is needed. This would have an advantage over the PSNT as it would depend on fewer nitrogen cycle processes and be less variable. Timing of this test would be less critical and could be performed prior to the season. The Illinois Soil Nitrogen Test (ISNT) may be that test."

They are considered to be an emerging threat because of recent outbreaks that caused wide-spread famine in Uganda (cassava) and other parts of Africa (corn) and economic hardship in Pakistan and India (cotton). They are a threat to the US because of the recent introduction of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus from Israel and the possible introduction of Old World geminiviruses infecting cotton or corn. Although resistance genes for different geminiviruses have been identified in bean, tomato, corn, and other crops, none of them has been sequenced. Sequencing of a potyvirus resistance gene in Arabidopsis was a breakthrough for plant breeding because it allowed the identification of naturally occurring resistance genes in several different crop plants and also shed light on exactly which host factors were important for RNA virus infection. The investigators have identified an Arabidopsis gene that confers resistance to two very different types of DNA virus. Such broad-based resistance would be an important complement to genetic engineering methods, such as RNAi, that are powerful but virus-specific. The goal of this project is to identify and sequence the Arabidopsis geminivirus resistance gene by determining which DNA fragments correlate with resistance in a mapping (F2) population. A cloned gene corresponding to this DNA fragment will be transformed into a susceptible plant and challenged with both geminiviruses. If the gene behaves as expected (resistance is conferred), information about the new function of the gene will be submitted to the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) and then published."

In 2009, hay was the leading crop in Colorado with an estimated value of $633 million, accounting for 31.4% of the total value from all crops. Colorado is experiencing several trends that are creating a need for additional information related to forage production and management. First, the dairy industry within the state has experienced a steady increase in cow numbers (40,000 head) over the last 10 years which brings with it a concurrent need for additional forage. In addition, when the Laprino cheese and whey plant comes online in Greeley within the next year, it will be accompanied by an additional need for 80,000 more cows in northeastern Colorado to meet the milk supply demand for the plant. Second, the state is experiencing a conversion of agricultural land to other uses. Large acreages are being subdivided into smaller parcels (less than 35 acres) which are being purchased by people from predominately urban backgrounds that have little knowledge of land management practices. Most like to keep a few animals on their property, but need help with such things as what forage species to plant, how to establish the plants, and weed and grazing management. The clientele base for research and extension information on forages is basically changing from traditional agricultural producers to these new  small acreage landowners . Finally, the urban development and subsequent population growth that Colorado is currently experiencing has brought about a need for more water for municipal uses. About 90% of the water used in Colorado is for agricultural purposes. One of the easiest ways for municipalities to obtain more water is to buy irrigation water rights from agricultural users. This creates a need for information on how to reclaim these formerly irrigated lands by establishing dryland forage species. If active restoration is not pursued, it may take years for succession to reach a point where the land is once again productive for both livestock and wildlife uses. To meet the above needs, various forages (annual and perennial grasses and legumes) will be evaluated for their adaptability in various environments throughout Colorado. Management practices will also be concurrently evaluated that ensure the long-term productivity of these forages which will ultimately minimize input costs to landowners. Results will be disseminated through referred journal articles, AES technical reports and bulletins, Extension fact sheets, workshops and seminars, and field days. Results will also be incorporated into campus courses (Forage and Pasture Management and Integrated Forage Management). Most of the information generated will be made available to the public through the world wide web."

Nationwide, production of snap beans is often limited by the presence of primarily two diseases, white mold and gray mold. Both diseases can result in economically devastating losses to growers. Disease development is favored by moist weather conditions typically found in the Northeast when crop production is at its peak. Research is needed on biological, chemical, and cultural practice management strategies for both pathogens. Another destructive vegetable disease of critical concern is Phytophthora blight, which is a well known disease of crops in the pepper and pumpkin families, and more recently it has been documented on snap beans. It has not been a significant problem in upstate New York until relatively recently, and vegetable producers are now searching for effective control strategies. Very little information is available about this disease on snap or dry beans, and control recommendations are sparse. We recently described a relatively new disease on cabbage caused by the fungus Fusarium avenaceum. The fungus produces an extensive rot on cabbage heads with profuse pink to orange colored areas in the infected tissues. It is not known how infection occurs or what environmental conditions favor disease development. Specific disease management strategies have not been developed for this pathogen, and no fungicides or biological materials are currently registered on cabbage for control of this disease. Upon completion of this project 1) snap bean producers will have a greater understanding of the most effective strategies to reduce white and gray mold on their crops; 2) snap bean producers will know which varieties to use to avoid losses to Phytophthora blight; snap bean growers will know how to deploy and integrate their growing practices to minimize losses to Phytophthora blight; and 4) cabbage growers will be knowledgeable of the factors that promote infection of cabbage by F. avenaceum, will follow the disease management strategies proposed as a result of this research, and will experience significantly less disease."

One of the most important constraints is transportation. Currently, nearly 90% of all beef consumed in Hawaii is imported from the mainland. Meanwhile, the state is exporting about $17.4 million in live cattle from the state. There exists an opportunity to reverse these numbers. A potential solution is to build a market around Hawaii's locally grown, grassed finished beef. While research is needed to determine how best to finish animals to a consistent yield and quality these animal production goals need to be aligned with sustainable grazing management practices. There is an immediate need to show that sustainable grazing management can be compatible with sustainable animal production goals. Currently, over 1.2 million acres of Hawaii's land area is utilized for livestock production. Many of these acres are in marginal condition because of poor grazing management practices in the past. This has led to infestations of noxious weeds and invasive grasses. In addition, poor grazing management has led to increased rates of erosion and a general decline in soil quality. Without mitigation these impacts will continue to increase in significance, and may eventually reach a threshold beyond which the land will not be able to recover. With the significant reduction in production acreage of the sugarcane and pineapple industries in Hawaii there is a unique opportunity for the livestock industry to expand. Most of these lands, once abandoned, developed into open grasslands where guineagrass is now the dominant species. Because of the intensity of the agricultural practices used in growing sugarcane and pineapple the soils are of poor fertility. Low soil fertility and acidic soils limit the productivity of desirable grasses and legumes, encourages invasion and the competitiveness of undesirable weedy species, results in low forage quality, low rates of gain per animal, and generally limits the long-term sustainability of the grazing system. Regardless of whether the land has been grazed since the 1800s or is just now being converted into a forage production and grazing system, improper management practices will eventually lead to significant losses in the social, ecologic, and economic value of the land. If livestock production is to be sustained on Hawaii's range and pasture lands, extension and research efforts are needed to develop a suite of recommendations for the efficient and effective management of these lands that fit Hawaii's unique production requirements. These Best Management Practices (BMPs) should provide stakeholders with efficient, economical, and ecologically sound alternatives for range and pasture improvements, converting former sugarcane and pineapple lands into sustainable forage production systems, controlling noxious weeds and invasive grasses, increasing the nutritional quality of forages for animal production, and developing grazing management practices that improve animal distribution, grazing efficiency, and protects native ecosystems."

Some of this city land may be parking lots covered with asphalt. There are several reasons for this interest. First, land is becoming more available in cities because of the recent economic/foreclosure crisis. Second, consumers are demanding more local produce because of environmental considerations and keeping food dollars in the local economy. Third, if we are near peak oil production, as some claim, or a carbon tax is implemented, the price of fuel will increase dramatically in the future and the cost of food produced under our current industrial agriculture model will also increase substantially. This will result in an increase demand for local produce that required less transportation and will make local food production more profitable. Small acreage or urban farmers can use many integrated pest management (IPM) tactics to manage pests, increase yields and increase profits that larger industrial acreage farmers would find cost prohibitive. These tactics include such things as the use of polyculture systems, high tunnels, raised beds, and growing crops in containers. Although there is some research information available on all of these components there is little to no information on growing food on asphalt and the impact on pest and beneficial arthropods. Therefore the purpose of this project is to evaluate several different growing systems that are designed for urban farmers interested in turning areas covered by asphalt into productive land. This experiment is located on an abandoned parking lot of the Ohio State University Agricultural Technology Institute and will evaluate a polyculture system that includes 4 perennial crops (apple, peach, blueberry, raspberry) and 4 annual crops (tomato, edamame soybeans, strawberry, green beans) using 3 different growing systems on an asphalted parking lot. The 3 treatments replicated 3 times are: 1) growing the crops in pots, 2) removing the asphalt within the rows and planting directly in the soil, and 3) planting in raised beds on a wood chip base. Treatments will be repeated on a grass area immediately adjacent to the parking lot to serve as paired comparison. High tunnels will also be applied over one replicate of each treatment to measure the impact on food production and pest management. The information generated from this project will increase the knowledge of urban farmers so they can determine what techniques are the most acceptable and profitable for their operations."

Abiotic and biotic stresses can severely limit both dry and snap (vegetable form) bean production. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases are the main production constraints. In the same way, some production regions are severely affected by drought, heat, soil mineral deficiencies, and short growing seasons, among other problems. Many of these diseases are seed-borne, or are caused by pathogenetically variable and sometimes emergent pathogens, and for whom chemical control can be expensive, is not practical, or in the case of plant viruses, requires resistance genes (traditional or engineered) to reduce damage.

New Phaseolous markers will make possible efficient introgression and pyramiding of favorable alleles and QTL into improved bean cultivars for a diverse cropping system. The efficient development of such germplasm and cultivars having multiple-disease resistance and abiotic stresses, requires a team of researchers with expertise and facilities and that share responsibilities as well as the exchange of segregating populations and breeding lines that complement screening and selection in contrasting field environments, combined with expertise in plant pathogen identification, culturing, manipulation and genetic/genomic studies to pinpoint pathogenicity genes (gene for gene and other resistance mechanisms), laboratories, and greenhouses regionally and nationally."

L.",,,047120084,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS,DAVIS,CA,95618-6153,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2011,,,"Common bean (P. vulgaris) is increasingly seen as a ?super-food? because of its multiple nutritional benefits for humans. It is the only food that is represented in two different categories in the USDA Food Pyramid (meat and beans, vegetables). In addition to providing an environmentally friendly source of proteins, beans also provide dietary fibers, antioxidants, vitamins (e.g., folate) and minerals (e.g., iron and zinc). They reduce blood cholesterol and sugar content. Recent results show that some varieties of common bean significantly reduce the incidence and multiplicity of breast cancer in lab animals. These powerful nutritional benefits are complemented by the agronomic qualities of common bean, which, as a symbiotic nitrogen fixer supplies nitrogen to associated crops, especially cereals. There are two significant ways in which bean production can be improved qualitatively and quantitatively. The first one is to improve our knowledge of the genes that determine the development and the composition of the main harvested organs of beans, namely pods and seeds. The shape of pods and the absence of fibers in pods are important quality traits for snap beans, as is the size of seeds for consumer acceptability of dry bean varieties. Information about the genes determining these traits will facilitate the development of improved varieties of snap and dry beans. For example, we have identified a candidate gene, which controls the absence of fibers (?strings?) in pods. This project will confirm this finding and use this information to develop markers for marker-assisted selection of new cultivars without pod fibers. Another example is the phaseolin locus, which is not only the structural locus for the main seed protein of common bean, but is also the main locus for total seed protein and seed weight. As this locus has been cloned, further analyses can be conducted to determine the factors influencing its expression, including specific sequence elements or chemical modifications of the DNA sequence of this locus (also called epigenetic changes). Similar approaches can be followed for genes involved in the color of seeds, which are often sources of antioxidants. The second way to improve bean production is to address changing environmental conditions such as global warming and reduce the use of inputs such as water. Making bean production more water-use efficient is part of more sustainable agricultural systems. This project will complement current bean breeding efforts to develop drought-tolerant varieties by expanding the sources of drought tolerance to wild beans. Because wild beans have survived to this day in harsh conditions, they may harbor genes for drought tolerance. These genes, once discovered, can be crossed into bean cultivars with enhance drought tolerance."

This project will identify the molecular basis of disease resistance to important pathogens of grain legume species, including cowpea, peanut, chickpea and pigeonpea, and deploy this knowledge for purposes of crop improvement through plant breeding.  Our approach is to leverage knowledge gained from the study of well-characterized legume species, such as soybean and Medicago. Both of these species have fully sequenced genomes, and we have developed comparative data sets that permit us to transfer molecular genetic information from these well-characterized species to less characterized crop species. Using this approach, we can accelerate the characterization of disease resistance traits in less characterized species, and ultimately arrive at a detailed description of the genes that underlie disease resistance against specific pathogens.  Key outputs will be a better understanding of the genes that confer resistance to important plant pathogens of legumes. Such knowledge can lead to more precise and rapid breeding strategies to provide disease resistant varieties of key crop legumes."

This will be achieved by developing longer crop rotations that include summer and winter annual species as well as perennial species. Oilseed crops such as canola and cereal grains such as wheat exhibiting summer and winter annual life cycles as well as perennial legumes such as red clover could possibly fit into an Iowa crop rotation providing growers with alternative options. Additionally, the inclusion of summer and winter annual crop species in rotations increases the potential of economically viable double-cropping scenarios. The inclusion of species with different life cycles such as these can also serve to improve cropping systems by increasing the amount of ground cover throughout the year and help disturb life cycles of problematic weed species. Incorporating multiple species into a crop rotation may also improve yields of other crops such as corn and improve a farmer's economic stability."

The European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis, accounts for over $1.85 billion in control costs and grain losses annually. In 2006, 88% of the fresh market sweet corn acreage was treated with one or more insecticide applications for a total of 605,000 lbs of insecticides applied. ECB also attacks many other crops, such as sorghum, small grains, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, and peppers. The southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella, causes about $1 million in damage in the Western High Plains (Morrison et al. 1977). Recently, the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis, has emerged as an important corn pest in the southern U.S. Other significant stalk-boring pests include the common stalk borer, Papaipema nebris, hop vine borer, Hydraecia immanis, and potato stem borer, Hydraecia micacea. Since 1950, previous committees have focused on ECB and other stalk-boring lepidopteran corn pests. In addition to stalk borers, we propose to address the other lepidopteran corn pests, which include those that feed on corn leaves and ears. This is a natural progression for the committee, as these pests are increasing in economic importance. Corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea, and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, consume corn leaves, tassels, silk and kernels. In the southeastern U.S., losses attributed to corn earworm in field corn range from 1.5-16.7%, and sweet corn losses can be as high as 50% (Wiseman 1999). Black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon, is the most damaging of the cutworm complex in the Corn Belt. Stand loss over 25% and yield losses of about 2,900 kg/ha are not unusual (Showers et al. 1983, Showers 1999). Western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta, increasingly is a pest of corn ears across the north central region. Outcomes or projected Impacts: -Cumulative benefits to Bt and non-Bt maize due to a suppressed European corn borer population during 13 growing seasons are conservatively estimated at more than $6.1 billion for a 5-state region, with cumulative benefits to non-Bt maize accounting for almost $3.9 billion of this total. -An improved program for monitoring for European corn borer resistance to Bt corn would help safeguard Bt technology for growers. -Blended seed refuge would increase grower productivity across the Corn Belt and reduce the likelihood that European corn borer would develop resistance to Bt corn. -Growers and consultants will have practical methods to monitor for western bean cutworm adults so they can initiate field scouting and avoid undue economic loss to either the pest itself or the increased mycotoxin contamination it might cause. -Online publication of outputs will expand clientele access to corn insect IPM decision support tools and increase implementation of IPM for corn lepidopteran pests."

Significantly greater N is removed via mechanical harvesting for feed but the same problem occurs when the forage is fed the animals consume forage N, but then excrete most of this N into the environment. Because N is usually the primary limitation to plant production in temperate ecosystems, significant manure and inorganic fertilizer N is applied to agroecosystems. Nitrogen fixation by legumes and purchased feed supplements contribute additional N to the system. Unless soil organic matter increases significantly over time, there is little potential for highly mobile N to accumulate in soils, so the fate of this surplus N is deposition in waterbodies, groundwater, the atmosphere, and adjacent terrestrial ecosystems where it can have undesirable effects. From an agronomic perspective, much is known about fertilizer type, amount, and timing of application for maximizing crop yields. Likewise, forage quality and animal nutrition research is targeting ways of improving N use efficiency by plants and livestock. A previous project (NC-189 Forage Protein Characterization and Utilization for Cattle) of this committee focused on the ruminal degradation characteristics of forage proteins in commonly cultivated forages and also provided a solid understanding of the protein degradation characteristics of native prairie and range grasses found throughout the north central region. While mechanisms and pathways for N transformation and loss have been determined for grasslands and pastures, major gaps exist in our knowledge of the relationships between management and harvest strategies and N pathways on managed cool-season pastures of the central US and elsewhere. There is major uncertainty in the quantification of N2O emissions, in particular with regard to different livestock production systems as well as their feeding and waste management practices, which need to be underpinned by more accurate modeling of soil N2O fluxes. Our expected outcomes and predictions include ranking of management strategies in terms of N use efficiency, particularly as it relates to the capture and excretion of N in the environment, ultimately with the goal of adopting strategies/practices that ensure efficient use of N in order to positively influence environmental quality. In addition, this work will facilitate the identification of management strategies and forage systems that minimize N inputs and production costs. Minimizing expensive N inputs (e.g., fertilizers) in forage-based livestock production systems has tremendous potential to enhance their profitability. These impacts are most likely achieved through the development and implementation of a multiple state project. Furthermore, the needed synergy and technical feasibility of this type of research is questionable for a single university but becomes realistic when several institutions combine resources and expertise."

The first commercial production of these crops was in the early 1990s and experienced rapid growth over the following decade. Production expanded into eastern Montana as producers recognized that the pulse crops fit well into their cropping systems while providing a positive net return to their operations. Production of pea, lentil and chickpea in North Dakota in 2009 was 515,000, 160,000 and 13,000 acres, respectively. North Dakota currently ranks number one among US states for production of dry pea and lentil. Combined production in eastern Montana and North Dakota accounts for 85, 69 and 16 perent of total US production of pea, lentil and chickpea, respectively, and generates an estimated combined farm value of 215.9 million dollars. Production of chickpea in North Dakota once accounted for 17 percent of US production; however, the absence of necessary genetic resistance to manage Ascochyta rabiei, the causal organism of Ascochyta blight, has limited production in recent years to 7 percent of US production. Potential for increased production of chickpea in the northern Great Plains exists, but only if cultivars with improved disease resistance are developed. Multiple market classes of each, pea, lentil and chickpea, are produced and consumed in world markets. Dry pea production is comprised predominantly of yellow (70 percent) and green cotyledon types (30 percent). Lentil production is divided among large- and small-seeded types. Large green and Regular lentils are the predominant market classes produced while the small-seeded Eston, Pardina, and Turkish Red types account for a combined 38 percent of production. Demand for small red lentils has increased in recent years underscoring the need for new cultivars adapted to the northern Great Plains Region. Chickpea production in the US is almost exclusively large-seeded Kabuli types. Kabuli chickpeas are divided between Cafe and Spanish White types. Though Spanish White chickpeas command a premium in export markets, the lack of suitable cultivars has kept production at a minimum. Historically pulse crops have been an export product contributing to the US trade balance. Approximately 60 percent of pea, 75 percent of lentil and 32 percent of chickpea production is exported. The significant export market for these crops, primarily into human food markets, mandates premium quality based on physical appearance. The US pulse industry is well known for its quality and new cultivars must match or exceed current standards. The pulse crops are well known for their nutritional value and serve as a staple in human diets in many developing countries, which stresses the importance of maintaining a high quality standard. In addition to consumption of whole or split legumes, interest in the legumes as ingredients in food products has grown in recent years. The ingredient market is a large, untapped market and the ability of food manufactures to fortify products with pulses and add a health claim to the label bodes well for the future of pulse crops."

Because of the expense and time required to incorporate the new genes necessary for variety improvement, common bean researchers have actively pursued marker-assisted selection. To date, the most widely used marker class is randomly amplified polymorphic DNA. Although these markers are useful, they are often difficult to transfer to a different laborator and for these to be useful, the markers must be converted into another format. SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) are changes at a single location in the genome. These are very abundant and provide a rich source of variation from which markers can be derived. These SNP loci can be found in coding or non-coding regions of a gene, or in non-expressed regions between genes. Currently, SNP technology is beyond the means of a standard public breeding program. To overcome this expense limitation, the development of CAP (cleaved amplified polymorphic) is desirable. The approach takes advantage of the large number of SNPs in a species while reducing the cost to a manageable level for a breeding program. Therefore, the extensive development of this new marker classes will provide significant support to local, regional, and national plant breeding efforts. Also screening populations with SNP, and subsequently CAP, markers, it will be possible to significantly increase the productivity of plant breeding programs as they develop better varieties for both consumers and producers."

Also, little is known of the population structure and genetics of other corn Lepidoptera. Acquiring such information will increase our understanding of the mechanisms of resistance, genetic basis for resistance, status of cross-resistance, and stability of resistance.

Outcomes expected are: Blended seed refuge will increase grower productivity across the Corn Belt and reduce the likelihood that European corn borer will develop resistance to Bt corn; growers and consultants will have practical methods to monitor for western bean cutworm adults; online publication of outputs will expand clientele access to corn insect pest management decision support tools and increase implementation of pest management for corn lepidopteran pests; data collected from this project over the next five years will be used to modify existing models to assess the impact of changing ECB dynamics on IRM for a range of Bt corn refuge scenarios, which will directly influence refuge requirements imposed on growers using Bt corn; a viable IRM strategy that incorporates seed mixtures for the refuge component will directly benefit growers because refuge will be easier to deploy, not only ensuring compliance, but saving growers money."

However, compared to corn, soybean, and wheat, the average national seed yield of dry bean is low (~1700 lbs/acre). In addition, several abiotic and biotic stresses can severely limit both dry and snap (vegetable form) bean production. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases are among the main production constraints, whereas drought, heat, soil mineral deficiencies, and short growing seasons, reduce productivity in many production areas. In order to remain competitive with other crops produced in the U.S., these production constraints need to be addressed. In spite of these limitations, beans are one of the most nutritious and healthiest foods, being the only item included into two different food groups in the USDA food pyramid. In addition to human health, beans promote soil and environmental health through biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen which allows beans to be produced with less N-fertilizer than other crops. Several diseases can be present simultaneously and reduce dry and snap bean yield and quality within and across different production regions. Yield losses can range from 10 to 90%, depending on the diseases involved and severity. Many of these pathogens are highly variable and new races or strains can appear in different regions. A recent example is the new rust races reported in Michigan and North Dakota. Many of these diseases are seed-borne, are caused by genetically variable pathogens, and cannot be economically controlled with chemicals (e.g., common bacterial blight). Fungicides increase production costs and can result in environmental and human health hazards if improperly used. This interdisciplinary, multi-state, collaborative W-1150 project proposal comprises several complementary sub-projects. Key collaboration among participants in these sub-projects is designed to achieve our overall goals and objectives of developing high yielding cultivars with enhanced culinary and nutritional qualities and resistance to major abiotic and biotic stresses. These cultivars will help reduce production costs and pesticide use, increase yield and competitiveness of the U.S. bean growers, and sustain production for domestic consumption and export. Researchers participating in each sub-project have complementary expertise and represent two or more institutions. This research scheme has been very successful as evidenced by the Excellence in Multistate Research Award given to the W1150 multistate project by the Western Association of Agricultural Experiment Station Directors (WAAESD) in 2009. For simplicity, these projects are grouped into the following priorities: (1) biotic stresses, (2) abiotic stresses and production/sustainability, (3) nutritional and health related benefits in the human diet, and (4) characterization/utilization of exotic germplasm."

The understanding of this symbiosis is not well understood genetically, especially from the plant side, and current efforts are being made to address questions related to the evolutionary onset of this symbiosis, the genetic mechanisms of nodule development (including player genes and expression timing), which mechanisms regulate nodulation (such as nodulation repression in high-nitrate conditions), which plant genes allow the symbiosis to occur (including membrane transporters that deliver reduced carbon and other nutrients to bacteroids and allow the passage of reduced nitrogen from the bacteroids enclosed in the symbiosomes located in the plant cytoplasm of nodule cells)."

While NYS growers received prices a decade ago in the $20 to $30 per cwt range, they have recently commanded $41 per cwt in 2007 and $62 per cwt in 2008 (with a resulting crop value of $20 million). Dry beans represents a crop with relatively low input and production costs, which can be grown using common farm equipment, and hence offers an excellent production option in many agronomic and vegetable crop rotations. However, to be consistently profitable, cultivars that help to reduce yield losses from white mold through host plant resistance are necessary to the future sustainability of the NYS dry bean industry. Given our very wet summers fungicides cannot be expected to stop an epidemic, which could cause serious yield losses as well as serious quality degradation, and would add excessive cost to production. Yield and quality losses attributable to this disease can range from 13 to 80%. Also, repeated cropping of susceptible crops increases the level of white mold sclerotia contamination within the field and would limit what crops could be grown in rotation with dry beans. Resistant breeding lines can be developed through accumulation of minor genes for white mold resistance using sources that include PI 204717 and PI 169787. This approach has been successful in developing lines that exhibit high levels of white mold resistance, but these lines need improved agronomic type for development of cultivars adapted to NY growing conditions and markets. New breeding lines from Geneva have performed extremely well in W-1150 national trials, ranking as the best common bean material for white mold resistance in the US. New dry bean lines are now being developed with improved agronomic type, to develop cultivars well suited for their intended market in NY, such as processing or the dry pack trade. As 70% to 80% of NYS dry beans are canned, it is essential that these new breeding lines possess excellent processing characteristics, together with relatively short maturity, stable yield and consistent seed quality. Development of white mold resistant dry bean cultivars which include reasonable maturity, yield potential and processing ability will aid plant breeders, growers, processors, researchers and extension staff to select and utilize the best lines for our NYS environment and markets. The most exciting aspect of bean utilization is the tremendous range of health benefits dry beans provide, including numerous important nutrients, vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein and complex carbohydrates which will help provide energy, and reduce risk of heart disease and certain cancers. Beans are consumed and enjoyed worldwide and cost less per serving than many other sources of protein."

Traditionally, European corn borer has been the pest of primary concern, but in much of its range, European corn borer is being controlled by use of transgenic varieties of corn that are resistant to corn borer feeding. We are evaluating the efficacy and value of some of these lines in the face of the current European corn borer population sizes. We are also evaluating the risk posed by western bean cutworm (WBC), Striacosta albicosta, is a corn pest that has been expanding its range of activity for a little over a decade. In 1999, WBC were found feeding in experimental plots of corn throughout southwestern Minnesota (O'Rourke and Hutchison 2000). Though present in South Dakota for many years (Fauske 1982), it did not cause economic damage there until 2000 (Catangui and Berg 2004). In 2001, widespread damage to corn crops occurred throughout western Iowa (Rice 2002), and was reported for the first time in Illinois and Missouri in 2004 (Dorhout and Rice 2004). The species continues to spread eastward and is now found in Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, (Rice and Dorhout 2006, Pope 2007, DiFonzo and Hammond 2008) and Ontario (Baute, personal communication). At present, little is known about the factors that initiated and sustain this range expansion, although population genetic evidence indicates it was not due to a sudden breach of a topographical barrier (Miller et al. 2009). Research has been initiated across the current WBC range on possible reasons why its range has expanded and on an array of WBC biological, ecological, and behavioral factors that will be used to develop a comprehensive IPM program for this pest. Outcomes of our work will give growers a better understanding of the efficacy of transgenic products in the face of diminished European corn borer populations. Growers will also understand the extent of western bean cutworm populations across the state and the threat that this pest poses to their crops."

Idaho growers also are in the top 10 production states for apples, sweet cherries, prunes and plums, various seed crops and processing sweet corn. Since most specialty crop pesticide registrations or minor uses on major crops are usually not economical for the manufacturer to defend with additional data, one method that chemical registrants can use to reduce their risk is to eliminate certain crops from pesticide labels. In Idaho and many western states, most specialty crops only have one or two choices for pest control options. The loss of one or both pesticide tools could result in crop devastation. Production costs will increase due to changes in agronomic practices. Other impacts could be the loss of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) tools. Pest resistance could develop due to the heavy use of one type of pesticide. This disruption in production could also have impacts to society in the lack of affordable,diversified and nutritious foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables, so important to a healthy diet. The Idaho project will generate data for five new pesticide registration for minor crops as well as supporting new Section 18 registrations. This will result in increased productivity and cash value of Idaho minor crops."

Although Arkansas vegetable production is diverse and includes most vegetables, the more important commercially produced vegetables include tomato, cowpea, corn, snap bean, greens, and cucurbits. Accurate measurements of the total value of commercially produced vegetables are difficult to ascertain. However, personnel with the Ozark Food Processors Association estimate the annual raw produce value at over $30 million. Further, the vegetable processing industry is large. Allen Canning Co. is the largest privately held canner in the U.S. and is headquartered at Siloam Springs, AR. While Del Monte has no processing plants in the state, the company is purchasing increasing amounts of snap bean, corn and greens produced in the state by Razorback Farms, Springdale, AR. Once vegetables are processed, the monetary value of the finished product is increased substantially, generally by a factor of at least 10 fold. In addition to organized commercial vegetable production, Arkansas harbors an ever increasing, less organized fresh market vegetable production. The designated market for these crops may be farmer's markets, vegetable stands or road side sellers. An ever increasing number of these producers now grow organically. Although no monetary estimate of this value is available, these markets play an important role in the economy of Arkansas. Perhaps the single most important contribution to Arkansas' economy from vegetable production comes from home gardeners. It has been estimated that the annual value of home vegetable garden production in Arkansas is over 300 million dollars (O. A. Porter, personal communication). Insects are a major threat to vegetable production. With edible commodities, such as vegetables, insect damage may be in the form of yield reduction (e.g., snap bean and cucurbits), cosmetic damage (e.g., tomato and sweet corn), insect fragment contamination (e.g., snap bean and spinach), or plant disease transmission (e.g., cucurbits). Losses resulting from insect pests also may take on various forms, e.g., monetary loss due to yield reduction or litigation over insect fragments detected in canned vegetables. Thus, management of insects is a necessity in commercial vegetable production in Arkansas. And while not as necessary in the home garden, insect management often results in improved production. The project seeks to gain knowledge on insects and their impact on both commercially produced and home grown vegetables in Arkansas. Once this knowledge is gained, management strategies will be developed and provided to both the commercial producer and home gardener."

Several diseases can be present simultaneously and reduce dry and snap bean yield and quality within and across different production regions. Yield losses can range from 10 to 90%, depending on the diseases involved and severity. For example, in the Western U.S., Beet curly top virus (BCTV), Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), Fusarium root rot (caused by Fusarium solani f.sp. phaseoli) and wilt (caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. phaseoli), and white mold (caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), can simultaneously attack susceptible cultivars. Similarly, in Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, anthracnose (caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum), bacterial brown spot [caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Psp)], BCMV, common bacterial blight [caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli (Xcp) and X. campestris pv. phaseoli var. fuscans (Xcpf), Syn. with X. axonopodis], halo blight (caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola), root rots (caused by a fungal complex in most cases), rust (caused by Uromyces appendiculatus), and white mold can occur together and cause severe yield losses. The root rot pathogens cause serious problems in snap beans across all production regions. In addition, snap beans are vulnerable to regional epidemics of virus diseases including Beet Curly Top Virus (BCTV) in the intermountain west, and a new virus complex in the Great Lakes states which includes Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) in the southeast, and Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV), among others. Many of these pathogens are highly variable in many cases and new races or strains can appear in different regions. A recent example is the new rust races reported in Michigan and North Dakota (Markell et al., 2009, Wright et al., 2008). Furthermore, the introduction of soybean rust into the southeastern U.S. has serious potential implications for dry and snap bean as they are susceptible to the soybean rust pathogens, Phakopsora pachyrhizi and P. meibomiae. Many of these diseases are seed-borne, are caused by pathogenetically variable organisms, and cannot be economically controlled with chemicals."

Research is needed to investigate new crop species, crop varieties, and production methods, in order to help producers succeed in streamlining field operations and diversifying crop rotations. Camelina is an emerging crop in Montana, but nutrient requirements and stand establishment are constraints to production. Field experiments will be conducted to investigate the effect of N and S fertility on camelina, as well as the effect of seeding rate on camelina productivity. This will allow for the development of fertilizer and seeding rate guidelines for camelina. Canola is another attractive oilseed crop to producers in Montana; however lack of adequate agronomic information about the crop is a perceived barrier among area farmers. In field trials conducted across Montana, the response of canola to N and S fertilizer will be examined and optimal fertilizer rates will be determined. Additional field experiments will be conducted to assess how seeding date and K fertilizer will affect winter survival in winter canola stands. This will result in the identification of optimal seeding dates and K fertilizer rates for winter canola survival in northwestern Montana. The continuous wheat and wheat-fallow systems common in Montana can be modified to incorporate relatively new and high-yielding crops such as canola, as well as N-fixing legume crops such as pea or lentil. Local producers are encouraged to include these crops in a rotation, but the benefits of doing so have not been explored in many years in northwestern Montana. Field trials will be conducted with the objective of quantifying the N benefit of legume crops, and will provide information about how canola and legume crops best fit into their wheat-based crop rotations. Spring forage barley intercropped with winter forage wheat is a cereal hay combination that remains untested in Montana, but potential benefits include increased hay yield and quality, reduced fall tillage, reduced weeds, and more efficient field operations. Nitrogen management in forage systems is important due to the increased N demand, and because N dynamics influence the nutritional value of the feed. Of current interest to producers are slow-release N fertilizers, which are designed to increase N uptake efficiency. The evaluation of slow-release fertilizer in monocrop and intercropped spring barley/winter wheat forage systems will be evaluated. Research results from all projects will be disseminated to producers and extension personnel at community meetings and through extension publications. Contributions to the scientific community will be made through conference presentations and the publication of scholarly papers."

Earthworms are ecosystem engineers and keystone species and thus can control belowground ecosystem dynamics and functions. Our previous research has suggested that there are fundamental shifts within the food web and hence nutrient cycling in soils under the influence of earthworms. Practices that promote earthworm dynamics in agroecosystems are encouraged because of their presumed role in improving soil fertility. This is a result of earthworms accelerating turnover of soil, increasing decomposition, cycling N through worm biomass, and improving soil structure, increasing water infiltration and water retention, but also drainage. Earthworms also increase protection of organic matter inside aggregates as they age. On the other hand, it is also important to recognize less desirable impacts of earthworm activity. Because earthworm burrows can facilitate movement of water into the soil subsurface, preferential flow through those macropores may move nutrients and fertilizers, pesticides, and land-applied wastes to surface or groundwater in agricultural systems. Extrapolation across ecosystem types is not straightforward because the role of vegetation in soil development in distinct types of systems. Additionally, cropland and pastures are actively managed for the growth of limited species of plants that are not necessarily native to the locale. In general, as practices such as ground cover management, cover cropping, incorporation of legumes into pasture systems, and conservation tillage continue to be implemented, earthworm populations are likely to benefit from increased food resources and less physical disruption. Earthworms are known to facilitate N cycling, but information regarding the timing and availability of N (which could lead to enhanced availability, enhanced competition, or greater losses from terrestrial ecosystems) in different systems still needs clarification.

The loss of alfalfa or other legume forages in the crop rotation will negatively impact the soil, reducing water quality, increasing C release to the atmosphere, and increasing operation cost. The bioenergy crop component of this project will generate decision-making information and crop production guidelines for growers in the near future when markets are open for crops dedicated to biomass production or as feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol.

Clopyralid is a new herbicide that has been registered for use and is being used for weed control in cranberries. Clopyralid effectively controls legume and composite weeds. Clopyralid has been used prior to registration under a section 18 Emergency Exemption in New Jersey cranberries wild bean Apios americana control. Research has indicated that cranberry tolerance to clopyralid and other experimental herbicides depends on application rate and time of application. Growers observed control of other composite and legume weeds, in addition to wild bean in treated bogs, including fireweed Erechtites hieracifolia and beggar-ticks Bidens frodosa. Field research will be conducted to develop information needed to expand the list of weeds controlled with clopyralid, and determine the optimum herbicide rate and time of application. Weed species in addition to wild bean that clopyralid has the potential to control includes fireweed, beggars-ticks, goldenrod Solidago species, and aster Aster species. In recent years, pronamide, marketed under the trade name of Kerb, has been used for dodder control with section 18 Emergency Exemptions. Pronamide will no longer be available for the control of dodder in cranberries. Research to identify alternative dodder control measures is a priority. Screening to identify additional herbicides with the potential to control weeds in cranberries will continue when new chemistry becomes available. Phytotoxicity and efficacy of labeled and experimental herbicides will be evaluated on newly established cranberry beds. Plots will be treated annually and followed through the first harvest to determine the affect of weed control on establishment and yield."

Majority of cropland is dryland and winter wheat is the major crop in this area. Diversifying crops in the farm can enhance the economic viability of producers and provide new market alternatives. Therefore, alternative crops that are suitable for dryland and limited irrigation production are important for sustainable farming in the region. Proso millet is the best alternative crop in the region due to its less water requirement and well adaptability. However, proso acreage is limited due to its primary use as birdseed and extreme price volatility in the market. Alternative use of proso millet (e.g. fuel, food) would increase its value and acreage. Because of narrow germplasm base of proso millet cultivars, genetic improvement of existing varieties and development of new proso millet variety with novel traits for new use will be critical. Camelina is an old oilseed crop newly introduced to the semiarid west of the United States and it is a promising spring-sown rotation crop in the region due to its excellent seedling frost tolerance and short-duration. A number of unique traits (e.g. low input crop, improved drought tolerance and water use efficiency, high oils ~35% content, limited culinary uses etc.) make camelina as a high-potential oilseed crops for biodiesel feedstock compared to other oilseed crops. There is limited research on developing improved camelina varieties well adapted to the western Nebraska. Annual forages are well adapted to the semiarid Northern Great Plains environments. Replacing summer fallow with annual forages may be an effective cropping system for improving soil quality and increasing economic returns. Annual legume with forage potential is desirable because it can be used as forage as well as to improve soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation but currently no such annual legume is available that is well adapted in the region. Outcomes/Impacts: It is anticipated that several new cultivars will be released from this program with improved adaptation and value for regional producers. Progress related to growth in alternative crop production in the region will be monitored by Nebraska Department of Agriculture Statistics. An ethanol-based market of proso millet has the potential to enhance the regional economy, to minimize its market volatility, and to increase wheat yield. Production of large acreage of oil-seed in the region will encourage development of local bio-diesel plant. All these efforts will help making agriculture in northern High Plains sustainable, which indirectly will sustain rural economy in Nebraska."

The integration of cultural, biological and mechanical control along with new pest resistant varieties is critical to ensure that vegetable producers remain viable. Striped cucumber beetles remain a chronic pest of squash, melons, and cucumbers. The western bean cutworm, is moving into New York and little is known about their impact on NY vegetable production. Lastly, biopesticides offer low-risk alternatives to conventional pesticides, but better formulations are needed to protect these biopesticides from environmental degradation. Outcomes : Results from the studies on striped cucumber beetle soil ecology and cultural control will be useful in the Northeast and beyond. Striped cucumber beetle is a major pest in much of the US, and insight into the underground aspects of its life cycle and possible perimeter trap crop management impacts will facilitate successful implementation of perimeter trap cropping and other cultural methods to control striped cucumber beetle in organic cucurbit crops, with reduced reliance on insecticides. The development of an effective bait-and-kill control measure for striped cucumber beetles will reduce pesticide use. Baited traps are the most efficient method of applying insecticides because there are almost no non-target effects and because mortality of target species is very high relative to the amount of insecticide used. This will minimize human and environmental exposure to insecticides. Biopesticides, attractants, and repellents offer high target specificity and low human and environmental risk. However, many are extremely susceptible to degradation by ultraviolet light. If a safe, effective formulation can be created that will protect fragile pesticides, then the door is open to development and registration of new, effective pesticides with low risk.

The development of an effective bait-and-kill control measure for striped cucumber beetles will greatly reduce pesticide usage. Baited traps are the most efficient method of applying insecticides because there are almost no non-target effects and because mortality of target species is very high relative to the amount of insecticide used.

Forage legumes can reduce annual nitrogen fertilizer requirements of grass pastures through their ability to fix nitrogen. Forage nutritive value of cool-season grass pastures has improved when forage legumes are grown in the sward because nutritive value of legumes tends to be higher than grasses. Although extensive research has been conducted on establishing, managing, and determining the pasture yield of interseeding legumes into existing pastures, it is not widely practiced in Nebraska or the Great Plains, partially because stand failures occur frequently. This project will try to determine the reasons for these failures by examining disease, insect, soil, and competition factors influencing growth and establishment of legume seedlings interseeded into existing grass sods. If this project successfully identifies factors responsible for causing stand failures of interseeded legumes, establishment techniques will be developed and producers will add legumes to many of their grass pastures. This will reduce their need for nitrogen fertilizer and also increase performance of their livestock, thereby improving profits."

Several other major U.S. dry bean producing areas have primarily converted to direct harvest. Nebraska producers, especially those with furrow irrigation, have resisted the change because of high harvest loss incurred by a few Nebraska producers who have tried direct harvest.

Comparative field studies with full size field equipment are needed to develop crop production and harvest practices that will result in acceptably low harvest loss and provide the economic and environmental benefits of direct harvest.

The U.S. Dept. of Energy (DOE) suggested that agriculture will need to contribute nearly 1 billion tons and forestry 368 million tons of biomass annually to meet the nations' needs for cellulosic biofuels. Primary biomass crops identified were corn stover, small grain straws, grains, perennial grasses (CRP and switchgrass) and woody crops. Unfortunately the DOE Roadmap report only lists woody biomass and forestry trimmings as contributions from the western region, ignoring other biomass types. The USDA Energy Plan includes annual and perennial cellulosic crops as dedicated bioenergy feedstocks nationwide. Traditionally western growers harvest annual grain crops, leaving straw residue in the field for erosion control or bale just enough for winter bedding. Perennial grasses and legumes are grazed, harvested for hay or silage, and fed to livestock. Growers are paid for higher quality hay and have learned to meet market demands through multiple seasonal harvests, even if tonnage is low. Biofuel feedstock production requires a different approach, even though many of the same crops would be grown. High amounts of cellulose, a carbohydrate based cell wall fiber, is most important in second generation biorefineries. Hemicellulose is of lower importance, although bioenergy products are also produced from this carbohydrate based cell wall component. Lignin, a non carbohydrate, is part of the biomass primary cell wall and linked to lower animal performance. However, lignin in advanced generation biorefineries is used as a bioenergy resource, primarily to produce electricity for the biorefinery. Feedstocks for advanced generation biorefineries therefore requires a different level of cell wall composition and fiber quality compared to forage for animals. This should result in fewer seasonal cuttings, higher harvestable tonnages (or higher biomass yields), reduction in costs of harvesting and equipment repairs, and provide for a stable market. The goal of this project is to provide new results and recommendations, without duplication of other western biofuel projects, to assess selection and management of dedicated cellulosic biofuel and bioenergy crops (including CRP) grown sustainably by growers for western biorefineries. Today the western region does not have a designated cellulosic commercial feedstock producing operation. Western land grant universities should accept leadership and partner with private companies and biorefineries to make this step towards energy independence possible for western growers. Expected Outcomes and Impacts: Increased collaboration and coordination of cellulosic feedstock development projects among WERA member states. Commercial production of multiple cellulosic feedstocks grown in the region. Creation of state and regional biofuel educational materials. Increased participation from grower organizations and/or bio-refiners are anticipated in biofuel grants, research projects, demonstrations and educational materials."

Successful delivery systems applicable to food fortification, particularly in meat, bakery, and beverage products, are expected to be readily scalable and commercialized.

This prompted the agricultural industry to look for alternative agronomically feasible and sustainable cropping systems. Diverse no-till continuous cropping systems were adopted by growers in the region. However, shortage of soil moisture continues to be a major limiting factor in continuous, no-till cropping systems. Winter wheat in continuous cropping systems with no fallow phase yields lower than winter wheat in the conventional fallow. Alternative crops in continuous cropping systems have not performed consistently over the years due to adverse soil moisture conditions. The relatively low crop yields along with high input costs render the cropping systems unprofitable forcing producers to look at other tools to manage no-till cropping systems. Cover crops offer a wide range of benefits including reduction in dependency on nitrogen fertilizers, prevention of wind and water erosion, weed suppression, improving water retention, and increasing soil carbon. Cover crops have not been tested for their effectiveness as substitute for conventional fallow in the drier environment of western South Dakota. Legumes fix nitrogen and introducing legume crops in cereal-based rotations may offer an opportunity to reduce fertilizer costs for growers. Research results from wheat-legume crops rotational studies show that effects of legume crops on the subsequent wheat crop vary depending on the crop, location and year. Oilseed crops in South Dakota have traditionally been used as vegetable and industrial oils, spices, and bird feed. Non-food oilseed crops targeted for the semi-arid and arid agro-ecozones of South Dakota have the potential to transform the economy of the region. Biofuel feedstock crops grown in rotation with cereal crops have potential to increase sustainability and reduce weed and disease problems. Availability of locally grown feedstocks will help to expand the oilseed based biofuel industry in South Dakota. There has been limited research done in the drier regions of South Dakota to evaluate alternative oilseed crops. Integrating annual forage crops into the predominantly wheat cropping systems using no-till technology would shorten the fallow phase in the cropping system, improve water use efficiency, and increase forage production in the region. This project will evaluate alternative cropping systems that include cover crops, legume pulse crops, oilseeds and annual forages for their effect on soil quality, soil water storage and long term productivity. We hypothesize that use of cover crops, annual legumes or short season annual forages in the rotation will improve soil moisture and soil quality, and lower demand for inorganic nitrogen fertilizers and ultimately enhance sustainability of the cropping system. Other anticipated impacts include reduction of land under fallow and diverse cropping resulting in reduction in disease and insect pests&#39; carryover from year to year resulting in reduction in pesticide usage."

Likewise, water conservation research in this area of New Mexico is critical and necessary in order to understand better and manage this threatened natural resource."

The major crops are staked tomatoes (32,400 acres), bell peppers (19,000 acres), sweet corn (45,300 acres) strawberry (6,900 acres), snap bean (37,800 acres) and potatoes (28,500 acres). Seventy percent of the Florida vegetable production is grown in South Florida counties of Collier, Hendry, Miami-Dade, Manatee, and Palm Beach with approximately 159,320 acres. Southwest Florida is an important production area in the USA for winter fresh-market tomato. The vegetable production system in Southwest Florida generally includes raised beds, soil fumigation, polyethylene mulch, and either seepage or drip irrigation. This production system has been effective in producing commercially valuable tomato yields. These cultural practices attempt to maximize economic return by maximizing productivity. Since, vegetables in Florida are grown in sandy soils with intensive use of soil fumigant and fertilization/irrigation, state and federal agencies have become concerned with issues affecting ozone layer and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) entering our environment and the impact on air and water quality. Nitrogen fertilizer management has become an environmental concern for Florida vegetable growers following the adoption by the State of Florida of vegetable BMPs [Best Management Practices, (www.floridaagwaterpolicy.com)]. BMPs emphasize the need to better manage fertilizer, increase fertilizer efficiency, and reduce N loss to the environment. Choosing which varieties to plant each year is a cornerstone of a successful vegetable industry. This variety testing program provides unbiased information about the adaptability and performance of varieties in Florida's diverse environments, thereby allowing growers to make informed decisions. Variety trials are being conducted in multiple locations (Palm Beach and Collier) and multiple seasons (winter and spring) in cooperation with David Sui (Palm Beach County Extension Services), Eugene McAvoy (Hendry County Extension Service), Crystal Snodgrass (Manatee County) and Richard Raid (UF/IFAS). Since, bell pepper varieties growth habits are changing, within row spacing should be adjusted to accommodate these new varieties."

Once identified, these can be used to move the resistance more efficiently into new varieties and in pyramid resistance genes to create varieties with more durable resistance. The outputs from this activity would be a set of high quality, high yielding, disease resistant green bean varieties that will be easier to grow and require less fungicide use than susceptible green bean varieties. In Oregon approximately 18,500 A of blue lake green beans, having a value of $21.9 million are grown each year. Eighty percent of the varieties grown in Oregon are bush blue lake varieties developed by OSU. Replacing a quarter of the acreage with an improved variety would bring in more than $5 million in revenue, not counting the savings from reduced fungicide use."

Potatoes (3rd nationally) and processed vegetables (2nd nationally) are an essential component of Wisconsin's agricultural economy with an annual value of $6.4 billion and over 35,000 jobs . Major processing vegetables include green beans and carrots (1st nationally), sweet corn (2nd), peas and potato (3rd) and significant acreages of beets, lima beans, onions and cucumbers. The continuing health and profitability of this important Wisconsin industry is dependent on its ability to remain competitive in the face of increasing national and global production. Currently, our farmers benefit from the central location of production in the US, our proximity to major population centers and a climate that is ideally suited to temperate vegetable production. In recent years, however, our climate is changing requiring increased reliance on irrigation, added costs and potential conflict with the water resource on which it depends. Simultaneously, the food industry has experienced a rapidly escalating demand from food processors and consumers for more sustainable production practices. This trend is emerging nationally as a driving force (Anonymous 2010, Food Trends, Schwartz 2010) with key vegetable end-users such as WalMart, Sysco, DelMonte, Pepsico/Frito-Lay, McCain's, McDonald's and others introducing new sustainability requirements that Wisconsin farmers must meet to remain competitive. Unfortunately, independently derived sustainability audits are inconsistent, often repetitive, rarely science-based, costly and come with no increased return to farmers. Several initiatives have emerged to generate consistent national standards or metrics but progress has been slow and national metrics are, of necessity, high-altitude and are unable to reflect regional differences in production or elicit meaningful change at a local level. This project will enable us to assemble a broad coalition of expertise both inside and outside the university that represents all segments of the food supply chain. With this support, we will develop assessments of research-based, producer-driven sustainability practices that are nationally coordinated and yet regionally appropriate and capable of driving change locally. We will build on the success and enthusiasm of a network of scientists, farmers, processors and NGOs which has developed assessment protocols for Wisconsin's 6.4 billion dollar vegetable processing industry. We will expand nationally through a series of regionally-based working groups patterned after the Wisconsin model. This framework will be developed in collaboration with an existing network of national commodity organizations that assisted in developing this proposal. We directly address the themes for sustainable practices, farm to consumer food and green payments for sustainability. The project is a key component of the USDA priority for Global Food Security and we will work with our national network to develop a NIFA proposal to implement a framework for sustainability that will be applicable to a broad range of cropping systems."

However, little data are available to show the relationship between fiber intake and health in younger children. Studies of nationally representative samples clearly indicate a large gap between the amount of fiber intake recommended and the amount of fiber actually consumed. Fruits vegetables, and whole grains represent ~80% of the dietary fiber consumed in US children; however in 3-year olds, their contribution is only ~25% because 2-3 year old children substantially under-consume whole fruits, total vegetables, legumes, and whole grains (50%, 80%, 78%, and 99% of 2-3 year olds consume less than the required minimum, respectively). Thus, children who do meet the fiber intake recommendations do so by consuming a lot of food, not by consuming a diet that is high in fiber-rich foods. Fiber consumption is differentially distributed in that minority and low-income children, who are at highest risk for obesity, consume less than population averages. In those groups, limited access might be the result of a lack of self-efficacy in parents to provide high-fiber foods and the high costs for dietary fiber. Based on public health research, there is a need for well-designed, multi-level, random controlled intervention studies with follow-up periods to increase dietary fiber provision and consumption . Issues that need to be addressed include barriers to providing high-fiber foods (cost and time of preparation), lack of access, and the child not accepting the food. We will address all of these three levels involved in dietary intake change by providing affordable high-fiber foods that are accepted by preschool-age children into their diets. These results will inform public policy efforts to improve children's diet quality and, potentially, the prevention of childhood obesity in 2-5 year old children."

Substituting a mustard crop for a pulse crop can significantly reduce the amount of herbicide used in the cropping system. Brassicaceae crops are extremely competitive with most common annual weed species, reducing the need for chemical weed control in the crop. Natural chemicals produced by Brassicaceae plant tissues also appear to provide pest control benefits that exceed those expected from an average break crop. Including Brassicaceae crops in a rotation has a number of other advantages. Increased plant available N has been measured in soils following mustard crops equal to that typically measured after a legume. Brassicaceae crops are highly drought tolerant and require less water than small grains. Although Brassicaceae species afford the aforementioned benefits with respect to agroecosystem sustainability and produce excellent quality oils for advanced biofuel feedstocks, acreages are limited by low financial returns to growers. An increased financial incentive to grow Brassicaceae oilseed crops will only occur if the oils and associated co-products command higher prices. Given the competing price of petroleum feedstocks, the value of oils produced from Brassicaceae species is unlikely to increase in the foreseeable future. Thus, the only way to develop an economically viable, regionally significant liquid biofuels industry based on oilseeds is to increase co-product value. We have chosen to focus our research efforts on developing co-products from the seed meal remaining after oil removal from the seed given that that meal constitutes 60 to 70% of the total seed weight and possesses unique chemical characteristics of potential economic value. Our approach is to focus on the unique seed meal chemistries to produce biopesticides. In addition to improving the economics of biofuel production, biopesticide development will promote and enhance organic and low input fruit and vegetable production. In so doing, this project will also contribute to the sustainability and economic viability of agroecosystems managed for fruit and vegetables."

In 2006, more acres of soybean were harvested in the U.S. (74.6 million) than acres of any other crop, including corn (70.6 million). Soybeans are produced in 31 states and 3 provinces in the eastern, central, and southern U.S and Canada, from Quebec to Florida, and Delaware to Nebraska. Given this large acreage and wide distribution, it is not surprising that soybean continues to suffer from insect pests that impact plant growth, grain quality, and yield. Whether it is a result of accumulated years in soybean production, changes in cropping practices, or global climate change, the distribution and impact of native and established pests is increasing in soybean. The populations of soil pests such as slugs, grubs, and millipedes, and foliar and pod feeders such as bean leaf beetle and stink bugs, are increasing in many regions. The distribution of other insects, such as Dectes stem borer and pyrethroid-resistant Lepidoptera (such as corn earworm), appears to be growing. Producers are encountering insect problems that they have never seen or managed. From a research standpoint, changes in pest distribution and status require greater understanding of pest biology and movement, as well as the development or modification of scouting and control methods. As in many other production systems, invasive species in particular are also an increasing issue in soybean production. In the northern U.S. and eastern Canada, the discovery of the soybean aphid (SBA) in 2000 fundamentally changed soybean insect management. SBA feeding impacts all components of yield; under heavy aphid pressure, yield differences between treated and untreated research plots may reach 50%. Outcomes/Impacts * Obj 2b. Success in classical biological control will reduce populations of, and yield loss from, SBA. A partial success could save producers tens of millions of dollars in control costs alone, with societal benefits of reduced human exposure, reduced non-target impacts from pesticide use, and slower formation of insecticide resistance. A better understanding of North American natural enemies and their conservation will have similar impacts as a partial success in importation biological control. * Obj 2c. The introduction of resistant varieties will reduce grower inputs by protecting yield and reducing outputs for insecticides. As a further result of reducing insecticide use, resistant varieties will lessen human exposure and non-target impacts, and eliminate or slow the formation of insecticide resistance. Management of SBA through the use of aphid-resistant varieties may also manage plant viruses through changes in aphid behavior. Further, host plant resistance is highly compatible with biological, cultural and chemical control of pests, and as such is a key component of soybean IPM programs."

Shorter rotations open opportunities for a bevy of pest issues. Since peanut and soybean are both legumes and have similar disease problems, it is not recommended to include them in the same rotation. When comparing the acreage of the four most relevant summer agronomic crops in GA, the combined peanut + soybean acreage must stay at a certain fraction of the combined cotton + corn acreage in order for three or four year rotations between legumes to be sustainable. Therefore, alternative cropping systems for peanut must be investigated to alleviate such pressure and be able to maintain maximized yields and profits with minimized pest incidence and costs. Wheat acreage can also affect availability of peanut acreage. A double crop of wheat followed by peanut may be possible, but this puts peanut planting beyond the recommended planting window, which interferes with other crop planting activities, and creates a risk of peanuts not reaching full maturity when cool fall temperatures set in. Research is needed to determine how to distribute available acreage with proper rotations. The availability of research-based scientific decision support tools in peanut agronomics is lacking. To maximize yields and profits and minimize losses to pest outbreaks and input costs, growers need fast answers to questions. County agents and extension specialists need data to defend or alter current recommendations to be relevant with current cultivars available, which is what this project is designed to provide, centered on four primary objectives: I. Peanut cultivar response to agronomic practices. II. Managing cover crops for improved timing and sustainability. III. Fertility and nutrition issues for peanuts and preceding or succeeding crops. IV. Long-term rotational systems for effective and efficient land utilization. The most important factors in reducing input costs are agronomic management strategies, which are often the easiest strategies to implement. In peanut production, highly influential effects on yield and pest incidence include cultivar selection, tillage management, row pattern, seeding rate, cover crop selection and management, and soil conditions/plant nutrition. However, new cultivars are released each year with varying growth habits, pod and seed size, hull thickness, fertility requirements, and vegetation characteristics, which cause different responses to various combinations of these factors. Therefore, it is imperative to test new cultivars upon release to determine those that have greatest potential for seed increase and those less likely to improve on what is commercially available. So, experiments will be conducted to maximize peanut production with minimized inputs to improve farmers' profitability based on the variables listed above."

BMSB feeds on a wide range of host plants and almost any crop with fruit can be at risk with the presence of BMSB. Crops at risk include fruits (e.g. apple, peach, pear, and berries), vegetables (e.g. tomato, pepper, and cucurbits), and field crops (e.g. corn and soybean). During the last three years, severe damage and economic losses by BMSB were observed in apple, peach, pear, corn, lima bean, soybean, and apricot throughout the Mid-Atlantic States. Specifically, high value crops are more prone to BMSB damage. Currently, insecticides are available to control BMSB (Nielsen et al. 2008) and new egg parasitoid wasps are being tested as potential natural enemies of BMSB. However, such control measures do not always provide an effective and economical BMSB control. Chemical control of BMSB has not been successful because BMSB outside of treated fields readily re-infest crops after insecticides are applied. Therefore, growers execute calendar-based insecticide spray, which is against the core concept of integrated pest management (IPM). Natural enemies of BMSB have been identified in Asian countries, but importation of the natural enemies will take multiple years to be available for growers in the United States. Although previous studies indicated that the spined soldier bug could be an important natural enemy of various stink bugs, much less attention has been given to the potential of the spined soldier bug. This project is designed to investigate the effectiveness of spined soldier bugs for controlling BMSB in fruit orchards, specifically for developing an IPM strategy by testing capability of spined soldier bugs to control BMSB and by investigating the effect of insecticides on spined soldier bugs. The results of this research will provide guidelines for growers who can utilize either biological control with spined soldier bugs or IPM with spined soldier bugs and insecticides together."

The European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis, accounts for over USD 1.85 billion in control costs and grain losses annually. In 2006, 88 percent of sweet corn acreage was treated with one or more insecticide application totaling 605,000 lbs of insecticides applied. ECB also attacks crops like sorghum, small grains, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, and peppers. The southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella, causes about USD 1 million in damage in the Western High Plains. Recently, the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis, has emerged as a corn pest in the southern U.S. Other significant stalk-boring pests include the common stalk borer, Papaipema nebris, hop vine borer, Hydraecia immanis, and potato stem borer, Hydraecia micacea. Corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea, and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, consume corn leaves, tassels, silk and kernels. In the southeastern U.S., losses attributed to corn earworm in field corn and sweet corn range from 1.5-16.7 percent, as high as 50 percent, respectively. Black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon, is the most damaging of the Corn Belt cutworm complex. Western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta, increasingly is a pest of corn ears across the north central region. The commercial release of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) transgenic corn in 1996 revolutionized corn pest management. This revolution rapidly moved corn pest management away from synthetic pesticides to biotechnology-based planted incorporated protectants. Bt technology often eliminates insecticide handling and increases the ease of planting and pest control. Seed companies continue to develop genetically-modified (GM) crops for pest protection. New GM corn hybrids have resistance to a broader range of lepidopteran and coleopteran pests. Changes in corn technology have caused major changes in the agricultural community and identified major knowledge gaps, increasing the need to reevaluate knowledge about corn pests. U.S. Bt corn acreage has increased steadily since 1996, as has the potential for resistance evolution. NC-205 Committee Research was used to develop models predicting the rates of resistance evolution and to investigate the role of refuge in preventing resistance. Recently deployed GM corn hybrids utilize multiple genes that target ECB. The IRM plan for these hybrids requires a smaller refuge of at least 5 percent. Seed mixtures (Bt and non-BT) are a new reality that assures refuge compliance, but introduces new concerns regarding movement of corn pest larvae. Models of these IRM modifications were constructed using the best information available and some assumptions to bridge data gaps. These assumptions must be tested to move them to quantified variables. Eliminating these information gaps forms the basis for several objectives of the project. The long-term goal of our research is to develop sustainable ways to manage lepidopteran corn pests. This is a high regional and important national priority."

Movement and avoidance behaviors will be evaluated using video-tracking and bioassays with lyophilized leaf tissue incorporated into artificial diet. Results of the laboratory trials will guide selection of appropriate treatments for subsequent semi-field experiments. The marker development and screening strategies used for identifying Bt resistance linkage groups in ECB will be adapted for developing molecular markers associated with behavioral adaptations in ECB. We will characterize gene flow and genetic structuring among ECB populations in Pennsylvania (PA). We will use a panel of 74 SNP markers, previously identified and verified from EST sequences, in population genetics analyses to determine the effects of potential geographic barriers on ECB gene flow separately for the pheromone races, and determine if genetic structuring is associated with host plant association in the E race. The development of laboratory tests to evaluate possible effects of stressors from GE crops involves two phases. The first phase is development of a standardized protocol for testing an orally administered test substance on a specific insect and life stage. The second phase is using these protocols to parallel test (a.k.a. ring test) the selected insect at three or more laboratories. We will take a mass-screening approach to validate EST-derived SNPs for WCR using the Illumina Golden Gate SNP assay platform. We anticipate that about 75% of the 4,111 candidate SNPs we have identified will produce a designable assay, which would translate into nearly 3,100 assays. These candidate SNPs, for which an assay can be designed, will be tested for polymorphism against samples of rotation-resistant WCR populations from Illinois and wild-type populations from Iowa. Information from the Illumina GenCall and GTS Reports software will be used to remove bad SNPs and bad samples. Complementing the genomics and bioinformatics groundwork, we will investigate Bt resistance traits by integrating structural and functional genome information. SNP markers will be used for mapping QTL studies of ECB, and population studies of ECB and WBC. Our experiments will investigate separate native resistance (NR) sources leading to differential feeding or survival of WCR larvae on roots, of WCR adults on silks, and of corn earworm (CEW) larvae on silks. For both lepidopteran and coleopteran pests, we will narrowly define chromosomal segments of the corn genome that harbor NR alleles. We will also create large sets of inbred and hybrid isolines to enable future mechanistic analysis of the effects of the NR alleles on both target and non-target insects."

Objective 3: Assess the role of processing-induced chemical or structural modifications on the individual allergens by systematically altering amino acids thought to be important in clinically-symptomatic allergic reactions. Objective 4: Develop computer models and/or determine NMR/crystal structures of native and recombinant peanut and select tree nut and legume allergens in raw and processed forms. Objective 5: Combine the structural information obtained with the empirical knowledge from Objectives 1, 2, and 3 to identify clinically-relevant allergen-antibody interactions in peanut and tree nut allergy. Objective 6: Develop processing technologies for peanut products with reduced allergenic properties. Objective 7: Develop and improve immunoassays for detection of peanut, select tree nut, and soy allergen residues before and after processing (i.e. roasting, baking into cookies, etc.). Objective 8: After establishing standardized protocols for determining threshold doses for peanut, select tree nut, and soy allergens, determine threshold (minimal eliciting) dose of reactivity for processed forms of peanut allergens and develop computational and statistical models to estimate population thresholds.Approach:   Specifically, peanuts and tree nuts will be subjected to thermal processing (i.e., roasting). New allergens or changes in allergenic properties of existing allergens due to the thermal processing will be identified by immunoassays, using serum (containing IgE antibodies) from peanut and/or tree nut allergic individuals. Proteins found to be immunologically altered by thermal processing will be purified by conventional chromatography and analyzed for alterations in size, structure, digestibility, and binding to various antibodies, including anti-Maillard reaction products and specific anti-allergen antibodies. The specific amino acid residues, thought to be modified during different processing events and to contribute to altered allergenic properties (i.e. IgE binding), will be identified. These amino acids will be identified by cloning and expression of select recombinant major allergens of peanut and tree nuts in E. coli followed by site directed mutagenesis, simulated processing and immunological analysis of previously identified IgE binding sites, specifically, sites thought to be modified by processing. Understanding the molecular basis of processing-induced alterations of allergens will guide development of processing technologies towards reduced allergenicity of nuts. This knowledge will also contribute to the development of better labeling practices and detection tools for industry and regulatory agencies resulting in better protection of consumers."

Most of our work concentrates on measuring properties of single kernels so that they can be segregated or the distribution of properties in a sample can be ascertained, versus measuring the average quality of a bulk sample. In general, the project will include the development of instruments to improve rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) measurement of grain quality at receiving stations, the development of non-destructive and rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) single-kernel sorting systems to improve post-harvest grain quality and similar systems to help grain breeders rapidly select specific traits for improved lines, and improve grain-storage and handling systems. Specific objectives are: 1. Develop sensors and methods to rapidly and accurately quantify attributes such as protein composition, starch composition, end-use quality, toxins, and micronutrients. 1.A. Develop or apply spectroscopic technologies that offer significant improvements over current technologies used to measure traits of single kernels and other biological materials. 1.B. Adapt a previously developed conductance mill for detection of live-insect infestations in wheat in other grains such as corn, rice, barley, and oats, and to dry beans, such as pinto and navy beans. 1.C. Develop procedures for rapid estimation of insect fragments in milled flour from minimally processed whole wheat. 2.Develop rapid single-kernel sorting systems to accurately remove defects such as fungal or insect-damaged grain and to isolate beneficial traits such as white wheat. 2.A. Develop high-speed, low-cost, image-based sorting systems for a variety of grains and legumes. 2.B. Develop Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) -based, single-seed sorting systems for large grains and legumes. 2.C. Investigate applications of single-kernel NIRS technology to select kernels with specific traits. 3. Develop instrumentation, sensors, and systems to improve monitoring, and management of grain storage. 3.A. Develop traceability and identity-preservation techniques for grain handling. 3.B. Develop new stored-grain packing factors for the common grains in trade with known confidence intervals for a complete range of field conditions. 3.C. Investigate insect-pest densities and commingling of insects in grain that causes the spread of an infestation from bucket elevator boots. 3.D. Develop monitoring systems for grain-storage quality management. 3.E. Develop improved, environmentally-friendly insect-pest control methods for stored grain. While the objectives of this project include pre-harvest (seeds) and post-harvest handling of grain, the work is interconnected in that the overall goal is to improve the quality of grain produced in the United States. Instruments developed to assess grain quality will be used to study how grain quality might change during storage and handling. An instrument previously developed by this group to detect insect-infested grain will be used to study the spread of insect infestations and the storability of grain based on insect population levels.Approach:   U.S. farmers grow over 15 billion bushels of corn, wheat, soybeans, and other grains annually to supply the nation and world with food, animal feed, and biofuels. A significant amount of this grain may be stored for a year or more before it is used or processed. Our goal is to improve U.S. grain quality and international competitiveness through the application of engineering principles, specifically to the areas of rapid (inspection results from at least 60 individual kernels per minute) quality measurement and in maintaining quality during storage. Much of our research concentrates on measuring the distribution of quality within samples, and on detecting traits that are present at very low levels. We propose to develop instruments to rapidly (up to 500 kernels/s) measure quality traits for inspection at the first point of grain delivery, for breeders in selecting traits for new lines, and for processors prior to grain buying or processing. We also propose to develop chemical-free technology to control insects and maintain quality during handing and storage. This research will lead to higher profits for the agriculture sector, higher-quality foods reaching consumers, and more food available for a growing world population."

Legume crops capacitate sustainable agriculture and global food security today because these plants establish two beneficial symbioses that minimize the requirement for energy-expensive and polluting N- and P-fertilizers.  Specifically, symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia supplies legumes with reduced nitrogen while symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi supplies legumes with phosphate and other growth limiting mineral nutrients. Development and differentiation of nitrogen-fixing (NF) and AM symbioses require coordinated changes in the expression of thousands of plant and bacterial or fungal genes. While tremendous advances have been made recently in our understanding of plant-microbe signaling during the early stages of the legume-rhizobia and legume-AM fungal interactions, relatively little is known about the genetic basis of later stages of symbiosis development which have a great impact on the efficacy of these symbioses for agriculture. This project establishes a Virtual Center for Symbiosis Research consisting of six groups at four organizations that are at the cutting-edge of NF and AM research and genomic, genetic, molecular and cell biology resource development for legumes. The major objectives of the project include: the systematic discovery of new genes required for NF and AM symbiosis using established resources for forward- and reverse-genetics; the development of advanced genetic resources and databases for high-throughput gene function discovery in legumes; and the development of facile resources for cell and molecular biology in Medicago. It is the hope that this project will accelerate basic discovery and contribute to knowledge and the resource base for delivering system-level models and comprehensive understanding of NF and AM symbioses in the future.This project is trans-disciplinary and requires the application of genomics, functional genomics, and bioinformatics with the classical disciplines of genetics, molecular and cell biology, and plant physiology. Strong and novel training opportunities integral to the research plan will be provided to postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students and technical staff at the Noble Foundation, the Boyce Thompson Institute and the Universities of Delaware and North Texas. All participating institutions have student outreach components that will be harnessed to maximize teaching and learning outcomes. In addition, this project will deliver genetic and molecular- and cell biology tools and databases to the legume research community. It will also strengthen collaborative links, not only among the project collaborators, but also to the legume community generally. The work will benefit society by helping to train the next generation of scientists and by helping to make agriculture more sustainable and environmentally-friendly. Vectors and transgenic and mutant seed will be maintained and distributed over the long term by the Noble Foundation's Molecular and Biological Materials Core Facility. Transcriptome data will be deposited and accessible through public repositories that include ArrayExpress Database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miamexpress), and the Medicago Gene Expression Atlas (http://mtgea.noble.org/v2/).

However, genetic improvement of soybean is beset by a lack of genetic diversity leaving soybean open to threats of pests, pathogens and abiotic stresses. This project will develop a set of tools that will allow investigators to leverage the recently released draft soybean genome sequence to exploit genetic diversity in the genus Glycine and to begin to understand the nature of species/genome diversification in the genus. Important in this process is an understanding of the cycle of polyploidization followed by diploidization found in this set of species. The specific objectives are to: 1) overlay diversity maps onto the soybean genome sequence using genomic clones from a set of phylogenetically informative Glycine species; 2) explore genome evolution in the genus Glycine at the chromosomal/sequence level to understand the polyploidy/diploidization cycle; 3) sequence targeted orthologous regions across the Glycine species in order to understand levels of linkage disequilibrium and genetic diversity that can be exploited for genetics and breeding; and 4) integrate data with other legumes which is necessary to extend its usefulness to other so-called  orphan  legumes such as common bean. The broader impacts of this project will be the development of an infrastructure that will be generally accessible by the broader legume community to exploit diversity and understand genome evolution in this economically important genus. The project will continue and expand a successful outreach program targeted toward Native American and Hispanic undergraduate institutions in the Southwest (primarily New Mexico and Arizona) to provide summer research training opportunities and further develop interactions with these faculty and students.  All project data and tools will be accessible though SoyBase at http://soybase.org/.

Known as missed, palpable breast cancer, the cause is plainly, lack of training and skill. The result is delayed diagnosis for millions of women and disease that is more extensive, painful, and costly. Poorly performed breast exams also result in unnecessarily high rates of false positive findings, which means ?detecting? disease that is not truly present. MammaCare scientists developed and standardized training and certification for nurses and physicians to perform proficient and effective breast exams. This training is taught by expert instructors who teach practitioners how to reliably detect small, suspicious breast tumors, about the size of a pea. However, this training is costly and time consuming. It cannot reach the thousands of nursing and medical students and practitioners who perform these exams. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to reduce the toll of breast cancer by giving all nurses who examine women the skill to detect the smallest, earliest signs of the disease. To do this we created a new skill-based teaching technology using high-fidelity breast models, computers and the Internet to provide practitioners with essential breast exam skills. The training is self-administered, inexpensive, and effective. Our colleagues at the Mayo Clinic found that nursing students and nurses were much more accurate in detecting breast tumors after the training than they were before receiving it. The potential benefits of this technology for millions of women are reduced medical errors, improved breast cancer screening accuracy, and a better chance for disease-free survival."

The endpoint is a specialized organ called a nodule, which is formed by the plant roots to house the bacteria. In exchange for carbon provided by the plant, the bacteria provide the plant with nitrogen from the air, allowing legumes the unique ability to grow in the absence of soil nitrogen. This project focuses on the plant's control of the symbiosis, with the genetically enabled model species Medicago truncatula as the plant host and Sinorhizobia as the bacterial symbiont. The mechanisms by which the plant regulates the number of nodules it forms will be studied. The PI has shown that regulation of nodule number occurs by way of signals that travel between roots and shoots.  Four questions about how the root and shoot signal to each other remain unanswered: What is the nodulation signal to the shoot? What perceives the signal in the shoot?What is the nature of the signal to the root? What receives the signal in the root? A combination of physiological, genetic and biochemical approaches will be employed to identify the signals and determine how they are perceived. Towards this end investigators will analyze the genes, nutrients and plant hormones involved in regulating responses to the signals.  Currently-known as well as new genes and proteins that function in this pathway will be characterized Nitrogen fertilizer is costly to produce and excessive fertilizer application is a source of groundwater pollution, making the unique ability of legumes to grow in the absence of soil nitrogen highly desirable for agriculture.  Because the nodule number regulatory pathway is also involved in root growth, the results of this project are critical to future manipulation of nodulation in agriculture and for revealing how all plants coordinate shoot and root growth.  The project will train two doctoral students and four undergraduates, while providing summer research opportunities to several high school students.  The lead investigator will engage in outreach by teaching best practices in research ethics through established university programs and disseminating the results of this project at scientific meetings and university programs targeted to the general public."

In animals, loss of control of cell division leads to cancer.  In both plant and animal differentiation, some cell types display a modified cell division cycle where the DNA is replicated without concomitant cell division, thus, increasing nuclear DNA content.  This is called endoreplication; in plants, important examples of endoreplicated cell types include cereal endosperm, cotton fibers, and nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodules in legumes.  Although endoreplication is known to be important in these critical systems, its detailed mechanism and regulation remain poorly understood.  Previous work using Arabidopsis leaf hairs (trichomes) as a model for cell differentiation demonstrated that the SIAMESE (SIM) gene encodes a cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor that suppresses mitosis during establishment of endoreplication, and defined a gene family of SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) genes found in all land plant genomes that may function similarly.   The project aims are to better define the biochemical mechanisms through which the SIM protein inhibits cell division, to test hypotheses about how the SIM protein itself is regulated, and to investigate the roles of some of the SMR genes in plant growth and development.  By illuminating the mechanisms underlying endoreplication and the coordination of cell division and cell differentiation, the project will advance the understanding of plant growth and development relevant to improvement of both traditional crops and production of biomass for biofuels.  Additionally, comparison of plant and animal cell cycle control mechanisms may give useful insights relevant to human disease.  Finally, the projected work will play a role in the education of graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students from diverse backgrounds."

Yet global changes are now altering nutrient fluxes of carbon and nitrogen that are the currency of trade between rhizobia and their hosts. In some soils, nitrogen levels have increased more than 100-fold due to pollution from fossil fuel combustion. Evolutionary theory predicts degradation of host systems that control symbiosis in such extreme settings, potentially unleashing epidemics of exploitative symbionts. This project investigates the rapid evolution of legumes and their symbionts in response to nitrogen pollution. Genetic and phenotypic analyses will resolve differences among populations in California that vary in nitrogen pollution levels and will uncover the extent and molecular mechanisms of rhizobial exploitation. This project will enhance our understanding of rhizobial symbioses, which are critical to wild plants and provide an important service to the bio-economy via enhanced crop growth and biofuel production. This project will also (i) train middle-school students and directly involve them in gathering data, (ii) develop a college course focused on the scientific method and its application to social and policy-related decisions, and (iii) initiate a microbiology-research training program that targets undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in the sciences."

An important part of this conversation between the microbe and the plant is a change in the chemical composition of proteins within the cell, i.e., in the degree by which phosphate groups are added or removed to specific amino acids. Using state of the art mass spectrometers to determine precisely which proteins are being modified by phosphate, and by how much in the first hour in which the bacteria meets the plant, the project will attempt to elucidate how the plant changes its proteins in order to initiate all of the myriad changes in their metabolism and gene expression that are required for the symbiotic nodules to form. All project outcomes (e.g., data, peptides and germplasm resources) will be provided to the public free of charge and without intellectual property restrictions.  Medicago transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome data generated in this project will be deposited and accessible to the public at long-term repositories such as National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the Legume Information Service (LIS: http://www.comparative-legumes.org/) and the PeptideAtlas (www.peptideatlas.org). The mass spectrometric technology being developed and used in this project could be useful for understanding many different biological events, besides symbiotic nitrogen fixation. In order to provide opportunities for researchers all over the U.S. to access this sophisticated instrumentation and technology for use in their research, the project will develop and hold a one-week long Plant Proteomic Workshop. To be held each summer at the University of Wisconsin, this workshop will provide two dozen participants (graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and professors) with hands-on, in-depth use of mass spectrometers for measuring changes in the proteins from plants under study in their own labs. This workshop will greatly facilitate the more widespread accessibility and use of this technology for research in the general area of plant biology, and should greatly help this country's goal of training our future plant scientists and help them become comfortable with modern genomic  systems biology  experimental techniques."

In arid regions such as Arizona and New Mexico about half of the annual total precipitation occurs during the summer monsoon season when plant growth is rapid and nutrient requirements are high.  This study will investigate how monsoon rains and plant growth impact the soil microbial community in these arid regions.  Three separate experiments will be conducted to assess how soil microbial biota is influenced by 1) timing of the water addition, 2) degree of moisture, and 3) plant growth.  Instantaneous changes in bacterial community composition are expected with watering, while a delayed response is predicted for the fungal community. In plots where moisture is withheld, changes in the structure of both bacterial and fungal communities are predicted to be less pronounced. Finally, plant removal is expected to prevent establishment of many fungal populations and some bacterial strains. Arid land ecosystems are undergoing change with grasslands being replaced by desert shrubs. Understanding how the soil microbial community responds to seasonal rains is critical to understanding organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling in desert ecosystems, which in turn, is important for understanding vegetation dynamics.  A partnership with a local Native American-serving K-8 school will allow the researchers to bring their research into the classroom, with lessons centering on the three sisters planting scheme -- a traditional Native American companion planting of corn, beans, and squash."

The  witchweeds , members of the genus Striga, are particularly devastating since their primary hosts include the major cereals (maize, sorghum, rice and millet) and grain legumes that are dietary staples worldwide. How parasitic weeds and Striga species in particular recognize their potential hosts and overcome the innate defense systems are not known. Using the interaction of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), an important food and forage legume, with Striga gesnerioides, this project seeks to identify parasite-derived effectors and virulence proteins that enter host cells, specifically altering their structure and function and suppressing the defense response mechanism at various levels, enabling infection and parasite ingress to occur. Novel, in planta functional screens will be used to identify candidate effectors from Striga that are directly or indirectly recognized by race-specific resistance proteins in cowpea leading to activation of a hypersensitive response at the point of infection and associated downstream defense responses. These functional screens are complemented by comparative transcriptome sequencing in compatible and incompatible host-parasite association and in silico analysis aimed at identifying candidate virulence effectors through race-specific gene expression signatures. The outcomes of this project will provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which parasitic angiosperms identify and parasitize their hosts and how hosts block such attack. The negative impact of parasitic plants on crop productivity increases globally each year and their potential for affecting domestic agriculture looms larger as the movement of seed resources expands globally. The outcomes of this work will contribute directly to the development of strategies to improve crop security by providing targets for manipulating pest resistance responses of crop plants. In addition these studies provide new educational, research, and training opportunities for US students on the African continent."

All organisms, from viruses to man, must synthesize proteins from their genomes by the process of protein synthesis (translation). Plant viruses are especially intriguing, as they must compete with their host cells for limited translation factors without killing the cell.  Research on plant viruses has revealed that the end of the RNA genome most distal to where translation begins (the 3' end) is a critical region for attracting components of translation to the genome, leading to substantially enhanced translation.  The 3' region of one virus with an RNA genome, Pea enation mosaic virus, was recently found to contain a translational enhancer that attracts ribosomes, the central protein synthesizing machines, and may function by helping ribosomes recycle following genome translation.  In addition, this translational enhancer also participates in a long-distance joining with another element near the other end (the 5' end) of the virus.  This project will examine how this translational enhancer interacts with ribosomes and whether ribosomes can  bridge  the ends of the viral genome by interacting simultaneously with both 3' and 5' RNA elements.  Since viral genomes cannot be replicated and translated at the same time, this research will also investigate how the virus switches between these incompatible activities.  Finally, the research will explore the possibility that the host plant's genome contains similar ribosome-binding elements that enhance translation of host RNAs.  Developing new paradigms for how the 3' region participates in translation will prompt other investigators to correctly examine their genes or viruses for 3' translational enhancers, which will be transformative in the translation field.  By understanding how these translational enhancers function, it should be possible to include them when designing new ways to produce higher levels of products in plants for improvement of agricultural traits.  Broader Impacts. This research will be conducted by graduate and postdoctoral researchers, who will learn state-of-the art techniques and model-building to enhance their development as scientists. Undergraduate researchers will also participate in all aspects of this project, learning about the excitement of scientific discoveries.  Enthusiasm for research-based discovery will continue to be conveyed weekly to Advanced Placement high school students and teachers at DuVal High School (98% minority) in Prince George's County, Maryland, with several students already benefiting by being accepted at top colleges/universities and majoring in STEM subjects.  The principal investigator will also continue to effectively represent science and scientists to the public, most recently as a consultant for a Discovery TV Series and participation in activities such as the Saturday morning science program at the University of Toledo.  Specific examples from this research will also be used to excite and enhance the education experience of students in their first year as science majors at the University of Maryland through an introductory biology course taught by the principal investigator."

Although 78% of the earth's atmosphere is diatomic nitrogen (N2), all living organisms require nitrogen but in either reduced (ammonia) or organic forms (amino acids, nucleic acids, etc.).  Nitrogen for plant growth is supplied mostly as commercial fertilizer, but the costs of fertilizer (and with it food) are increasing because synthetic nitrogen fertilizer requires natural gas for its production. Certain bacteria reduce or 'fix' N2 gas into ammonia as the starting point for amino and nucleic acid syntheses.  Nitrogen fixation is a crucial component of the nitrogen cycle, and thus essential for maintenance of the planet's nitrogen balance. This project will test members of the genus Burkholderia, recently discovered to nodulate such agriculturally important legumes as bean and cowpea, with Rhizobium strains in terms of providing fixed nitrogen to plants growing in arid, acidic, or saline soils, which will become more widespread as climate change continues. Our approach will be to inoculate legumes with Burkholderia species either singly or together with Rhizobium strains, or together with newly discovered plant growth-promoting bacteria that improve root architecture for water uptake or provide available phosphate or iron, to test for increased plant biomass, seed yield, shoot and root growth, nodule number, and nitrogen fixation ability.  Genetic tools including reporter gene fusions and mutagenesis as well as genome analysis and physiological/biochemical experimentation will be employed.  This project will provide scientific training and critical thinking skills to undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students, particularly members of groups who are currently underrepresented in STEM fields.  Our ultimate goal is to reduce our dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels by utilizing beneficial microbes that act synergistically with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to enhance plant growth and yield even on the most marginal soils."

Lanning, under the guidance of Dr. Bram Tucker, will conduct research that addresses a classic but important debate about how individuals make decisions. Are they rational, economic decision makers who, given certain constraints, carefully calculate costs and benefits or do they make decisions as social actors who are embedded in networks and structures that share low-cost, but potentially flawed, strategies? The research will be conducted among farmers in Malawi who are challenged by persistent hunger, uncertain prices for agricultural inputs, and decreasing soil fertility. Farmers are faced with decisions to invest in hybrid seeds and chemical fertilizer or to use alternatives, like planting legumes, to increase soil fertility and maintain yields. The researcher asks how variation in agricultural behavior among Malawian farmers is explained by (1) economic and environmental constraints, (2) ethno-agricultural knowledge of cause and effect, (3) attitude towards risk, or by (4) a farmer's use of decision-making short cuts such as just imitating what other farmers in their social networks do. The project will begin with a census recording basic demographics and the slope (flat, gentle, steep) of a farmer's primary maize field. A sample of farmers from the census, capturing variation in field slope, will participate in field mapping and semi-structured interviews, focused on economic and environmental constraints. An historical matrix exercise will explore perceptions of agricultural cause and effect relationships, while a small-stakes choice experiment will measure attitudes towards risk. Social network analysis will be used to examine the interactions with and influence of prestigious and successful farmers in each network.  This project contributes to the development of decision-making models that unravel the degree to which ecological/economic variables versus social variables influence behavior. Revealing the determinants to investment in agriculture may be instrumental in the design of strategies that promote behaviors that maintain yields while preventing environmental decay or exacerbation of social and economic inequality."

Biological nitrogen fixation also makes legumes key components of both natural and agricultural systems because they return vital nitrogen to the environment. This project will extend existing knowledge of how legumes and their symbiotic bacteria establish this unique partnership, in particular by bridging traditional genetic methodologies with specialized tools that the investigators have developed for protein biochemistry and cell biology. The outcome of these studies will be increased understanding of a critical phase in symbiotic development, namely the period during which legumes select efficient symbiotic bacteria from the soil environment. In particular, the proposed research will identify new genes and proteins that underlie symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Knowledge of symbiotic nitrogen fixation has great relevance to agricultural systems, because US agricultural is highly dependent on input nitrogen, which for non-legumes involves consumption of fossil fuels to drive conversion at atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to fertilizer nitrogen. The fact that legumes produce fertilizer nitrogen directly, using solar energy obtained through photosynthesis, makes them key components of cost-effective, carbon-neutral, sustainable agricultural systems. Increased understanding of symbiotic development will enhance our ability to constructively manipulate this vital biological process. The anticipated broader impacts of this work include training of  graduate students, and students will participate in an active international collaboration with scientists in the Republic of Korea through the Korean Rural Development Administration."

This proposal is in direct response to thatneed and will support a State laboratory's full participation within the FERN ChemistryCooperative Agreement Program (cCAP). This participation includes instrumentation, training,method enhancement activities and analysis of surveillance samples. The Department ofAnalytical Chemistry at The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) has a 115year history of food safety research and over the last five years as a cCAP laboratory, hasdemonstrated the expertise and analytical capacity required to meet FERN goals. The currentproposal is divided into four distinct project areas, all of which are inherently flexible dependingon Forensic Chemistry Center (FCC) and FERN National Program Office (NPO) input: (1) The use of Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) for the analysis ofunknown compounds in foods. We have used GC-MS to detect melamine in food productsfrom China and pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables. We have enhanced the FDA FERNT021 methodology by developing the use of a Programmed Temperature Vaporizing (PTV) inletfor the GC-MS. In this proposal we look to continue our advances with this methodology bylooking at new toxins and poisons, by expanding to new matrices such as alcohol and seafood,and to explore the potential use of Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) with GC-MS. (2) The use of Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) for the analysis ofunknown compounds in foods. We have used LC-MS to analyze toxins in surveillancesamples and pesticide residues in produce, as well as honey bee related matrixes. We haveadded new toxins to the FDA FERN T022 method and evaluated many matrixes. We proposethe use of new chromatography columns to expand the capabilities of the FERN methodologyand also to expand to additional matrices such as alcohol and seafood. (3) The use of Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for theidentification of toxic metals in foods. Our elemental experience has ranged from thedetermination of lead in maple syrup to cadmium in fish tissue to nanoparticles in vegetables.We have used the FERN methods for the analysis of food surveillance samples. We propose tofurther enhance methodology by optimizing the High Matrix Introduction accessory for the ICP -MS. We also propose to use LC prior to elemental analysis instrumentation so as to speciatemetals and separately analyze multiple oxidative states. (4) The use of Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the identification oftoxins in foods. We have used ELISA methods for surveillance samples, proficiency tests, andto determine peanut allergens in foods. We evaluated Tetracore Ricin kits and are developingtechniques for Abrin analysis. We propose to use ELISA kits and lateral flow devices (LFDs)for matrixes specified by FDA as well as studies on the rosary pea, the source of Abrin.

The expression of Npt2a at the apicalmembrane is a critical regulatory step because the level of expression and function of Npt2a is the primaryregulator of total body phosphate homeostasis. VA-funded research from this laboratory had revealed that theabsence of NHERF-1 in a model of proximal renal tubule, OK (opossum kidney) cells, resulted in a markeddecrease in Npt2a expression. The decrease in expression was due to two factors 1) decreased transcriptionof Npt2a, and 2) decreased trafficking of Npt2a to the apical membrane. The mechanisms for the faultytrafficking of Npt2a have not been determined and are the subject of this proposal. Npt2a translated in theNHERF-deficient cells (OK-H) lacked a critical post-translational modification, glycosylation. These proteins,instead of trafficking to apical membrane, accumulated in a perinuclear location. Inefficient apical membranelocalization had previously been described in a mouse lacking expression of NHERF-1. Expression of aNHERF-1 construct that lacked a normal PDZ-2 domain did not allow trafficking of Npt2a to the apicalmembrane. NHERF-1 is a multiple PDZ domain protein which interacts with multiple signaling molecules andtransporter proteins. A role for the PDZ-2 domain in Npt2a regulation had not been observed previously.Finally, inhibition of SNARE (SNAP Receptor) protein interaction using a competing peptide introduced into OKcells blocked insertion of Npt2a into the apical membrane, demonstrating that Npt2a is transported to theapical membrane via a vesicular transport mechanism. The preliminary data suggested the hypothesis that NHERF-1 is essential for the forward trafficking ofNpt2a from site of synthesis to the apical membrane. First, the role of the post-translational modificationsglycosylation and phosphorylation on Npt2a apical membrane trafficking will be examined by determining thecellular localization of transfected Npt2a constructs lacking the motifs required for these post translationalmodifications in a cell culture model. The glycosylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination states of Npt2a willbe compared in NHERF-replete and NHERF-deficient OK cells and in wild type and NHERF-1 knock outmouse proximal tubule cells. The effect of inhibitors of glycosylation on the intracellular localization of Npt2awill be determined. Second, the intracellular site or sites of interaction between NHERF-1 and Npt2a will beanalyzed. Forward trafficking of Npt2a labeled by a GFP tag and by S35 methionine in OK cells and OK-H cellswill be slowed by culture at 20 C. Analysis of Npt2a localization by confocal imaging, density centrifugation,and immunoelectronmicroscopy will be performed at sequential time points until the proteins are detected asbiotinylated forms, indicating appropriate insertion into the apical membrane. Trafficking of Npt2a in the twocell culture models will be compared. Proteins associated with Npt2a at each time point will be determined byimmunoprecipitation and proteomic analysis. To define which steps in the forward trafficking are NHERF-dependent, Npt2a trafficking will be compared in NHERF-replete and NHERF-deficient cells under conditionsof traffic arrest: ezrin deficiency, inhibition of SNARE interaction, and CLC-5 (intracellular chloride channelCLC family isoform 5) deficiency. Third, the sites on Npt2a and NHERF-1 critical for the NHERF-1 effect onNpt2a trafficking will be determined by mutational analysis of both proteins followed by both in vitro analysis ofprotein interaction and assessment of intracellular interaction by FRET methodology. These studies will define where NHERF-1 acts in Npt2a forward trafficking, define the sites on bothproteins responsible for their interaction, and yield mechanistic insights for this unique functional process."

Population pressure has led to continuous cultivation of the land without crop rotation. This system results in a decline in soil fertility and high disease inoculum in the soil, specifically, bean root rot fungi and root-knot nematode. Our long-term goals are to use organic matter (compost and biochar) to reduce the incidence and severity of soil borne fungal diseases and plant-parasitic nematodes and improve soil health; improve legume inoculants (strains and carriers) to increase yield, BNF and the protein content of common bean, and build capacity by training participants on how to prepare compost, how to use farm-scale, biochar producing stoves and how to use the resulting biochar and compost to suppress plant diseases, improve soil health, and increase nodulation and N fixation in beans. Our approach will be to produce biochar-based inoculants, amend soils with biochar and compost we develop and evaluate their efficacy in on-farm trials with farmer cooperators. Small-holder farmer networks established by Univ. of Nairob, IITA and Cornell will be engaged. Measurement variables will include bean yields, nodulation, nitrogen fixation, fungal disease incidence and root galling. Simple pictorial guides to evaluate nodulation and nematode galling will be used, so that farmers can assess their own outcomes in these trials and in the future. We expect to advance knowledge on the interactions between biochar/compost and key bean diseases and pests and the efficacy of selected biochars/composts in their control; gain knowledge on the longevity of observed effects to guide timing of further amendments; and expect several publications to emerge from this work. We expect bean yield to increase and yields to become more reliable. In addition to yield improvement, improved N content will enhance family nutrition. We anticipate rapid farmer adoption, once disease control efficacy is shown, but also due to anticipated synergistic effects of enhancing and improving nitrogen fixation, thus improving nutrient content of beans. We will build capacity by training Master Farmers as a key dissemination tool. We will train four PhD and two MSc Kenyan students to carry on work in this area. Capacity of University of Nairobi to address key issues constraining bean yields for small-holder farmers will improve. Training materials developed will continue to be built upon as more knowledge becomes available. Our vision of success is that we begin to turn the tide on bean disease pressure and soil degradation by use of organic matter amendments; encourage more widespread inclusion of beans in cropping systems to improve soil quality and family nutrition; help farmers achieve greater agronomic success, higher yields and more reliable return on their investments in bean cropping and; increase research and extension capacity to help small scale farmers address constraints to bean production sustainably."

Coupled with the genome sequence, an efficient transformation system will accelerate genomic approaches to improve this important crop. Our goal is to establish a reproducible transformation protocol for common bean using Agrobacterium-mediated method. Our hypothesis is that half seeds or cotyledonary nodes of common bean can be used as target explants for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and organogenesis for regeneration. We will focus our efforts on Agrobacterium-mediated method as transgenic events generated by this method usually provide low transgene insertion in the genome, which is more desirable for researchers. Iowa State University's Center for Plant Transformation has extensive experience providing genetic transformation services (corn, soybean, rice and Brachypodium) to public researchers around the world. We expect to develop a robust and publicly-available bean transformation technology. This new technology will accelerate gene discovery, marker development, and identification of new traits in a crop that has been extremely difficult to improve using standard breeding approaches."

Beans are the major staple for millions in East Africa and the crop is particularly valuable to women farmers and homemakers both as a food source and a source of revenue. A major threat to maintaining or expanding bean production in these countries is the high occurrence of soil borne plant pathogens that attack the bean crop, reduce yields and quality of the harvestable bean pods and seeds. Available land resources, tight rotations, and susceptible varieties, limit the ability of small land holders in Rwanda and Uganda to meet consumption needs or take advantage of beans as a cash crop.

Root and crown rot diseases cause severe yield losses and are especially problematic in areas with too little or too much water. The narrow genetic base of commercial bean varieties also contributes to lower yields. A number of soilborne pathogens within different species of fungi and Oomycetes are the primary causes of root rots. This proposal addresses research for broadening the genetic base of beans and identifying the predominant causal agent(s) by rapid unbiased methods. Additionally, epidemiological information on the pathogens that has been lacking and has hindered progress in breeding for root/crown rot resistance will be obtained. We will employ approaches such as multi-site field evaluations of a nursery of parental candidates from diverse areas of the world and with multiple disease resistance, molecular marker assisted selection, and next generation DNA sequencing methods to identify the problem pathogens. Practical interventions will be transferred to the stakeholders by local scientists with innovative web based approaches such as Legume ipm PIPE. A unique combination of plant pathologists, breeders, and soil scientists with agronomic backgrounds and expertise in innovated DNA technology will be engaged in both research and training scientists to strengthen the human resource capacities within Zambia and Mozambique. The proposal participants will disseminate methodologies and germplasm outputs to other African research networks and institutions in the private and public sectors. Improved bean yields and increased availability of this highly nutritious source of protein and other health benefits will be outcomes of this research. Expected Outcomes: 1. Release of germplasm and pre-variety lines of dry bean with root rot resistance and resistance against other diseases in Zambia and/or Mozambique. 2. One or more molecular markers associated with root rot resistance will be available with markers for other traits to use in marker assisted selection breeding. 3.

However, yields are often only 20% of bean yield potential due to diseases and other factors. Plant genetic engineering can overcome disease losses by introducing durable resistance genes into transgenic bean cultivars. As more common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are consumed than any other legumes, it is the species of choice for improvement via genetic engineering. Likewise, genetic transformation using Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a preferred approach due to precision, low copy number, and defined integration of foreign genes. We will develop a reliable Agrobacterium-based transformation protocol for common bean and test several antimicrobial genes in transgenic bean lines for resistance against targeted fungal pathogens. Specific objectives of this project are, to establish a reliable Agrobacterium-based transformation system, generate independent transgenic bean lines expressing seven different types of antimicrobial proteins, and to screen the transgenic lines for resistance against soilborne fungal pathogens. A reliable common bean transformation system offers avenues for quick and targeted development of the next generation of improved genotypes able to mitigate negative effects of diseases, drought and other adverse growing conditions. Development of a reliable Agrobacterium based transformation protocol and disease resistant transgenic bean lines are two deliverable outcomes of this project.

Biological nitrogen fixation-in which legumes in symbiotic relationship with bacteria known as rhizobia capture atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into a form available to plants-is the major source of new nitrogen in organic agriculture. Composts or animal manures are used in conjunction with legumes to provide the remaining complement of major and minor nutrients. Legumes can provide as much as 300 pounds/acre of nitrogen, although 80-150 pounds/acre is more common. In addition to fixing nitrogen, leguminous cover crops serve multiple functions in organic farming systems. The functions we hear mentioned most often by organic growers are: 1) build soil organic matter 2) suppress weeds, 3) provide habitat for beneficials, 4) suppress disease, 5) improve soil tilth, 6) reduce nitrate leaching, and 7) reduce soil erosion. To increase the probability that a cover crop can achieve these multiple functions, organic farmers often plant mixtures that combine legumes with non-nitrogen-fixing plant species. Grasses, for example, are usually more effective for weed suppression and reducing soil erosion, while brassicas excel at capturing nitrate to reduce leaching losses, particularly in sandier soils. A major challenge faced by farmers who rely on biological nitrogen fixation as the chief source of nitrogen additions is determining how to optimize the process to meet cash crop nutrient requirements while also managing cover crops to deliver other key benefits. The long-term goal of this project is to develop guidelines that can be used by organic farmers to select the best cover crops for grain and vegetable production systems in the northeast. We will pursue questions about how organic management regimes and the resulting soil legacies interact with plant and microbial species to regulate biological nitrogen fixation and other nitrogen cycling processes that govern crop production and environmental impacts. Our approach combines on-farm research with field station experiments, farmer directed cover crop trials, and a suite of integrated outreach activities. The proposed project targets five goals: 1. Conduct research in organic and conventional farms to determine the impact of long-term organic management and specific practices on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental services. 2. Characterize cover crops in terms of a variety of attributes that impact crop production and environmental services. 3. Improve the Denitrification-Decomposition model to simulate N2O emissions from organically farmed landscapes in the Northeastern US. 4. Engage in outreach activities with organic farmers and policy-makers to optimize environmental services in organic farming systems and develop metrics/tools that can be used to implement policies rewarding farmers for these services. 5. Develop and test a course that trains the next generation of agricultural scientists in how to conduct collaborative, agroecological, on-farm research."

Organic farming systems enhance soil quality and biodiversity, but data on their impact on environmental outcomes are lacking. Here we propose to fill this knowledge gap by evaluating the impact of a novel combination of no-till, multi-functional cover crops, and organic amendments as tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O) and NH3 volatilization, increase carbon sequestration and N and P accumulation, reduce nutrient losses by soil erosion and leaching, increase soil food web structural and functional diversity, increase energy flow in soil ecosystems, decrease weed and insect pressure, and enhance natural biocontrol activity in a corn-soybeans-spelt rotation on long-term organic farms and transitioning experimental plots fully equipped with run-off and leaching facilities.

In systems where N fertilizer can be replaced or offset with N from biological N fixation (BNF), GHG can be significantly reduced through decreased fossil fuel based inputs and reductions in GHG emissions from fields. Furthermore, increased soil C sequestration and resulting improvements in soil health also result in greater yield stability in an uncertain climate. We address two Challenge Area Goals: Climate change mitigation and adaptation and the Program Priority Area of food and fiber production systems, with a focus on legumes. The over-arching goal is to reduce use of Haber-Bosch N though increased adoption of green manures. A second, related goal, is to expand the provision of ecosystem services from annual cropping systems by increasing N-use efficiency, reducing N losses, and enhancing soil health to mitigate potential stresses anticipated with climate change (e.g., drought frequency, increased rainfall intensity, etc.). We identify three inter-related requirements for increasing reliance on BNF in agriculture: i) cropping systems that respond to contemporary socioeconomic and ecological demands, ii) ecosystem modeling at a range of scales to analyze tradeoffs and measurement of performance, and iii) institutional analysis and design that can support sociotechnical transitions. Our multi-disciplinary, integrated research approach combines on-farm research quantifying N2O fluxes, controlled plot experiments for optimal ecosystem services, analysis of the agricultural policy process, and deliver findings to key players in the policy dialog."

Next is the development of regionally-appropriate, whole-farm, and crop-specific sustainability metrics, while also giving attention to potential barriers to grower adoption of these tools. On-farm trials and field research will test credibility for sustainability claims relative to environmental and economic impacts in Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin.

Re-integrating livestock into diversified organic farming systems could enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of organic production in semiarid environments. Based on inputs from our advisory board, we have developed this regional research/extension/education project to evaluate integrated animal and crop production systems. This redesigned system replaces tillage with targeted sheep grazing to terminate legume cover crops, manage crop residues, and reduce weed, insect, and pathogen pressures. Advantages of the proposed system include reduced soil erosion, enhanced pest control, improved soil quality, enhanced nutrient cycling, and diversification of the economic base of the organic enterprise. This systems-level study combines on-farm research with information gathered in controlled experimental plots to increase our knowledge-base in the areas of crop production, animal health, holistic pest management, and economics. We will deliver our results through field days, news releases, technical bulletins, stakeholder and professional presentations, and web-based outlets. We will develop training opportunities and educational resources on sustainable organic agriculture for undergraduate and graduate students, and elementary and secondary rural schoolteachers.

This means that without an active lima bean industry, vegetable processors would move out of this area, taking with them at least 500 jobs. Lima bean production is on the rise in the MAR, while it is declining in the rest of the United States due to economic forces. However, difficulties in controlling diseases that plague this particular crop are economically limiting in the MAR. Such diseases include those caused by fungi and fungal-like pathogens, as well as an animal pathogen, a small worm called a Root-Knot Nematode, which is an escalating concern on lima beans in the MAR. One of these pathogens alone (downy mildew) destroyed half of one years the lima bean crop in Delaware and Maryland, resulting in a $3,000,000 loss. For many years, researchers at University of Delaware and University of Maryland have worked with lima bean growers and processors on certain aspects of controlling these diseases, however a comprehensive plan for generating and fostering more economically efficient and environmentally friendly pest management practices had yet to take shape. Our project goals are to develop these practices and strategies to tackle these pressing concerns, and then to implement these practices in the field and teach the growers and processors how to use them. We have a structured, yet flexible time-table that will allow us to obtain feedback from the growers as we move through the project, at the beginning, middle and end stages.

A class of proteins (termed RXLR effectors) has been identified as being key for the pathogens ability to infect the host. These proteins are secreted from the pathogen and enter the host cell where they modify cell physiology. This system is further complicated by the fact that it is genetically diverse and readily utilizes sexual recombination to maintain its diversity in US fields. By determining what genes are turned on within both the host and pathogen during infection (and by doing this across many unique genetic variants in the pathogen) we can understand what genes within the pathogen are important for infection and how genetic variations between isolates effect the plant responses. This knowledge can then be used to guide breeding choices when developing strains of plant that are resistant to the pathogen."

Objective 2: Analyze replication of Tomato spotted wilt virus in the plant host and thrips vector through quantification of replicative forms of the virion during infection. Objective 3: Quantify the aster yellows phytoplasma load in the leafhopper, determine the relationship of AYp load to successful transmission of disease to the carrot host, and use this information to improve detection of the aster yellows phytoplasma in the insect under field conditions.Approach:For Objective 1: Our initial microarray analysis identified approximately 1200 genes that are regulated by GacS/GacA. During this project period, we will analyze the affect of bacterial growth conditions on gene expression including varying pH, iron availability and liquid vs. solid media. High quality RNA will be prepared using our standard bacterial protocol. RNAs will be used to probe commercially available genomic expression arrays containing oligo DNA markers for all 3,840 genes within the B728a genome. The vendor performs standardized hybridization protocols, with the chip data processed by the SY using proprietary software. Changes in gene expression will be confirmed using real-time RT-qPCR. Genes that show differential expression under the various growth conditions will be mutated and their effect on plant virulence determined.For Objective 2: We developed real-time RT-qPCR primers to quantify the total RNA species produced by Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). We will use primers specific to non-coding regions to determine the amount of virion and virion complementary RNA. The mRNAs of TSWV are capped but not poly(A) tailed. We will use methods that specifically enrich capped mRNA to distinguish between the mRNA, virion RNA, and virion-complementary RNA produced by TSWV infection. The viral RNA will be quantified by real-time RT-qPCR using our standard protocols. Expression of TSWV mRNAs during plant infection will be compared to the expression of these RNAs during infection of the insect vector, thrips. The virus is only acquired by 1st instar larval thrips. We will quantify TSWV replication and gene expression in populations of larval and adult thrips.For Objective 3: We will use primers to two aster yellows phytoplasma (AYp) gene sequences and an aster leafhopper (ALH) gene sequence as a target for amplification of the aster leafhopper chromosomal DNA. The presence of phytoplasma in plant and insect tissue extracts will be detected using traditional PCR or nested PCR reactions. AYp copies per insect will be determined with both AYp specific primer pairs using real-time qPCR. We will also determine AYp copies per cp6 chromosomal marker to access the utility of using a chromosomal marker instead of copies per insect as standardization. Our objectives are to measure the increase of AYp copy number in ALH over time, examine AYp copy number differences between male and female insects, and determine the phytoplasma levels required for successful AYp transmission. For transmission analysis, ALH will be given a 48-hour acquisition access period on an AYp-infected Chinese aster (Callistephus chinensis) followed by transfer to rye seedlings to allow for the propagation of the phytoplasma within the leafhoppers. Leafhopper individuals will be clipped to healthy aster plants and given a 24-hour inoculation access period (IAP). Disease will be assessed visually on individual aster plants at 20 and 30 days post-IAP and aster petioles will be assayed for the presence of AYp by nested PCR. A positive detection in the aster plant will relate directly to a positive transmission by an ALH."

Isolated dietary fibers may not be as effective as intact sources dietary fiber, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Many components of a plant-based diet may reduce risk of developing chronic diseases, not just dietary fiber. These include phytochemicals such as antioxidants, phytoestrogens, phytic acid, protease inhibitors, saponins, among others. Thus, a healthy diet does not just include isolated dietary fiber, but the other protective components in plants. To define a desirable intake of dietary fiber we cannot just state the necessary total intake of dietary fiber each day, but must consider the source of the dietary fiber and the associated substances. Little progress has been made on increasing dietary fiber intake in this country, despite the addition of fiber to foods and supplements. Dietary fiber intake remains at about 14 grams per day. The 2002 Dietary Reference Intakes support a fiber intake of 14 grams per 1000 kcalories, or 25 grams per day for women and 38 grams per day for men. Many consumers find high fiber diets unacceptable and would prefer to get their fiber needs from fiber supplements, such as inulin and resistant starch that are easily added to processed foods and drinks. Yet little research has been conducted on these novel sources of dietary fiber and proposed labeling regulations will require novel dietary fibers to show physiological effectiveness before they can be listed as fiber sources on food labels."

Farm revenue could be greatly increased by lowering production costs, obtaining higher yielding cultivars and by expanding the world market. Among the options to growers for remaining competitive are to lower production costs, increase yields (assuming increased market sales), or obtain higher prices through value added traits or specialty markets. To assure continued profitability of the peanut industry, there is a need to decrease yield losses resulting from diseases and insects, decrease input costs for fungicides and insecticides, and increase yields. Despite large expenditures for pesticides, equipment, and labor, U.S. production continues to experience over 39% losses annually due to diseases and insects. Furthermore, safety and environmental concerns have resulted in more stringent federal environmental regulations and have limited the number of pesticides available to the North Carolina grower. Increases in production costs continue to surpass yield gains, and to remain competitive, growers need to lower expenses. One method of lowering production costs is to develop higher yielding, pest-resistant cultivars. Utilizing closely related species to A. hypogaea will be important for making significant progress in breeding for many disease resistances in peanut. However, ploidy level differences between species and/or genomic incompatibilities restrict gene introgression. Developing efficient methods for transferring desirable genes from the wild to cultivated species and selecting favorable agronomic traits in advanced generation hybrids has been difficult and rarely accomplished, in large part because of infrequent genetic recombination. Extensive cytogenetic and molecular information will be needed to effectively manipulate Arachis species and exploit their genetic potentials. For other traits, such as leaf spot and Sclerotinia blight resistance, there is a large amount of variability within and among cultivated species, but none that have low enough levels to produce cultivars that do not need significant amounts of chemical control. Thus, developing improved cultivars for this trait may require use of genetic resources outside the genus Arachis. For the peanut producer in North Carolina to remain competitive, new and innovative approaches must be applied to create cultivars which will increase profitability at the farmer level. Both conventional breeding approaches and molecular technologies will be needed to achieve these goals."

Plant pathologists who have directed the Center's long-time Vegetable Pathology program have all placed strong focus on diseases caused by fungi and oomycetes. Broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, cucumbers, green beans, and green peas, and squash dominated the processing vegetable acreage of the past. Now, fresh market specialty potatoes (red, purple, yellow, and white cultivars) and certified seed potatoes comprise the largest part of the region's vegetable crop base. Due to the value-added traits of meeting fresh market or seed potato certification standards, both of these types of potatoes command a higher price than the Russet type potatoes grown in eastern Washington which are destined for processing. The same is true for tomato where consumers pay premium prices for nutritious, high quality, disease-free fruit sold during direct market sales. Over the years, the vegetable disease control measures that have been utilized have been fairly standard (crop rotation, cultural practices, fungicide applications, host resistance, sanitation, and soil fumigation). However, traditional plant disease control practices are becoming more and more difficult to implement. Alternative approaches in vegetable disease management for the region need investigation. Practices such as directed low-dose fungicide applications, disease forecasting, growing crops in high tunnels, soil flooding, using biodegradable mulches, and vegetable grafting are not widely employed, but are worthy of investigation. Ways in which public welfare or scientific knowledge will be advanced: Since its inception, this program has strived to develop a comprehensive research and extension program that has flexibility; provides research-based answers for practical as well as fundamental questions; focuses on integrated approaches in plant disease control; utilizes new research techniques and applications when possible; and, delivers information promptly and effectively. Further, since 2000 the program has played a key role in developing WSU's Vegetable Pathology Team which has now expanded to PNW-VEG (Pacific Northwest Vegetable Extension Group). Leadership by the program on the USDA SCRI SREP project, Biodegradable Mulches for Specialty Crops Produced Under Protective Covers, also has had strong research and extension components. Likewise, the program has received funding from The Nature Conservancy (a non-traditional agricultural research funding source) on Field Flooding for Soilborne Potato Pathogen Control. All program personnel have a long history of interacting with growers and agricultural organizations, providing a wide variety of extension activities and written materials, participating in field days, presenting at workshops, and utilizing websites. In addition, the program has published numerous scientific journal articles and technical reports and abstracts as well as contributed to many scientific meetings."

J.",,,078592789,TEXAS A &amp; M UNIVERSITY,LUBBOCK,TX,79409,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2012,,,"Crop and forage production in the Southern Great Plains continues to be challenged by abiotic and biotic stresses that limit yield and profitability. Although commodity prices have risen substantially in recent years, input costs have also climbed and profitability has not improved. Growers need to have more crop options, particularly genotypes of alternative, vegetable, or specialty crops, in order to optimize profitability. Possible alternatives include the vegetable crops that have a higher per acre return. Another alternative is to refine the production of dual-purpose crops so that growers can make in-season decisions that optimize profitability. Although research comparing performance of varieties among the major crops such as soybean, corn, and wheat are prevalent, there are much fewer data that compare vegetable varieties for yield and quality in the Southern Great Plains. Potential vegetable crops for the southern Great Plains include seed legumes, specialty oilseed grains, root-type crops, and leafy greens. Because fertilizer nitrogen applications are costly and have environmental consequences, seed legumes, such as pigeonpea and edamame (vegetable soybean for the fresh market), offer an obvious solution. Secondly, winter grain alternatives for winter wheat in the southern Great Plains are also needed and safflower has recently shown promise but most the data are from elsewhere. Root-type crops offer a third alternative, especially for the winter season. The fourth cropping category with promise in the Southern Great Plains is leafy greens. For edamame, a mechanical one-row harvester was introduced to improve pod harvest in the early 1990s and later, a stationary pod stripper was introduced used to eliminate pod removal by hand for situations where a mechanical harvester is unavailable. To address the dearth of yield and quality data for vegetables in the Southern Great Plains, we plan to conduct research with seed legumes, winter oilseeds, root-type crops, and leafy greens. Growth variables, insect data, water use, yield, quality, and storage longevity will be determined. Taken together, this wide set of alternatives and accompanying physiological data will lead assist in variety and management select and will ultimately prove valuable for this region's vegetable producers."

A.",,,627797426,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,RIVERSIDE,CA,92521-0001,UNITED STATES,,,10.203,2012,,,"Plant parasitic nematodes cause significant losses in production and quality of field and vegetable crops worldwide. These losses occur in both subsistence and highly mechanized agricultural systems. Effective management practices for nematodes can increase productivity of land and growers' income, improve quality of food and fiber and give more uniform emergence, growth and maturity of crop plants. Over the last fifty years, nematode management has been based primarily on the use of soil-applied nematicidal agents that either kill nematodes or inhibit their parasitic ability. However, a major shift away from the use of these pesticides is occurring because of problems associated with human health and environment risks, and the prohibitive cost structure of developing new nematicides and of using currently available nematicides in many low cash value production systems. Future use of nematicides will require a more judicious use of the pesticide through integration with other control strategies. Through better understanding of the ecology, biology and pathology of known or suspected nematode pathogens of plants, non-chemical management strategies may be made more effective and, where suitable, might be integrated with existing or modified nematicide use in a broad based management program. Currently the best alternative controls in field and vegetable crops are based on host plant resistance that protects both the resistant crop and the following susceptible crops in annual rotations. Natural host plant resistance is a major resource in agriculture for developing nematode management tools and programs. The potential for resistance has been achieved in some crops and situations but not in many others, reflecting that only a small portion of natural host plant resistance has been utilized. The approach in this project is to identify, analyze and implement host plant resistance traits to the root-knot nematodes, the most broadly damaging nematode parasites of crop plants. We will identify new sources of resistance in wild and domesticated plant germplasm, with emphasis on cotton, dry grain legumes (bean crops), and carrots. The resistance genes will be analyzed and mapped within the plant genome and molecular markers developed for use in resistance selection by plant breeders. This approach enables different genes to be stacked into improved crop varieties. Advanced breeding lines and new varieties will be studied in crop rotations to assess their effectiveness for protecting against nematode crop losses. Identification and characterization of resistance genes in crop plants will lead to more effective and safe approaches to managing root-knot nematodes by developing resistant varieties. The use of the resistance in crop production systems is aided by understanding the number, combinations and specific types of resistance that will be most effective. Optimal crop protection and durability of resistance are advanced by determining the most efficient ways of deploying resistant cultivars in cropping systems."

In order to ensure a healthy and plentiful food supply, it is critical that we understand the natural means which plants use to protect themselves and thereby ultimately produce food and fiber for humans to use. This project is designed to identify some of the natural genetic and biochemical mechanisms that are important for plant defense. We will measure how the expression patterns of some genes change after plants are exposed to stresses, such as high salt, high temperature, and insect pests. This information should aid us in developing molecular markers, based on DNA sequences, that will be useful for plant breeders who are actively developing improved crop varieties. We will use sensitive techniques for measuring the levels of specific plant compounds, which have been suggested as perhaps important in defense against pests. In addition to these DNA-based molecular techniques, and the analytical chemistry techniques, we will take advantage of the spectrum of genetic diversity among plants by screening multiple varieties of plants for their growth performance when they are subjected various stresses. Much of our work on environmental stress will focus on crops that are important throughout the U.S., such as soybean and rice. Our project on defensive compounds will be centered on a legume plant called Medicago truncatula. This plant species is useful because it has a broad genetic background, it is a legume that requires very little nitrogen for growth, and because it produces a broad array of complex anti-microbial and anti-insect compounds. Our ultimate goals in this work are to be able to apply the information gained to use the naturally occurring plant-defense mechanisms to produce improved crop varieties. Ultimately, this would result in a better understanding of plant biology and potentially in a reduced need for chemical pesticides. As many farmers need to increasingly contend with higher levels of salt in their soils and with increased air temperatures, it will become more important that we develop plants that are able to survive in harsh conditions."

The rapid increases in chronic diseases and obesity in the US are attributed in significant part to unhealthy dietary choices and patterns. Yet, our understanding of the determinants of food preferences, choice and intake and other diet-related consumer behaviors continues to be limited, and so is our understanding of the obstacles to the adoption of healthy diets by individuals. Evidence does suggest that for many of the foods or recipes deemed healthful by nutrition experts (i.e., produce, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes and fish), consumer appeal is low compared to less healthy foods and recipes whose sensory appeal is linked to high levels of salt, sugar and fat. But many other variables come into play. We have developed and validated a consumer research model that accounts for the multivariate nature of consumer behavior and provides a holistic framework for the investigation of factors mitigating food choice and consumption behavior. This model relates consumer behavior to three types of variables - product variables, consumer variables and context variables. Product variables are all the characteristics of the product, such as price, brand, package, label information, and sensory properties, among others. Consumer variables are mostly genetics, demographics and psychographics. Context variables can summarily be defined as all those variables that are not product or consumer variables. In practice, they include the physical environment of consumption but also the non-physical context. The consumption behavior measures that can be modeled with this model are preferences, liking, purchase intent, repeat purchase, and satisfaction, among others. The model also considers culture as a set of variables that overlaps between consumer and context variables. The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of consumer behavior with respect to food, nutrition and diet-related health. Specific objectives are 1) to develop and test new consumer research methods and models for the investigation of consumer behavior, particularly food preferences, likes and dislikes, food choice, and food intake; 2) to research the formulation of sensory liking among consumers, e.g., how do consumers decide whether they like or dislike a food; 3) to investigate the respective influences of product, consumer and context variables on consumer behavior; and 4) to formulate foods, recipes and menus for health with high acceptance among consumers. Expected outputs and outcomes for those objectives are 1) refined and novel methodologies for the investigation of consumer behavior and model(s) of consumer behavior; 2) an improved understanding of how consumers formulate their liking or dislike for foods with regard to the process and the factors that influence that process and its outcome(s); 3) a determination of the respective influences of product (sensory and non-sensory), consumer and context variables on food choice and intake for a wide range of foods and beverages; and 4) the formulation of foods, beverages, recipes and menus for better health with a high level of acceptance among consumers."

There is growing interest for multispecies grazing involving goats and beef cattle. In this management technique, it is expected that goats would select tall growing plants such as shrubs and forbs whereas cattle graze mainly short growing forages such as grasses and legumes. More efficient use of available vegetation and increased animal performance or productivity is expected; this may result in better use of available resources and consequently, increased profits. Most research involving multispecies stocking has been conducted in range or large land ownership environments. This study will focus on researching the benefits of multispecies grazing and its application at small farm level. This study will also evaluate the suitability of locally available crop by-product feeds as alternatives to the more expensive commercial feeds. Animal feeds comprise the biggest expense in livestock production; livestock producers opting out of this business often cite feed cost as the main reason advising their decision. Feeding a cheaper but nutritionally balanced diet is very desirable to our target audience, thus, our focus will be directed towards testing and recommending suitable crop by-product feeds to the small and limited resource farmer. New research-based knowledge is expected to be learned from this study and this will help small and limited resource farmers to reduce production costs and increase profits from their livestock operations."

The US production value in 2011 was almost $40 billion nationwide, and $1.7 billion in South Dakota. Insect pests can substantially impact soybean production, and thus negatively affect our agricultural economy. An example of such a pest is the soybean aphid, an invasive species which has caused serious harm to soybean production in Midwestern states. Other existing and emerging soybean pests such as spider mites, bean leaf beetles, grasshoppers, Japanese beetles, and stink bugs also impact production. This project directly supports the agricultural industry of the state and region by providing unbiased, science-based information to inform the pest management activities and decisions of agricultural producers and the other ag professionals who support them. The research focus of this project is on the biology, ecology, integrated pest management (IPM), and biological control of soybean insect pests. The ultimate goal is more sustainable and profitable soybean production systems. This will involve experimentation and data collection to better-understand management approaches such as biological control (i.e., beneficial insects that prey upon pests), resistant varieties, and techniques to minimize pesticide use, and how to make these approaches work together. Another important aspect of this project is that the research will be integrated with information delivery via Cooperative Extension, to improve transmission to intended audiences. This information transfer is more efficient because the project director has responsibilities for both research and Extension. The intended audiences of this work are farmers, crop consultants, and commodity groups, Extension personnel, other scientists working in this area, students and postdoctoral trainees. The expected outputs of this project are: (Activities) conducting and analyzing experiments, training students and/or postdoctoral trainees, facilitating collaborations among other soybean professionals in the USDA and Land Grant universities; (Events) demonstration sites for producers, college and departmental field day tours, and symposia at professional meetings; (Service) assisting with ID of insect specimens submitted to the pest diagnostic lab at South Dakota State University; (Products) data sets, scientific publications and presentations, collaborations fostered by the project, information for soybean producers and fellow scientists, and information to integrate into Extension programming. Outputs will be evaluated for impact through the Cooperative Extension side of this program, which includes pre/post surveys, metrics to assess information access, and metrics to assess points-of-contact. Anticipated benefits include an increased knowledge level about insect pest management among scientists, Extension staff, and crop producers, and changes in action as producers make better pest management decisions."

Its introduction into major crops would allow the development of true-breeding hybrids. Three points in ovule development are altered in apomicts. 1) Meiosis either aborts while neighboring nuclear cells enlarge to form aposporous initials or is never initiated when the megaspore mother cell divides mitotically (diplospory). 2) The chromosomally unreduced egg in aposporous or diplosporous embryo sacs develops in the absence of fertilization (parthenogenesis). 3) Endosperm is initiated as in sexual reproduction (pseudogamous) or in the absence of fertilization (autonomous). Progeny of an apomictic plant are genetically identical to the seed parent. This method of clonal propagation has distinct advantages over vegetative propagation in terms of size and longevity of propagules. A better understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the trait is necessary before apomixis can be manipulated in crop plants. Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is a globally significant legume crop with economic importance for the southern US and particularly Georgia. Peanut breeding in conducted almost exclusively in the public sector with no major corporate programs existing.

These half-sibling families of maturing trees will be core-samples for studies of heritability of wood quality. Three seed orchards derived from superior trees in these trials also offer material for study and seeds for distribution. New efforts to clone koa using root sprouts appear promising. These techniques will be refined and clonal nurseries established at several locations to evaluate environmental influences on quality and for multi-line seed orchards of this legume tree.

The project directly addresses needs identified by local stakeholders and the newly-formed Tropical Hardwood Tree Improvement and Regeneration Center (www.TropHTIRC.org). The related American leguminous genus Leucaena also produces wood of high density and quality. It is a common source of timber, craftwood, and bio-energy in Asia. Unlike koa it is harvestable in a decade, thrives in Hawaii's dry lowlands, has few major disease or pests, and can be readily cloned and coppiced. Seedless triploid hybrids produced from some of the 22 species in this genus have been grown at three college research stations and solve the problem of invasiveness of the wild-type Leucaenas. Clonal plantings have been made for shade and windbreaks. These trees will be harvested and milled or core-sampled, and they will be compared with the parent trees to assess genetic and environmental factors affecting wood quality. Superior seedless clones will be provided to foresters and bio-energy developers.

Citrus is a $1 billion industry. Southwest Florida is a leading producer of citrus and vegetables including pepper, watermelon, cantaloupe, squash, corn, cucumber, potato, tomato, and snap bean. A large transplant industry for vegetables is located in the region. Additionally, there are ornamental and palm nurseries, herb producers, organic growers, and various specialty crops. This wide diversity of crop species can be subjected to a number of limiting plant diseases, most of which are favored by Floridas subtropical climate of warm and wet environmental conditions for rapid disease development. Additionally, Florida crops are exceptionally at risk because of the frequent introductions of exotic pests, including plant pathogens. Plant diseases can severely and adversely affect production of all of these crops. Documented disease outbreaks caused 100% plant loss in watermelon and tomato caused by watermelon vine decline (Squash vein yellowing virus; Adkins et al,. 2007) and late blight (Phytophthora infestans), respectively. Losses incurred by diseases can impact productivity by 10-50% in any given year. Currently, the citrus industry is facing one of the most devastating diseases of citrus, Huanglongbing (HLB) a.k.a. greening disease (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus), vectored by the Asian citrus psyllid, which causes tree decline, lost productivity due to reduced yields and quality, and ultimately tree death (Bove, 2006; de Graca, 1991). Another disease introduced in the 1990s, and now endemic to Florida citrus despite a massive eradication program, is citrus canker caused by the bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri. Citrus canker can cause severe yield losses due to fruit blemishes and premature fruit drop. The introduction of exotic pests to Florida creates challenging situations to the ecosystem and agriculture. Although the potential exists that an exotic pest can devastate a particular host and entire industry, at the very least, growers may have to substantially change their management practices and increase inputs to include disease control measures for an exotic pathogen. Additionally, established pathogen populations can shift and become increasingly problematic to manage, for example, a genetic shift may occur in the pathogen which then becomes insensitive to fungicide active ingredient"

A critical feature of P. capsici is the high level of sexual reproduction in commercial fields. Infested fields contain sexually produced dormant oospores that persist for many years and give rise to highly variable populations. Cultural and chemical control strategies do not provide adequate control and the dynamic nature of P. capsici renders investigations focused on one or a few strains ineffective. Recent research indicates that secreted Phytophthora virulence proteins promote infection of host plants and thus epidemics. In susceptible plants these proteins suppress host defenses, but some resistant plants recognize these virulence proteins and induce rapid localized cell death and prevent disease. Our goal is to utilize virulence proteins to aid the development of economically viable vegetables that are resistant to vegetable blight. Our specific objectives support the Understanding Plant-Associated Microorganisms Program A1121 goal to elucidate the molecular mechanism used by microorganisms to interact with plants. They include (i) the identification of conserved virulence genes via sequencing diverse isolates and measuring virulence gene expression in P capsici and vegetable hosts, (ii) an assessment of the conserved virulence genes diversity in natural populations, and (iii) implementation of an virulence gene-based transient assay system to identify and track plant resistance and associated genes in vegetables. The knowledge and tools produced via this project will promote the development of diverse P. capsici resistant vegetables."

Dry beans are generally recognized as an excellent source of inexpensive complex carbohydrates and proteins, and are rich in iron, magnesium, Zinc, potassium folate, and other essential nutritional components amongst which includes antinutritional factors (ANFs). It contain soluble dietary fibers and high concentrations of short chain fatty acids, which have been known to have contributed towards lowering the blood cholesterol levels and thus minimizes the risk of cancer. Bean consumption is limited because of anti-nutritional factors (ANF) such as phytic acid and trypsin inhibitors lowers the bioavailability of minerals by forming insoluble complexes with mono- di - and trivalent cations, and inhibits the hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases and amylases. Polyphenols in beans also decreases the digestibility of carbohydrates and proteins and decrease the bioavailability of vitamins and minerals. The project intends to develop a new innovative method for bean canning by using canned as a bioreactor where the products will be hydrolyzed prior to commercial sterilization. The bioactivity and bioavailability of the new ingredient (hydrolyzed phytic acid into inositol and inorganic phosphate) will be evaluated and its effect of its metabolism as a dietary element will be assessed."

The development of improved varieties and germplasm with high yield potential, disease resistance, efficiency under low soil-water conditions, and good seed quality has to be continued in order to maintain market competitiveness for the Nebraska bean industry. Breeding for resistance to limiting bacterial and fungal diseases in dry beans will lead to the use of fewer chemicals, resulting in less damage to the environment and lower cost of production. Nationwide, the bean industry and dry bean growers are interested in reducing cost of production. Identification of high-yielding, drought-resistant dry bean lines is needed in order to reduce dependence on irrigation water, lower costs of production, and increase profit margins for dry bean growers in western Nebraska. Elite adapted Nebraska lines will be crossed to several sources of germplasm possessing disease resistance, good agronomic traits, earliness and plant architecture, using the 'Good x Good' approach. Demonstration plots of elite great northern and pinto lines will be planted at the PHREC-Scottsbluff and Baby Trials in growers' fields from 2012 to 2016. Entries from different stages of breeding development will be tested in replicated trials. The University of Nebraska dry bean breeding program will participate in the regional trials (MRPN, CDBN and WRBT). Multiple disease screenings will be conducted in the field and the greenhouse and molecular markers will be continued used to incorporate and pyramid disease resistance into commercial cultivars. Release of dry bean germplasm and/or cultivars with multiple disease resistance will benefit public industry and private breeding programs as well as the western bean growers. Genetics and map the genes of bacterial wilt resistance will be elucidated. Results of the yield trials will be distributed through the 'Bean Bag' newsletter published by Nebraska Dry Bean Growers Association, producer meetings, the Nebraska Variety Test web page http:// cropwatch.unl.edu/web/drybeans/, official publications of the Nebraska Variety Testing Program, and at the biennial Bean Improvement Cooperative Meeting (BIC).

One potential way of decreasing seed survival is through incorporation of green manures and other organic amendments. Several studies have observed seed bank density in cropping systems with contrasting organic matter inputs and some have found relations between weed seed density and microbial activity. Some researchers showed both above-ground weed density and weed seed banks were lower in soil amended with cover crops and compost. Other showed seed bank density after 4 years of low C:N ratio compost was lower than with manure slurry, though neither differed from the control. A problem with these studies is that weed seed rain was not controlled across treatments so that one cannot be certain that differences among treatments were due to effects on persistence of the seed bank. Controlled studies on seed survival in contrasting organic matter input treatments using seed packet and artificial seed banks have produced variable results. Researchers buried seeds of smooth pigweed and common lambsquarters in packets in cropping systems treatments with high and low organic matter inputs and followed survival over two years. Overall, they found relatively small differences in survival among treatments, though some differences were significant. A group of researchers showed that weed emergence was reduced after incorporation of cover crops and that this was associated with attack on seeds by micro-organisms. Organic amendments incorporated into the soil might be expected to reduce survival of weed seeds by increasing populations of fungi and macroinvertebrate. Also, if the amendment has a low C:N ratio, as is the case for most legume green manures, then N release during decomposition will produce nitrate in the soil solution, and nitrate is a known germination cue for many weed species. Germination deep in the plow layer usually results in death since few weed species are able to emerge from more than 1 to 2 inches deep. These mechanistic considerations indicate possible reasons why results from cropping systems experiments appear to be contradictory. This Multi-State project will allow assessment of the effects of more types of amendments on more species of weeds than could be accomplished in any one state. We believe that legume green manures may be particularly useful for promoting seed mortality, but the types of legume cover crops used across the U.S. varies widely. A Multi-State initiative will allow us to determine whether effects are general to broad classes of organic amendments or highly specific to particular inputs and whether they relate to measurable characteristics such as carbon/nitrogen ratio."

Epidemiological evidence has identified several dietary trends with reduced risk or severity of PCa. In the 2007 AICR/WCRF report, foods containing lycopene were listed as probable and pulses/legumes were listed as limited-suggestive in their ability to reduce the risk of PCa. Broccoli consumption has also been associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer. While whole foods are identified as protective, many mechanistic studies have taken a pharmacologic approach by testing single bioactives at high doses from these foods, making it difficult to extrapolate findings to the efficacy of the whole food. Our laboratory was the first to show that tomato powder was more effective than lycopene alone in reducing PCa development and progression. We have also found that the combination of tomato powder with broccoli powder was more effective than either alone in suppressing growth of prostate tumors. Recent in vitro evidence suggests that whole soy extract was more effective than individual isoflavones and that tomato paste was more effective than lycopene alone in inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PCa cells. In order to better clarify and support the epidemiological evidence, future research should utilize foods rather than isolated bioactives to identify the anti-carcinogenic potential of the whole food. Illinois is one of the primary producers of soybeans. If it can be shown that soy reduces prostate carcinogenesis, this may increase sales of soy products. Moreover, the citizens of Illinois, like those in other states, would benefit from reduced mortality or morbidity from PCa if tomato, broccoli and/or soy consumption could be shown to reduce the appearance and growth of prostate tumors or to slow PCa metastasis to other tissues."

This family encompasses one of the major threats in potato production and seed potato certification, here in Wisconsin, Potato virus Y, with its new emerging tuber necrotic strains, which make it difficult for growers to identify in the field and can results in seed downgrading or rejection. The aim of this proposal is to harness tools in biology and in bioinformatic to study potyviral infection to understand of mechanism of viral pathogen resistance and contribute in safe and effective control of viral pathogens. Recessive resistance genes have been reported as another efficient barrier against plant viral infection and open door for exploitation in plant breeding. While the precise role of the reported recessive genes against potyviral infections has yet to be determined, these host factors have been implicated in translation and as a requirement for successful viral infection of a large variety of agronomically important crops like tomato, pepper, lettuce, pea, wheat and recently potato. The objective of this research project delves into the mechanistic details of RNA viral elements in translation and in the larger context of viral replication and plant virus resistance. Untranslated regions of many RNA virus genomes are known to harbor important functional elements, acting at the RNA primary sequence or secondary or tertiary structure. Such elements may be involved in various aspects of the viral lifecycle. This research proposal address questions  basic to the problems of agriculture in its broadest aspects  and aims to contribute to our knowledge of plant disease resistance genes in agronomical crops by investigating the basic molecular mechanism of viral translation and replication and their requirement for those translation factors. The research from this project will not only be beneficial for other researchers working on viral translation regulation, but it is key and first ground step to study plant virus resistance and resistance durability if exploited in plant breeding."

Their importance derives in large part from their capacity for symbiotic nitrogen fixation with soil bacteria, enabling them to return vital nitrogen to the soil environment and to create seed and forage of high protein content. Two decades of molecular and genomic studies in model systems have revealed the presence of exquisite genetic pathways that initiate symbiosis, but despite these advances essentially little is known about genes that regulate symbiotic performance in the natural environment. Research under this project strives to understand the evolution of symbiotic performance in the wild progenitors of legume crops and the ways in which human selection has reshaped this potential during domestication. The research combines ecology and population genomics with classical molecular genetics and reverse genetic assays to deduce the functional consequences of standing variation in wild populations of Cicer reticulatum and its domesticated counterpart Cicer arietinum (chickpea).  Project outcomes will expand our knowledge of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in novel ways, and will contribute to an emerging paradigm in plant biology where the intersection of ecology, genomics and molecular biology empowers the study of gene function in natural and human-built environments. Importantly, the outcomes should have relevance to both basic science and to agriculture.  Legumes provide an estimated 30% of humankind''s nutritional nitrogen, while in agricultural systems crop rotations with legume species provide an important means to maintain soil fertility. Despite legumes'' comparative advantage of N-fixation, nitrogen fertilizers are often added during legume cultivation and legumes are often grown under high residual nitrogen following cereal crops. These practices relax selection on nitrogen fixation traits and contribute in a substantial way to environmental degradation through nitrogen runoff. Improved understanding of the processes that regulate N-fixation in natural and agricultural environments will ultimately enable rationale strategies to mitigate these situations. Of more immediate impact, researchers on this project are mentoring under-represented minorities as young biologists by participating in established high school science programs at UC Davis and the Fairchild Botanical Garden. The project will provide training for undergraduate students in laboratory science, while mentoring their academic and professional development. Data and biological resources generated under this project will be available through public repositories, including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and through the Germplasm Resource Information Network (GRIN) of the USDA Agricultural Research Service. Information will also be provided through a project-specific web site."

Many beneficial symbionts are themselves infected with viruses called bacteriophages, which have the capacity to impact host biology in critical ways, yet their roles in animal-bacterial symbioses are poorly understood. In the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, the bacterial symbiont Hamiltonella defensa confers protection from attack by parasitic wasps, but only when bacteriophages called APSEs are also present. Aside from this role in protection, little is known about the influence of APSEs on H. defensa and aphid biology, including specifically how APSEs contribute to the demise of parasites and the potential role in the regulation of symbiont abundance. This project will use a combination of approaches, including genomics and molecular biology, to characterize the roles of APSEs in the regulation and maintenance of the protective symbiosis and to identify specific factors responsible for wasp mortality. Deciphering phage-symbiont interactions is important to the study of animal-microbial interactions generally and to understanding the biology of many economically important insects like aphids. The proposed work will yield information of practical importance for the management of pest insect populations and on the role of phages in the establishment and maintenance of bacterial-arthropod associations, which are widespread in the natural world. The interdisciplinary nature of this research is also well suited as a platform to train young scientists at the interface of symbiosis, cell biology, parasitology, and molecular processes.

Voigt (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)Key Collaborators: Giles E. Oldroyd (John Innes Centre, UK) and Phillip S. Poole (John Innes Centre, Oxford University, UK)Nitrogen is an essential element of biological molecules and life on earth.  Lack of usable nitrogen limits growth of microbes, plants, and animals. Scarcity of nitrogen in agricultural soils limits plant production of food, feed, fiber and fuel.  Nature solved the nitrogen limitation problem via evolution of biological nitrogen fixation in a type of bacteria, diazotrophs, that are able to reduce atmospheric N2 to NH3, which is readily assimilated into biological molecules.  Biological nitrogen fixation is promoted by a complex metal containing enzyme called nitrogenase, whose oxygen-sensitivity may explain its restricted distribution amongst bacteria.  Some plants, including most legumes and a few non-legumes form intimate, nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs that provide the plants with ammonia.  As a consequence, legumes have been an integral part of sustainable agricultural systems for thousands of years.  Unfortunately, many important food species, including the grasses maize/corn, rice, and wheat cannot establish effective nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs, making them dependent on nitrogenous fertilizers for high yield. Large-scale use of industrially-produced nitrogen-fertilizer has doubled the influx of nitrogen into the terrestrial biogeochemical nitrogen-cycle, with serious negative consequences for human health and the natural environment.   Therefore, the long-term sustainability of massive nitrogen-fertilizer inputs in agriculture has come into question. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators from the US and UK to solve the dual nitrogen problems of nitrogen-fertilizer over-use in developed countries and soil nitrogen-paucity in developing countries by developing effective endophytic (bacteria inside the root) and associative (bacteria attached outside the root) nitrogen-fixing symbioses in a model and a crop plant species.  The overarching goal of the project is to develop effective N2-fixing symbioses between the model C4-grass, Setaria viridis, as well as the related crop species, Zea mays, with the endophytic bacterium, Rhizobium sp. IRBG74, as well as the associative bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescenes Pf5.  Successful deployment of biological nitrogen fixation in model or crop grass species will pave the way for a second Green Revolution to increase crop yields for resource-poor farmers and decrease the use and environmental-impact of industrial nitrogen-fertilizers by wealthier farmers. This project will establish a powerful new model system for the study of plant-microbe interactions and demonstrate the power of synthetic biology in engineering new associative relationships and interdependencies that have the potential to be universal for all crop plants.  It will test this potential in the important crop, maize.  The integrated US-UK research partnership will provide a unique training opportunity for students and post-doctoral associates with active exchange of personnel between academic laboratories and research foundations in both countries.  Data and materials generated in the study including plasmid constructs and genetically modified bacterial and plant species will be made available via websites maintained in the US and the UK.  To broaden the impact of the work, traditional and non-traditional outreach strategies will be used to help K-12 teachers, students, and the public understand the fundamentals and benefits of interdisciplinary research and the implications of synthetic biology for the next generation of biotechnological solutions in agriculture."

While chemically synthesized inorganic nitrogen fertilizers are effective in increasing crop yields, they are costly and also have a negative impact on the environment, especially on aquatic ecosystems. In contrast, sustainable agriculture relies on biological nitrogen fixation as an economically attractive and ecologically viable source of new nitrogen. The conversion of molecular nitrogen into ammonia is performed by bacteria (Rhizobia) that live in symbiosis with leguminous plants such as peas, soy beans, and alfalfa. The research will be carried out using the symbiotic model system, the nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti (S. meliloti). The process of chemotaxis enables motile rhizobia to preferentially move in the soil towards host plant roots and supports efficient interaction between symbiosis partners. Many motile bacteria are propelled by means of rotating flagella, driven by a powerful, self-assembling nanomachine. The unique flagellar motor and the specially adapted chemotaxis system of S. meliloti make cells more efficient at maneuvering in the viscous soil environment, leading to better survival and optimal interaction with their host plant alfalfa. Previous research uncovered several novel molecular mechanisms governing chemotactic responses and motility in S. meliloti, thereby setting the stage for an in-depth analysis of the underlying molecular events. The overarching goal of this project is to analyze the specific adaptations that occurred in S. meliloti motility and chemotaxis due to the soil habitat and communication with its plant host. The first objective of the research analyzes the roles of two novel proteins in the response of S. meliloti to quickly changing environmental signals, which is essential for bacterial survival. The second objective determines the cellular concentrations and enzymatic activities of key chemotaxis components, allowing prediction of bacterial behavior in the interaction with alfalfa crop. The third objective will identify the function of newly discovered flagellar motor components in facilitating effective movement of S. meliloti in the soil and towards symbiosis partners. This research will lead to the discovery of significant bacterial properties and impact current understanding of how bacterial symbionts respond to plant signals and efficiently move through soil.Broader Impacts     The project directly benefits future agricultural and environmental issues for society. By enhancing understanding of the cues that bacterial symbionts use to efficiently interact with their host crop, the research will impact biological nitrogen fixation and thus crop yields and reduce the use of detrimental synthetic fertilizers. The project will also vertically integrate research activities with educational activities through the development of an undergraduate classroom exercise addressing currently open research questions, which will transform into scientific discoveries in the research laboratory. The existing, successful outreach program of the Microbiology Club of Virginia Tech will be expanded to rural, underdeveloped communities of Appalachia. Outreach activities in the form of interactive lectures and hands-on activities will promote scientific awareness across the educational spectrum, including a local 4-H Agricultural Club and rural elementary schools. Studies of motility and chemotaxis can be demonstrated easily and will allow the development of innovative, inquiry-based microbiology lessons with High School science teachers, a valuable strategy for effective learning. Collaboration with Novozymes? BioAgricultural Group will give Virginia Tech students the opportunity not only to experience basic research approaches at the university and applied research in industry through merged collaborative training programs, but also to increase their chances for recruitment into professional careers.

More specifically, the project will investigate the feasibility of extracting meaningful features of insect pests using a set of low-cost, low-power sensors?namely ultrasound, infrared light and bio-impedance sensors?and develop multi-modal sensor fusion algorithms for robust detection and classification of multiple target insect species against any non-target organisms that may enter the trapping device.  Measurement signals generated by the sensors will be analyzed to determine a set of distinct features that can be computed on an embedded platform for real-time processing.  The critical requirements of employing low-cost, low-power sensors with real-time processing capability make this research unique and challenging.  Different sensor fusion strategies based on these features will be investigated and the performance of each fusion algorithm will be evaluated.  Successful conclusion of Phase I and II of this project will result in fully automated, wireless insect traps capable of providing accurate, real-time populations of multiple pest species. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the proposed system could revolutionize pest management practices in agriculture and drastically reduce the amount of pesticide applications.  The proposed system not only eliminates one of the most laborious and dreaded activities of manually inspecting insect traps, but also provides unprecedented access to accurate, real-time insect population information to make more effective pest management decisions.  This leads to reduced, spatially-restricted pesticide applications, better understanding of insect pest behaviors, and enhanced biological control.  The potential market for the proposed technology is quite broad.  In fact, the technology can benefit any industry that requires regular monitoring of insect populations such as tree fruits (e.g., apple, grape, citrus, pear, etc.), row crops (e.g., corn, soy bean, sugar cane, etc.), vegetables, nuts, coffee, ornamental trees, stored food, etc.  Furthermore, the proposed technology could be used for various state and federal pest monitoring programs?such as the Slow the Spread (STS) Project administered by USDA to monitor gypsy moths?that requires placing and managing up to a few hundreds of thousands of pheromone traps annually."

Phosphorus availability in soils is limited because most soil P is not directly available to plants and natural inputs are insufficient to replace P removed by harvest. Applications of fertilizers or manures are thus required to maintain soil fertility and yields, but economically viable P reserves are declining and P losses from agricultural systems degrade aquatic ecosystems. This project evaluates whether cover crops, especially legumes, could provide P fertility for cash crops while reducing P input requirements by mobilizing soil P (converting P bound to soil minerals and organic matter into plant-available forms). The central objective is to identify how different species of cover crops could mobilize P. To do so, complementary approaches ? field measurements in long-term experiments, greenhouse studies, and computation of P budgets ? will be used. Measures will be taken of different forms of soil P, processes that mobilize P, transfer rates of P from cover crop to cash crop, and the overall importance of P mobilization by cover crops relative to other P fluxes at the farm scale.This project will contribute to the development of alternative fertilization strategies that could maintain soil fertility while reducing costly P inputs. It will test whether using cover crops could contribute to this goal and provide a better understanding of P transformations in soils where different plant species grow. Because results from this project should be directly relevant to farm practitioners, this research will be coupled with outreach activities to disseminate results widely, including making the data publicly available, contributing to cover crop databases, and transferring knowledge through activities held outside of academic circles (field days, non-technical publications). This project will also involve undergraduate students and provide them with basic training in ecosystem science."

During the 24-month fellowship, Dr. Parker will work on a project titled,  Variation in the outcome of an insect-symbiont association: a role for host genotype  under the sponsorship of Professor H Charles Godfray at the University of Oxford in Oxford, England. Animals host complex communities of microbes that play an important role in health and disease. In recent years, scientists have determined that there is a great deal of variation in the types of microbes that inhabit different individuals, and in what effect these microbes have on their hosts. The goal of this research is to use a simple model system to learn about the ecological and evolutionary forces generating variation in animal-microbe interactions. Pea aphids host a species of bacteria that protects them from a natural fungal pathogen. Recent work has shown that some aphids are better protected from this fungus by bacteria than others. This project will combine next-generation sequencing and immunological techniques to determine the role that hosts are playing in shaping their associations with beneficial bacteria, and why hosts differ in these associations. By learning about this simple animal-microbe system, this work will contribute to a broader understanding of how ecology and evolution shape associations with microbes in more complex individuals. In addition, aphids are invasive agricultural pests, and fungal pathogens are used as a way of controlling aphid populations. Developing an understanding of how crop pests resist biocontrol agents is important to agricultural management. This project will also involve the development of a series of classroom exercises that use aphids to expose students to natural history. The exercises will have students set up and monitor natural communities of aphids, which are found commonly throughout the US, and will explore how pathogens and predators influence populations. This award provides a unique opportunity for a US scientist to collaborate with foreign scientists, and utilize the unique facilities, expertise and experimental conditions available abroad."

Craig Venter Institute), Joann Mudge (National Center for Genome Resources) This project uses functional assays, de novo genome assembly and bioinformatic data-mining to characterize symbiosis genes in the model legume Medicago truncatula. Legumes are noteworthy for the sophisticated symbioses they form with rhizobial bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, existing knowledge about symbioses comes primarily from knockout mutants, an approach that often misses genes of subtle yet significant effect, especially genes likely to be important in contemporary evolution. In earlier work, several strongly supported candidate symbiosis loci were discovered through genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and support for candidate genes often included independent evidence like expression profile, correlation with multiple traits or co-localization with known symbiotic phenotypes. The current project will test ~100 of these candidate loci through reverse genetic experiments involving Tnt1 insertion and RNAi  knockdown  plant lines. Promising genes will be examined through interaction assays involving previously defined Sinorhizobium and AM strains and tested for  gene-for-gene  relationships using a panel of 48 sequenced Sinorhizobium strains. Earlier GWAS mapping only targeted SNP variation, even though structural variants (SVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) are known to have major impacts on genome variation. This is especially relevant to the genomics of symbiosis because the large gene families such as the NB-ARC domain-containing genes and nodule cysteine rich peptides (NCRs) play critical roles in symbiosis. This project will deeply sequence and de novo assemble 30 nodal M. truncatula accessions, in order to discover SVs and CNVs. SVs and CNVs will be imputed genome-wide, leading to a new round of GWAS to discover symbiotic loci missed in the earlier phase of mapping. The primary outcomes of this project will be the identification of genes associated with the contemporary evolution of symbiosis as well as the architecture of M. truncatula genomic diversity. This research effort will be extended by involving undergraduates from Hamline University, a four year institution located near the University of Minnesota, and from the University of Puerto Rico (UPR). Students at Hamline will work throughout the academic year and then together with UPR students during the summer as part of Minnesota''s Life Sciences Summer Undergraduate Research Program (LSSURP) program. Their work will target the important but largely uncharacterized Sinorhizobial enzyme, ACC deaminase, and students will also participate in the screening of reverse genetic mutants. These experiences will provide the students the opportunity to develop their own hypothesis-driven projects. Through joint mentoring by project PIs, student training will also assist the undergraduate research program at Hamline to become more competitive for its own future external research initiatives.  Genomic sequence resources will be available for public through medicagohapmap.org, and the Short Read Archive, dbSNP and FTP sites at Genbank. Importantly, the underlying Medicago Hapmap GWAS platform, available at medicagohapmap.org, will provide a long-term resource for the broader research community to discover legume genes controlling quantitative variation of agricultural and biological interest, especially trait variation in alfalfa (Medicago sativa), the fourth most widely cultivated crop in the U.S."

The edible parts of several major food plants, including corn, rice, wheat, beans, and peas, undergo a specialized process called endoreduplication in which their cells enlarge and increase their DNA content several fold. Despite its importance, little is known about how endoreduplication is regulated, and it is difficult to investigate in food plants because the endoreduplicating nutritive tissues are buried deep within their developing seeds. To overcome this difficulty, the research proposed will use genetics, cell biology, and genomics to investigate endoreduplication in exposed cells on the surface of the Arabidopsis flower. In this new system, the cells are accessible for experimentation in growing plants. In particular, the research will address the question of how endoreduplication influences the cell undergoing the process. First, a mutant with increased numbers of endoreduplicated cells will be used to elucidate how endoreduplication is controlled. Second, the mechanism through which endoreduplication turns off one gene will be determined. Normally scientists think of external signals turning on and off genes within a cell.  However, exciting recent results suggests that in, at least one case, endoreduplication can turn off a gene. Finally, to find how many genes are turned on or off by endoreduplication, the expression levels of all of the genes in the Arabidopsis genome will be compared between endoreduplicating cells and their non-endoreduplicating neighbors. Findings from this research may show new ways to increase crop yield. In addition, this project will train two graduate students, provide opportunities for summer research for three undergraduate students, and will enable workshops targeted to interest school girls in science."

This group includes genera that produce only bipinnately compound leaves, and a more recently evolved genus (Acacia) that initially produces compound leaves, but then switches to the production of a simple leaf called a phyllode. Nested within Acacia is a group of approximately 70 species (Botrycephalae) that produce only compound leaves. It has long been assumed that these species represent derived ?juvenilized? forms of phyllodinous species, but there is no evidence for this conclusion.  The juvenile phase of vegetative development is specified by high levels of the miRNAs, miR156 and miR157. The working hypothesis of this project is that the Botrycephalae arose from phyllodinous species by the prolonged, high expression of miR156 and/or miR157. To obtain preliminary evidence for or against this hypothesis, the expression of the mature miR156/miR157 transcripts will be examined in a few phyllodinous and bi-pinnate species of Acacia, using Northern analysis. The genes that encode miR156/miR157 will be identified by next-generation sequencing genomic DNA from a representative phyllodinous and bi-pinnate species. This will make it possible to test the feasibility of examining the expression of specific miR156/mIR157 genes by qRT-PCR. The results of these experiments will provide the ?proof-of-concept? for a future proposal aimed at determining the molecular basis for variation in the expression of juvenile and adult traits in the Acacieae. Broader ImpactAn exhibit on phase change will be created for annual Philadelphia Science Carnival, held on the Ben Franklin Parkway.  The goal of this exhibit will be to teach the many children who attend this carnival that plants are dynamic, and change as they grow. Attendees will be asked to find all the differences between juvenile and adult ivy and corn leaves, and will be introduced to phase change in Acacia and Eucalyptus. Arabidopsis plants transformed with 35S::miR156 will be used to illustrate how a single gene can change the entire architecture of the shoot."

We have used GC-MS to detect melamine in food productsfrom China and pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables. We have enhanced the FDA FERNT021 methodology by developing the use of a Programmed Temperature Vaporizing (PTV) inletfor the GC-MS.

We have used LC-MS to analyze toxins in surveillancesamples and pesticide residues in produce, as well as honey bee related matrixes. We haveadded new toxins to the FDA FERN T022 method and evaluated many matrixes.

This study is interested in developing and validating an in vitroassay that predicts the dissolution rate of particles of orally inhaled drug products (OIDP)in the lung, thereby allowing predictions of the in vivo behavior of inhaled drugformulations as it relates to the interrelationship between drug/formulation properties,dissolution of drug in the pulmonary lining fluid and the pulmonary effects and, afterabsorption, systemic side effects. The proposed study can be divided into three parts:First, the proposed dissolution device will be optimized with respect to the dissolutionmedium to be used (a dissolution medium reflecting the conditions in the lung is desired),drug amount and mechanism of applying drug to testing device , design of the overalldissolution device and other factors. After optimization of the system, the second part ofthe study will assess a wide range of commercially available and experimental drugformulations that differ in physicochemical properties, delivery (metered dose inhaler,dry powder inhaler nebulizer), formulation (solution, powder, suspension) andphysicochemical properties of the drug compound (hydrophilic, lipophilic....). In thethird step of the proposed work, pharmacokinetic studies present in the literature will beanalyzed with respect to the rate with which OIDPs enter the systemic circulations inhumans. These data are than correlated to data generated within the dissolution testexperiments. It is intended to provide a strong relationship between in vitro dissolutiondata and in vivo absorption properties of OIDPs."

High costs of grain and nitrogen (N) fertilizer, in conjunction with the environmental conservation attributes of grassland-based agriculture, have led to renewed interest in the use of N-fixing forage legumes as a source of feed for ruminant livestock. Improved BFT cultivars from this project could contribute to increased resiliency and sustainability of pasture-based beef production systems. We propose to increase the efficiency of beef gain on pastures by developing birdsfoot trefoil germplasm from which cultivars with improved stand longevity and tannin concentration could be developed. We will focus on the Eastern Transition Zone where significant cattle production takes place on toxic endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue [Schedonorus arundinaceum (Schreb.) Dumort.] pastures to the detriment of cattle health, gain, and reproduction. We will use a two-pronged approach by starting with (a) material from existing cultivars and breeding populations and (b) with 120 accessions from the National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS). The former have been selected fro aggronomic traits such as yield and persistence, whereas the latter has accessions with high tannin content. The resulting germplams will be extremely valuable for the development of improved BFT cultivars."

The new Type II pinto bean permits direct harvesting, the preferred production practice of dry bean producers, and is now the industry standard. While a significant accomplishment, important traits, such as earliness, were not fully maintained during the development of Type II pinto beans. To fully support breeding efforts within this new growth habit, it is necessary to: 1. develop a complete description of an ideal Type II pinto bean ideotype; 2. search the germplasm for important genetic variability that breeders can incorporate into they efforts to improve Type II pinto beans;, and 3. describe the genomic regions that can be targets for marker assisted breeding. A national field trial will assess the available variability for important traits that support a successful Type II pinto bean. Genomic and phenotypic data will be evaluated to discover the important genetic factors controlling these important traits. The result will be a new knowledge base that public and private pinto breeders can utilize to develop more resilient Type II pinto varieties for US production conditions."

Although historically small grains, potatoes, sugar beets, and beans represented the primary crops, a surge in dairy production has lifted Idaho to the 3rd largest dairy-producing state in the U.S. Over 70% of the dairy cattle within the State reside within the south-centrally located Magic Valley. Idaho also has 115 permitted aquaculture facilities with approximately 98% of those facilities also located within the Magic Valley. Rainbow trout are most important in that Idaho provides approximately 70% of the domestic supply. Annual precipitation within the region averages less than 300 mm, thus making the Snake River a key resource linking crop production, dairy operations, and aquaculture. Critical to continued sustainability of agriculture in this region is irrigation water from Snake River dams, water that once applied to crops moves quickly through the sandy soils to shallow aquifers that drain back into the Snake River. Thus any contaminants originating from municipal or agricultural sources and transported through the soils are available in downstream waters reused for irrigation or for aquaculture. The ability of agricultural soils to attenuate transport and obviate the threat of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) such as hormones, antibiotics, and other veterinary drugs to environmental quality and downstream aquaculture operations is unknown. Our objective is to determine the capacity of soils in the Eastern Snake River Plain to attenuate the transport of biologically active concentrations of CECs contributed from irrigated, dairy manure-amended fields, thereby improving the sustainability of crop production, dairy operations, and aquaculture. We propose to not only identify and quantify potentially harmful CECs, but to assess biological impacts with respect to endocrine disruption and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Both field and laboratory studies will be conducted to identify harmful CECs (hormones, antibiotics, and other veterinary drugs) and Cu in manure and manure-amended agricultural samples and determine the potential biological impacts. Data will be used to construct a model that will predict the fate of CECs in the environment and whether those CECs will be potentially harmful to agricultural sustainability and human health. Our data will contribute to developing best management practices designed to minimize negative environmental consequences associated with the land application of dairy manure in an irrigated environment of critical importance to three major agricultural industries."

For example, genes for yield, disease and pest resistance, and tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought and heat, have been found in the wild ancestor but are absent in the corresponding crops. This projects seeks to facilitate the utilization of such extra diversity in the breeding of improved bean varieties, whether dry beans or green beans. The use of biodiversity collections for crop improvement has been limited in the past for a number of reasons, including the difficulty in evaluating such collections in a systematic way; and the difficulty in transfering genetic diversity of interest, while leaving deleterious wild trait behind. Wild beans are of great interest because genes for yield and disease and pest resistance have been identified previously among them, but also because they have a very broad geographic distribution from northern Mexico to northwestern Argentina, suggesting that they have diverse adaptations to drought or heat. In order to identify wild beans of interest in this broad distribution, we will perform a novel combination of analyses, namely an analysis of DNA diversity combined with a computer-based eco-geographic analysis to: 1) identify those wild bean populations that live in the driest/hottest environments; and 2) identify those genes or genome regions correlated with distribution in the driest/hottest environments.In turn, the chosen wild beans can then be used in crosses with domesticated beans to enhance drought or heat tolerance and using the genes identified as molecular markers in marker-assisted selection. This project will provide an unsurpassed detailed view of genetic diversity in wild beans, which will facilitate the maintenance and utilization of this biodiversity. It will develop a new high-throughput genomic resources for beans, namely a large number of new molecular markers. It will initiate new breeding efforts to obtain bean varieties that are more tolerant to drought and heat, two traits that may climate-proof beans."

The research will be conducted in three phases.In phase 1, six biochars will be analyzed to obtain characterization data needed to address hypothesis 1.In phase 2, three incubation experiments will be conducted. For the first experiment, two contrasting soils (silt loam and clay loam textures) from the field study sites (phase 3) will each be incubated with the six biochars analyzed in phase 1 for at least four months. Secondly, two of the biochars will be subjected to a series of treatments to isolate specific biochar fractions, and these fractions will be incubated with soil. Lastly, the biochar used in phase 3 will also be incubated with soil from one of the field sites at three different moistures and temperatures. GHG emissions from these soil-biochar mixtures as well as soil alone will be quantified at regular intervals throughout the incubations.For phase 3, I will measure GHG emissions at two different field sites where the mixed hardwood gasification biochar has already been applied to research plots. These plots contain the following cropping systems:continuous corn monoculture; switchgrass monoculture; a low-diversity, high-input grass-legume polyculture; and a high-diversity, low-input perennial polyculture (prairie mix)."

Major natural resource problems include drought, over-used rangeland, farmland highly susceptible to erosion, weeds, difficulty in grass and forb establishment, low fertility on farmland seeded to forages, and low forage quality from late summer through winter.  The challenge is to develop economic, energy-efficient grazing systems for the area while maintaining or improving the plant, soil, water, wildlife, and aesthetic resources.  The overall approach is to gather information on forage production and quality, and cattle gain on native rangelands, perennial forages growing in marginal farmlands, and annual farmed forages as affected by management, climate, and soils.  The information will be used to develop and test forage and grazing management strategies for red meat production systems."

Bearing citrus in the state is grown on a total of 268,600 acres within 5 diverse climatic regions - the Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley, southern California coastal, southern California interior, and southern California desert regions. Arthropod pest management problems and solutions vary greatly between the various climatic regions and on different varieties of citrus within each region. Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) was first found in California late in 2008, has now spread throughout much of southern California, and is under  eradication  (really suppression) in much of southern California. In recent months, officials have come to the realization that the massive Los Angeles area infestation is beyond control and biological control is now being looked at to replace chemical treatment of backyard trees. Huanglongbing is a serious bacterial disease of citrus vectored by ACP and this disease has had severe impacts on citrus production in China, Brazil, Florida, and more recently, Mexico. The disease is moving northward towards California from Mexico and it is only a matter of time before the HLB is found in California and ACP spreads into the San Joaquin Valley production region. This project will address the need to make citrus arthropod pest control more reliable and less costly while minimizing the grower's reliance on broad-spectrum pesticide use to the degree that is possible. Substantial effort will be spent on helping the industry determine how to best deal with Asian citrus psyllid. This will logically progress from the current situation where we are mostly in suppression mode while the insect expands its range, then to a management phase once eradication/suppression is no longer feasible, and then to a third phase once huanglongbing is found and spreads in California. Based on 2010 statistics, avocados in California had an annual crop value of $415 million and were grown on 58,500 acres with the majority of this located in the coastal regions of San Diego, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties. Prior to the early 1990's, California avocado growers were able to manage their arthropod pest problems with minimal chemical intervention and relied heavily on cultural and biological controls. This pattern was disturbed in recent years by the increasing importance of two newly introduced exotic pest species, the avocado thrips and persea mite. On citrus, research will focus largely on Asian citrus psyllid with continued research on citrus thrips; soft scales including black scale and citricola scales; bean thrips; Fuller rose beetle and Diaprepes root weevil; and mites or other contaminants of export citrus. On avocados, research will focus on avocado thrips and persea mite, focusing on basic biology, alternative management methods, selective chemical control, pesticide resistance management, and evaluation of the any promising natural enemies. Proactive research will be conducted on exotic armored scales that are likely to be introduced into California in the future and their biological control."

Within this group of producers, a modest number have begun to incorporate some reduced tillage practices into their farming operations, particularly when those practices have a direct affect upon crop success. Reduced tillage practices have been examined and found to be beneficial by many agronomic crop producers within the state of Oklahoma. In a survey of farms within the state it was found that approximately one-third of farmers are utilizing some form of reduced tillage in their operation (Wright et al. 2010). Farms that produce specialty crops exclusively may or may not be using reduced tillage practices. Traditionally, few specialty crop producers report the use of reduced tillage practices. Although these practices have many benefits including reducing soil erosion from wind and water and improving soil condition, their use is dependent upon crop type and harvesting technology. Not all specialty crops are compatible within a reduced tillage system. Crops such as leafy greens require clean tillage to prevent crop debris and insects from being harvested along with the crop. That said, there are many specialty crops that may lend themselves to a reduced tillage approach to farming. Fruiting vegetable crops, cucurbits, legumes and other groups of vegetables may work well within this system. There are several benefits that may result from further examination of reduced tillage practices in specialty crops. Obvious benefits would include verification of reduced operational costs, reducing soil erosion, conservation of moisture and fuel savings. Less tangible issues that need examining might include impacts on soil organic matter and quality, stand establishment, and pest management effects between conventional and reduced tillage systems. A whole systems approach that includes both agronomic and vegetable crops may prove to be beneficial to farmers that need a number of unrelated crops for crop rotations to complete their farming system."

They provide humans food (pulses and vegetables), forage for ruminants, ecosystem plant diversity, fuels (wood or cellulosic bioenergy), cover crops, green manure, and many other essential services. Cultivated forages and rangelands are important components of agricultural production in north-central Texas and similar low-rainfall regions of the southeastern USA. Forages are utilized for traditional animal husbandry such as wildlife, cattle production, small ruminant feed, dairy silage, or commercialization of hay and silage. In operations catering to urban centers, the uses are less traditional, including natural ecosystems restoration, wildlife habitat and feed and even ornamental gardening. Forage species are also used to address environmental concerns such as soil bioremediation, soil conservation, green manures, renewable biofuels and landscape restoration. Current growth areas for legumes in north-central Texas include low-input forage systems, soil conservation, right-of-way restoration, ruminant nutrition and health, locally grown dairy forage, and wildlife. In addition, growth potential exists for expanded use of cultivated forages in biomass (bioenergy) as well as soil conservation and phytoremediation (riparian buffers and fallow cropland). The inexorable attrition of row-cropping in the Cross Timbers, caused by soil exhaustion and inappropriate climate, may also contribute to increased pasture and forage acreage in the near future. As the cost of nitrogen fertilizer and fuels continue to rise, the use of legumes as self-regenerating, inexpensive sources of nitrogen in crop rotations and as green manures becomes more attractive. This research program at Stephenville will focus on the multiple uses of herbaceous, brushy and arboreal legumes through a diverse program. The common thread will be increased inclusion of legumes. Legumes make ecological and environmental sense for pasture, rangeland or roadside revegetation, soil conservation, ruminant nutrition, or natural ecosystems regeneration in north-central Texas. This is not an easy prospect in a culture that is not accustomed to managing for legumes and in a climate that has both hot dry summer conditions and freezing winters. Land managers, even when they care, are not always sure which introduced or native species to plant and how to manage those pastures and rangelands. Identifying adapted species for multiple uses, whether native, naturalized or introduced germplasm, and understanding the physiological adaptations that will enhance their success in production systems is imperative to their increased use, these tasks are not easy when grasses are far more aggressive and persistent than legumes. Knowledge arising from the Stephenville research program will provide north-central Texas and similar regions around the globe with as many answers to these questions as possible."

Soybean meal is produced from soybeans by an involved process which includes harvest, transport, oil extraction, roasting and grinding. This adds considerable costs to the soybean meal. The meal (or beans) must be heat treated to destroy enzyme inhibitors in the bean. Novel beans are now being developed with improved digestibility and low enzyme inhibitors. These beans must be tested in poultry to determine their suitability for use on a commercial level.

It is a major part of the Asian diet and gaining popularity in other parts of the world. Its popularity is associated with its health-promoting properties including promotion of cardiovascular health and reduction of cancer risk. These health benefits are due to the presence of biologically active compounds in soybean including isoflavones, saponins and bioactive peptides and proteins. Soybean is a high protein, nutrient dense food that possesses biologically active peptides such as lunasin and others. The Food and Drug Administration approved the claim that 25 g of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled studies on the effect of soy protein consumption on risk factors for CVD found a median intake of 30 g/d significantly improved serum lipoprotein. Although chronic inflammation has been implicated as a major contributor to the progression of atherosclerosis, further research into the molecular effect of soy protein would provide potential implications to health. It is extremely important to understand the role of peptides on the health benefits to animals and humans. This will increase the demand for soybeans and thus will benefit U.S. growers. Scientific knowledge will be advanced since the results of this research will be published in scientific journals, will be presented in scientific meetings, and also will be presented to consumers in short non-technical communications.

Tobacco is no longer a viable alternative for many small acreage farmers. Vegetable soybean or Edamame as a cash crop is an ideal substitute because Edamame can be grown as a commodity crop similar to grain-type soybean but is marketed as a high value vegetable if harvested fresh. Because studies over the years on soybean and human health indicated that eating Edamame reduces cancer risks and lowers total and bad cholesterol, domestic demand has been increased with rising consumer awareness, which makes Edamame a potentially profitable crop. Most Edamame on the U.S. market relies on frozen product imported from China and Taiwan. However, the quality of frozen Edamame quickly drops in storage. Fresh Edameme is preferred by consumers, but fresh Edamame supply lasts only a few days every year as a result of short harvest window. Little information of extending Edamame harvest window is available for optimal conjunction of yield and profit. The objectives of this project are to build up an off-season Edamame production system in Virginia in order to extend Edamame harvest window from a few days up to half a year; and to identify optimum Edamame varieties in multiple growing seasons. The field research will be mainly conducted at Randolph farm of Virginia State University, Petersburg, VA from 2013 to 2015. Four released Edamame varieties with maturity groups (MG) from III to VI, GardenSoy 31 (MG III), GardenSoy 41 (MG IV), Moon Cake (MG V), and Randolph (MG VI), will be sowed in greenhouses and transplanted into high tunnels and the field for spring and early summer harvest, and will be successively, directly planted in the field and high tunnels for summer and fall production. Total marketable yield and seed quality traits including moisture and the content of protein, oil, and sucrose of each cultivar will be measured after each harvest to determine whether the production system is feasible and profitable. The findings of this project will help farmers to get maximum profits from extended Edamame production in Mid-Atlantic region."

Use of native warm-season grasses, which are well adapted to drought conditions will extend summer growing period and thus increase annual forage production. Additionally, toll-growing grasses enable goats to feed high off the ground thus minimizing chances of ingesting gastro-intestinal parasite eggs. These bunch grasses also combine better with forage legumes to make high quality forage."

To accurately identify soybean genotypes that perform well in Nebraska production environments, it is imperative that our program involving extensive evaluation of new soybean lines in environments across the state be maintained and enhanced. This will facilitate identification of lines that are better adapted to Nebraska's environments, improving our selection of superior new cultivars, cultivar recommendations to producers, and selection of parents for the breeding program.

Inbreeding can expose novel genetic variation to selection, potentially facilitating adaptation to novel environments, such as following colonization of a new host species. However, the more common effect of inbreeding is inbreeding depression. Unfortunately, we have a poor understanding of how inbreeding is mediated by mating behavior in insects, and even less understanding of how inbreeding depression affects the evolution of dispersal and mating behavior in insects. The proposed experiments will provide insight into how inbreeding is mediated by mating behavior, and how inbreeding depression affects the evolution of mating behavior, in Callosobruchus maculatus, a cosmopolitan pest of stored legumes.

Specifically, the experiments are designed to uncover the functions of effector proteins that oommycete pathogens secrete to the inside of plant cells. The objectives of this project are to understand where these proteins are localized inside plant cells, and to identify the plant proteins that they sabotage. We expect to gain new, broadly applicable knowledge of how disease-causing pathogens manipulate plants to suppress their potent immune systems. Our long-term vision is that foundational knowledge on molecular aspects of these interactions will inspire new control strategies, perhaps based on suppression of effector function.

A return to sustainable vegetable pest management practices will require intensive research on key aspects of its biology and ecology, including its development on, use of, and seasonal patterns of movement between wild and cultivated hosts. As well, development and refinement of ecologically and economically sound practices to mitigate its effects is critical. We seek to understand the host utilization of wild trees and various vegetables in brown marmorated stink bug population ecology.

Coal accounts for 42% of the electricity generation in the US. Burning coal to generate electricity produces large amounts of coal combustion wastes, CCW. Coal combustion wastes can contain toxic substances that are linked to cancers, neurological and birth defects in humans. Nearly sixty percent of CCW generated annually in the US is composed of very fine materials known as fly ash, FA. Currently, FAs are generally stored in massive wet ash ponds, or they are shipped to designated landfills. The historic Kingston TN Fly Ash Spill of 2008 was caused by failure of the containments at such wet ponds at the Tennessee Valley Authority coal plant. One reason for failures of containment systems is the old age. The site of the Kingston ash release has accumulated ash sludge since 1952. An urgent need exists to address disposal of FA. Well recognized, biologically based strategies collectively called bioremediation and phytoremediation, using microbes and plant systems, respectively, currently exist for cleaning up a broad range of wastes. However, they have not been systematically evaluated for FA disposals because FAs are not classified as wastes according to US solid waste regulations. This proposal seeks to extend bio- and phytoremediation to cleaning up FA contaminations. Our own programs have long studied and implemented these strategies for mitigating land degradation using native grasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, big bluestem and Indian grass. These grasses can be used this way because of their high biomass productivity even under harsh conditions. The same grasses are at the forefront of the current intense debates on bioenergy as one strategy for reducing global dependence on petroleum fuels. Accordingly, our current proposal will not only clean up environmental pollution by FA but also, biomass produced during the process will be used as feedstock for biofuel production. Despite their reputation as sources of hazardous chemicals, FAs also contain major and trace elements that are essential for plant growth. Additionally, they can improve water retention and storage characteristics of soils when they are used as amendments for plant growth. Beneficial utilization of FA as soil amendment has been thoroughly documented by investigators from India, the greatest FA producer in the world. In that country, FAs have been used to grow a variety of food crops including rice, corn, legumes and sugar cane. Such use of FA has been proposed in the US, the third largest producer of FA, but less than one percent of the product is used in this way. This may be changing. According to the USDA Deputy Administrator, wise management of CCWs by industry and new beneficial uses will minimize the quantities of CCWs that must be disposed of and sequestered long-term in landfills and impoundment ponds. Our proposal to turn waste to energy feedstock production is an emerging strategy in the current focus on energy security and environmental sustainability."

Access to these new markets is critical for the sustained long-term growth of farming operations in Minnesota. However, we must be careful to maintain balance between access to new markets and support of existing grain and fiber markets. Finding ways to efficiently diversify our cropping systems in a way that captures multiple markets is one way to address these challenges. Diversified cropping systems not only improve market access and potential for increased farm profits, but they also can help address other important issues such as water quality. It is, therefore, important that we think carefully about the research agenda that will ultimately support diverse cropping patterns in Minnesota. I believe that research must first focus on production issues that will ultimately reduce risk to the farmer, industry, and rural communities. Furthermore, we must also be aware of how these production systems impact or possibly provide a solution for environment issues now and in the future. The value gained by selective placement of dedicated biomass crops will come from an understanding of how crop growth and productivity is influenced by terrain, soil properties, and other attributes. Optimizing commodity production (i.e. food, bio-based products, or feedstock for heat/liquid fuels) and environmental benefits (e.g. soil stabilization, phytoremediation, carbon sequestration, and/or wildlife habitat) will require a deeper understanding of growth environments and surrounding landscape structures or features. To that end, we hope to develop knowledge-based decision tools that can be used by farmers and other land managers to design cropping systems that meet market demands for food, fiber, and biomass, address critical environment issues, and optimize profitability. This project will focus on an integrated approach to site preparation and weed control in the establishment phase of woody biomass crop production. Evaluation trials will also be conducted to identify promising willow and poplar lines in collaboration with existing breeding programs at SUNY/Syracuse and NRRI. Information from these trials will allow us to identify which clones are best adapted for this area. I also want to expand the evaluation of new herbaceous plant varieties such as false indigo and perennial flax being developed by a team of faculty in Agronomy and Plant Genetics that show promise in the bioproducts markets. Field work is being conducted at the SROC to characterize a range of attributes/values associated with six biomass cropping systems representing five functional groups; hybrid poplar and willow (woody perennials), alfalfa (perennial legume), perennial flax (perennial forb) switchgrass (perennial grass), and corn (annual grass). Water table depth and soil nitrate concentrations will be measured in each crop and landscape position. We will also obtain separate soil cores to determine the particle-size distribution, organic carbon content, and soil water retention characteristics."

Since then, research coordinated by this project has revealed that viruses cause recurring disease problems with significant impacts on soybean production in the NC region, the principal soybean producing area of the United States. In multiple years, soybean virus diseases were found at near epidemic levels in NC states causing significant yield reductions, decreased pod and seed set, reductions in oil content of seeds, and seed discoloration. Disease outbreaks were paralleled by abundant insect vector populations associated with these viruses. For example, mild winters allowed bean leaf beetles, which efficiently transmit Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV), to overwinter and immigrate into soybean fields at unprecedented levels, which resulted in very high incidences of BPMV early in the growing season when soybean plants are most sensitive. The spatial and temporal distributions of populations of the introduced soybean aphid, which transmits Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) and several other viruses, also varied greatly from year to year. Emergence of unsuspected viruses in NC soybean fields, such as Soybean dwarf virus, Tobacco streak virus (TSV) and newly discovered viruses like Soybean vein necrosis virus and Soybean yellow mottle mosaic virus have also added complications to this situation. While single-gene resistance has been identified for at least some strains of AMV, SMV, and TSV, effective control options for the other viruses remain to be elaborated. This project will coordinate research on soybean-infecting viruses among concerned scientists with the goal of identifying management options that reduce losses to soybean producers."

The dry bean industry as a whole will benefit indirectly with the identification and develop such sources of heat tolerance germplasm/cultivars. Identification of sources of bacterial brown spot resistance in dry beans will lead to the use of fewer chemicals favoring the environment and reducing production costs. Release of chickpea cultivars with Ascochyta blight resistance will lower costs and reduce pesticide use, making this a viable alternate crop in Nebraska. Identifying chickpea types that will bring the greatest value to regional production will facilitate this region becoming a competitive production area.

Many developing nations depend on beans for nutrition, particularly where protein from animal sources is scarce. One of the problems affecting bean yield worldwide is susceptibility to diseases. This is true for Nebraska, USA, Africa and Latin America, particular areas of emphasis of my research. Dry beans are also an important cash crop on irrigated land in western Nebraska. Bean rust is now endemic in Nebraska and the high plains. Developing plants with resistance to diseases is a management strategy that is sustainable and does not result in any cost to the grower. However, the rust pathogen is one of the most variable plant pathogens known. Thus, strategies to deploy new resistance genes such as using multiple genes in any one variety needs to be available. A similar situation exists for root rot pathogens such as Rhizoctonia solani, which has high variability and causes root and crown rot as well as web blight on common bean. White mold is a disease caused by a fungus that is not only a problem for bean growers but is also a pathogen on 400 other host species, including vegetables, forage legumes, and oilseed crops such as soybeans. Disease resistance is the most cost effective management strategy for white mold but has been difficult to identify and breed into beans/soybeans. This project will provide guidance for use of pathogen isolates to improve resistance screening by studying characteristics of pathogen isolates from all major bean and soybean production areas, searching for new sources of resistance, and collaborating with plant breeders to incorporate resistance into new germplasm and varieties. The long survival time of the fungal pathogen in soil, its wide host range of broad-leaf weeds and other plants and for high yield management of dry beans and soybeans by growers creates a favorable disease environment that ensures that it will be a soybean production risk for the foreseeable future."

Eight of the top ten commodities in Michigan are field crops, or dependent on field crops (livestock, egg production). Corn is the leading crop in the state in acreage (2.5 million acres) and cash value, followed by soybean (1.9 million acres). Unlike neighboring corn-belt states driven by corn and beans, Michigan grows a diversity of field crops, ranking first in several types of dry beans and fourth in sugarbeets. Other field crops include alfalfa, pasture, and other forages; small grains such as wheat, barley, oats, and rye. With the global demand for grain for direct consumption and livestock feed, as well as for biofuels, crop prices are at a high and field crop acreage is expanding in the state. Invasive species were and continue to be a major problem in the U.S. Michigan is a potential hot-spot for insect introductions, home to Great Lakes shipping ports, airports in Detroit and Chicago with non-stop flights to Asia, and a diverse crop base vulnerable to colonization by many species. Other invaders, foreign and native, are expanding in their range into Michigan. Thus producers are presented with new challenges from both foreign-invasive and native-invasive species that increase in pest status or range. Established and new insect invaders are now responsible for the majority of insect-caused yield and quality loss in Michigan field crops, influencing pest management decisions, driving insecticide use and reducing profitability. Tied in with invasive species is the issue of climate change. For some field crop insect pests, damage is getting worse and the damage period is growing longer during the season. A reality in field crop production is the use of biotechnology, specifically genetically modified crops with herbicide resistance or Bt insecticide toxin. According to the USDA Economic Research Service, 86% of the corn, and 91% of the soybean, acres in Michigan were transgenic in the 2012 planting season. Because universities have little role in the development of this technology, land grant entomologists are viewed as neutral observers and thus have an important role to play in education and making public statements. A by-product of the introduction of Bt crops is overuse. Growers plant hybrids expressing insecticides that they don't need, exposing insect populations to traits year-after-year. This is antithetical to the principles of integrated pest management, because it increases the chance for resistance. This project concentrates on understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive species, climate change and use of technology. The long term goal is to generate research and recommendations to producers that reduce unnecessary insecticide use, protecting growers profitability, the environment and human health."

Soybeans are produced in 31 states and 3 provinces in the eastern, central, and southern U.S and Canada, from Quebec to Florida, and Delaware to Nebraska. Given this large acreage and wide distribution, it is not surprising that soybean continues to suffer from insect pests that impact plant growth, grain quality, and yield. As in many other production systems, invasive species are an issue of increasing importance in soybean production. The introduction of a single species can significantly and negatively impact the profitability of soybean production, and increase risks to human health and the environment. In the northern U.S. and eastern Canada, the discovery of the soybean aphid (SBA) in 2000 fundamentally changed soybean insect management. SBA feeding impacts all components of yield; under heavy aphid pressure, yield differences between treated and untreated research plots may reach 50%. On a landscape level, SBA outbreaks often correspond to potyvirus outbreaks in dry beans, snap beans, vine crops, and potato, broadening the impact of this invasive insect. From an economic standpoint, SBA infestation increases the cost of soybean production. In 1999, the year prior to discovery of SBA, the National Agricultural Statistics Service estimated that less than 1% of the soybean acres in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio were treated with insecticide (NASS 2000). In 2005, an outbreak year, estimated insecticide use in these same states ranged from 9% (IL) to 42% (MI) (NASS 2006); in 2006, when outbreaks were more sporadic, 56% of the acreage in Minnesota was treated (NASS 2007). At least 20 different foliar and seed-applied insecticides are now used for aphid control on millions of acres, adding $10-$20 per acre to production costs (Song et al. 2006). To move beyond chemical use, particularly to control SBA and other chronic pests, alternatives are critically needed. These alternatives include both biological control and host plant resistance, preventative tactics which form the foundation of IPM, and which must be integrated with therapeutic tactics such as insecticide use. Significant progress in developing resistant varieties has been made since SBA was first discovered as a pest in North America in 2000. However, the rapid progress and success in developing resistant varieties and germplasm is complicated by the identification of SBA biotypes capable of overcoming plant resistance (Kim et al. 2008; Hill et al. 2010). Three separate biotypes have been reported in peer-reviewed publications and there are unofficial reports of even more, indicating that a significant amount of aphid biotype variation already exists in natural populations. This shows the need for continued discovery of more sources of resistance, specifically tolerance and the incorporation of these resistance genes into new varieties. In addition to discovery and breeding of aphid resistance genes, we require more information on the mechanisms and physiological function of SBA resistance (specifically tolerance)."

This region is marked by high variability in climate, elevation, and geology. Perhaps the most consistent characteristic of this landscape is limited moisture. Many of the crops and rangeland environments are unique to western Nebraska, and some are specific to only the panhandle in relation to the whole of Nebraska. In 2009, the key row crops grown in this region were harvested off of > 10.8 million acres and were valued at > $6.5 billion across Nebraska. All of these crops fit into an agricultural system that has at least one key pest that can impact both production quantity and quality. Numerous insecticides have been removed from the market in recent years, in part due to mandates by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Furthermore, due in part to the goals of FIFRA, there have been added incentives to decrease pesticide use. To meet these challenges, in the face of increasing pest pressures, technologies have been developed that enable the application of reduced rates of active ingredient (e.g., seed-applied, systemic insecticides), plant incorporated pesticides via transgenic technologies (e.g.expression of cry toxins), or through enhanced conventional breeding programs assisted by technologies that improve our understanding and deployment of host plant resistance. The interactions of these management tools within the ecological context of the Central High Plains have not been fully explored. Once an insects role and pest status becomes defined for a commodity, integrated pest management provides managers with a standard practice for integrating multiple control tactics. However, much of agricultural production is managed within a context of active pest suppression without appropriate consideration of interacting factors beyond the intended target. Furthermore, the current basis of IPM, the economic injury level, does not explicitly integrate these interacting factors into its calculations. However, recent research concerning biotic stress and tritrophic interactions could give us better understanding of the basis for the compatibility of current management tools for biologically-based pest management. Thus, this project seeks to integrate host plant resistance and ecosystem services for crop profitability and sustainability. This will be pursued via three focus crops in which to study various aspects of plant-insect interactions. Standard methodologies will be used to discover new information about insect-plant interactions, deliver information and products to clientele, and provide practical, hands-on workshops for best practices in product use. This project will benefit crop production in Nebraska. Biotic stress and plant defense investigations across diverse host-pest complexes will facilitate sustainable production practices. Public dry bean varieties and knowledge will be provided that improve yield and quality with fewer inputs. Sugar beet producers be able to adopt best management practices of insect control.

The fungal endophytes, Undifilum spp., are primarily or completely responsible for SWA in locoweeds. We have found the fungal endophyte-locoweed interaction to be in effect physiologically asymptomatic although there are locoweed taxa (A. mollissimus var. thompsonae or var. matthewsii), which have evolved to no longer host an alkaloid-producing endophyte as compared to their progenitor locoweed taxon (A. mollissimus var. mollissimus) suggesting a trade-off exists. Interestingly, our recent findings show a suppression of some wound-induced volatile compounds in the terpenoid and phenolic pathways in E+ plants over that of E- plants, while there is an enhancement of methyl salicylate production, suggesting the plant is compensating to maintain herbivory and pollinator cues in the presence of the fungus. We propose to explore how the endophyte&#39;s apparent influence on volatile chemistry alters host plant herbivory and reproductive fitness. We hypothesize that the locoweed taxa which have evolved to lack the alkaloid-producing endophyte (E-) compensate for herbivory or pollinator cues and unlike grass endophytes, instead of enhancing primary metabolism, alternately invest in secondary metabolite production other than the alkaloid produced by its fungal endophyte (E+). We propose to define the unique biochemical and molecular mechanisms which control these interactions and thus increase our understanding of mutualistic or commensalistic plant-endophyte interactions while exploring how endophytes regulate plant reproductive fitness. This knowledge will also increase our ability to manage locoweed to avoid livestock or wildlife poisoning."

They provide humans food (pulses and vegetables), forage for ruminants, ecosystem plant diversity, fuels (wood or cellulosic bioenergy), cover crops, green manure, and many other essential services. Cultivated forages and rangelands are important components of agricultural production in north-central Texas and similar low-rainfall regions of the southeastern USA. Forages are utilized for traditional animal husbandry such as wildlife, cattle production, small ruminant feed, dairy silage, or commercialization of hay and silage. In operations catering to urban centers, the uses are less traditional, including natural ecosystems restoration, wildlife habitat and feed and even ornamental gardening. Forage species are also used to address environmental concerns such as soil bioremediation, soil conservation, green manures, renewable biofuels and landscape restoration. Current growth areas for legumes in north-central Texas include low-input forage systems, soil conservation, right-of-way restoration, ruminant nutrition and health, locally grown dairy forage, and wildlife. In addition, growth potential exists for expanded use of cultivated forages in biomass (bioenergy) as well as soil conservation and phytoremediation (riparian buffers and fallow cropland). The inexorable attrition of row-cropping in the Cross Timbers, caused by soil exhaustion and inappropriate climate, may also contribute to increased pasture and forage acreage in the near future. As the cost of nitrogen fertilizer and fuels continue to rise, the use of legumes as self-regenerating, inexpensive sources of nitrogen in crop rotations and as green manures becomes more attractive. This research program at Stephenville will focus on the multiple uses of herbaceous, brushy and arboreal legumes through a diverse program. The common thread will be increased inclusion of legumes. Legumes make ecological and environmental sense for pasture, rangeland or roadside revegetation, soil conservation, ruminant nutrition, or natural ecosystems regeneration in north-central Texas. This is not an easy prospect in a culture that is not accustomed to managing for legumes and in a climate that has both hot dry summer conditions and freezing winters. Land managers, even when they care, are not always sure which introduced or native species to plant and how to manage those pastures and rangelands. Identifying adapted species for multiple uses, whether native, naturalized or introduced germplasm, and understanding the physiological adaptations that will enhance their success in production systems is imperative to their increased use, these tasks are not easy when grasses are far more aggressive and persistent than legumes. Knowledge arising from the Stephenville research program will provide north-central Texas and similar regions around the globe with as many answers to these questions as possible."

They have this ability because they typically consist of large populations with abundant amounts of heritable variation for traits needed to overcome the particular challenge. Similarly, plant-feeding insects are often observed to expand their host ranges by evolving the ability to attack a newly encountered crop species or cultivar. Pest populations can quickly surmount specific plant defenses incorporated into crops by either classical breeding or transgenic methods. The research proposed here will add to our knowledge of the mechanisms by which change their diet breadth, and begin to infest crops previously considered unsuitable to a given pest. We plan a series of experiments that, taken together, will address a series of longstanding questions in plant/insect interactions. These questions include: Are there trade-offs associated with attacking a new crop host, such as a simultaneous decrease in performance on the ancestral host? How many genes and which genes are involved in the process of genetic adaptation to a novel resource? Are the same genes (e.g., key detoxification enzymes) involved in adapting to several novel hosts, or are there specific genetic mechanisms involved in each distinct process of adaptation to each new host? Does the rapid acquisition of the ability to use a very poor host make an insect population  pre-adapted  to attach other hosts to which they have never been exposed (as a kind of cross-adaptation)? Which traits are more evolutionarily labile in the process of adapting to a new crop (e.g., larval physiology vs. adult egg-laying behavior)? The experiments described in this proposal will use a seed beetle-grain legume model system to evaluate these issues and others. Callosobruchus maculatus attacks several Old-World grain legumes, and is one of the most destructive post-harvest (storage) pests in the world. Experimental evolution in the laboratory (also called quasi-natural selection) can be used to answer questions that are not as easily addressed by field pests or natural populations. Because the process of adaptation in nature is often not recognized until well after it has occurred, the underlying genetic mechanisms that actually mediated the switch to a new host are confounded by potential genetic changes that may have occurred after the insect was already well adapted to the new host, or may have occurred in response to some other (non-host) component of the environment. Consequently, there are few cases to permit generalizations concerning the typical genetic changes (or amount of genetic change) accompanying host shifts by plant-feeding insects. Because C. maculatus is a storage pest that has attacked human stores for at least a few thousand years, the laboratory provides an unusually close approximation of its &#39;natural&#39; habitat. Its short generation time and simple rearing requirements make it an ideal candidate to provide a realistic assessment of mechanisms by which insects modify their host ranges."

Most ideas for sustainable agriculture include legumes as a major component since some of the nitrogen they produce is available to succeeding crops. Our focus is on the metabolism that underlies this symbiosis. Using various approaches grounded in bacterial genetics and physiology, we are attempting to understand what compounds the bacteria gets from its host plant and how use of these compounds is coupled to nitrogen fixation, a very energetically expensive process."

Cancer is defined as uncontrolled cell growth influenced by both environmental and genetic factors.  While therapies for established cancers have existed for a while and are heavily researched, substances that prevent cancer have not received as much attention.  A variety of different agents exist that may prevent or slow disease progression.  We propose to investigate two of these, Lactoferrin (LF) and soy, and their relevance in chemoprevention of prostate cancer (PCa).  LF is a protein that is naturally found in secretory fluids such as milk, saliva, and tears.  Although its mode of action is not completely understood, it has been found to have both anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties.  Soybean, or soy, is a legume that is a universally important crop that is grown in the vast majority of agricultural populations.  Animal models are the closest surrogate to human cancers that we currently use.  A genetically driven mouse model that we developed that incorporates two important genes associated with human PCa, MYC and Pten, accurately resembles all of the phenotypic stages of human disease.  There are two specific aims for the proposed work.  The first aim is to test the chemopreventative effects that LF and soy have when added to the diet of this mouse model.  In the second aim, genetic analysis will reveal important changes associated with disease progression and the changes associated with dietary addition of LF.  The proposed work may provide insight into the clinical use of LF or soy in the chemoprevention of human PCa and contribute towards my success as a postdoctoral fellow and prostate cancer researcher.I recently started my Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in the Department of Pathology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine under the direction of Dr. Karen Sfanos, mentor, and Dr. Angelo De Marzo, co-mentor.  My goal is to complete 3-4 years of postdoctoral research and then apply for a full-time, tenure-track position at a research hospital or university.  The guidance and support that will be provided to me from Dr. Sfanos and Dr. De Marzo will be instrumental in making the proposed research and my postdoctoral fellowship a success.  In addition, the collaborative support from Dr. Charles Bieberich at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Dr. Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine will provide excellent resources that will allow me to expand my knowledge about prostate cancer and develop new skills to make me a better researcher.The proposed research can have an immediate impact on patients without and with prostate cancer.  If the addition of LF or soy to the diet prevents cancer altogether, then a diet supplemented with one of these natural substances can be initiated early in the life of high-risk individuals to prevent disease.  If it is shown to slow cancer progression, then individuals diagnosed with early stage disease can add one of the substances to their diet to prevent metastatic spread.  Lastly, if it is shown that the addition LF or soy to the diet prolongs survival, then individuals at any stage of disease may benefit from these substances.  Natural substances have been used to treat a variety of different human disorders.  Both LF and soy are known to be non-toxic in humans; therefore, the relative risk is extremely low, but the benefits could be substantial.  The proposed research may provide valuable insight into the use of these chemopreventative substances in all aspects of prostate cancer prevention and treatment.The benefits of the proposed study to use natural substances to prevent or treat prostate cancer in a mouse model that closely mimics all of the stages of human prostate cancer may be substantial and would certainly represent a paradigm shift in the field.  Furthermore, the Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program Postdoctoral Training Award will also provide the means to establish myself as a dedicated prostate cancer researcher."

While food packaging has dominated this market, flexible packaging is also being used extensively in the pharmaceutical sector. Unfortunately despite all efforts, less than 10 % of plastic waste generated is successfully recycled in the U.S.A [2]. About 5.8 million tons of flexible-packaging waste is generated annually in the U.S.A (40 lbs per capita). The vast majority of plastic waste generated ends up in landfills. Improper disposal has also resulted in the accumulation of billions of pounds of plastic in vast ocean gyres. While biodegradable polymers such as corn starch derived poly(lactic acid) [PLA] are available commercially, the oxygen and water vapor barrier properties of these polymers are extremely poor and hence they cannot be used directly for food packaging. Metallization of biodegradable plastics using aluminum can improve moisture and oxygen barrier properties [ 3 ]. However studies investigating effect of aluminum in contact with food indicate leaching and contamination problems especially in the case of packaging of acidic food such as coffee beans. Multiple coatings or lamination (with often non-biodegradable films) is essential to prevent direct contact of aluminum with the food. Metallization also causes problems with biodegradation of the films and metals or metal oxides are released into the composting environment [4]. There is an immediate need for the development of biobased and biodegradable films with improved barrier properties suitable for food packaging.Objectives:The objective of the proposed research effort is to develop novel biobased coatings and appropriate processes to significantly enhance the gas barrier properties of bio-derived flexible packaging films such as PLA. This novel, packaging solution will lead to the creation of biodegradable films with good oxygen and moisture barrier properties suitable for food packaging, as a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based non-biodegradable films. The proposed research utilizes biobased materials like chitosan (derived from exoskeletons of crabs) and beeswax to enhance the barrier properties of these plastics. This project seeks to support the three pillars of sustainability &ndash; people, prosperity and planet by addressing a huge problem caused by environmentally-persistent plastics packaging waste. Specific goals of the first phase of the project are stated in the list below:Use of Renewable, non-toxic and biodegradable starting materials for coating PLA in accordance to the principles of green chemistry and engineering. The selected starting materials should be low cost and abundantly available (such as chitosan and beeswax).Develop method for modifying the surface energy of the films (corona treatment) to facilitate electrostatic layer-by-layer deposition of Chitosan from solution.Optimize the coating thickness by systematically varying concentration and pH of the Chitosan solution so that appropriate oxygen barrier properties and surface chemistry for the coating of the subsequent layer(s) can be achieved.Develop appropriate moisture barrier layers based on fatty acids or biodegradable beeswax and a process for coating it.Optimize coating materials and processes to achieve an Oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of less than 50.0 cm3/m2 day and Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR) of less than 8 g/m2 day at (38&deg;C, 90% RH) &ndash; the specification for coffee bean packaging application.Characterize the film with the coatings at every stage: Film thickness measurement using optical profilometry or deposition of coatings on a quartz crystal microbalance.

The Rhg1 locus is in widespread commercial use as the primary tool to reduce SCN damage, but the molecular basis of the trait has remained largely unknown. We recently isolated the Rhg1  gene  and discovered that it is actually a block of three different genes, and that this three-gene block is present in as many as ten repeated copies in the genome of SCN-resistant soybean varieties. Still, essentially nothing is known about how the proteins encoded by these genes confer SCN resistance. For the present project we propose to identify molecular mechanisms by which the three dissimilar Rhg1 gene products confer resistance to soybean cyst nematodes.

Root colonization by AM fungi (AMF) triggers profound physiological changes in the host plant thereby affecting other interactions with above- and below-ground organisms. Though, it has been proposed that the plant hormone, jasmonic acid plays a central role in AMF-induced resistance (AIR), the exact mechanisms involved in tripartite interactions (especially in crops) still remain unclear. In many cases, AMF-crop associations exist in the field under natural conditions, so it is essential to better understand the influence of AMF on plant-insect interactions, not only because of the AM symbiosis&#39; important role in nutrient cycling, but also, because of the deleterious effects caused by insects on crop yield and as vectors of devastating plant pathogens. This Seed Grant starts to fill the void regarding the potential impacts of AIR in potato especially against insects. It will allow us to establish the experimental conditions to study two tripartite interactions: 1) potato with AMF and potato aphids, and 2) potato with AMF and cabbage loopers. The research goals are: a) to evaluate the conditions to create a rigorous biological system to study AMF-potato-insect interactions, b) to examine the effects of above-ground insect herbivory and below-ground AMF colonization on potato plant physiology, and assess organism performance in these tripartite interactions, and c) to determine the impact of AIR in potato against insects of two feeding-guilds.We expect that: i) AMF-root colonized potato plants will exhibit enhanced systemic resistance against shoot herbivores; and ii) the AM-symbiosis will counteract the detrimental effects caused by insect herbivory. These are supported by our preliminary data showing that mycorrhizal barrel medic plants had fewer pea aphids feeding on them compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. The data obtained through this Seed Grant will strengthen a future grant proposal to AFRI aiming at elucidating the mechanisms through which AMF alter potato-insect interactions. The project outcomes will serve as a foundation to achieve our long-term goals of discovering genes useful in developing insect-resistant crops; therefore, this research has significance in enhancing food security and has practical applications for U.S. agriculture. Furthermore, the proposed project explores an environment-friendly approach to reduce the use of phosphate fertilizers and pesticides, thus it is of an urgent nature to the AFRI&#39;s priority area: Plant-Associated Insects and Nematodes."

This proposal addresses Program Area Priority  Understanding Plant-Associated Microorganisms and Plant-Microbe Interactions  (Priority A1121). The specific part of this program priority addressed is the  determination of molecular mechanisms of communication between plant-associated microorganisms (e.g....nitrogen-fixing bacterial endosymbionts) and their plant hosts.  The rationale for the proposed project is that symbiotic, nitrogen-fixing bacteria are extremely important for increasing productivity in agriculture and reducing nitrogen fertilizer usage. It is therefore necessary to gain a thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which these bacteria invade and colonize their plant hosts, in order to improve these processes in the native symbionts and hosts and ultimately transfer the capacity to perform these processes to non-native symbionts and hosts. The proposed research aims to determine the molecular mechanisms of communication between the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti and its agriculturally important hosts, the forage legumes Medicago sativa (alfalfa) and Medicago truncatula (barrel medic). Specifically, our long-term goals are to determine how the rhizobial exopolysaccharide succinoglycan facilitates bacterial invasion of plant roots, why chemical modifications to succinoglycan and its size distribution have a profound effect on invasion efficiency, and how the plant host perceives and responds to succinoglycan to build an  infection thread  pathway for the bacteria to invade plant roots. This work will also provide fundamental information about the interaction between bacterial acidic exopolysaccharides and host plant cells. These exopolysaccharides are important determinants in interactions between plants and pathogenic bacteria as well as symbiotic bacteria."

The overall objective of this project is to evaluate and develop this trait as a tool to improve drought tolerance in maize and eventually other crops. Specifically, we will: 1. Confirm the physiological utility of CCFN for root growth, soil exploration, and water capture from drying soil in controlled environments. 2. Identify genes underlying natural variation in CCFN and develop stocks that will support mechanistic assessment of its regulation and utility. 3. Evaluate the utility of CCFN for drought tolerance in the field in rainout shelters in PA and a field research facility in AZ. Defining and understanding traits enhancing drought tolerance is of considerable importance for keeping American agriculture competitive while ending world hunger, as well as adapting to climate change, two of NIFA&#39;s grand challenges. CCFN could be an entirely new tool for improving drought tolerance of crops. In addition to drought, CCFN may be useful in the acquisition of limiting soil nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. While this project focuses on maize, we have observed variation for CCFN in rice, sorghum, and common bean, so this trait may have broad utility.

This project will focus on two common arid lands plants, Gindelia squarrosa (curtly top gumweed), and Ericameria nauseosa (rabbitbrush). Both plants are prevalent in the intermountain west on lands that are not generally suitable for food and feed crops, and both have potential as biofuel sources, but also for higher value industrial and consumer products. Rabbitbrush produces rubber, and gumweed produces a chemical, grindelic acid, which has properties similar to the industrial product, abietic acid. Thus, this investigation, by engineers, chemists and agronomists will examine a variety of avenues to produce fuels and biomaterials on lands that will not compete with food crops. Extensive arid lands exist in the western US, which are not suitable for growing food crops, but which might contribute significantly to biofuels production, particularly for plants that have relatively low water requirements. Gumweed (Grindelia squarrosa) is a hardy and versatile plant, indigenous throughout the Great Basin of Nevada, which has been successfully cultivated in an experimental setting. A biocrude oil is extracted from gumweed at about 70-85 gal/acre on an annualized basis in amounts comparable to that of soy beans, except that gumweed needs much less water. To utilize marginal arid land, which is unprofitable for food crop cultivation, for growing the dedicated energy crop can be truly valuable. It is estimated that if even 10% of sagebrush lands of Nevada are used to grow gumweed for aviation biofuels, 400-600 million gallons per year of jet biofuels could be produced, which can supply up to 20% the single largest fuel customer, the US military (jet fuel consumption was ~3.0 billion gallons in FY2008 (Andrews, 2009)). These considerations make gumweed a local solution in Nevada (as well as much of the intermountain west) to a national initiative. Cultivated gumweed contains 12-14% extractable hydrocarbons on a dry plant weight basis, and is composed of 60-75% grindelic acid. Grindelic acid is an excellent biomass feedstock source for jet fuel. Besides grindelic acid, the gumweed biocrude contains other terpenes, which, together with grindelic acid, are prone to forming coke at elevated temperatures. While both biodiesel and aviation fuel potential will be examined, the higher valued aviation fuel will receive the primary focus."

This allows for habitat management to improve wildlife and ecosystem restoration. Most of the CRP acreages in the Southeast have been planted to pine trees (loblolly, slash and longleaf) . These trees range in age from 10 to 17 years, requiring a management system that will make them productive and profitable, sustainable forestry practices are being sought. Silvopasture systems integrate trees, forages, livestock and related animals and plant species. Landowners derive impressive revenues and sustainable land use from silvopasture when practised.This project involves the participation of selected CRP landowners in three separate counties in the Tri-State areas of North Florida, South Georgia and Southeast Alabama). A two-tree-row methodology will be used in two acres of CRP land as trees will be thinned from a spacing of 12 ft x 12 ft to a spacing of 12 ft x 42 ft for the demonstration trials. For rotational grazin g purposes, 1 beef cattle and 5-7 goats will be grazed on bahia grass estblished in between tree rows in electrically fenced paddocks. Data will be collected on livestock performance, tree growth and pasture indicated by grazing response. We anticipate two main outcomes from this project: a brochure and a DVD detailing the various steps needed to successfully implement and mange a silvopasture system while converting CRP trees into a a sustainable forestry program. Secondly, a greater awareness for silvopasture among landowners and extension agents."

In particular, cowpea aphids that attack black locust trees are infected with a symbiont known as  Arsenophonus  and are alsotoxic thepredatory Asian ladybeetle, Harmonia axyridis.In this project, we test the hypothesis that Arsenophonus actually causes ladybeetle death, using aphid isolines in which we have experimentally manipulated infection by the bacteria. We will measure the fitness of ladybeetles exposed to aphid-produced toxins, and also evaluate whether the bacteria affect host plant usage by the aphid, thus determining the distribution and pest status of the toxic aphids across the landscape. Finally, we will investigate whether toxin production by these aphids compromises biological control of the aphids. In other words, are toxic aphids less likely to be eaten by predators, and thus worse pests, thanks to their toxin? This project will ultimately shed light on how bacterial symbionts affect the interactions between pest insects and beneficial predatory insects."

Traditional soil carbon models assume that soil C is linearly related to plant C inputs; however multiple studies have shown alternative relationships. For example, non-linearities appear to exist, where soil C is higher in systems receiving fewer C inputs. Such is the case at the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) Long Term Ecological Research site in SW Michigan, where the organic cropping systems have higher C concentrations despite lower total C inputs. This research hypothesizes that the observed non-linear relationships between plant C inputs and soil C sequestration can be explained by differences in microbial physiological traits and their response to plant resource quality. The potential significance of microbial physiology in driving non-linear soil C relationships arises from recent evidence that stable C is largely comprised of microbial biomass residues and byproducts. As such, soils characterized by high microbial biomass production may result in greater rates of stable SOM formation. If true, this has major implications for how we manage our soils: plant inputs that promote microbial activity and efficient growth, such as energetically favorable plant litter (i.e. legume covercrops) may be more effective at building soil C. To pursue this hypothesis the organic and conventional agricultural field sites from the KBS LTER will be used, where known non- linearities in soil C exist. These sites which differ in their plant input chemistry will be examined for differences in key traits of microbial biomass production (growth efficiency and growth rate) over two-year-long cropping cycles. Microbial physiology will be linked with how new C inputs are processed into various soil C pools and biomarker analyses will determine how differences in observed C allocation strategies influence the production of stable microbially-derived soil C. Results from this research could encourage new approaches for agricultural management and land-use conservation that emphasize building soil C by increasing microbial biomass production. Not only will this research advance our fundamental knowledge of soil C formation, but it will inform crop residue and soil C management decisions that impact long-term predictions of soil C stabilization and climate change mitigation."

This mutualism culminates in the formation of a new plant organ, called the root nodule, within which the bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a biological form that can be directly consumed by the plant. One striking feature of the symbiosis is its high level of specificity. Such specificity can occur at the early phase of the interaction that is associated with bacterial infection and nodulation as well as at the late phase of nodule development that is related to nitrogen fixation. Genetic control of symbiosis specificity is complex, involving complex signal communication between the symbiotic partners. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the signaling pathways leading to root nodule development, the molecular mechanisms underlying natural variation in nitrogen fixation efficiency/specificity are largely unknown. The goal of this proposal is to explore host genetic control mechanisms underlying strain-specific nitrogen fixation in the legume-rhizobial symbiosis using the Medicago-Sinorhizobium model."

Priorities address farm efficiency, profitability and the protection of natural resources and environment.Small farms in rural Vermont are typically isolated and underserved by conventional avenues of information and technical assistance. Farmers are consumed by daily workload and have difficulty leaving the farm for management planning or educational events, resulting in a competitive disadvantage and posing a risk to the viability of sustaining their farm business.An integrated team of outreach professionals will work directly with 150 farms in the Champlain Valley to provide technical assistance and outreach support to plan and implement improved crop practices and supporting program implementation. The result will be a measured increase in farm profitability and environmental sustainability through improved soil health, increased crop production, enhanced pasture grazing management and alternative crop production systems.On-farm research trials will demonstrate the use of diversified cover crop mixtures to provide supplemental feed, increase soil organic matter, cycle on-farm nutrients and protect soil from erosion. Cover crop  cocktails  will include three-way legume, grass and forb mixes for nitrogen fixation, biomass production and to relieve soil compaction. Extension outreach will include monthly news articles, farm meeting presentations, cover crop enterprise budgets, and written guides for farmers describing best practices for cover crop production on heavy clay soils."

Like all aerobic organisms, terrestrial insects need oxygen to survive because it is important for generation of catabolic ATP. Hermetic storage is a widely adopted technique for preventing stored grain from being damaged by storage insect pests. This cultural control measure uses airtight containers and preserves grains by limiting access to oxygen required for insect development. By sealing grains in airtight bags and containers, the respiration of the feeding and growing insects raise levels of carbon dioxide while utilizing the oxygen, resulting in hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions. Such an environment is intended to cause insects to cease feeding, growing and reproducing, and eventually to die. However, many insects are very tolerant to oxygen deprivation, and can recover from hours to days of hypoxia exposure. This poses a difficulty in using hermetic storage as a means to control insect pests, leading to more loss of stored grains. Storage insecticides have human health and environmental consequences and are becoming less and less favorable. To protect and promote this cost-effective and environmentally friendly storage practice, it is imperative to have a deeper understanding of insect adaptive response to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Unfortunately, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms mounted by storage pests in response to hypoxia. We plan to use the cowpea bruchid as our model to dissect the complex transcriptional regulation of hypoxia-responsive genes. A genomic approach will identify a group of hypoxia-responsive genes from cowpea bruchids. We will study the transcriptional regulation of selected genes by identification of their interacting cis- and trans-factors. We expect that the results of these analyses will help expose insects&#39; resistance mechanisms against hypoxia, and possibly identify new vulnerable sites in adaptive regulatory pathways useful for pest management strategies in legumes and many other valuable food grains."

This research is to take the advantage of recently-developed high-throughput sequencing technology-based restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to map the genes controlling drought and heat tolerance and to develop SNP markers, the latest DNA marker technology, enabling efficient manipulation of heat and drought tolerances in cowpea and related species. We previously developed the methods efficient for high-throughput assay of drought and heat tolerance in cowpea, identified a number of drought and/or heat highly-tolerant lines and developed a recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population for genetically analyzing drought and heat tolerance. In this research, we will genetically analyze the drought and heat tolerance of the population, map the related genes and develop tools enabling effectively manipulating the traits. This research will not only map the drought and heat tolerant genes in cowpea, but also provide a platform for mapping the genes controlling several other biotic and abiotic stress tolerances such as aphid resistance and low-phosphorus tolerance, both of which are also of extreme significance for agricultural production of many crops. The drought and heat tolerant genes, once defined and cloned, will significantly advance our understanding of molecular basis underlying plant drought and heat tolerances, and help design tools enabling effectively combining multiple adaptive traits into new cultivars adapted to global changing climate in this and related crops, thus supporting the long-term genetic improvement in and sustainability of U.S. agriculture and food systems."

Their knowledge of healthy foods was extensive. They developed sophisticated agricultural systems that gave us beans, corn, potatoes, squash, tomatoes, and many other foods (Keoke &amp; Porterfield 2003). Their knowledge of medicinal plants was also extensive. They could cure scurvy centuries before Europeans and more that 200 indigenous drugs they used have been in the pharmacopoeia of the United States since 1820 (Vogel 1970). Thus, it is hardly surprising that traditional diets and lifestyles allowed them to enjoy excellent health and freedom from chronic disease. The picture of American Indian / Alaska Native (AI/AN) health today is very different. AI/AN have among the highest levels of health problems of all ethnicities in the U.S. in each of these areas: overweight / obesity, diabetes, alcoholism, drug abuse, heart disease, suicide, family violence, tobacco use, life expectancy, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and more. Many of these challenges are compounded by extreme poverty.Fortunately, solutions are available. Research shows that culturally-based approaches to addressing these challenges among AI/AN are more likely to succeed than non-cultural approaches (Halpern 2007; Minkler &amp; Wallerstein 2003; Smedley &amp; Syme 2000). For example, in a recent study among the Pima, participants were assessed for ethnic diet-type preference - Pima, Anglo, or mixed. Those who followed the traditional Pima diet had higher intakes of complex carbohydrates, vegetable proteins, dietary fiber, insoluble fiber, and the proportion of total calories from complex carbohydrates and vegetable proteins. The risk of developing diabetes in the Anglo-diet group was 2.5 times as high as in the Pima-diet group and 1.3 times higher in the mixed diet group than in the Pima-diet group (Williams et al. 2001).In addition to their impact on obesity, poor food behaviors also play a negative role in the continuum of substance abuse. Research shows that AI/AN and others who drink the largest quantity of alcohol, even infrequently, have the poorest eating habits, while people who drink the least amount of alcohol have the best quality diets (Breslow et al. 2006). While many tribal agencies throughout the United States engage in work related to wellness through traditional plants and foods, there is often little collaboration between these organizations. Most are burdened by incredibly heavy workloads. As such, tribal health clinics, schools, commodity foods programs, elders&#39; center, and similar programs often focus on only their own turf. The conference for which we are seeking funding brings representatives of these programs together, giving them opportunities to teach and learn from each other while initiating ongoing relationships that will benefit all.As our Plants Program gained success and notoriety in tribal communities throughout the region, we recognized the need for an organization focused on sharing not only the successes and resources of our program, but also those of other similar programs making a difference in Indian Country. With support from a National Institute of Food and Agriculture grant, we established the NWIC Institute for Indigenous Foods &amp; Traditions in 2011. The Institute&#39;s mission is: By embracing ancestral knowledge and identifying successful models of change, we can build tribal community strength and resilience. The Institute serves as a connecting point for all entities that touch on the world of traditional plants and foods. By hosting an annual conference, the Institute fosters opportunities for tribal agencies and allies to partner and collaborate."

Over the past five crop seasons (2007-2012), these crops have been grown on an average of 1,260,000 acres in the US with an average harvest value of over $320 million. These crops also contribute to the success of the US wheat and barley industry by serving as useful rotation crops in small grain production systems.   This research project has three objectives that focus on developing new and improved varieties of cool season food legumes (peas, lentils, and chickpeas) and effective integrated disease control strategies for these crops.   1) Develop and release new varieties and germplasm of peas, lentils, and chickpea that have higher seed mineral concentrations; improved host-plant resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, Sclerotinia wilt and Ascochyta blight; and higher yields than existing commercial varieties.   2) Identify genetic markers closely associated with superior yield, optimal plant height for harvest, seed mineral concentration, resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, and improved cold tolerance for autumn-sown peas, and validate their utility for marker-assisted plant breeding. Sub-objective 2A:  Identify molecular markers in adapted pea populations that are associated with important traits including concentrations of minerals in seed, resistance to Aphanomyces root rot, and winter hardiness.  Sub-objective 2B:  Identify molecular markers in adapted chickpea populations that are associated with seed size and early maturity.   3) Develop efficient techniques to screen peas, lentils, and chickpeas for host-plant resistance to Ascochyta blight and Sclerotinia wilt, and characterize genetic and physiological factors responsible for the virulence of these pathogens.  Sub-objective 3A:  Develop efficient techniques to screen peas, lentils and chickpeas for resistance to Ascochyta blight and Sclerotinia white mold. Sub-objective 3B:  Deter  Approach: New varieties and germplasm will be developed from pure lines selected from among segregating populations of peas, lentils, and chickpeas. Cyclical hybridization will be conducted to combine favorable alleles for traits of interest. Parental lines will include adapted germplasm, commercial cultivars and accessions from the various international breeding programs. Promising breeding lines will be released as either germplasm or varieties based on a rigorous comparison of their performance relative to that of commercial check varieties.   Linkage analysis and the detection of associations between markers and different traits will be done using simple sequence repeats (SSRs), expressed sequence tagged- SSRs, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pea recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations will be developed from a cross between Aragorn and Kiflica to identify markers associated with seed mineral concentrations. RILs from a cross between the pea cultivars Medora and Melrose will be used to identify markers associated with cold tolerance. Molecular markers associated with seed size and early maturity in chickpea will be detected using a RIL population developed from an interspecific cross between C. arientinum line Flip 90-27 and PI599072 (C. reticulatum). Associations between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) conditioning traits of interest  will be detected by composite interval mapping.  Improved methods will be developed to screen chickpea for reaction to Ascochyta blight. Toxins will be purified from liquid cultures of A. rabiei. Toxins will be adjusted to various concentrations and applied to detached chickpea leaflets. Leaflets treated with water will be used as controls. The speed of lesion development and final lesion size will be used to compare the reactions of different chickpea genotypes. The relationship between field disease scores of the chickpea genotypes and their sensitivity to the toxin will be determined. Studies to develop more efficient methods to screen peas and lentils for reaction to Sclerotinia white mold will initially examine resistant and susceptible materials reported in prior studies. Plants will be grown in the greenhouse and inoculated with agar plugs containing mycelia of S. sclerotiorum. Disease reaction will be scored by measuring the length of the lesion produced by the fungus over different time points.   Two approaches will be taken to investigate the genetic factors responsible for pathogenicity and virulence of S. sclerotiorum. One approach will be to use Agrobacterium mediated transformation (AMT) to generate random mutations that will be screened to detect mutants with reduced virulence. The other approach will be to identify genes of S. sclerotiorum that are differentially expressed during the processes of infection and disease development."

Objective 2: Breed, evaluate, and release dry and fresh green pea, lentil, and dry bean (kidney, pink, and pinto) germplasm with combined disease resistance, desirable seed quality attributes (slow darkening trait), and improved agronomic performance.  Approach: Edible legumes (common bean, chickpea, lentil, and pea) are high value crops that provide growers with crop options for the short season growing regions in the US. Production losses resulting from diseases caused by pathogens and abiotic stresses (drought, low soil fertility) cost growers millions in lost revenue annually. Incorporation of genetic resistance and stress tolerance traits are needed to minimize yield and quality loss caused by disease and abiotic stresses, and to reduce dependency on pesticides and fertilizers.    The breeding of new edible legume germplasm and cultivars with improved resistance to diseases or abiotic stresses will be accomplished by the systematic evaluation of germplasm from different countries, interspecific lines, and core and base collections in repositories to identify new resistance sources. Once new sources of resistance are identified, inheritance studies including QTL analysis and genomic characterization will be conducted to understand the resistance source and develop breeding strategies to utilize the resistance.   Genomic advances such as: the release of the annotated common bean whole genome sequence; availability of other reference genomes for synteny; abundance of genetic markers; and improved sequencing techniques will be used to characterize resistance traits. Phenotypic data will be obtained to characterize major genes conditioning resistance traits from appropriate genetic populations. Traditional and marker-assisted breeding strategies will be used to develop new cultivars with enhanced resistance to diseases, drought, and low soil fertility to ensure sustainable productivity.   Genomic markers in the form of SNP arrays will be used to identify genes/QTL which condition resistance to targeted diseases and abiotic stresses segregating in different populations. Available and developed bi-parental recombinant inbred line populations and germplasm diversity panels will be used for composite interval mapping and association mapping, respectively. Genome-wide association studies will provide a new approach for identifying gene/QTL in common bean. Two fully gene-annotated, whole genome reference sequences will be used for physical mapping and validating genetic map positions. The physical map positions of the resistance-linked markers will be used to find SSR, indel, SSCP, and other sequence based-markers from associated whole genome sequence for the purpose of marker-assisted selection.  Genetic maps will be developed using MapMaker, MapDisto, or JoinMap, and QTL analysis will be performed with QTL Cartographer, QGene, or other related software. Selective mapping and whole mapping approaches will be used to identify major-effect QTL associated with expression of disease and abiotic stress resistance. Principal components analysis will be used to determine population structure. Identity-by-descent and identity-by-state estimates will be calculated to measure genotype relatedness and the cofactors will be fit in regression models and evaluated using GAPIT. The best mixed models accounting for structure and genotype relatedness will be determined using Bayesian Information Criterion using GAPIT."

Objective 2: Optimize legume/grass mixtures, including nontoxic (novel) and toxic (wild-type) endophyte-in  Approach: Forage systems provide low cost feed while mitigating man’s impact on the environment. Currently, the available fundamental biological information for predicting animal performance in response to plant nutrients under varying environmental, genetic, physiological status, and management conditions is limited. Even more problematic is the poor understanding of the effects of plant nutraceuticals and anti-quality factors on nutrient intake, metabolism and assimilation for product, health maintenance, or work by the animal. To increase the sustainability of forage-based enterprises, it is essential that a better understanding be developed of the fundamental biological processes underlying the interactions between the animal, plant, and environment. This is particularly essential for endophyte-infected forages that produce toxicants. This Project Plan, through the development and utilization of cutting-edge technologies and real world testing, proposes to decipher the complex interactions within the animal-plant interface in order to accomplish the following objectives: improve productivity of forage-based animal systems through optimization of legume/grass mixtures and management of nontoxic (novel) and or control of toxic (wild-type) endophyte-infected tall fescue in pasture systems; determine forage nutrient and forage plant secondary metabolite effects on the gut biome to improve the health, well-being and forage utilization efficiencies of forage-animals; determine the fundamental biological processes underlying the interactions between forage animals, plants, and the environment including the epigenetic effects of forage nutrients and secondary metabolites in the forage-animal; and define the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of the ergot alkaloids in forage-animals."

Over the next five years, the following specific objectives will be addressed. (1)  Develop best management practices for Midwest and central Great Plains perennial grass, mixed grass, and grass-legume pastures to increase livestock production, provide biomass feedstocks for bioenergy production, and maintain ecosystem services; (2) Develop new cool- and warm-season grass cultivars and native legume germplasm for Midwest and Great Plains growing conditions; and (3) Identify biomass characteristics that impact conversion efficiency to liquid fuels. Utilize this information to develop improved breeding criteria and improved management practices.  Approach: Improved perennial grasses and legumes and associated management practices will be developed for use in the Central Great Plains and Midwest for bioenergy production and grazing when grown on land that is unsuitable or marginal for grain crop production.  Perennial plant breeding technologies will be used to develop the improved cultivars.   Improved management methods will be developed to fully utilize the genetic potential of the new cultivars by enhancing establishment, yields, and utilization by livestock, and all aspects of biomass energy crop production.  Basic molecular biology and biochemistry/physiology information will be developed that will improve the breeding and management products. The project is a continuation of a long-term perennial grass project that has plant materials, management, and basic science studies in various stages of development and completion.  Research will be conducted on both C3 (cool-season) and C4 (warm-season) grasses because both are needed in the region to maximize the length of the grazing season.  Switchgrass, big bluestem, and indiangrass will be the primary C4 species and will be developed for use in both bioenergy and livestock production systems.  Smooth and meadow bromegrass and intermediate, tall, and western wheatgrass will be bred for use in cool-season pastures.  Native legumes will be enhanced for use with C4 grasses in biomass production systems.  Grass technologies from this research when utilized on 6 million hectares in the Midwest could produce biofuels for 15 million cars.  Beef production per hectare from pastures with new cultivars and improved management could be improved by 10 to over 25%."

Specifically, during the next five years we will focus on the following: Objective 1: Enhance productivity and ecological function of native tall-grass prairies by development of management practices, including management-intensive grazing, and restoration strategies to follow invasive brush and tree species removal. Sub-objective 1A: Compare the effects of different systems of intensive grazing on plant communities and soil properties of over-utilized tallgrass ecological sites, and define shifts in responses to applied management regimes.

This project will develop management practices and identify forage genotypes that are resilient under variable climate and will increase forage productivity and input use-efficiency on livestock farms at a range of scales. Commensurate with the scope of the location as a Long-Term Agroecosystem Research network site, we will initiate assessments of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and agricultural production under different livestock systems of the Southern Great Plains, including both native prairie and wheat pasture.  Data from this study will be pooled with results from similar flux studies in the region to evaluate climate and environmental impacts on system response.  To evaluate system resilience, over-utilized prairie ecological sites with a mix of native and introduced species indicative of good and poor condition mixed grass prairie will be used to evaluate the use of infrequent, high-intensity grazing on succession and diversity of forage species at the sites. The impact of prior encroachment of redcedar on old-field nutrient and seedbank reserves and consequent recovery of understory and grass species following removal of redcedar will be assessed.  The use of legumes and grasses as green manure sources will be researched for summer (sorghum) and winter (wheat) grain crops to promote efficiency of N and water use.  Nitrogen turnover and utilization by the subsequent crop will be assessed.  Also, N-uptake and efficiency of utilization of cool-season annual and perennial species will be measured in greenhouse experiments to develop screening methods for plant germplasm.  Improved management methods will be developed to fully utilize the genetic potential of new cultivars by enhancing establishment, yields, and utilization by livestock. To increase marketing options of livestock producers, we will determine appropriate forage resources for production of farm-finished beef, either on all forage or with limited grain inputs.  Interactions of animal genetic type (frame score) and finishing system (forage or grain) will be assessed.  Time-series data from ryegrass trials in four southern states in the last decade will serve as the basis for examining the possible importance of 5-day and 7-day summary weather statistics of the near-surface environment, and the variations of those statistics around decade-long averages, as a predictor for seasonal production.

Develop improved production strategies that include warm-season grasses, legumes, and winter cover crops to meet life-cycle objectives for feedstock production and quality, carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas emission reductions for the Southeast regional conditions.  Approach: Objective 1: Three bermudagrass populations with desirable traits for forage, good seed production, and synchronous pollination will be used in a system of recombinant recurrent selection to develop a uniform, highly productive seeded bermudagrass for forage and/or turf.  Multiple cycles of selection and crossing will be done to create populations that will be tested in multiple replicates at different locations.  In napiergrass, a similar approach will be developed to develop vegetatively propagated high yielding, disease resistant genotypes for multiple location testing and eventual release.  Also for napiergrass, sequence data generated from genomic DNA from the cultivar Merkeron will be used to mine single sequence repeat (SSRs) markers and match them with genotypic traits of interest as marker assisted selection.  Similarly, SSR markers will be developed for salt tolerance in segregating populations of seashore paspalum.

Objective 2: Replicated tests will be performed to determine appropriate nitrogen-fixing winter legume cover crops (clovers and alfalfa) for use in forage bermudagrass (Tifton 85, Russell) to reduce fertilizer applications and improve forage quality.  Similar tests will be conducted for efficient production of biomass from energy cane, napiergrass and biomass sorghum (rotated with traditional row crops).  Winter cover crops (lupine, clover, others) will be tested against inorganic and unfertilized controls to determine efficient ways of reducing inorganic fertilizer use.  These replicated tests will be conducted at multiple sites.  Production systems will be tested to determine water and nutrient requirements for maximum biomass yields of napiergrass using a replicated split block design with three irrigation rates and six fertilizer treatments.  In collaboration with other research units, greenhouse gas emission comparisons will be determined for the cropping systems of biomass crops as well as for forage bermudagrass cultivars compared to traditional row crops."

(Objective B.1, NP Action Plan 215)  Approach: The semi-arid and arid rangelands and irrigated pastures of the western U.S. provide a broad array of ecosystem services, including livestock forage, a diversity of native plants, pollinators, animals, and recreational activities.  Many of these regions are classified as severely disturbed and non-productive.  Moreover, based on predicted climate change models for semi-arid regions, environments will become hotter and drier, increasing the already high rate of rangeland and pasture degradation, resulting in the invasion of annual grasses, increasing wildfire frequency, and reducing forage productivity.  Thus, in water-limiting environments, there is a need to develop grasses, legumes, and forbs that will establish under drought, compete with invasive weeds, and persist with adequate forage production and quality to meet the needs of wildlife and livestock producers throughout the year.  Increasing digestibility in pasture grasses by 1% results in a 3% increase in livestock gains.  The Forage and Range Research Lab (FRRL) combines the disciplines of plant breeding, molecular biology, and ecology in conducting experiments to better understand the genetic mechanisms and pathways of seedling establishment, persistence, competition, forage yield and quality, and other abiotic stresses to develop improved plant materials and management practices for use on these western U.S. rangelands and pastures.  These plant materials and management strategies will improve sustainability by reducing the impact of wildfires and invasive weeds, improving wildlife habitat, and conserving, restoring, renovating, and reclaiming degraded landscapes."

Limited basic biological information exists on the cross-talk mechanism between tall fescue (TF) (the predominant forage of the transition zone) and its fungal endophyte (symbiont – beneficial to TF plant), as well as how the plant and/or fungal metabolites affect forage quality, persistence, and production.  Furthermore, little is known about the impact that forage and/or fungal metabolites have on their pasture ecosystems.  Gaps in our current knowledge are hindering researchers’ abilities to predict and select best combinations of forages and management systems for use by forage-animal production enterprises.  Aiding researchers to develop new forage varieties, forage systems, and management recommendations for improving sustainability of forage-based enterprises will require an improved understanding of metabolite (plant and fungal) profiles and their biological functions at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels.  This research project proposes to decipher the complex interactions within the animal-plant-environment interface; improve sustainability of forage-based enterprises through improved forages and forage systems management; and improve basic understanding of the plant/fungal metabolite effects on forage plant persistence and production, as well as consequent effects on the structure and function of pasture ecosystems.  The objectives of the proposal are focused on the predominant forage of the transition zone, TF, as well as on its companion species (e.g., red clover)."

The Collection is a service-oriented program with a major objective of distributing characterized germplasm of rhizobia to stakeholders in industry for use in inoculants and for research at State, Federal and University laboratories.  The second part of the project is research-oriented with the focus on soybean, the most important leguminous grain crop for U.S. agriculture.  The purpose of the study is to investigate the soybean host genotype and its influence on the genotypes of the rhizobia that infect and establish in the nodules on the roots.  This part of the project is the only one of its kind and is made possible by the development by ARS of a method for determining the rhizobial genotype in each individual nodule.

These pathogens are known for their extensive virulence diversity that may change from one year or location to another.  Thus, one very important target of this project is to identify broad-spectrum disease resistance genes from the Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools of the wild and cultivated common bean. This will be accomplished by inoculating common bean with selected races of the aforementioned pathogens.  Studies of the inheritance of disease resistance will be conducted to characterize and map the new disease resistance genes.  Simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers linked with the newly discovered disease resistance genes will be identified to expedite the incorporation of these genes into new bean cultivars using marker-assisted selection.  Conventional and molecular breeding approaches will be used to develop bean germplasm lines in various market classes that combine several genes with broad-spectrum resistance to the rust, anthracnose, and angular leaf spot pathogens with high yield and other valuable agronomic attributes.   The specific objectives of this project are: Objective 1: Evaluate available common bean accessions from various geographic regions to identify potential sources of resistance to various pathogens, characterize new resistance genes, and develop molecular markers for use in introgression.   Objective 2: Introgress useful disease resistance genes, combine with good agronomic and quality trait genes in adapted backgrounds, and release germplasm lines or cultivars that can be used to broaden the genetic base of common bean.  Approach: To identify disease resistance sources and genes for rust, anthracnose, and angular leaf spot, the emphasis will be on evaluating 77 wild accessions and 55 domesticated landraces from the Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools of the common bean.  The Andean Diversity Panel with about 350 bean accessions will also be evaluated.  All evaluations will be conducted under greenhouse or field conditions.  Evaluations in the field will be in locations where these pathogens occur naturally or where inoculation with local isolates is possible. Similar methodologies will be used for the three aforementioned diseases.  Selected races of each of these pathogens known for the virulence spectrum will be used to inoculate all bean accessions.  Crosses will be made between selected resistant and susceptible cultivars to determine their inheritance of resistance.  F2 populations consisting of at least 120 F2 plants will be inoculated with selected races of the three pathogens.  Reactions of each F2 plant to these pathogens will be recorded.   Molecular markers including simple sequence repeat (SSR)  and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA markers are needed for use in marker-assisted selection to develop common bean cultivars with durable resistance.  To accomplish this, the parents, the segregating population, and checks will be inoculated with specific races of the three pathogens to which one of the parents is resistant and the other susceptible.  The reactions for each F2 plant will be recorded.  Genomic DNA will be isolated from the parents, checks, and from each of the F2 plants of the segregating population.  Bulked segregant analysis will used to identify DNA markers associated with resistance in those cases when the segregation indicates single gene resistance.  The homozygous and susceptible bulks and the resistant and susceptible parents will be analyzed with 5398 SNP DNA markers using the BARCBean6K_3 Illumina Infinium assay.  The whole genome sequence scafld possessing the polymorphic SNPs will be canvassed for SSRs that distinguish the R and S parental lines.  The SSRs will be assayed on the recombinant inbred line mapping population, such as BAT 93 x Jalo EEP 558 population, to map the resistance genes to one of the common bean linkage groups.   Crosses will be made to combine the newly identified bean rust resistance genes with other already identified rust resistance genes to create bean germplasm lines with broad and durable resistance to this pathogen.  A similar approach will be followed to develop cultivars with broad resistance to the anthracnose and angular leaf spot diseases.  To combine genes for resistance to rust and other diseases into a single common bean germplasm line or cultivar, crosses will be made between cultivars carrying the newly discovered broad-spectrum rust resistance genes with cultivars having genes for resistance to the anthracnose and angular leaf spot diseases.  Races of the pathogens and molecular markers will be used to confirm the presence of the disease resistance genes in the newly created bean plants with genes for resistance to rust, anthracnose, and angular leaf spot."

Subobjective 2B: Develop a reproducible greenhouse protocol for screening germplasm for resistance to pod rot.  Approach: Objective 1: Parental lines being used in such crosses include Arachis hypogaea L. cultivars, advanced breeding lines, and plant introductions (PIs) with demonstrated disease resistance and high oleic acid content. New and existing potential parent lines with high oleic acid content are continually tested in the greenhouse and field plots for resistance to Sclerotinia blight and southern blight and are readily available for use in the peanut breeding program.  Included in our annual screening of germplasm for disease resistance are cultivars, breeding lines, and germplasm accessions. Also, collaborators include the curator of the U.S. peanut germplasm collection as well as other breeders who are continually evaluating accessions for value added traits. Molecular markers for Sclerotinia resistance will be identified and verified by phenotypic reaction. Advanced breeding lines will be tested in local, regional and national tests for agronomic performance before release as a variety.   Objective 2: Response to oxalic acid, stem lignin content, and specific canopy architecture appear to be correlated with Sclerotinia resistance among cultivars of other legumes. We will determine if these traits are also useful for predicting resistance to Sclerotinia and southern blights in peanuts. Development of pod rot-resistant cultivars is significantly slowed by unpredictability of the disease occurring under field conditions. We will develop a reproducible greenhouse protocol for screening germplasm for resistance to pod rot by: 1) identifying and quantifying Pythium spp. and Rhizoctonia solani from Oklahoma and Texas fields with high incidences of pod rot using quantitative real-time PCR; and 2) evaluating symptoms in greenhouse-grown pods exposed to different inoculum levels of the three most common pod rot pathogens found in Oklahoma and Texas."

Despite much research, many determinants of host resistance and their roles in signaling remain unknown. Pseudomonas syringae, a plant pathogenic bacterium, causes disease in more than 150 plant species. ZAR1 is the R protein responsible for recognizing the acetyltransferase HopZ1a, a P. syringae type III secreted effector protein (T3SE). ZAR1 is found in many plant species, including the Solanaceae, castor bean, and rice. However ZAR1 defense signaling does not depend on any components previously implicated in plant resistance, including salicylic acid. Further investigation of ZAR1 signaling gives us a unique opportunity to identify novel genes involved in plant resistance and potential targets for improving plant immunity. This project plan will address three major questions:  1) What other genes are genetically implicated in resistance to HopZ1a? Preliminary data from a forward genetics screen has identified several mutants that lack HopZ1a-mediated defense responses (hopz-effector-triggered-immunity-deficient or zed). The proposed work will map these mutants and characterize their roles in resistance.   2) What is the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance? The proposed work will identify other proteins that contribute to ZAR1-mediated resistance.   3) Is ZAR1 resistance conserved in other plant species? The proposed work will examine ZAR1 resistance in wild and domesticated tomato. Using a multi-pronged approach, this work will identify and characterize new sources of resistance to protect plants from disease.  The specific objectives are: Objective 1:  Conduct genetic screens coupled with next-generation DNA sequencing to identify genes that contribute to pathogen resistance in plants.   Objective 2:  Characterize the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance using molecular, genetic, and proteomic approaches.   Objective 3:  Evaluate susceptibility and resist  Approach: Objective 1:   Hypothesis: Using HopZ1a as a probe of immune pathways in plants, we will identify novel genes (ZED1 and ZED2). We hypothesize that ZED1 and ZED2 will not be affected in basal defenses or responses to other T3SEs, and will be specifically involved in HopZ1a recognition. Further, we hypothesize that ZED1 or ZED2 will act as the guardee, and will be acetylated by HopZ1a. Experimental design: Screen F2 population of zed1 (or zed2) cross to Ler for a loss of the HopZ1a-induced macroscopic HR, when pressure-infiltrated with P. syringae carrying hopz1a. Identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms by Illumina sequencing of whole genomes from zed1 or zed2 populations that lack defenses. Characterize the roles of the zed mutants in defense and virulence, and their molecular functions. Contingencies: We can also conduct a genetic suppressor screen for restoration of HopZ1a-mediated immunity in zar1 mutants.  Objective 2:   Hypothesis: Plasma membrane-localized complexes of ZAR1, HopZ1a and other plant proteins will contribute to immunity. Defense-related host proteins will interact specifically with ZAR1. Epitope-tagged ZAR1 will be functional, complement the null zar1 mutant, and interact with other host proteins. Loss of function alleles of unknown (non-zed) plant genes will result in a loss of HopZ1a recognition and increased bacterial growth. Experimental Design: Identify ZAR1-interacting proteins using membrane-based high-throughput yeast two-hybrid approaches and biochemical approaches. Test whether the interacting protein affects defense responses. Contingencies: If the gene of a single interacting protein is part of a gene family, we will silence the gene family by RNAi and test for changes in defense responses.  Objective 3:   Hypothesis: As ZAR1 appears to be an ancient R gene, I hypothesize that HopZ1a will be recognized by a complex of proteins homologous to ZAR1 in tomato. Pto and Prf, known resistance-related genes in tomato, will not be needed for HopZ1a recognition. I further hypothesize that we will observe natural diversity for HopZ1a recognition. Silencing of ZAR1 homologs will result in the loss of HopZ1a resistance. Experimental Design: Infiltrate P. syringae carrying hopz1a into tomato. Test for induction of defense responses by conductivity assays, which measure rapid ion leakage upon recognition of a pathogen, or by bacterial growth assays, which quantitate bacterial growth over time. Silence homologs of ZAR1 to determine if they are necessary for HopZ1a recognition. Contingencies: If our study of natural diversity in tomato progresses more quickly than anticipated or if we fail to identify accessions that are resistant to HopZ1a, we can test additional accessions of tomato. HopZ1a can also be delivered to tomato by Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression."

Identify and map important abiotic (heat and drought) and biotic traits for disease and pest resistance in common bean, and develop useful molecular markers that will help accelerate the breeding process. 1a: Map drought and heat tolerance traits, derived from common bean and tepary, respectively, using bi-parental and association mapping populations and develop markers. 1b: Elucidate the genetics of resistance to pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina, causing ashy stem blight.  2. Develop and release common bean germplasm with higher levels of abiotic stress tolerance, and with multiple resistance, including disease and insect resistance, in important U.S. market classes.  2a: Develop heat and drought tolerant common bean in new market classes, including great northern and cranberry. 2b: Develop germplasm of medium seed size tolerant to multiple root rot pathogens; and to leaf-hoppers.  3. Introgress useful genes from tepary bean into common bean and develop tepary bean as a new crop with superior heat and drought stress tolerance and with improved agronomic and quality traits for areas where bean production is not practical due to severe abiotic stress.  Approach: Identification and mapping of important abiotic (heat and drought) and biotic traits will be completed using bi-parental and association mapping populations. Drought and heat tolerance traits, derived from common bean and tepary, respectively, will be evaluated using yield components and stress-response traits. For genotyping, the BeanCAP 6,000 SNP chip will be employed using the Illumina Infinium system that was developed through the BeanCAP project. In order to analyze these complex traits, both quantitative trait loci (QTL) and association mapping (AM) analyses will be employed. The genetics of resistance to the pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina, causing ashy stem blight, will also be elucidated. Controlled trials, using inoculation with M. phaseolina in the field, will be completed. Green house screening techniques for M. phaseolina will be further refined, as greenhouse methods producing more consistent results are needed.  Development and release of common bean germplasm with higher levels of abiotic stress tolerance will focus on the great northern and cranberry market classes. Parental crosses will be performed during the shortest photoperiods (winter) in order to ensure flowering of exotic parents and reduced temperature stress during hybridization. About 100-400 F2 progeny will be planted in the field in Juana Diaz for selection for high temperature tolerance in May, or for drought tolerance in December. For root rot and Empoasca resistance, the ARS Isabela Research Farm, PR will be used as the selective environment and the focus will be on general germplasm improvement. Due to differences in genetic control and genetic distance between different germplasm, varied breeding approaches are often required for gene introgression, including recurrenwan. Populations developed from intercrossing will be selected in the F2 under heat stress at the UPR Ag. Substation in Juana Diaz, PR in FY13 based on heat tolerance, plant habit and seed type. In order to take advantage of the superior abiotic stress tolerance of the tepary bean, a concurrent effort will focus on improving agronomic characteristics and virus resistance in tepary bean. The goal is to develop tepary bean germplasm that is capable for use as a crop in areas with high levels of heat and drought stress, such as in arid zones and in areas marginalized by climate change. Although challenging due to genetic distance between the species, crosses between tepary bean and common bean lines with virus resistance genes (e.g., I, bc3) will be completed in order to transfer BCMV and BCMNV virus resistance to tepary. The lines generated will serve as important germplasm for future tepary bean breeding efforts.t selection, congruity backcrossing, bridging parents or inbred backcross approaches.

Generate and compare sequence information among cultivars, wild soybean relatives and other legumes to discover novel alleles that can be used to improve important agronomic traits.  Approach: This project will provide data and resources that will increase soybean production by mitigating losses due to pests, pathogens and nutrient stress and by identifying genetic factors that increase yield. To study disease resistance, we will focus on the soybean-Phakopsora pachyrhizi pathosystem, using expression analyses and virus induced gene silencing to identify signaling networks required for resistance. To tackle nutrient stress, we will use iron deficiency chlorosis as a model. We will use expression analyses and virus induced gene silencing to improve our understanding of the signaling networks controlling iron homeostasis in soybean. Finally, we will use molecular, genomic and bioinformatic techniques to take a retrospective look at soybean production over the last 80 years. Using these tools, we can determine how breeders have continually increased soybean yield over time, largely before the introduction of molecular techniques.

In addition, one project objective also addresses the use of markers in wheat and common bean improvement through identifying loci impacting a range of traits including disease and environmental stress and product quality and developing additional markers for marker assisted selection.  An additional objective is the whole genome sequence analysis of two perennial soybean species that can ultimately serve as sources of genetic variability for cultivated soybean.  A final objective relates to determining the genetic influence of the soybean on the genotype of the nitrogen fixing bacteria that form root nodules on the soybean host plant.    The specific objectives of the project are: Objective 1:  Develop a Core Collection for wild soybean and provide whole genome sequence data of the Core Collection, as well as elite cultivars that will be used in crosses with selected wild soybean accessions, and analyze highly productive progeny as well as unselected progeny from the G. max x G. soja crosses to further define and delimit the genome regions associated with soybean domestication and agronomic performance.

Objective 4:  Determine the nature of the host–regulated genetic control of the specific strain of Bradyrhizobium japonicum that occupy the nitroge  Approach: The genetic analysis of 1,150 wild soybean accessions in the USDA Germplasm Collection with 50,000 SNP DNA markers will provide the genetic data to select a Core Collection of 60 wild soybean accessions.  Thirty of the accessions were used by collaborators in crosses with cultivated soybean followed by intense selection and yield evaluation.  The whole genome sequence (WGS) of the Core Collection, the adapted parents used in the cultivated x wild crosses, as well as a set of the highest yielding progeny and a similar set of unselected progeny from each cross will be determined.  These data will facilitate a comparative sequence analysis to identify genome regions containing genes associated with domestication and unique genomic regions/genes from the wild soybean.  Genetic markers to introgress the wild soybean-derived genes into cultivated soybean will be identified.   The available WGS of common bean and wheat will be analyzed to identify SSR DNA markers.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets flanking the SSRs will be designed and used to establish SSR marker databases for common bean and wheat.  To evaluate the utility of the databases, a set of SSRs will be selected to amplify DNA from a set of genotypes and the amplicons visualized for locus specificity and polymorphism.  In the case of wheat, additional WGS analyses using the HiSeq 2000 DNA sequencer will be performed on a small set of hexaploid wheats to provide additional data for SSR identification.  In the case of soybean, analysis of 50,000 SNP DNA markers on the USDA Germplasm Collection of more than 18,000 cultivated soybean accessions will be used to identify a set of 6,000 SNP markers that are highly informative and well distributed across the soybean chromosomes.  The 6,000 SNPs will be used to create a new Illumina BeadChip for soybean genome analysis.  This Beadchip, along with a previously designed 6,000 SNP BeadChip for common bean, will be used to discover genes/quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling important traits including resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and agronomic and seed quality.  Genomic DNA libraries of perennial Glycine species G. tomentella and G. canescens will be prepared for DNA sequence analysis on the HiSeq 2000.  Size-selected DNA libraries ranging from 500 bp to 10 kbp will be developed for paired-end sequence analysis.  Construction of four DNA libraries with fragment sizes of 500bp, 2.5kb, 5kb, and 10kb will be produced.  The resulting 150 bp sequence reads will be processed using SOAPdenovo software.  The resulting sequence scaffolds will be anchored to the G. tomentella and G. canescens chromosomes using genetic maps created using genotyping by sequencing.   Recombinant Inbred line (RIL) populations of progeny from crosses of Williams 82 soybean with nodulation-restricting genotypes PI377578 and PI417566 will be analyzed for nodulation phenotype.  Bulked segregant analysis using 1536 SNP DNA markers will be used to identify the position of the gene in each population controlling restricted nodulation.  Additional markers will be developed and used to verify the position of the genes controlling restricted nodulation."

This study is interested in developing and validating an in vitroassay that predicts the dissolution rate of particles of orally inhaled drug products (OIDP)in the lung, thereby allowing predictions of the in vivo behavior of inhaled drugformulations as it relates to the interrelationship between drug/formulation properties,dissolution of drug in the pulmonary lining fluid and the pulmonary effects and, afterabsorption, systemic side effects. The proposed study can be divided into three parts:First, the proposed dissolution device will be optimized with respect to the dissolutionmedium to be used (a dissolution medium reflecting the conditions in the lung is desired),drug amount and mechanism of applying drug to testing device , design of the overalldissolution device and other factors. After optimization of the system, the second part ofthe study will assess a wide range of commercially available and experimental drugformulations that differ in physicochemical properties, delivery (metered dose inhaler,dry powder inhaler nebulizer), formulation (solution, powder, suspension) andphysicochemical properties of the drug compound (hydrophilic, lipophilic....). In thethird step of the proposed work, pharmacokinetic studies present in the literature will beanalyzed with respect to the rate with which OIDPs enter the systemic circulations inhumans. These data are than correlated to data generated within the dissolution testexperiments. It is intended to provide a strong relationship between in vitro dissolutiondata and in vivo absorption properties of OIDPs."

This proposal is in direct response to thatneed and will support a State laboratory's full participation within the FERN ChemistryCooperative Agreement Program (cCAP). This participation includes instrumentation, training,method enhancement activities and analysis of surveillance samples. The Department ofAnalytical Chemistry at The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) has a 115year history of food safety research and over the last five years as a cCAP laboratory, hasdemonstrated the expertise and analytical capacity required to meet FERN goals. The currentproposal is divided into four distinct project areas, all of which are inherently flexible dependingon Forensic Chemistry Center (FCC) and FERN National Program Office (NPO) input: (1) The use of Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) for the analysis ofunknown compounds in foods. We have used GC-MS to detect melamine in food productsfrom China and pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables. We have enhanced the FDA FERNT021 methodology by developing the use of a Programmed Temperature Vaporizing (PTV) inletfor the GC-MS. In this proposal we look to continue our advances with this methodology bylooking at new toxins and poisons, by expanding to new matrices such as alcohol and seafood,and to explore the potential use of Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) with GC-MS. (2) The use of Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) for the analysis ofunknown compounds in foods. We have used LC-MS to analyze toxins in surveillancesamples and pesticide residues in produce, as well as honey bee related matrixes. We haveadded new toxins to the FDA FERN T022 method and evaluated many matrixes. We proposethe use of new chromatography columns to expand the capabilities of the FERN methodologyand also to expand to additional matrices such as alcohol and seafood. (3) The use of Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for theidentification of toxic metals in foods. Our elemental experience has ranged from thedetermination of lead in maple syrup to cadmium in fish tissue to nanoparticles in vegetables.We have used the FERN methods for the analysis of food surveillance samples. We propose tofurther enhance methodology by optimizing the High Matrix Introduction accessory for the ICP -MS. We also propose to use LC prior to elemental analysis instrumentation so as to speciatemetals and separately analyze multiple oxidative states. (4) The use of Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the identification oftoxins in foods. We have used ELISA methods for surveillance samples, proficiency tests, andto determine peanut allergens in foods. We evaluated Tetracore Ricin kits and are developingtechniques for Abrin analysis. We propose to use ELISA kits and lateral flow devices (LFDs)for matrixes specified by FDA as well as studies on the rosary pea, the source of Abrin. The explicit goal of this opportunity is to enable the analysis of food in the event thatredundancy and surge capacity is need by FERN. The CAES Department of AnalyticalChemistry has demonstrated the expertise, capability, and adaptability to fully meet and exceedthese program needs."

For the HIV-positive men, outcomes of theintervention component include time to linkage in care, time to staging, time to ART initiation,retention in care, and, for those who initiate ART, self-reported measures of adherence andvirologic suppression. For the HIV-negative men, outcomes of the intervention will includeretesting rates and risk behaviors while in follow-up. For both groups, risk reduction outcomesincluding reduction in number of partners and unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) will beanalyzed.

Typically, plants can only use atmospheric N can when fixed by microbes that live in the soil or via a symbiotic relationship with legumes, but recent findings indicate that bacteria inside pine needles can also perform this critical function. In this research, investigators at University of California, Merced will examine the symbiosis between bacteria and limber pine (Pinus flexilis). The goals are to understand the diversity of bacteria present in pine needles, calculate how much N microbes fix and under what conditions, and infer how this fixed N is transferred to the tree. The research could significantly improve our understanding of the N cycle and help identify a currently unknown source of fixed N within coniferous forests. A more complete understanding of the N cycle will also help improve climate models, and a better characterization of the microbes that can fix Nitrogen could lead to advances in crop development. This research will train undergraduates. graduate students and post-doctoral researchers in both field and lab techniques. Additionally, the research will include outreach to teachers, administrators and students at a K-8 STEM school serving under-represented groups, and will develop inquiry-based learning modules in line with Common Core educational standards for incorporation within the K-8 STEM curriculum.The investigators will examine how the phylogenetic diversity and genetic potential of subalpine tree endophytes affect N fixation within western coniferous forests. Their central hypothesis is that across its broad geographic range, limber pine hosts a broad taxonomic, genetic and functional biodiversity of mutualistic N fixing endophytes, shaped by the local environment, and shared, in part, with neighboring trees. To test this, investigators will examine the biodiversity of endophytes in limber pine and co-occurring species across the limber pine range, identify the factors that structure the patterns of diversity, and determine the relationship between taxonomic diversity and N fixation. Cutting-edge methods in sequencing and genome analysis will be integrated with established and highly sensitive methods for detecting and visualizing N fixing activity in situ to understand how endophyte diversity is shaped by the environment and shapes the N cycle in subalpine forests."

They serve as clearinghouses for community information and communication.  Researchers need easy-to-use analytical workflows in an easily accessible and familiar location, but the community database typically lacks the infrastructure to support these needs and more data exchange is needed between sites.  Additionally, the community database requires the ability to easily incorporate results from analytical workflows for public dissemination, and the capacity to transfer large datasets quickly between computational resources and the database.  Tripal, an open-source toolkit used for construction of online genomic and genetic databases, is uniquely positioned to provide solutions to these challenges as it has been adopted by multiple community databases and thus provides a common infrastructure.This project creates Tripal Gateway: a set of modules (extensions) to be incorporated into Tripal to foster greater data dissemination, collaboration, and research.   The team develops three modules that integrate Tripal with Galaxy (a popular workflow system), interconnects Tripal sites for data sharing, and utilizes emerging technologies for faster data exchange: - Tripal Galaxy - a module integrating Galaxy workflows into a Tripal site, providing both next-generation analytical workflows and seamless transition of results into the community database. - Tripal Exchange - a module to provide capabilities for cross-site querying, enabling collation and viewing of data from multiple sites, and integration of data into workflows. - Tripal SDN - a module incorporating software defined networking (SDN) technology, providing mechanisms to improve speed of data exchange.These new modules are developed, implemented, and tested in conjunction with six data sites (the Citrus Genome Database, Cool Season Food Legumes, CottonGen, the Genome Database for Rosaceae, Hardwood Genomics, and TreeGenes).  Integration of the Tripal Gateway is also anticipated for four additional databases (GrainGenes, KnowPulse, LegumeInfo, and PeanutBase).  After implementation, this effort will interlink and allow cross-querying across a major Arabidopsis resource, four legume genomics sites, the primary cotton community site, GrainGenes, and four different tree genomic sites covering fruit trees and forest trees.  Implementation of Tripal Gateway into the community databases servicing these extensive research communities will support basic and applied research that is both crop-specific and broadly useful across crop agriculture."

These Tyr-derived plant natural products have profound impacts on plant growth, development and environmental responses, and also have important nutritional and pharmacological activities in humans (e.g., vitamin E, morphine). Despite their importance in both plant and human biology, we still do not know how Tyr is synthesized in plants. Therefore, this project will gain fundamental knowledge to enhance the nutritional quality or pharmaceutical values of crops and medicinal plants, and can potentially improve plant growth and stress responses for sustainable production of food and biomass. An outreach event,  Pigment-Art , will take advantage of attractive and beneficial plant pigments derived from aromatic amino acids (e.g., betalains). While younger children will appreciate the beautiful and complex colors in natural pigments, parents and older children will have opportunities to learn about how these pigments are synthesized by plants. Technical Description of the Project:Accumulating evidence suggests that many plants synthesize Tyr via the intermediate arogenate and therefore differ from microbial models that usually use 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate as an intermediate. However, significant variations appear to exist for the Tyr biosynthetic routes among different plant species. The goals of this project are to define the Tyr biosynthetic route(s) in plants and determine their compartmentalization and crucial regulatory step(s). The proposed research will build upon PI's recent isolation of Arabidopsis and legume genes encoding arogenate and prephenate dehydrogenases (ADH and PDH), key enzymes of the Tyr pathway. Arabidopsis ADHs have strong substrate specificity toward arogenate, are localized in the plastids and inhibited by Tyr. In contrast, legume dehydrogenases specifically use prephenate, lack a plastid transit peptide, and are insensitive to Tyr. The primary hypothesis of this study is that Arabidopsis mainly uses the plastidic arogenate pathway that is regulated by Tyr, whereas legumes synthesize Tyr via both arogenate and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate with unknown localization and regulatory mechanism. In this project, kinetic analysis and localization studies are first planned for the newly identified legume PDHs (Aim 1). In planta functions of PDHs and ADHs will be investigated and compared using two contrasting plant models, Medicago truncatula (Aim 2) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Aim 3). Targeted metabolite profiling and stable-isotope feeding experiments will be further conducted in the generated mutants and transgenics to directly measure the distribution of carbon flow among the alternative Tyr pathways. Although primary metabolism is generally assumed to be conserved across plant species, our preliminary data indicate otherwise. This project will directly test this assumption and address how Tyr biosynthesis, a primary metabolic pathway, has evolved in different plants to support the enormous chemical diversity that exists in the downstream specialized metabolism."

Gathering large amounts of DNA sequence data has become relatively easy and thus, models of host/microbiome function are accumulating.  Critically, most models lack experimental tests.  Working in a system that involves one eukaryotic host paired with a single bacterial symbiont the investigators will test models of symbiotic function to identify fundamental design principles in symbiosis.  The project will exploit a very productive collaboration to further examine the nature of nutrient transport and regulation in insects; specifically, the investigators will exploit the model aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and its symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola, to fully characterize the substrate and feedback regulation of transporters between the aphid and bacterium. The first objective targets testing whole genome based models of symbiotic function and regulation. The research team will transiently express transporters of sap-feeding insects in oocytes of the South African clawed frog to test genome sequence based models of symbiotic function and host/symbiont regulation. Because aphids are both a significant crop pest and excellent models for the study of symbiosis any work that increases understanding of basic aphid biology increases our ability to develop ecologically safe methods of pest control and may facilitate development of the aphid as a model for understanding the process of bacterial infection.  Functional characterization of transporters in the pea aphid and related insects will facilitate comparative work in other insect systems thus benefitting the annotation of transporters in all arthropod genomes.  The second objective targets bringing NSF-funded basic research into the lives of Americans through the production of six broadcast quality films about aphids, the science of symbiosis and life as a scientist.  The films will be supported by development of curricular resources that target early childhood and middle school children. Finally, this project supports the research program of a mid-career female scientist."

The majority of cultivation-induced BNF occurs in symbiotic nodules of legumes such as soybean. Understanding the development of symbiotic nodules and enhancing biological nitrogen fixation would help reduce chemical fertilizer usage, and provide a sustainable supply of clean water, fertile land and a benefiting habitat for future generations, an immense benefit to the society. This project will provide research training for three graduate students and multiple undergraduate students in plant biology. Undergraduate and graduate exercises in bioinformatics will be developed using data from the project and disseminated for use by other educators. Results from the project will be disseminated through a project website, public databases, and relevant biological repositories.  Rhizodive , a statewide integrated research and training pipeline involving high school students, teachers, and university students to examine rhizobial diversity using trap legumes will be executed (with targeted recruitment of schools with significant minority enrollment). These activities will cultivate and promote scientific interest among the younger generation, promote participation of minorities in STEM areas, help develop a competitive STEM workforce, and enhance STEM curriculum and educators. This project will utilize novel genomics-empowered approaches to discover molecular signaling mechanisms that regulate legume nodule development. Based on evidence from gene expression, microRNA sensor and suppression assays, one emerging hypothesis is that microRNAs are one of the crucial determinants of the development of different nodule zones. The project will test this hypothesis utilizing a combination of genetic, molecular and micro-imaging approaches. Specifically the results from the project will help identify early signaling pathways that cause distinct development of different nodule zones. This knowledge in combination with other advances in plant breeding and biotechnology will enable the optimization of BNF (or possibly transfer it to non-legume crops) thus helping to meet global N needs in a sustainable manner. This is especially relevant in the context of a growing world population (expected to reach 8-11 billion by 2050), reduction in cultivable area due to urbanization, and the essential nature of nitrogen in maintaining plant productivity."

Medicago is the genus that includes alfalfa. Both species are native to Europe and invasive in the US. The researchers will 1) compare genetic diversity in native vs. invaded host range mutualists, using high marker density genotyping for hosts and whole-genome sequencing for symbionts, 2) assess divergence in mutualism properties between the native and invaded range to test hypotheses of reduced specialization, partner choice and mutualism dependence in invaded range mutualists using cross-inoculation trials, 3) test the impact of invasion on symbiont genome dynamics and mutualisms by simulated symbiont invasions in soil mesocosms under contrasting host density and diversity, and 4) identify the molecular underpinnings of mutualism specialization using a transcriptomic approach to nominate host-symbiont pathways. This research will shed light on the long-standing question of whether beneficial microbes face a trade-off between having a broad partner range and providing a high degree of benefit to a partner."

An educational module will also be developed on rhizobium-legume interactions in neighborhood soils, to be distributed to school children via MSU's Kellogg Biological Station Bioenergy Sustainability Program and the Fairchild Challenge, an environmental education program that reaches over 100,000 children a year in Miami.To understand whether mutualisms become less beneficial in the process of species invasions, this project will test the hypothesized trade-off between partner breadth and mutualism benefit across legume and rhizobium genotypes from the native and invasive range for two Medicago species. Medicago is the genus that includes alfalfa. Both species are native to Europe and invasive in the US. The researchers will 1) compare genetic diversity in native vs. invaded host range mutualists, using high marker density genotyping for hosts and whole-genome sequencing for symbionts, 2) assess divergence in mutualism properties between the native and invaded range to test hypotheses of reduced specialization, partner choice and mutualism dependence in invaded range mutualists using cross-inoculation trials, 3) test the impact of invasion on symbiont genome dynamics and mutualisms by simulated symbiont invasions in soil mesocosms under contrasting host density and diversity, and 4) identify the molecular underpinnings of mutualism specialization using a transcriptomic approach to nominate host-symbiont pathways. This research will shed light on the long-standing question of whether beneficial microbes face a trade-off between having a broad partner range and providing a high degree of benefit to a partner."

Bean Life Science Museum at Brigham Young University (BYU).  The BYU collection is the largest insect collection west of the Great Plains and east of the Pacific coast. Many of the BYU specimens were collected in the first half of the 20th century, and they therefore contribute a great deal of legacy data critical for scientific studies. It preserves a wealth of information on distributions and habits of important species, including agricultural pests, medically important species, threatened and endangered species, and beneficial species such as pollinators. This information will be made widely accessible by cataloguing and photographing specimens and then publishing the results on the Web. The project will provide an outstanding mentored experience for numerous students, including those traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.  In addition, the project will result in an interactive museum display to teach basic principles in the change of organismal distributions over time.  The insect collection at Brigham Young University (BYU) joins the Southwest Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN) in creating an extensive, Web-accessible catalogue of museum specimens. Project activities include: (1) Capturing collecting and identification data from 52,000 previously uncatalogued ground-dwelling arthropod specimens from the BYU collection representing the four focal insect families in SCAN: Acrididae, Carabidae, Tenebrionidae, and Formicidae. (2) Georeferencing specimen localities contributed to SCAN, utilizing GEOLocate and other resources, and upgrading fading locality labels on legacy specimens with archival quality labels. (3) Producing high-resolution images of type specimens of all ground-dwelling arthropod species whose type material is housed at BYU. (4) Contributing to SCAN's synthetic regional database to promote accessible, well-structured, taxonomically sound data for modeling climate change impacts on species distributions, and thereby enhancing SCAN's remote specimen annotation and identification workflows.

Grillo is  Natural Variation for Specificity Mediated by Signaling Interactions in the Legume-rhizobium Mutualism: A Population Genomic Approach in Medicago truncatula . The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Katy Heath.Training objectives include genomics, plant-microbe interactions, quantitative and evolutionary genetics, association mapping, and population genomics. Broader impacts include promoting Medicago and legumes as a teaching tool in high school biology classes in the Chicago area that serve underrepresented groups in the sciences.The mutualism between legumes (Fabaceae) and rhizobia (nitrogen-fixing bacteria) is one of the most economically and ecologically important interactions on the planet. A striking feature of this mutualism is the high level of variation for partner specificity, yet the mechanisms that control and maintain such specificity remain poorly understood.  This research aims to elucidate the genetic basis of specificity between the model legume, Medicago truncatula, and its primary symbiont, Sinorhizobium meliloti, through an integrative population genomic approach that addresses the following questions: 1) Which signaling genes demonstrate a genomic signature of selection that suggests a role in partner choice, 2) What are the effects of natural allelic variation at signaling genes on partner choice, and 3) What genes control incompatible interactions between Medicago and Sinorhizobium? This line of research will provide a comprehensive examination of natural variation underlying symbiotic signaling in Medicago interactions with its mutualist rhizobia."

This research will be an important first step in determining how competition between viruses is altered by the presence of beneficial bacteria and whether infection by viruses can reduce benefits from beneficial bacteria to their host plant, the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). This work benefits the public both directly by providing data that is relevant to agricultural crop production and indirectly through scientific education and outreach.  Beans and other legumes are important, highly sustainable sources of dietary protein worldwide.  A better understanding of microbial interactions in common beans can be used to inform strategies that could alter disease prevalence and increase crop yields.  The pursuit of this knowledge will also provide a variety of hands-on research experiences for undergraduate students. Finally, the results of the research will be widely disseminated to the public through presentations to the community and the development of hands-on learning experiences and mini-courses for 6-12 grade students. The researchers will examine how the presence of additional mutualist microbial species in a host plant changes the outcome of virus competition and disease severity in coinfections and 2) whether infection by pathogens reduces the benefit that the host receives from mutualists. The ecological and evolutionary interactions between multiple pathogens which occupy the same host will be studied, using a system of viruses infecting the common bean. Mutualists have the potential to alter competitive outcomes between coinfecting pathogens by influencing host resources for growth and defense. At the same time, pathogens can induce a full immune response by the host that can be damaging to microbial mutualists. If pathogen infection reduces the benefit that the host receives from mutualists, this might destabilize the association. Common beans infected with pathogenic viruses and mutualistic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) offer a highly tractable system for studying the interactions between coinfecting pathogens and mutualists. Two measures of pathogen competitive ability, within host concentration and transmission between hosts, will be compared in plants with and without rhizobia to evaluate whether the presence of a mutualist is differentially beneficial to one pathogen species. The impact of pathogen infection on the viability of the mutualism will be quantified by measuring plant immune response hormones as well as rhizobial root colonization and nitrogen fixation."

This is partly credited to not enough effort being devoted to the creation and dissemination of more ecological pest management (EPM) solutions, new pest introductions causing growers to abandon EPM options in favor of pesticides, and EPM solutions being insensitive to growers&#39; production constraints or cost. This is an applied research project aimed at developing economic and ecological sustainable pest management plans to alleviate weed and insect problems in solanaceous and leguminous vegetables. Yields and profits of these crops are impacted by several high-priority pests including herbicide resistant weeds and economically damaging insects. Growers often rely solely on chemicals to address these problems. This project proposes to examine, create and disseminate a  truly integrated  pest management program that includes several tactics to help mitigate multiple pest complexes and lower input costs. Two economically important crops, eggplant and snap beans will be used as model systems. We anticipate this project embodying all priorities listed by the ARDP such as addressing multiple species complexes, integrating multiple pest management tactics, promoting interdisciplinary IPM system approaches, developing effective management tactics for invasive and key production limiting pests, developing projects that enhances the development of innovative, ecologically-based, sustainable IPM systems, and overcoming constraints to and measuring impacts of IPM adoption.The EPM tactics that we propose to develop can be adopted in part by conventional and organic producers. Potential impacts will include hundreds of growers transitioning from high-risk and restricted-use insecticides to cultural and conservation biological control, reduced-risk chemicals, limited or no chemical options. Specifically, products and husbandry practices that are of lower risk to beneficial organisms (e.g., predators, pollinators and soil health organisms) will be used. Learned tactics will potentially impact hundreds of thousands of handlers and consumers through reduced pesticide residues on harvested produce and chemical exposure to handlers, pick-your-own clientele and sensitive environmental tributaries."

There is a critical need to implement effective and sustainable methods for controlling pests of fruiting vegetables, such as strawberries, green beans, melons, squash, eggplant, bell peppers and tomatoes. These and other vegetable crops for the fresh market generate more than $11 billion per year in the United States. This revenue is being threatened by non-native thrips and the plant viruses they spread (tomato spotted wilt virus, groundnut ringspot virus, tomato chlorotic spot virus, and ilaviruses). Primary pests include not only thrips but also whiteflies, aphids, spider mites, pepper weevil, and a few others. Melon aphid and green peach aphid are among the most important pests of cucurbits, including watermelons, cucumbers, cantaloupes, and squash. Unfortunately, growers uninformed about the science of pest management have responded to outbreaks of these pests by applying broad-spectrum insecticides according to calendar schedules. This has resulted in a classic &#39;3R&#39; situation: 1) Pest resistance to insecticides, 2) Resurgence of thrips and other pests due to the killing of natural enemies and native competitors, and 3) Replacement of native non-target thrips with new much more damaging species. An overreliance on insecticides to control thrips has resulted in the development of resistance to the available insecticides, and an inability to prevent unacceptable damage in many vegetable crops. Research is providing effective and sustainable integrated pest management (IPM) methods for controlling these pests and diseases but implementation of these methods depends on delivering training to producers and Extension personnel.Goals and Benefits. The purpose of this project is to increase adoption of sustainable IPM practices by strawberry growers, and possibly growers of other fruiting vegetables. These practices assist producers in deciding when to take action to control a pest and how to prevent pests from reaching damaging levels by using ultraviolet reflective materials, biological control and compatible insecticides. If a pest must be controlled, insecticides are used that minimize environmental side effects. Increasing IPM adoption, will require developing grower&#39;s proficiency in scouting and identifying pests, non-pests and natural enemies; capacity to determine the impact of natural enemies in suppressing pests; understanding movement of pests within and around crops; and ability to assess the injury to fruiting vegetables caused by pests and if necessary take informed action to protect their crops. IPM training will be delivered to producers of strawberries and other fruiting vegetables, Extension agents, educators, consultants, scouts and others. Up-to-date, high quality education and training materials will be developed and used for this training, e.g., IPM guide for strawberry, PowerPoint presentations, videos, websites, etc. The outcome will be reduced use of broad spectrum insecticides, prevention of pest resistance to available insecticides, lower risk of damage to vegetable crops caused by pests and diseases, fewer environmental side effects caused by pest control practices, and increased profits for vegetable growers."

The US is a significant leader in hazelnut breeding and research, yet US production amounts to &lt;5% of the world&#39;s crop and most US consumption is from imported nuts. Eastern filbert blight (EFB), a stem canker disease found only in North America, is devastating to the European hazelnut and threatens the sustainability of current commercial production in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, where 99% of the US crop is grown. It also severely restricts expansion of hazelnut plantings in the eastern US, where selections of European hazelnut could thrive if resistant.To date, more than 40 sources of genetic resistance to the disease have been identified, although only a dozen of them have been used in breeding and all recently released commercial cultivars rely on a single R-gene. A substantial germplasm base, including new EFB-resistant accessions and cultivars and thousands of breeding progeny, has been amassed in Oregon and New Jersey. These resources are now available for study and use in developing enhanced, EFB-resistant plant material. Much research has also been completed on the genetics of hazelnut and the EFB fungus, and is now available to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of breeding for durable resistance. Through this targeted research: 1) the inheritance of EFB resistance from many new sources will be studied; 2) hazelnut germplasm available for use in breeding will be characterized with molecular markers; and, based on these results, 3) new, enhanced EFB-resistant germplasm will be developed from which to select/breed new cultivars in the future. Graduate and undergraduate students will also be trained.Broad outcomes of this project will include the expanded planting of hazelnut as a sustainable, low-input, high-value food crop. The target environments are the Pacific Northwestern US and the  fruit belt  of the eastern states--from Virginia to the Hudson Valley and along the Great Lakes. Although the climate in these areas is suitable for growing European hazelnuts, EFB susceptibility is a major constraint. The breeding of new cultivars with durable EFB resistance will provide new economic options for growers and entrepreneurs, improve national food security, and enhance crop and product diversity."

The Southeast US presents ideal conditions to produce food such as crops or animals, but there are ways where the management of these production sites can be improved. One big issue is soil health that can affect crop production as a whole and forage production requires large areas and large amounts of N fertilization.Managing alfalfa in the South to increase its acreage can be beneficial since alfalfa is a legume crop that can fix N in the soil. Producing alfalfa incorporated with grasses can improve soil health and forage quality, making this production scenario more sustainable.In order to increase alfalfa production in the Southeast US, we have proposed to do field experiments to test different forage management strategies that can increase production of this forage crop especially in TN an AL. Since this project is going to be developed also in Ohio, where alfalfa is well-developed, we can use some of their management strategies and guidance for improvement in the South.We plant to disseminate our findings through field days, conferences directed to livestock producers, scientific conferences and meetings, extension publications and peer-reviewed publications as well.Our goals by the end of our project are to inform our extension agents and livestock producers in all three states where this is going to be developed and increase alfalfa production that can be used in beef and dairy production farms."

Micrometeorological techniques will be used to quantify NH3 losses, 15N enriched fertilizer will be used to trace N movement in the environment and into crops, and yield and protein measurements will be made to determine the impact of management practices on productivity and economic return. Current NH3 inventories for the West are highly uncertain, in particular for soil emissions, because it is a non-regulated gas and because of the paucity of field data. Therefore, this study will provide new information on NH3 emissions from agriculture in the West. Anthropogenic activities, in particular the burning of fossil fuels has caused a substantial increase in atmospheric CO2. To help mitigate this increase in atmospheric CO2, environmental scientists and policy maker have considered using terrestrial ecosystems to sequester C in vegetation and soils. For agricultural ecosystems in semiarid climates, modifying cropping systems to increase crop frequency and reduce fallow, and minimize soil disturbance represent two management practices that have been proposed to enhance soil C storage. Currently, there is an information gap related to the potential of Montana's soils to sequester C in response to modifying cropping system practices. This project will bridge this information gap by analyzing the results from six long-term (10 year) cropping system studies in Montana. In the future, soil management may be viewed as a protocol for mitigating climate change. This project will provide data on the potential of Montana agricultural soils to assist in this protocol. Integration of livestock into agricultural systems provides a method for controlling weeds, and enhancing soil fertility and quality without the use of chemical herbicides, tillage, and chemical fertilizer inputs. This project will investigate the potential for integrating targeted sheep grazing into a diversified organic cropping system at a site in Montana and North Dakota. Organic options for improving soil fertility are limited in the region. Livestock manure, while potentially an excellent source of N, is not economically viable due to long hauling distances in the West. The extent to which this can be achieved through targeted grazing and minimal soil disturbance for organic farms is largely unknown but will be investigated in this study."

We have used quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping information to facilitate introgression and pyramid genes for favorable disease resistance and quality traits in snap beans. The consistent limitation has been that our linkage maps, though extensive, are based on marker systems (i.e. RAPDs) that do not allow ready communication to other mapped bean populations or comparisons to the genomes of other species of Fabaceae. The cooperative Bean CAP project provides not only sequence information but also the tagged SNP markers that will allow us to communicate and compare our results not only with other bean populations but also throughout the Fabaceae and even allow for potential gene discovery with Arabidopsis or maize. Common bean is 2n=2x=22 and soybean is 2n=2x=40 and both are members of the family Fabaceae. In early macrosyntentic level studies, genome comparisons of soybean, common bean, and mung bean determined that common bean shares a large synteny with soybean. The doubling the chromosome number in Glycine max is due to genome duplication followed by rearrangements leading to diploidization. In addition to soybean, genes in other Fabaceae including alfalfa, may also be present in common bean, and will likely map to a similar genomic position relative to other genes. The objective of our HATCH proposal is to take advantage of our extensive years of research and collection of field and molecular-based data and utilize it to connect to the genomic databases to enhance gene discovery and utilize this knowledge to develop improved snap bean cultivars with enhanced disease resistance, better adaptation to sustainable production and improved flavor and nutritional value."

Increased consumption of raw fruits, salads and sprouts led to an increased number of reported illnesses due to contaminated produce. In the United States, bacterial pathogens are the major contributors to food-borne illness caused by fresh produce. In outbreaks caused by bacterial pathogens, Salmonella enterica is most frequently involved, accounting for nearly half of the outbreaks. To date, very little is known about the plant determinants that allow or facilitate the surface or internal colonization of crops. The goal of our research is to gain a better understanding on the plant responses to human enteric pathogens. To address these issues, we propose to use Medicago truncatula as a model plant and alfalfa and soybean as target crops. Our specific aims are to: 1. Identify Salmonella genes that contribute to the survival of these bacteria in the environments and to the colonization of legume sprouts. 2. Characterize plant genes regulated by Salmonella colonization. 3. Identify genetic loci of Medicago truncatula that control the colonization by Salmonella. Medicago, alfalfa and soybean plants will be infected with Salmonella and the colonization level will be evaluated. Likewise, the survival of Salmonella strains will be monitored under different environmental conditions. We will assess the effect of different plant compounds on Salmonella colonization. These experiments will allow us to identify genetic and environmental factors that affect the colonization of crop tissues by these human pathogens. For objective 2, we will identify plant genes that are regulated specifically by Salmonella colonization. To understand the biological role of these genes, their expression will be decreased or increased in Medicago plants. Medicago plants with modified expression of these genes will be infected with Salmonella and the colonization levels will be tested as described previously. With these experiments, we are expecting to better understand how legume sprouts respond to Salmonella colonization. For objective 3, based on the genes identified in objective 2, we will develop reporter constructs that get activated specifically under colonization by Salmonella. This will allow us to detect more easily the presence of Salmonella in plant tissues for genetic research but also for practical purposes. Transgenic plants expressing these reporters will be mutagenized and mutants will be analyzed by classical genetics to identify plant loci that control Salmonella colonization. We expect to generate the following outputs: 1. Better knowledge on the response of crops to Salmonella colonization and on the role of stress responses in Salmonella during plant colonization; 2. Identification of plant reporters, which will allow detecting more easily and more specifically plants infected or contaminated with Salmonella; 3. Genetic resources (reporter genes and mutants) that will allow an improved understanding of plant colonization by human enteric pathogens."

The research proposed herein aims to maximize animal productivity in a forage-based management system that is conducive to environmental quality and beef cattle welfare. The U.S. produces 21% of the world&#39;s beef. There is an opportunity for U.S. beef producers to participate in improving global capacity to meet the growing food demand (NIFA 1), but their methods must maintain high productivity in the face of climate changes (NIFA 2) and meet consumer expectations for animal care. This project seeks to explore options that could assist Wisconsin beef producers to achieve these goals (Wis research priority 6). In Wisconsin, there are 34,174 farms with permanent pasture and 11,469 farms that practice rotational grazing. The implication is that the pasture land on 66% of farms is managed as a continuous grazing system. Consequently, the animals practice selective grazing which can result in some plants being over-grazed while others are under-grazed, the spread of invasive plant species, stream bank erosion, and poor biomass yields. Rotational grazing is only practiced on 34% of farms with permanent pasture. Rotational grazing is a management method whereby a pasture is sub-divided into paddocks. The herd of cattle is exposed to only one paddock for a period of time, depending upon the number of paddocks and the duration that the grazier wishes to allow the unexposed paddocks to re-grow. The grazing management practice could result 3 to 8 cycles by the herd over the pasture in the span of a growing season. The latter practice is referred to as management-intensive rotational grazing. It is characterized by uniform cattle grazing pressure, suppression of weed growth, maintenance of stream bank integrity and larger yields of higher quality forage. We believe that rotational grazing should be more widely implemented because of animal and plant productivity (and therefore economic) advantages, as well as environmental benefits. The first aim of this project is to evaluate 3 legume-cool-season grass mixtures in terms of beef cattle gain per hectare. These combinations avoid the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Also, sufficient herbage productivity enables the grazier to avoid exogenous feed supplements which incur daily labor and feeding equipment expenses. There is a challenge posed by typical cool-season grass species. The seasonal growth pattern of cool-season grasses does not match the pattern of nutrient supply required by the grazing herd during the grazing season. Nutrient requirements increase because the cattle are growing. The challenge is that the productivity of the cool-season species is inadequate during summer warmth. Therefore, the second aim of this project is to evaluate 2 warm-season grass species for their ability to support pasture carrying capacity during July and August."

Among cultivated crops, legumes are unique in their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbioses with rhizobial bacteria. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is a legume that occupies a key role as forage for livestock production. Alfalfa is the fourth most widely grown crop in the United States with an annual value exceeding $8 billion. Unfortunately, the genome of alfalfa has not yet been sequenced and it also displays autotetrapoloid genetics, making it difficult to study in terms of genome organization and genetic analysis. The closely related M. truncatula is often utilized as a model for genome studies. My research program will investigate the genomics of M. truncatula, emphasizing the use of genome sequence data to explore genome variation and the architecture of gene families important in plant-microbe interactions. We will use functional assays, de novo genome assembly, and bioinformatic analyses to characterize genes underlying symbiosis in M. truncatula. Legumes are noteworthy for the sophisticated symbioses they form with rhizobial bacteria (Sinorhizobium). However, existing knowledge about symbioses comes primarily from knockout mutants, an approach that can miss genes of subtle yet significant effect. This project seeks to discover the genes most likely to experience active selection and therefore be important in the contemporary evolution of rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbioses. In earlier work, we utilized genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) to discover several strongly supported candidate loci, often with independent lines of evidence (expression profile, correlation with multiple traits, published symbiotic phenotype). In contrast to earlier GWAS studies, our results were based on whole genome resequencing that enabled SNP analysis at much higher density and without ascertainment bias. We will now go on to test ~100 of these candidate loci through reverse genetic experiments involving Tnt1 insertion lines and Agrobacterium rhizogenes-based gene silencing. Structural variants (SVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) are both known to have major impacts on genome variation. This is extremely important in exploring the genomics of symbiosis because certain large gene families, especially NB-ARC disease resistance genes and nodule-specific cysteine rich peptides, play important roles in symbiosis and other plant-microbe interactions. Unfortunately, SVs and CNVs are difficult to discover with confidence using medium-depth next generation sequencing. Therefore, we will deeply sequence and de novo assemble 30 nodal M. truncatula accessions to discover SVs and CNVs with high confidence. Sequence-based variant discovery will be complemented by comparative genome hybridization and experimental validation. Ultimately, SVs and CNVs will be imputed genome-wide for our entire panel of 250 Medicago accessions."

The roles played by individual proteins and enzymes of saliva is unclear. Research done has begun to enumerate the proteins, enzymes, and aphid saliva. The identification of the roles of these proteins and enzymes is just beginning. Identification and enumeration efforts on saliva-proteins/enzymes have featured mainly transcriptomics and proteomics. We will look at the insights in the pea aphid system from a combined proteomic and transcriptomic approach. Given our incomplete understanding of the aphid salivary-gland secretome, the goal of further identifying proteins and enzymes of aphid saliva will be central in our research. Obj B: The Russian Wheat Aphid (RWA) exists in biotypes which differ in the ability to feed on cultivars of wheat and barley. These differences may lie in the proteins/enzymes of saliva, allowing individuals of a given biotype to feed or be unable to feed on a given cultivar. Understanding biotype differences in proteins of saliva could lead new approaches to lessening the agricultural impact of RWA by genetic engineering of wheat and barley. The biotypes of most importance in the US are RWA1 and RWA2, and they have strikingly different abilities to feed on various cultivars of grains. Obj C: Of the various proteins/enzymes that have been identified, protein C002 is the one for which there is the clearest evidence of a required role in aphid feeding on a host plant. We provided the initial evidence, largely through a combination of transcript-knockdown by injection of dsRNA and electrophysiological studies. Knockdown of the C002 transcript resulted in early death of the aphids and a lack of feeding. Other researchers have provided different evidence that supports a role of protein C002 as an effector in aphid feeding on plant tissue. We have shown C002 knockdown has no effect on feeding by pea aphids on artificial diet. It appears that protein C002 is involved with the interaction of the aphid with the plant, and in particular in establishing or maintaining prolonged contact with the sieve element and the phloem sap. Obj D: We have found that levels of transcripts of proteins of pea aphid saliva increase up to 30-fold when aphids are moved from artificial liquid diet to a host plant. Only some of these changes are observed when the aphids are placed on a non-host soybean. Measuring changes in levels of transcripts that encode proteins/enzymes of saliva appears promising as a means of determining the roles played by the proteins now believed to occur in aphid saliva and the different classes of proteins of saliva. We will investigate the Russian Wheat Aphid, where the existence of biotypes provides a beautiful experimental system and an opportunity to gain insight into the mechanisms by which ability to feed on a cultivar of wheat is established. Obj E: The only aphid for which a genome sequence has been reported is the pea aphid. Efforts are underway now on the green peach aphid genome. Undertaking a genome sequencing project on the RWA is also important, given the agricultural impact of this aphid and the existence of RWA biotypes."

Among the major diseases of soybeans in South Dakota, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines)and the Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) are the most common. SCN is particularly a problem in South Dakota because it is relatively new and growers are either not aware or because of the absence of visual SCN foliar symptoms, growers don&#39;t consider SCN as a problem. Bean pod mottle virus is disseminated primarily by bean leaf beetles (BLB)and the overwintering and first summer BLB generations are the most important in the spread of BPMV. Lack of pre-plant overwintering BLB population prediction makes it difficult for growers to decide on insecticide seed treatment.In wheat, Fusarium head blight and leaf spot diseases cause significant yield reductions annually. Use of fungicide as a management tool for wheat fungal diseases has been increasing in South Dakota. However, most fungicide applications follow calendar sprays (for instance tank mix with herbicide application), irrespective of the disease intensity. This is in part due to lack of informationon effectiveness of timely application of fungicidein the management of fungaldiseases as well aslack reliable prediction of the likely risk ofplant diseaseepidemic development.Determining the occurrence and distribution of Heterodera glycines (HG) types present in South Dakota and continued sensitizationof the soybean growers on importance and management of SCN is crucial for increased soybean yield as well limiting SCN resistance development. Use of plant disease prediction tools can go a long way in limiting pesticide usage and ensuring a timely and effective pesticide application. The major focus of this research is determining HG types distribution and occurrence in South Dakota, validating the prediction tools for Fusarium head blight and bean leaf beetle winter mortality, and determining the effectiveness variousfungicide timings in controlling fungal pathogens in wheat.. The anticipated impact of this research is effective and sustainable management of major soybean and wheat diseases and ultimately increased profitability of the two crops."

Perennial forages comprise a majority of the available organically produced feed for the production of organic dairy products. Soil insects frequently thrive within perennial cropping systems where they reduce yields and thin stands from constant root pruning by the larvae, causing the plant to be more susceptible to growth reduction and death during times of limited rain fall and high temperatures. In addition, root feeding wounds by soil insects provide entry zones for plant pathogens to colonize the plant and cause reduced vigor and plant death. Soil insects are difficult to control in conventional field crop production systems with a full array of synthetic pesticides at the farmer&#39;s disposal. Management of soil insects in an organic production system is much more difficult due to the reduced management options. Organic dairy rations are often composed of legumes, and grass. Alfalfa stand life is significantly shortened by the direct root feeding from Clover root curculio, Sitona hispidula (CRC) and the feeding wounds providing access to the root vascular system for pathogenic fungi. Clover stands are shortened in a similar manner by CRC with the added impact on stand life and viability from attack by Clover root borer, Hylastinus obscurus (CRB). Production of grass for harvest and rotational grazing is impacted by root loss from feeding by the wide array of native and introduced white grubs found throughout NYS. Grass fields in these situations typically are not in a short rotation with other crops, but remain in place for many years. Grass hay production in moderately to well-drained soil types are at much higher risk from white grub-related stand and yield losses than grass grown on more poorly drained or  down drainage  fields. Entomopathogenic nematodes have been shown to effectively attack these insect species. Our past research for the past 20+ years focused on native persistent strains of nematodes has shown the effectiveness of these strains under NY conditions in the alfalfa-grass production systems. Nematode persistence extends beyond 7 years and across crop rotations. Native nematodes introduced into the organic dairy production system are expected to reduce insect damage, increase yield and profitability. It is the goal of this project to evaluate the efficacy these native persistent entomopathogenic nematodes against the soil insects found in the three different forage systems and quantify their impact on stand persistence, and yield."

US soybean production is also largely influenced by drought since more than 85% of soybean is produced by rain-fed farming. In Virginia, soybean is a major field crop (580,000 acres in 2012), but its productivity has been negatively affected by various environmental stresses including drought and flooding. Despite the economic impact of water-related stress in the major legume, fundamental mechanisms that regulate submergence and drought tolerance are largely unknown, presumably because the entire genome sequence and molecular tools were not available until recently. As a postdoctoral researcher, Takeshi Fukao led the USDA-NIFA-funded Sub1 Rice Project (2003-2012) exploring the mechanisms of submergence and drought tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) with Prof. Julia Bailey-Serres at UC Riverside. Fukao has successfully adapted molecular protocols established in Arabidopsis for rice research and characterized the master regulator of submergence tolerance, SUBMERGENCE-1A (SUB1A), at physiological, molecular, and genomic levels (Fukao et al., 2006; Fukao and Bailey-Serres, 2008; Fukao et al., 2009; Fukao et al., 2011; Fukao et al., 2012).

Collectively, diseases related to diet contribute to over a $700 Billion dollar burden to society. It is clear from these data that the message to improve diet through traditional methods is not being followed. Changing eating habits is one of the most difficult challenges people face and is often the reason why many fail to lose weight and suffer from diet-related illnesses. There are many reasons for this challenge; however, incremental changes in one&#39;s diet can lead to improved success. Although consumers are aware that diet can influence health, the discipline to commit to a change in dietary habits is difficult and many individuals fail to maintain a balanced diet. Developing food products that contain disease preventing ingredients could be an important approach to improving the healthfulness of consumer diets. Agricultural products, including many produced in North Dakota, have the potential to be a source of healthful ingredients. The goal of this research is to investigate the use of crops not traditionally used in convenience food products (e.g. snack product) with the intent to provide industry and society with data to support the development of healthy foods from North Dakota commodities, such as dry edible beans, dry peas, flaxseed, and sunflower. These commodities contain many healthful components that could be exploited by the food industry. The application and stability of the healthful components in convenience foods will be determined. The resulting prototypes will demonstrate success and be made available to the food industry with the intent that they would use the information to produce nutrient enhanced convenience foods."

Unfavorable climatic conditions during past years resulted in a sizable reduction of the US cow herd. Hence, many producers are evaluating production alternatives that ideally would: 1) reduce production by lessening reliance on increasingly expensive inputs while providing niche-market beef price premiums; 2) provide healthy and wholesome meat products for a growing population; and 3) reduce the environmental impact of beef production by cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions where possible. Beef production in the Southeastern US is likely to move towards a much greater reliance on forages in the future than on grain-based feedstuffs. This trend is caused by several intersecting issues: 1) increased costs for grain; 2) environmental concerns about feedlots, and 3) consumer awareness of and desire for grass-fed, locally grown beef are expanding. Simply switching from feedlot beef production to forage-finishing is not easy. Many beef producers, especially those among small and medium-sized producers, have limited time and knowledge regarding the amount of forage management necessary for commercial success of grass-fed beef. In addition, much of the predominant forage besides bermudagrass in the southeast is KY31 tall fescue (E+) that can have toxic effects on cattle. One approach to reduce these negative effects of E+ is overseeding those pastures with legumes of various types. Another approach already demonstrated by our group is to plant a non-toxic, novel endophyte-infected fescue (NE+). Despite excellent results from previous and ongoing research (Caldwell, 2013), adoption of these practices by farmers has been slow. Combined, these factors demonstrate a critical need for the development of ecologically sound management practices for beef cattle producers to enhance productivity and efficiency while also increasing profitability, consumer health, and environmental sustainability. Without comprehensive information regarding production alternatives and marketing plans, beef producers may not be ready to respond to changing economic conditions and environmental pressures affecting their operations. Therefore, the long-term goal of this project is to enhance farm efficiency and sustainability through research on the impacts of novel agronomic practices and changes of input costs on the viability of small- and medium-sized beef operations. The central hypothesis is that the economic and environmental sustainability of beef production systems can be improved over and above the introduction of NE+ fescue by well-managed utilization of legumes."

High-value fruit and nut crops for farmers markets, on-farm markets, Community Supported Agriculture, locavore cooperatives, and restaurants are of great interest to small farmers. Kentucky&#39;s produce (vegetables/fruit) industry has seen steady growth over the last decade. The proposal objectives were developed through stakeholder input through conversations with individual growers, interaction with grower associations including the Organic Association of Kentucky, the Kentucky State Horticulture Society, the Kentucky Nut Growers Association, and the Ohio Pawpaw Growers Association. Farmers were interested in pawpaw, primocane fruiting blackberries, table grapes, eastern filbert blight resistant hazelnuts, and high tunnel production of fruit/vegetable/aquaponics crops as new or alternative crops for Kentucky. Aquaponics combines conventional aquaculture, fish or prawns in tanks, with plant hydroponics. Using aquaponics systems in high tunnels systems with fruits and vegetable crops could further increase the number of economic opportunities for small farmers. Through germplasm collection and breeding, new and improved pawpaw varieties will be developed for growers. This proposal will develop both fundamental and applied knowledge for scientific and lay publications for organic and conventional production methods and techniques for these fruit and nut crops in Kentucky and the surrounding region. Field days and tours of field plots will provide demonstrations that will improve skills, increase knowledge, and improve decision-making ability of small and limited resource farmers. Recommendations for cultivar selection and conventional and organic production practices will be developed and distributed via print, presentations, field days, and the internet to farmers in Kentucky and beyond. Organic production practices developed could positively impact public health and the environment by reducing pesticide use and enhancing agricultural biodiversity. Locally produced organic fruit crops will promote economically viable, environmentally sound and socially responsible production practices that reduce synthetic chemical inputs and can protect human health and the environment. Facilitating the local production of fruits and nuts could lead to improved economic opportunities in the south eastern United States, reduced energy inputs and transportation costs, and improve the health and quality of life of youth and adults in rural communities and people in urban settings."

Current energy-intensive vegetable production systems have well-known negative effects on the environment and have also detracted significantly from the economic viability of farming given rising fuel costs. Dependence on energy use can be reduced through adoption of reduced tillage systems and by replacing synthetic fertilizer inputs with nitrogen-fixing and nutrient scavenging cover crops. However, adoption of the systems is constrained by their complex and sometimes negative effects on management of pests. Weeds are particularly problematic in vegetable production and are often a major obstacle to adoption of alternative systems. The objectives of this research are to 1) optimize reduced tillage production systems and evaluate their impact on pest and nutrient management as well as yield and quality of vegetable crops; 2) Improve nitrogen use efficiency in vegetable cropping systems through targeted zonal management; and 3) determine the impact of tillage and soil amendments on weed population dynamics. Field, greenhouse, and growth chamber studies will be conducted to meet these objectives. Field studies will examine the long-term effects of tillage, cover crop and weed management practices on pests, crop quality and profitability in sweet corn, snap bean and winter squash rotations. Targeted nitrogen management studies will include evaluation of deep placement and slow release forms of N fertilization (including polymer coated urea and compost) in various crops including processing carrots. The effects of tillage, cover crop and N management practices on weed population dynamics will be evaluated through a combination of field, laboratory and growth chamber studies and will include assessment of changes in the diversity and abundance in the weed seed bank, as well as studies examining mechanisms responsible for those changes. Results from this research will be disseminated through a variety of forums including written publications in journals, newsletters and web-based bulletins, as well as oral presentations at grower meetings, workshops and scientific conferences."

Sustained agricultural productivity has historically been maintained in the rich world by copious application of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, with high cost to the economy and the environment. Unique among crop species, legumes produce their own nitrogen nutrient through a symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria collectively known as rhizobia. In this symbiosis, the bacteria convert molecular nitrogen into ammonia in exchange for host photosynthate. Studying the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis and fully explore its potential can boost the productivity of legume crops in the short term, and may expand this ability to non-legume crops over the long run. However, the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis is a complex system, and currently we know too few of the molecular players involved. This project will optimize two methods to reduce the activity of a given gene, and use these methods to screen for legume genes required for the function of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. The result of such endeavors should be a comprehensive list of legume genes playing critical roles in interacting with their rhizobial symbionts, and help unveal crucial biological processes in the interaction between plants and beneficial microbes."

There are approximately 840,000 calves produced annually in Arkansas, most of which are sold in the fall at weaning. The enterprise services that the stocker-cattle segment supplies to the beef industry are well characterized. These services include providing the market with immunocompetent weaned feeder cattle that have been acclimatized to feed bunks and water sources and have been grouped in load lots. Other services include providing placement area for calf numbers that are in excess of feedyard capacity at times of the year when large numbers of calves are marketed. Previous research indicates that the fall/winter grazing period is key to profitability of cool-season annual grazing programs. Hoveland (1986) stated that  The greatest opportunity for profitable beef production in the Southeastern U.S. is through retained ownership of calves through the stocker phase on high-quality pastures.  Often performance of stocker calves during the fall and winter is lower than what can be expected due to low forage availability. If performance and stocking rate of small grains can be improved during the fall and winter, fewer calves would be purchased at seasonally high cost in the spring improving overall enterprise profitability. A series of studies is planned that will investigate optimal stocking rates based on available forage. The increased costs of feed and other production inputs has increased the emphasis on efficiency of production in drylot cattle growing systems based on total mixed diets. Novel feedstuffs and cropping residues have been used by producers with varying success. One aspect of this project will evaluate forage species and forage quality and how this effects calf performance when fed mixed diets post weaning. Other studies planned, will evaluate nutrient profile of the diets and how they effect animal performance. Increasing fuel and fertilizer costs have increased producer interest in growing systems that limit fertilizer and equipment costs. Pasture systems that decrease fertilizer expenses, such as changes in fertilizer rate and timing, increased use of clovers and other legumes needs evaluation in a controlled scientific evaluation. This project will evaluate establishment methods and grazing management that may impact the persistence of clovers and other legumes in pasture setting."

Specifically, this project strives to increase our understanding of how soil management techniques common in organic or low-input farming systems affect the cycling of nutrients via soil microbial processes. All farming systems, organic and conventional, require nutrients to be made available to crop plants at critical points in the plants lifecycle. Organic farmers rely on cover crops and other organic nutrient sources that require microbial activity to make them available to crop plants. It is critical that we know how to design agroecosystems where nutrient availability from certified organic sources is synchronized with crop needs, yet we are only just beginning to understand how organic management practices influence soil nutrient cycling and availability. One common management practice in organic farms, as well as on increasing numbers of conventional farms due to prohibitively high synthetic N fertilizer prices, includes the use of legume cover crops. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is a major source of new nitrogen entering organic farming systems, typically through the inclusion of leguminous cover crops in the management plan. Synthetic nitrogen sources are prohibited under organic standards, and thus farmers are in-part dependent upon the fixation of atmospheric N2 through the legume-rhizobia symbiosis to provide N for crop growth and development. To this end, my project investigates the ecology of the symbiotic bacteria associating with legume cover crops, rhizobia, within and among organic farm soils. Previous work in our lab has shown that many if not most of the nodules on some cover crop legume species are occupied by resident soil rhizobia, even when recommended inoculant formulations are applied. Nodule formation by these competitive resident soil rhizobia may result in reduced N contribution to an organic system if that competitive strain is shown to be less efficient in N-fixation. The current questions we are seeking to answer in our lab concern competition between added rhizobia inoculant strains, and already existing rhizobia, as well as nodule occupancy when multiple strains are added in one inoculant mixture. We use traditional microbiological techniques as well as genetic fingerprinting to evaluate rhizobia in active farm fields, as well as in controlled laboratory settings. We extend our findings to stakeholders through traditional academic channels such as peer-reviewed publications, as well as extension events such as field days and regional workshops for organic producers."

Currently in Kentucky, livestock production relies almost exclusively on cool-season forages. Although these species are productive during the early spring and fall, they are also often susceptible to limited production during the summer months. Native warm-season grass, however, are better adapted to warmer and drier conditions and produce most of their growth during the summer. While this may fill the gap in forage production left by the  summer slump  with cool-season species, NWSG are lower in forage nutritive value and may reduce animal performance. The incorporation of legumes into grass mixtures increases animal production due to it being inherently higher forage quality. Legumes also increase the sustainability of the system through their ability to form a symbiosis with Rhizobia bacteria that converts atmospheric nitrogen into organic forms. There have been limited studies examining the production of legumes in NWSG stands, and of these studies, red clover [Trifolium pretense L.] has shown the greatest potential. However because of their earlier initiation of growth, cool-season legumes may have a competitive advantage over warm-season species and may lead to a decline of their presence within the stand. Similarly, the removal of cool-season legumes before appreciable production of NWSG forage may also remove photosynthetic tissue needed for growth of the grass and will compromise summer forage yields. Perennial warm-season legumes may be more compatible with NWSG and, in central Kentucky, species selection from these types of forage legumes is limited to sericea lespedeza [Lespedeza cuneata (Dum. Cours) G. Don]. The establishment and persistence of legumes within mixtures with grass, regardless of growth habit, is often constrained by the legume species&#39; ability to exploit environmental niches, such as openings within the canopy. As the canopy architecture of NWSG varies between and within species, closer examination of the variability of this factor in relation to legume production may provide further insight into their maintenance within sustainable agriculture systems."

We also currently have a very limited understanding of how specialization of fungi on particular host plants causes them to form new species and possibly create new host-pathogen combinations that have and will continue to devastate US agriculture. We will use Alternaria alternata infecting citrus and Ascochyta spp. infecting cool season food legumes as model systems with which to study the genetics of host specificity and mechanisms of speciation. These two pathosystems will allow comparison of a predominantly asexually reproducing pathogen of wide host range (Alternaria spp.) with a predominantly sexually reproducing pathogen of narrow host range (Ascochyta spp.) thus providing insight into speciation processes in fungi with diverse mating systems and pathogenic lifestyles. We will employ modern statistical methods in population genetics and systematics to develop approaches to quantitatively define species for pathogens with limited morphological variation. Results of this research will provide methods for quantitative recognition of plant-pathogenic fungi of regulatory significance to US agriculture. Closely-related Alternaria spp. historically have been a taxonomically challenging group of plant-pathogenic fungi because of a paucity of morphological characters and extensive phenotypic plasticity. Alternaria spp. represent an ideal model system with which to investigate the use of quantitative criteria for species delineation and will prove an ideal model system for the application of these approaches. For studies of speciation and the genetics of host specificity, we will employ modern genetic mapping techniques based on high-throughput, next-generation sequencing and modern approaches using information contained in genes under selection and visible at the molecular level as  signatures  of selection. We will also employ a novel experimental approach to better understand the ecology of Ascochyta fungi on their host plants. These approaches will contribute to our basic knowledge of the evolution of plant pathogenesis, the emergence of disease, host shifts and allow the design of more effective and durable methods of disease control. In previous work, phylogenies of Ascochyta spp. causing Ascochyta blights of cool season food legume species were developed and used to distinguish closely related but host-specific taxa. These results will also be used to develop the Ascochyta/legume pathosystem as a model system for the study of ecological speciation mechanisms. In addition to clarifying speciation processes in fungi, evolutionary studies of pathogenic fungi at the population/speciation interface is critical from a taxonomic perspective, with important economic ramifications for quarantines, biosecurity and molecular epidemiology."

Acute viruses are well studied and cause symptoms and plant diseases. In contrast to acute viruses, persistent viruses do not appear to affect the phenotype of the plant host. The genus Endornavirus contains persistent viruses that infect plants without causing visible symptoms. Infections by endornaviruses have been reported in many economically important crops, such as avocado, barley, common bean, melon, pepper, and rice. However, little is known about the effect they have on their hosts. The overall objective of the proposed project is to elucidate the nature of the symbiotic interaction between endornaviruses and their hosts. Some specific objectives include (a) developing endornavirus-infected and endornavirus-free Black Turtle Soup common bean and Marengo bell pepper, (b) to evaluate the phenotype, grain and fruit yield of endornavirus-free and endornavirus-infected isogenic lines under greenhouse conditions, and (c) to study the interactions between selected acute viruses and endornaviruses. It is likely that the endornaviruses of bell pepper and common bean are in a mutualistic relationship with the host and provide tolerance to biotic or abiotic agents. Nevertheless, it is also possible that the endornaviruses could interact synergistically with acute viruses and indirectly or directly cause harmful effects. Therefore, the addition or elimination of endornaviruses from some crop germplasm will be an action that will have to be taken."

Development of crops with broad-spectrum and stable viral resistance is crucial for fighting mixed infections, which are common in the fields. For example, synergistic infection of soybean by Soybean mosaic virus and Bean pod mottle virus causes much severe infections than that of each virus. A universal feature of (+)RNA virus replication is that they assemble their replication complexes in association with host intracellular membranes, which are usually remodeled by viral proteins during infections. However, the mechanisms of virus-induced membrane rearrangements are not well-understood and the lipid microenvironment of viral replication complexes is not well-defined. A better understanding of such processes will identify novel and promising targets for designing broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. Our project targets the above knowledge gap by using Brome mosaic virus (BMV), which invaginates endoplasmic reticulum membranes to form spherular structures in barley, Nicotiana benthamiana and the baker&#39;s yeast. The primary objectives of this proposal are to determine the lipidomic alterations induced by BMV infection in various hosts, dissect the mechanisms by which BMV modulates lipid synthesis, and develop a pipeline to generate crop plants that are resistant to multiple viruses, intially by manipulating host lipid synthesis. Specifically, by using lipidomic and electron microscopic analyses, we will test the hypothesis that BMV recruits host lipid synthesis enzymes to promote phospholipid synthesis dedicated to viral replication. Building on previously work and our preliminary data that unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) are required for replication of a number of plant viruses, we will generate crop plants that express artificial microRNAs to knock down the expression of UFA synthesis genes to achieve resistance to multiple viruses. By completion of the project, we expect to provide new knowledge on virus-host interactions and new ways to control viral infection."

The U.S. supplies 33% of the world&#39;s soybean production. In Louisiana, soybean accounted for 23% of the total agricultural production, with soybean production valued at $408 million.A recent survey conducted inLouisiana has shown that the number of acres scouted and the number of insecticide applications has doubled over the last four years. Losses due to insecticide applications and insect damage averaged $41.22 per acre. Thus, soybean producers will likely be more risk-averse, unwilling to suffer grain quality and yield losses due to insect pests. An effective and sustainable soybean IPM will be necessary to reduce pest impacts while increasing productivity.To implement this plan, knowledge on pest biology, host range, and population dynamics is necessary. Louisiana soybean is attacked by a diverse insect pest complex, but the primary problems in recent years have been associated with stink bugs, threecornered alfalfa hoppers, bean leaf beetle, and several Lepidopteran defoliators (velvetbean caterpillar, soybean looper, corn earworm, and green cloverworm). In addition, kudzu bug reached Louisiana in 2013. One or more of these pests are significant annual problems and are responsible for limiting soybean yields in Louisiana. This is an evolving system and new management tactics are needed to combat a changing pest assemblage. This project utilizes short and long term objectives to generate the necessary data on pest density, impact, biology, and control tactics that are critical to improve the overall soybean IPM program."

In addition, there are over 500,000 horses in Florida with an associated cash flow of $3 billion per year. Forage is a major component of the diet of all livestock in the state, and planted pastures occupy approximately 3.5 million acres.In spite of their large contributions to the state&#39;s economy, limitations remain among forages currently utilized in Florida. Bahiagrass, which is grown on approximately 2.5 million acres for forage, produces 85% of its yield during the period from April through September. Lack of cool-season production results in greater need for supplement feeds and increased cost to livestock producers. Limpograss has demonstrated ability to produce forage for livestock during the cool season, but only one limpograss cultivar, Floralta, is widely used. Greater genetic diversity and improved performance would greatly benefit the livestock industries. In addition, novel cool-season forages are needed statewide to address the winter shortfall of forage quantity and quality. Bermudagrass, though highly desirable for hay production, requires high inputs, is established by sprigging only, and may not tolerate close, repeated grazing. More persistent and easier to establish types would benefit livestock producers and horse owners. Another pressing need for livestock producers is alternatives to expensive nitrogen fertilizer for forage production. The legume rhizoma peanut has become an important component of hay production systems in the state, but until recently establishment has been too expensive to allow its use in pasture-based systems that generate less income per unit land area (e.g., beef production systems). New establishment technologies have been developed, and because RP is very grazing tolerant, lower cost approaches to establishment may allow it to become an important part of pasture-based systems in the future.Thus, there is a need for continued evaluation of potential new forage species and genotypes for Florida forage-livestock systems. This project will assess digestibility and grazing tolerance of new limpograss hybrids, measure yield and nutritive value of Jiggs bermudagrass compared with traditional bermudagrass hybrids, determine which new cultivars of RP are best adapted to grazed pastures and how they should be managed, assess new breeding lines of cool-season forages, and determine the impacts of the most common and several innovative year-round forage systems on soil carbon accumulation."

Pod shattering before harvest is a serious problem that causes yield loss of grain legumes. Furthermore, the dominant shattering trait of the wild progenitors is also a limiting factor for efficient introgression of value-added traits into elite breeding lines. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying pod shattering in soybeans. Knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underlying pod shattering will facilitate the breeding of shattering-resistant varieties, expedite the introgression of agronomically favorable traits from wild species to elite breeding lines, and enrich our understanding of the evolution of seed dispersal and crop domestication in diverse crop species."

Global N inputs have more than doubled since the Industrial Revolution, and understanding the biological consequences of increased N is a scientific problem of the highest priority. Theory predicts that N-deposition will have large effects on the model mutualism between plants in the legume family and soil bacteria (rhizobia). This mutualism involves the exchange of carbon produced by plants for N fixed by rhizobia and is the primary source of naturally-fixed N on land. N-deposition is predicted to reduce the abundance of rhizobia and cause the evolution of less-cooperative rhizobium mutualists, resulting in lower rates of N-fixation. As a result, the effects of N-deposition on this important mutualism may change plant community composition, increase reliance on synthetic fertilizers, and influence the global N cycle. We will experimentally test these well-established theoretical predictions by capitalizing on an existing 22-year N-addition experiment at the Kellogg Biological Station&#39;s Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Site. Ancient evolutionary events, such as the evolution of N fixation, have generated profound shifts in geological and atmospheric processes on earth.

Horse industry also contributes largely for the State economy. Forages grazed or conserved as hay, haylage, or silage are an important component and generate income for different stakeholders. Grasslands in Florida are estimated at 4.6 million hectares supporting 1.2 million head of beef cattle and other livestock (Blount, 2013). Sustaining this industry and increasing its profitability while protecting Florida&acute;s environment is a challenge ahead of us.Cattle production systems in Florida are based on grazing operation on warm-season grasses (e.g. bahiagrass, bermudagrass, limpograss), cool-season annual grasses (e.g. annual ryegrass or mixtures such as rye/ryegrass), and hay production from warm-season grass fields. These systems are highly dependent on N fertilization. Improved pastures, mainly bahiagrass and bermudagrass, occupy 1.5 million hectares in Florida. Considering that approximately 20% of this area is currently fertilized with 60 kg N/ha, current N fertilizer expenses by farmers is US$ 27.7 million dollars. Developing year-round cow-calf production systems based on grass-legume mixtures will not only reduce the need for N fertilizer, but also has potential to increase current productivity of unfertilized systems by at least 20%. Current productivity of unfertilized systems is 1.2 ha per cow-calf pair. Increasing forage productivity by 20% on these 1.2 million hectares would allow either increasing the herd size and profitability of Florida cattlemen or maintaining the current productivity and release pasture area for other agricultural activities.Off-farms inputs such as fossil fuel, equipment, seeds, and purchased feed increases cost of farming operations and may reduce producer profitability. Strategies to reduce off-farm inputs will be tested and include stockpiled forage, cool-season forages with self-reseeding potential, biological N fixation by grass-legume associations or grass association with N-fixing organisms. Reducing N fertilizer also has potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, contributing for reduction in global warming. Industrial N fertilizer is manufactured using high energy inputs from natural gas, a fossil fuel. Thus, N fertilizer has a high carbon footprint not only because of its manufacturing phase, but also because of increased N2O emissions when applied to the field. This multi-state, multi-site, multi-disciplinary research and outreach project will address year-round cattle production systems less dependents on N fertilizers. Cool-season and warm-season mixtures of grass-legumes will be evaluated under different environments. After selecting the best mixtures, animal performance data will be assessed in year-round cattle production systems based on grass-legume mixtures vs. N fertilized grass. Carbon footprint from different forage production systems will be assessed and management practices will be proposed in order to reduce GHG emissions from these systems. Reduction in cattle production costs, increasing cattle productivity in unfertilized grass pastures, and lowering GHG emissions to the environment will be the major benefits for the society. Decision support tools directed to extension faculties, producers, and allied livestock industry is an expected outcome of this project."

In its native range it is a serious pest of fruits, vegetables, and legumes. BMSB will eat several hundred different plant species. It is also an expensive nuisance pest of households--thousands of BMSB are finding their way into houses looking for overwintering sites. It also attacks valuable native plants. This pest was first reported in the Western Hemisphere in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in 2001, although it probably arrived there earlier, but went unreported. BMSB has since been reported from about 40 States, and its range is expanding. Feeding damage on fruit and leaves results in small rot spots, secondary infections, and scarring. Economically important damage to commercial apple and pear crops was first observed in the Eastern United States in 2006. Fruit damage can be severe, with an economic impact of over $37 million in Pennsylvania alone.An integrated pest management program for BMSB isbeing developed, using biological, chemical, cultural and mechanical tactics. Biological control using natural enemies of BMSB from its native range is the tactic most likely to produce sustainable, low-input, affordable management of BMSB. From foreign surveys, the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service identified several potential natural enemies of BMSB. Tiny wasps that attack BMSB eggs are the most promising biological control agents they found. Preliminary host-specificity testing suggests that these wasps are quite specific to BMSB and its close relatives, but additional testing is needed to predict the field host range. The USDA-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has taken the lead to pull together a multi-State team of biological control researchers to evaluate the host-specificity of the first potential BMSB egg wasp. Colleagues have catalogued the native and introduced, pest and beneficial, predatory and plant-eating stink bugs in each State, and are rearing them for testing the wasp. Farm Bill funding has been obtained by APHIS and collaborators for this program. Data from the host-specificity testing will be pooled, and an application for field release will be made if testing indicates an acceptable degree of specificity to BMSB. We are hopeful that our combined efforts will results in release of a safe and effective natural enemy of BMSB."

The amount of these biosynthates in harvested seed varies from negligible to a majority of the total mass. Though the biosynthetic pathways for seed storage compounds are mostly known, it is not clear how these pathways are regulated to produce higher quantities of oil versus starch or protein. With recent technological advances in the area of mass spectrometry in conjunction with maturing plant gene databases, high throughput identification of proteins from model and crop plants is technically feasible. Research on the development of quantitative proteomics approaches and applying these strategies towards seed filling in oilseeds will enable prediction of metabolic flow in diverse crops such as castor, canola, soybean and sunflower. As increasing rates of allergies to legumes and tree nuts are reported, the ability to determine accurate protein allergen content is of particular importance to both regulators and consumers."

However, in the past decade spinach production in the U.S. has increased dramatically with annual grown approximately 35,000 ha (Correll et al., 2011). The U.S. has been the internationally behind only to China for spinach production with annual harvested about 553,000 million tons valued at over $200 million (USDA-NASS, 2008). Spinach is regarded as one of the healthiest vegetables because of its high lutein, vitamin C, calcium, and iron content (Dicoteau, 2000; Morelock and Correll, 2008). The primary problem for spinach production is pest stress (disease and insect). The main diseases are downy mildew, white rust, Fusarium wilt (=Fusarium decline) (F. oxysporum f.sp. spinaciae), Stemphylium leaf spot, and the primary pests are leafminer and aphids. Therefore, breeding resistant varieties with high yield and high nutrition is the main foci of spinach breeding program. Improvement of spinach through classic and molecular breeding to develop high leafiness yield varieties with uniformity, a good germination percentage, slow bolting, disease resistance/tolerance, and with high nutritional components as the spinach breeding goals. The program will also develop diversity spinach varieties with different leaf texture of smooth, semi-savoy, or savoy (puckered), different leaf shapes of round or oval, leaf edges with cupped in, cupped out or flat, different leaf discover genome-wide SNPs for spinach; construct linkage maps in spinach; conduct QTL mapping or association analysis for important traits like downy mildew and white rust disease resistance, leaf shape and texture; analyze genetic diversity for spinach cultivars growing in North America and world-wide; and develop a SNP set for spinach cultivar identification.Genetic improvement in cowpea: Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) (2n=2x=22), an annual legume is originated in Africa and it is widely grown in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia and in the southern United States (Muchero et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2012). The cowpea breeding program at the University of Arkansas has over 50 years history and has released more than 12 varieties and more than 1,000 advanced breeding lines. Some of releases have been very useful to the processing industry and some have been widely grown by farms (http://aaes.uark.edu/veg.morelock.html). The breeding program has emphasized improved plant architecture, earliness, concentrated flowering and fruiting as well as improved yield and processing quality and more preferred to release upright and bush-type cultivars easily harvested by direct combining or by hand. The program will continuously emphasize improved yield and seed quality such as protein and sugar content and erect plant habit and also improved drought and heat tolerance through molecular breeding to develop cowpea cultivars emphasized growing in Africa besides in North America. Molecular breeding has become part of the breeding program to speed up breeding progress and obtain genetic gain in breeding. Molecular breeding covers molecular marker discovery, genetic mapping, QTL identification, genetic diversity, association analysis, marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genome-wide selection (GWS). MAS has been successfully used in selection of speci?c genes/alleles in plant breeding. SNP, with its abundance, cost ef?ciency and high throughput scoring, has become a powerful tool in genome mapping, association studies, diversity analysis, and tagging of important genes in plant genomics. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is one of the next-generation sequencing platforms used for genome-wide SNP discovery, trait mapping and association, and allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on any germplasm or species with and without prior knowledge of the genome (Elshire et al., 2011; Sonah et al., 2013). Phenotypic data are the key for trait: marker association. The program will use available phenotypic data from public in order to save time and save cost. For those unavailable data, the program will conduct phenotyping through the experiments. The program will conduct association and develop SNP markers for agronomic traits: seed production (yield), 100-seed weight and seed size, and maturity day; for morphologic traits include plant habit, dry pod abio- and biotic (disease and pest) resistance/tolerance including resistance to cowpea wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. tracheiphilum), cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), bacterial blight (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vignicola), cowpea aphid, iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC), and low phosphorus efficiency; and seed quality traits: seed protein and sugar contents. Genotypic data will be obtained from SNP genotyping and SNPs will be postulated from GBS. The specific project will develop nutritional cowpea lines with high protein content and/or sweetness cowpea with high sucrose content. The program will conduct genome-wide association for protein and sugar contents through GBS platform. It is expected SNP markers will be identified to be associated with protein and sugar contents. SNP markers will be used in cowpea breeding through MAS and new cowpea variety with high yield and high protein and/or high sucrose content will be selected and released.Improvement of greenhouse and hydroponics leaf vegetable crops: (1) Spinach will be one of the greenhouse vegetables. During 2014, the vegetable breeding program will screen heat-tolerance spinach from various cultivars, hybrids, and germplasm released in North American, from USDA spinach accessions originally collected world-wide, and from the advanced breeding lines from Arkansas spinach program. If the heat-tolerance lines is identified, the program will use the heat-tolerance lines as donor to transfer heat-tolerance into elite lines to release heat tolerance, slow-booting, disease resistance and high yield spinach cultivars. (2) Dandelions will be as a vegetable crop growing in a greenhouse conditions as a new crop for breeding program: collecting dandelion accessions, screening dandelion lines, selecting dandelion as varieties, developing and breeding new dandelion cultivars. Meanwhile, building SNP platform and GBS platform will be part of the breeding program to enhance dandelion molecular breeding. The program will do classic and molecular breeding for other vegetables as hydroponics food crops such as chicory, endive, Amaranths and Blitum."

Despite such advances in pest management as more selective pesticides, use of behavior modifying chemicals, resistant varieties and transgenic plants, pest arthropods and weeds continue to damage our agricultural crops and natural ecosystems. Biological control, used singly or in combination with other management options, should be the centerpiece of successful pest management programs. In recent years, researchers in the northeast have worked with many types of biological control agents including insects, mites, parasitoids, and pathogens in successfully managing key pests including gypsy moths, purple loosestrife, birch leafminers, mites on apples and vegetables, fruit moths, alfalfa weevil, Mexican bean beetle, whiteflies in greenhouses, imported cabbageworm, euonymus scale, etc. and are currently working against such critical forestry pests as hemlock wooly adelgid and emerald ash borer These successes and ongoing efforts have generally involved cooperative work by scientists from several states and agencies.

Seedling establishment occurs when the seedling 1) is competent to photosynthesize, assimilate water and nutrients (apart from seed stores) required to grow, and so must undergo developmentally appropriate cellular and tissue differentiation and maturation, and 2) can appropriately respond to environmental stimuli such as light, gravity and touch. This transition between germination/ emergence and growth independent of the seed stores is crucial as seedlings are susceptible to unfavorable biotic and abiotic factors during this stage. This is especially important for agronomic crops needed for food and fuel. Depending on the crop and cultivar, 10%-55% for maize and up to 48% to70% for edamame seedlings fail at this stage in the field. The results of this work can be used for crop improvement at the critical stage of seedling establishment which becomes increasingly important as the climate changes. In addition, this information can be applied to natural ecosystems as well as agricultural ecosystems.The basic methods used will be to make a model of seedling establishment. The factors that will go into the model are the genes that are turned on and turned off during seedling establishment, and the coordination and of the proteins that increase and decrease during seedlings establishment. These basic science pieces of information can be combined to make a model that will help us identify and then understand the processes that occur during this time. Once we understand how seedling establishment occurs, then we can apply this information to food crops and predict what characteristics are important to seedlings establishment as the climate changes."

Insects of major interest include several stink bug species, soybean podworm, and other late season insect pests that feed on soybean foliage, pods, and seeds and are difficult to manage with available control methods. Also of concern are three additional soybean insect pests which will soon arrive in Missouri and attack the soybean crop. They include the red banded stink bug, the brown marmorated stink bug, and the bean plataspid. Knowledge gained from the study of current soybean insect pests may help in developing effective management strategies for the invading soybean pests. It is important to document the current distribution and abundance of soybean insects in Missouri&#39;s four soybean production regions and within individual soybean fields. This information will be gained through a statewide random survey of 60 producer fields each sampled three times during the growing season for a three year period. Insect samples will be collected by taking 20 sweeps using a 15-inch diameter sweep net. In a second study distribution of soybean insects within a soybean field will be determined through the growing season by collection of monthly sweep net samples at 10 locations within each plot ranging from field border rows to 160 feet into the field interior. Insect abundance will be determined at each of these ten sample locations in soybean planted at 7-, 15, and 30-inch row spacing. Insects that initially infest field edges before moving to field interiors will be the focus of this study. Several stink bug species will be intensively studied. A third soybean insect study will determine insect distribution through the growing season in soybean varieties with four different maturity ratings and three planting dates equivalent to early, mid, and late season. A fourth study will utilize pheromone baited traps and sweep net sampling to determine  first occurrence  and abundance of the red banded and brown marmorated stink bugs, plus the closely related bean plataspid species in Missouri. Pheromone traps and sweeps will be located along major highways and in select border counties. At present, the red banded stink bug is prevalent in Arkansas, the brown marmorated is found in several of Missouri&#39;s border states, and the bean plataspid has been found close to Missouri in the adjoining state of Tennessee. Early detection of these invading insect pests of soybean in Missouri should allow producers time to gain the knowledge to better manage these new soybean pests before population grow to economic levels in the state&#39;s soybean crop. The more knowledge available about each specific pest allows for development of effective pest control strategies and soybean integrated pest management programs."

Annually, rice alone provides nearly 34 million metric tons of protein, which is about half of the total protein provided by legumes. Rice is the main component of diets in many parts of the world, including Asia. In these regions, widespread malnutrition occurs. High protein rice can be used as a vehicle to remediate malnutrition problems worldwide through both humanitarian missions or can be tailored into specific products to meet the needs for individuals and human populations as a whole. Improving the protein content in rice is the first general objective of this state project. The second general objective is the development of herbicide-resistant rice. Current Clearfield technology is very effective in controlling red rice,a major weed in rice. Its sustainability has become of concern due to field outcrossing between Clearfield rice with red rice. A new type of herbicide-resistant rice that has a different mode of action, therefore, needs to be developed. Field tests are being conducted for the most promising high protein rice lines that were developed from the previous project. Total crude protein content and amino acid profiles will be determined for brown and milled rice. Isolation of the different fractions of seed storage proteins will also be conducted. To develop new herbicide resistant lines, different herbicides that have different modes of action than the imidazolinone herbicide will be used to screenM2 plants that are grown from the ethyl methanesulfonate treated Mo plants. Genetic studies will be conducted to determine the inheritance of the trait.World malnutrition is an undoubtedly complex problem. The availability of high protein rice varieties, it will provide a solid bottom line that can be used to help solve the worldwide malnutrition problem across social, cultural, and economic issues. High protein rice is also important to economy of Louisiana and other stated where rice is grown. New types of herbicide-resistant rice with different resistance modes will offer effective method to control weeds (including red rice) that acquire resistance to NewPath herbicide. These new herbicide-resistant lines will strengthen the weed control program and help farmers to stabilize rice yield potential."

Improved control over water application leads to less nutrient loss, while increased soil organic matter (SOM) from conservation tillage increases water and nutrient supplying potential of soils. Both present opportunities for improved crop nutrient management, but altering irrigation and tillage without changing fertilizer practices can reduce yield and quality of crops such as sugarbeet and malting barley from oversupply of nitrogen (N). Phosphorus (P) fertilizer management on calcareous soils is also a long-term issue for Wyoming producers and could be affected by management changes. Also, many Wyoming production areas do not receive adequate irrigation water for whole growing seasons. Improved understanding of interactions among conservation tillage, water supply and use, and nutrient management are needed. We propose a combined on-farm/on-station experiment to investigate factors that support improved yields and quality in irrigated sugarbeet-dry bean-barley (SB-DB-BY) production. This research project will assess nutrient use and requirements, SOM dynamics, N and P cycling, and water use under three tillage practices:conventional (CT), no till (NT), and strip till (ST); and two irrigation levels (full and 75% of plant needs) under the lateral-move sprinkler irrigation system of the UW Research &amp; Extension Center located in Powell, WY. We will also evaluate effects of incorporating cover crops following barley and beans in the rotation. Trials will be replicated on farms in northwestern Wyoming as well. Our primary objectives are to (1) develop revised soil fertility recommendations for N and phosphorus (P) under the six irrigation x tillage scenarios, (2) evaluate effects of incorporating cover crops into rotations; (3) monitor soil organic matter and moisture dynamics, and (4) engage producers and ag advisers through extension education activities and materials.

Small ruminant producers are rapidly running out of chemical control options due to widespread GIN resistance to available anthelmintics. Newer anthelminties for cattle and sheep are available that could potentially be useful in sheep and goat integrated parasite control. Several non-chemical novel parasite control technologies, such as FAMACHA for targeted selective treatments (TST), copper oxide wire particles (COWP), and grazing or feeding of the high-tannin perennial legume Sericea lespedeza have been tested and validated by the American Consortium for Small Ruminant Parasite Control (ACSRPC). In the proposed work, the efficacy of two new anthelmintics- LongRange and Zolvix, will be evaluated for sheep and goats GIN control. A combination of chemical and non-chemical novel integrated parasite control strategies for small ruminants will be tested. The results will be distributed to producers, scientists, and other clientele groups in U.S. and worldwide through the ACSRPC website, scientific and producer oriented publications, and presentations at scientific meetings and producer workshops."

The body&#39;s metabolic processes form by-products known as free radicals, which are reactive forms of oxygen. Antioxidants are scavengers of these by-products and protect cells from damage by free radicals. The result of reducing these free radicals is an improved immune system. Antioxidants in general play an important role in disease prevention and health promotion. Several of the recognized antioxidants are the vitamins A, C, and E, and the mineral selenium. Food pigments also possess antioxidant properties. Antioxidants are a subcategory of phytochemicals (also referred to as phytonutrients). Phytochemicals are naturally occurring compounds in plant foods--fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains. Phytochemicals include flavonoid compounds such as plant pigments, the carotenoids which include beta carotene, lycopene and xanthophyll, and the anthocyanin, which is a red to deep purple pigment.The fruit and vegetable intake in the US remains below recommended levels despite evidence of health benefits of regular consumption (Murphy et al., 2012). Highly pigmented plant foods are great contributors of antioxidants. Offering locally grown plant foods to consumers may provide for an economic incentive as well as health and wellness to our state&#39;s citizens."

There are several factors that are impacting crop production and the sustainability of farming systems in northern Idaho. These include soil acidification which exhibits negative impacts on crop health and yield, the need for more precise recommendations for seeding rate and nitrogen use to maximize yield and protein production in wheat, and evaluation of biostimulants as a potential mechanism to improve plant vigor and yield. Addressing each of these areas is vital to improve soil health, reduce the fertilizer inputs required to produce high yielding crops, and promote the sustainability and profitability of cropping systems in northern Idaho. Research into the area of soil acidity and liming could result in improved yields, improved nutrient availability, and increased nitrogen fixation in legume crops grown in rotation with wheat. Likewise, new information concerning variety response to nitrogen inputs and evaluating the feasibility of using biostimulants in north Idaho cropping systems will lead to improved soil health and reduced fertilizer inputs, resulting in lower quantities of nitrogen and other nutrients leaching into waterways.The research planned to address each of these problems will be a combination of greenhouse trials and field research plots that will be conducted on University of Idaho research farms as well as grower fields in collaboration with grower cooperators. In the case of the acid soils research, several commercial sources of lime are being tested at varying rates of application at three locations in northern Idaho and eastern Washington in collaboration with growers. Additional field trials will examine nitrogen use efficiency in combination with liming treatments and explore the ability of commercial lime sources to reduce the impact of Cephalosporium stripe on winter wheat. A regional soil survey will also be conducted to determine the scope of the acid soil problem and identify those areas where lime application is likely to have the greatest impact in reducing soil acidity and/or aluminum toxicity. A second component of research will examine impact of varying seeding rate and nitrogen rate on winter wheat varieties that are commonly grown or are being tested for possible variety release. Agronomic measurements, including yield components, will be collected to identify optimal seeding rate/nitrogen rates for each variety. The ultimate goal is to design nitrogen and/or seeding rates that can be custom tailored to each variety being produced. Likewise, variable rate seeding experiments will be established in cooperation with growers interested in this technology, with variable rates applied in strips on a field scale. In addition to yield information obtained by the grower at harvest, additional agronomic measurements will be collected during the growing season to identify optimal seeding rates for different portions of the field. The third project will examine the use of biostimulants through a combination of field tests to examine the feasibility of using biostimulants in crop production as well as via greenhouse testing to determine whether biostimulants can improve microbial activity and potentially increase the general suppression of soilborne plant pathogens.There are several goals for these projects. In the case of the acid soils research, the goals are to better understand the distribution of soil acidity and aluminum toxicity in northern Idaho in order to identify those areas that will benefit the most from liming; to provide additional information on liming sources, rates, and the economics of lime application; and to identify secondary benefits to liming in northern Idaho, namely improved nutrient use efficiency and reduced plant disease incidence. The goals for the seeding density and nitrogen rate studies with respect to new wheat varieties is to provide updated and variety specific information to allow growers to produce optimal yields with lower inputs. In addition, the variable rate seeding may allow growers to add additional precision to how they grow their crops through more accurate seeding rates, making more efficient use of available water and reducing nutrient inputs. Finally, there is a movement to examine ways to improve soil health through the use of cover crops, novel crop rotation, etc. As part of this effort, the research on biostimulants may identify an additional tool that can be used to promote more sustainable crop production and help to introduces alternative management strategies into mainstream crop production. Overall, this research should help to improve soil health and promote more sustainable production through more efficient use of resources for production in northern Idaho."

Small grain cereals (winter and spring wheat and spring barley) account for more than 80% of the acreage annually. Traditional rotation crops are pea and lentil. This has prompted many of the region&#39;s growers to investigate alternative crops to avoid the disease buildup and other problems associated with monoculture cereal production.Brassicaceae crops such as canola, rapeseed and mustard have shown potential as good rotational crops in the Pacific Northwest, and inclusion of these crops in traditional and direct seed systems have proven invaluable. These crops break disease cycles that result from mono-culture cereal production and significantly improve soil health by increasing organic matter and allowing greater water infiltration, less water run-off and markedly reduced soilerossion. In addition they ofer growers greater diversity of crops and managementpest management options.The objective of the research group is to develop superior Brassicaceae oilseed, forage, mustard, and soil fumigant cultivars that are highly adapted to a wide range of dry land and irrigated regions of Idaho and other U.S. regions. Development of these crops will offer growers greater flexibility and alternatives to include in crop rotations, be more environmentally sound, help to reduce crop inputs, improve profitability and sustainability, and make U.S. growers more competitive in international markets."

Soil conservation and improved efficiency of resource (water and fertilizer) use is critical to feeding this growing population. The pressure that agriculture is facing to produce more food while conserving natural resources such as soil, water, and nutrients is compounded by an increase in the middle-income population and the related demand for food, fuel, and fiber. Conservation agriculture and resource efficient technologies are available in the United States, but are only regionally adopted. Advances in plant genetics and machinery, and availability of cheap energy and inorganic fertilizer greatly improved agricultural productivity during the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution resulted in a shift from diverse agricultural enterprises into highly mechanized and specialized production units. Today, a growing awareness is emerging that the stability and resiliency of agricultural lands appear to be impaired by specialization, concentration of operations and expansion of scale which have compartmentalized and disrupted nutrient cycling far removed from natural ecosystem cycling (Gates, 2003; Franzluebbers, 2007).In the South Texas Plains, the primary agriculture commodities produced are cotton, corn, and cattle. Steadily decreasing water availability, more frequent and severe drought conditions, and increasing costs of fuel, fertilizer, and labor require maximum efficiency for economically and environmentally stable agricultural systems. As a result of these economic drivers, land tracts are still large, but average acreage is decreasing and where cattle are produced, the primary profit is shifting from beef cattle production to wildlife hunting leases. New management practices that maximize resource efficiency and conserve natural resources are necessary in order to maintain agriculture production in south Texas. One of these management shifts is the replacement of introduced forages with native forages in pastures. Besides providing nutrition for grazing livestock, forages in the region are also important for maintaining water quality and providing erosion control along waterways and near the Gulf of Mexico. Using forages for soil remediation caused by salt contamination and in rotation with traditional row cropping systems also have potential for this region in the future. Another management shift is the introduction of conservation tillage into the region, which may increase the potential success of cover crops, which reduce soil erosion. Conservation tillage has been shown to decrease soil erosion, soil temperatures, and evaporative water loss, and increase water infiltration (Pimentel et al., 1995; Reeves, 1997; Kay and VandenBygaart, 2002). Since increases in soil organic C (SOC) and decreases in mechanical soil disturbance are two hallmarks of conservation tillage systems, a conservation tillage system is expected to improve water capture and availability over the long-term timeframe. Research in other regions indicates that although water is lost from cover crops through evapotranspiration the total soil moisture increases when conservation tillage is also used (Reeves, 1994). The present push towards production of sustainable bioenergy through the cultivation of cellulosic feedstocks may also present new opportunities for forage use.Research, especially regionally focused in south Texas, is lacking in regards to improvements in resource use efficiency due to the transition of introduce pastures to native forages, the use of forages as cover crops in conservation tillage systems, the integration of legumes into rotational cropping systems, the use of forages for cellulosic ethanol, and how various management practices may impact these systems. Because agriculture production in south Texas is diverse, this program is broad and seeks to fill this identified knowledge gap by evaluating the use of forages and their management for livestock, wildlife, as erosion control, salt remediation, and bioenergy. Using forages to improve the resource use efficiency of agriculture systems will improve the resource use efficiency of the system as a whole. Unifying this program of interest is the use of legumes and forbs with a systems research approach. Information gathered with this program may provide sustainable remedies for problems facing livestock production, bioremediation, biofuels, and crop production practices. The vision of this program is to be a nationally recognized and respected Forage Management Program with groundbreaking research and competitive graduate student training. The Forage Management Program will perform research that maintains or improves forage production while maintaining or enhancing resource (water, fertilizer, energy) efficiency. Graduate training will be a primary component of the research and education within this program."

Production of fresh-peas has expanded from  back yard  gardening to commercial acreage production. Marketing of the fresh peas has expanded from being just farmers markets to grocery food stores. A vegetable crop production and marketing cooperative (Horton Community Producers, FSC Colt, Arkansas), for example, has been formed. This Cooperative markets fresh peas in Wal-Mart food stores.The need to develop new, more productive and uniform seed varieties has increased. This research need has arisen for higher yield for increased production. Correspondingly, many fresh-pea producers have transitioned from hand/ manual harvesting to machine/ mechanical harvesting of fresh-peas. With this transition has arisen the need to breed new varieties that are suitable for mechanical harvesting. Moreover, as fresh-pea markets and consumers have expanded, it has become evident that there has been differential consumer market preference and acceptance for different seed types/color. Black-eyed seed-type, for example is accepted and preferred for consumption in the dry seed form but not as fresh peas. There is research needed to develop new varieties for consumer market preference.The purpose of this project is to continue the evaluation and improvement of the existing 800 cowpea germplasm accessions in order to identify breeding lines needed to develop fresh-pea varieties with traits conferring consumer- and consumer-market acceptance and preference.

This limits the opportunity to include cover crops in rotations. The primary focus of this project is to produce information, management tools, and technologies to help farmers integrate cover crops and compost into intensive vegetable and strawberry production systems, maximize the benefits from cover cropping, and reduce production costs.    The main objective of this project is to develop ecologically-based soil management strategies that enhance soil quality, nutrient cycling, pest and disease management, and profitability, and reduce off-farm inputs, organic vegetable and strawberry production systems. The subobjectives are as follows:   1. Evaluate the effects of cover cropping frequency and compost on soil quality, vegetable and strawberry yields, soil borne disease, and system profitability. 2. Evaluate the effects of a legume-rye mixture versus non-legume cover crops on vegetable and strawberry yields. 3. Evaluate the effects of cover crop seeding rates on weed density and weed management costs in subsequent vegetable and strawberry crops grown in rotational sequences. 4. Identify pathogens causing emerging bacterial diseases of organic vegetables and small fruit.  Approach: The first three sub objectives will be addressed using unpublished data collected during the first 10 years of the Salinas Organic Cropping Systems (SOCS) experiment, and with additional laboratory analyses on archived soil samples using standard proceedures. During the next 5 years, experiment will continue with a less intense management phase to provide the team with the time to analyze and understand the existing data before deciding if the experiment should be terminated or continued. Furthermore, a complete analysis of unpublished data from the first 10 years is essential to provide insights into potential modifications to the existing treatments, and to formulate meaningful questions to be addressed if a new long-term study is initiated.  The following hypotheses will be tested for the first three subobjectives outlined above. - Soil quality will be higher in systems where cover crops are used annually than in systems where they are used only quadrennially.   - Soil quality will be higher in systems that receive compost annually than systems that only receive cover crops. - Vegetable and strawberry yields will be higher in systems where cover crops are used annually than in systems where they are used only quadrennially.  - Vegetable and strawberry yields will be higher in systems that receive compost annually than systems that only receive cover crops.  - Profits will be higher in systems where cover crops are used annually than in systems where they are used only quadrennially.   - Profits will be higher in systems that receive compost annually than systems that only receive cover crops.  - Verticillium microsclerotia counts will be higher in systems that receive legume-rye cover crops than systems with non-legume cover crops. - Vegetable and strawberry yields will be higher following legume versus non-legume cover crops. - Weed density will be lower in vegetable and strawberry systems where cover crops were planted at relatively high seeding rates over several years, than when using lower seeding rates. - Weed management cost during vegetable and strawberry production will be lower in rotations where cover crops were planted at relatively high seeding rates over several years, than when using lower seeding rates.  The results from this SOCS experiment will be communicated to stakeholders by publications and presentations. The results from the first 10 years may indicate that there would be value in collecting additional field data or conducting additional analyses of archived soil samples. If this occurs we will modify our plan to collect this additional data with our existing collaborators or seek additional collaborations as needed.   The fourth sub objective will be achieved by soliciting samples of new diseases from organic fields. Samples will be analyzed with standard methods to identify the bacterial pathogens. The results will be reported to the growers through publications and presentations. If samples are not submitted, work will be conducted to resolve the etiology of diseases from organic systems for which isolates have been obtained but research has not proceeded."

Approach: The major emphasis of this project is to identify cacao genotypes tolerant to abiotic stresses (drought, infertile acidic soils, and high/low irradiance) and develop sustainable management systems to improve their productivity and bean quality. The residual effects of cover crop cultivation and improved management systems (agroforestry planting, high density planting, fertilization, sanitary and phyto-sanitary practices) on the changes of soil quality parameters (physical, chemical, biological) and bean yield and quality will also be determined. Nutrient use efficiency of macro-micronutrients of elite cacao genotypes and cover crops at various abiotic stresses and management systems will be evaluated. Enhanced nutrient use efficiency and sustainable high productivity of cacao will be achieved through improved management practices. To achieve these objectives we have established collaborative research programs under specific cooperative agreements with government and non-government organizations (NGO) and national and international agricultural universities in cacao growing regions of Peru, Brazil, and Ecuador, and the University of Florida at Fort Pierce as well as the USDA ARS in Puerto Rico to establish controlled studies in greenhouses and large scale field trials. University of Reading (UR), UK will be collaborating on abiotic stress assessment. Cacao genotypes with superior ability for establishment under abiotic stresses will be identified and incorporated in cacao improvement programs. Improved management systems will be developed, based on the results of this research, to enhance cacao yield potentials and bean quality and further improve soil fertility and halt the further soil degradation."

Determine if absorption of selected phytochemicals can be measured in the poultry duodenal loop model.  2.B. Define bioavailability of specific phytochemicals from select foods using the validated duodenal loop model.  Approach: This project has two major objectives.  The first is to develop lines of staple food crops with improved bioavailability and content of iron (Fe).  To do so we will employ our established screening tools of an iron bioavailability bioassay and an animal model.  In conjunction with these tools, we will make use of mass spectroscopy and marker assisted molecular breeding techniques.  With these approaches, we will be able to identify and utilize regions of the plant genome that harbor genes associated with the enhanced food crop nutritional quality for Fe. To further complement the above approaches, we will continue our work on the identification of agricultural and food processing practices that enhance the bioavailability and content of Fe and Zn in staple food crops.   The second major objective of this project is to develop a method to measure and evaluate the bioavailability of functional phytochemicals from plant foods.  To do so, we will assess the use of a surgical model utilizing the unique intestinal anatomy of the broiler chicken to measure absorption of compounds from the duodenal segment of the intestine.  This approach uses an established surgical preparation involving anesthetized animals.  Our initial efforts with this model will focus on compounds that are common to many staple food crops, fruits and vegetables.  These phytochemicals will include the flavonoids epicatechin, quercitin, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and kaempferol. Enhancing our knowledge of bioavailability of health promoting phytochemicals will significantly improve efforts to develop more nutritious plant foods."

Determine the effects of a diet and activity enhanced Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program on weight and health related outcomes in mothers and their infants.  2. Determine associations between dietary patterns (identified using variant statistical and epidemiologic approches) and health inicatiors in children using the most recent NHANES datasets.  Approach: 1. The Delta Healthy Sprouts Project is an 18-month, randomized, controlled comparative effectiveness trial. Participants are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms (75 participants per arm) – Parents as Teachers (PaT) or Parents as Teachers Enhanced (PaTE). All participants receive monthly PaT lessons and materials. Only participants in the experimental arm receive PaTE supplemental nutrition and physical activity lessons and materials. The control arm utilizes the PaT curriculum which is a nationally recognized, evidence based MIECHV program that includes one-on-one home visits, monthly group meetings, developmental screenings, and resource networks for families. Through these activities, PaT seeks to increase parental knowledge of child development, improve parenting practices, provide early detection of developmental delays, prevent child abuse, and increase school readiness. PaTE, delivered to experimental participants, builds on PaT by adding culturally tailored, maternal weight management and early childhood obesity prevention components. These components include healthy weight gain during pregnancy, nutrition and physical activity in the gestational and postnatal periods, breastfeeding, appropriate introduction of solid foods, and parental modeling of positive nutrition and physical activity behaviors. The interventions are delivered in the home to women beginning early in their second trimester of pregnancy by community based, trained Parent Educators.  2. Dietary patterns will be determined for 2-18 year old U.S. children using the 2 most recent cycles of NHANES datasets with available dietary data. Analyses will be conducted separately by gender, age group (2-5, 6-11, and 12-18 years), race/ethnicity, and poverty income ratio (PIR) given sufficient sample sizes. The first dietary pattern identification method is based upon existing recommended dietary guidelines and current knowledge. The Health Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) ranks individuals in terms of compliance with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Total HEI-2010 scores range from 0-100 and are computed by summing scores for 12 components including:  total fruit; whole fruit; total vegetables, greens and beans; whole grains; dairy; total protein foods; seafood and plant proteins; fatty acids; refined grains; sodium; and empty calories.  For the first 9 components, higher intakes result in higher scores (healthier diet).  For the last 3 components, lower intakes (more beneficial) result in higher scores. Latent class analysis (LCA), the second dietary pattern identification method, derives empirical dietary patterns based on current study data. Similar to cluster analysis, LCA partitions data into groups so that observations (children) within a group are as similar as possible to each other (foods consumed) and as dissimilar as possible to the observations in other groups. Differing from cluster analysis, LCA does not absolutely assign observations to groups, but assigns a probability of group membership. Associations between identified dietary pattern scores, excess adiposity, physical activity, and sedentary behavior will be determined."

In particular, multiple genomes from the same or related species are actively being acquired; this has lead to the new research field of pangenomics.  Pangenomics sheds new light on how organisms adapt to their environment and what genomic features vary or stay the same within related species.  This project deals with some of the computational challenges associated with efficiently storing and querying large pan-genomic data sets.  New and enhanced data structures will be developed that efficiently describe the genomes of closely related lines or species and permit fast information retrieval for common activities such as sequence searching.  The investigators will develop software tools that will be made freely available to the general scientific community and test and validate these tools using several important species, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a yeast species), Arapidopsis thaliana (thale cress, a small flowering plant) and Medicago truncatula (barrel clover, a small legume).  This project will initiate work on a next generation of bioinformatics algorithms that can exploit the increased information content available from multiple accessions and intelligently use the data for unbiased, species-wide analyses.  The current trajectory of next generation sequencing improvements, including falling costs and increased read lengths and throughput, ensure that multiple genomes per species will be routine within the next decade.  The researchers will investigate improvements to graphical data structures such as deBruijn and string graphs, used to represent pan genomes and develop associated algorithms for querying pan-genomic data, building on data structures such as the FM-index.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arapidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula will be the principal model organisms for this study, listed in order of complexity.  Multiple genomes of each of these organisms have been sequenced so they are good candidates for pangenomic study.  In particular, this project will complement existing work on symbiotic relationships of M. truncatula.  This work will also shed light on the impact of reference bias in genomic analysis and provide alternative routes to avoid it. It will provide a practical method for pan-genomic sampling that provides a single FASTA sequence that minimizes reference bias in downstream analysis. This research will lead to new software tools that will be made available to the community and will be used to engage students in bioinformatics research and educational activities."

The lead investigator and collaborators have discovered a new type of lignin, apparently restricted to the seed coats of a range of non-crop species. This new type of lignin has significant promise for conversion to carbon fibers. If this type of lignin could be engineered into bioenergy feedstocks, it would represent a high value co-product of biorefining. This project will determine the biochemical pathway by which this new type of lignin is synthesized, and the steps that will need to be taken to make it accumulate in the stems and leaves of plants. Understanding the limitations to the accumulation of different types of lignin in different plant tissue and cell types also addresses a fundamental problem in cell biology. This project uses a range of approaches from genetic mechanisms through metabolic engineering to production and testing of biomaterials. Outreach activities will target two demographically distinct groups; highly talented high school students at the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, and mathematics and science public school teachers with primarily Hispanic students who are Limited English Proficient (LEP). Teachers will develop curricular activities in Spanish and English to implement in their classrooms. The project will include informal learning activities through deployment of the projects to encourage K-12 girls into STEM through outreach with the Dallas Society of Women Engineers.  During lignin biosynthesis, the monolignol precursors are functionalized by aromatic hydroxylation and O-methylation to generate, successively, hydroxyphenyl (H), catechyl (C), guaiacyl (G), 5-hydroxyguaiacyl (5-OH-G), and syringyl (S) units. Natural lignins in angiosperms consist of approximately equal amounts of G and S units, with less than 2% of H units and no C or 5-OH-G units; gymnosperm lignins are similar but lack S units. 5-OH-G units are incorporated into lignins in transgenic plants in which the second methylation step is blocked, but C-units have not been reported to accumulate in the lignin of angiosperms in which the first methylation step is similarly blocked. The Principal Investigators have shown that the seed coats of a wide range of dicot and monocot plants contain a novel type of lignin (C-lignin) derived totally from catechyl units. This linear polymer has advantageous properties for conversion to carbon fibers. However, C-lignin appears to be restricted to seed coats in nature.  This award will address two major questions: what is the mechanism underlying the biosynthesis of C-lignin in plant seed coats, and why does C-lignin not occur naturally in the vegetative tissues of the plant? The researchers hypothesize that C-lignin biosynthesis involves loss of function of one or both methylation steps in classical monolignol biosynthesis, and will determine how this happens using transcriptome profiling in developing seeds of Cleome hassleriana, in which there is an abrupt transition from G lignin to C lignin biosynthesis at around 13 days post-pollination. Addressing the second question will involve attempting to introduce the C-lignin polymer into different tissues of the model legume Medicago truncatula, utilizing existing mutants in which enzymes of lignin methylation have been functionally disrupted.  These studies aim to determine the potential for engineering accumulation of C-lignin in vegetative tissues in sufficient yields to enable industrial processing, and, in this context, improved methods for extraction of C-lignin from both seeds and vegetative tissues will be developed, and the physical properties of the polymer further analyzed."

Some, like tomato, rice, beans and other cultivated species, cast pollen from male to female organs in the same flower. Others employ ingenious schemes to ensure that one individual pollinates the flower of another. Persimmon, pistachio, kiwi, hops, and spinach are amongst the few percent of plant species in which these functions are found in separate individuals, a condition called dioecy. In mammals maleness or femaleness are determined by X and Y chromosomes: males have an X and a Y and females have two Xs. A single gene on the Y is responsible for triggering the development of male traits. Most dioecious plants resemble the human system, with XY males and XX females. But what gene(s) may be responsible for determining whether a particular plant carries male or female flowers has been a long-standing mystery. Recently, the authors combed through the genomes of persimmon trees looking for genes that were exclusive to males and found pair of genes, called OGI and MeGI. In females, MeGI builds to high level and acts like a neutering agent, repressing pollen formation. In males, OGI prevents the accumulation of MeGI. Discovery of the OGI-MeGI system in persimmon opens up new possibilities in plant breeding. Controlling flower organs is also important for facilitating production of high yielding hybrids from controlled hybridization of selected inbreds. Broader impacts include an outreach aimed at increasing skills and confidence in Big Data Analysis for high school or early college students of underpresented background. Additionally, because dioecy evolved independently many times in plants, this work provides a foundation to ask whether plants invented similar or different solutions to the same problem.  These results cast light on the organization of a plant Y chromosome and provide a working model for dioecy determination in Diospyros species. The authors aim to capitalize on these findings to further investigate the molecular function of the OGI and MeGI genes, as well as ask more general questions about the evolution of dioecy determination in dioecious species. Their specific objectives are to: 1) Define the Y chromosome in Diospyros lotus using a combination of sequencing and genetic approaches 2) Unravel the molecular function of OGI and MeGI using transgenic technology in A. thaliana and genome-wide genomic analyses in Diospryros and 3) Characterize variation in the Y-chromosome dioecy determination region in Diospyros and closely-related species and test whether similar systems are at play in other dioecious systems. This work provides a model for unraveling dioecy determination systems in economically-relevant plant species, an area important for human sustenance and well being."

The bacteria establish a symbiotic relationship with their legume hosts, residing in root nodules where specialized structures develop to facilitate the exchange of nutrients between the two partners. This is an economically important process as it reduces the amount of nitrogen fertilizer needed to grow crops and is a key component in sustainable agriculture. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the nodulation process should lead to insights about more effective ways to capture and fix atmospheric nitrogen and to the transfer of this capacity to non-legume plants. One notable achievement in our understanding of legume nodulation is the characterization of the signaling steps that control the infection of the plant root hair cell by rhizobia, the initial step of nodulation. This symbiotic pathway is regulated by almost 2000 genes in legume root hair cells. The investigators will characterize a network of genes essential in controlling the early stages of nodulation. In addition to its impact on legume research, the broader impacts of this project include the development of unique educational programs dedicated to Oklahoma high-school and undergraduate students from under-represented groups, promoting strong integration between research and education.  This CAREER project is built on the hypothesis that regulatory networks directly under the control of one or several transcription factors of the symbiotic pathway orchestrate the proper activation and timing of gene expression in root hair cells in response to rhizobia. Specifically focusing on the Nodulation Signaling Pathway1 (NSP1) regulatory network, this project will address two key questions: What is the identity of the soybean and medicago root hair genes directly under the control of NSP1? What are the protein complexes asscociated with NSP1 and how do they control the expression of root hair genes in response to rhizobial inoculation? To answer these questions, the investigators will 1) characterize the soybean root hair genes directly under the control of the transcription factors GmNSP1a and b in response to Bradyrhizobium japonicum through high-throughput sequencing technologies and by applying DamID-seq or ChIP-seq methods, 2) identify the protein partners of the GmNSP1a and b in root hair cells inoculated with B. japonicum by co-immunoprecipitation of the protein partners in root hair cells upon rhizobia inoculation; 3) validate the conservation of the root hair gene regulatory networks between soybean and Medicago truncatula, the model legume."

Modern agriculture depends upon chemical N fertilizers that cause extensive environmental damage and are not sustainable. In contrast to the majority of crops, legumes (such as soybean, bean, lentils, alfalfa) form symbiotic associations with soil bacteria, resulting in the formation of nodules in which the bacteria accumulate in high numbers and fix atmospheric N for the plant. Because of N-fixing ability, legumes play an important role in sustainability in both agricultural and natural environments. However, many tree legumes do not form nodules and are thus considered non-N fixing. Many non-nodulating legumes are important components of various ecological systems and are increasingly being used for land reclamation and as biofuel crops. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which non-nodulating legumes obtain their nitrogen will be crucial in improving the utilization of these legumes in nutrient-poor soils. The project will provide opportunities to undergraduate students and a post-doctoral fellow to train in both microbial and plant biology, especially as they relate to plant-microbial interactions. The benefits of research on microbial symbioses will also be emphasized in the urban agriculture initiative at UW Milwaukee.   Legumes are by far the largest contributors of biologically fixed N2 to pristine environments. Although nodulation is often considered to be a distinguishing characteristic of legumes, a large number of species are not known to nodulate. Non-nodulating legumes live in the same native environments as their nodulating 'cousins' and yet have the same in planta N concentrations. Very little , however, is known about the mechanisms of N-acquisition in non-nodulated legumes. This project will explore the hypothesis that non-nodulating legume honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos L.) possesses the potential for symbiotic N2 fixation with rhizobia. Preliminary data from the investigator's laboratory shows the presence of nodule-like structures on the roots of G. triacanthos that contained rhizobia. This project will (i) Elucidate the extent and mechanism of rhizobial colonization in G. triacanthos, (ii) Determine the response of G. triacanthos to rhizobial infection and (iii) Determine the potential of N2-fixation in the G. triacanthos-rhizobial association. In the long term, the results of this project could pave the way to improve N nutrition of non-legumes, including cereal crops that do not form N-fixing symbiosis."

Anthropological theories suggest meat and animal fat played critical roles in the evolution of energy-intensive human traits and that transitions to grain-based agricultural diets were detrimental to health and longevity. In contrast, perspectives advanced in the field of nutritional epidemiology suggest that consumption of meat and animal fat tend to be associated with increased risk of chronic diseases while plant-based diets appear to be protective. To address this debate, this project will explore the health effects of dietary restrictions on animal products and assess whether any shifts in health indicators vary in relation to the amount and quality of animal-based foods (e.g., processed versus unprocessed meats) consumed prior to restriction, the types of plant-based foods (e.g., refined versus whole grains versus vegetables and legumes) consumed as caloric replacements, and shifts in energy balance. Just as the health effects of omnivorous diets may depend on the overall caloric intake and nutritional composition of specific animal- and plant-based products, the health benefits of plant-based diets may depend on the amount of whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables consumed in relation to processed grain products and sugars. A clearer understanding of these interactions is of key interest to public health, anthropological, nutritional epidemiology, and population health scientists. Sharing the project results across these fields has the potential to influence how nutritional guidance is taught in schools and communicated to the public, as well as more broadly inform global and local efforts to understand and tackle the growing health and economic burden of nutrition-related chronic diseases in the U.S. and worldwide.   This project will explore these nuances through the study of a ritualized eight-week voluntary dietary restriction on animal products practiced by Orthodox Christians (OCs) in the U.S. during Lent, the period prior to Easter. Because OCs receive guidance on which animal-based foods to abstain from during Lent but not on which plant-based foods to consume as caloric replacements, this study context allows the researchers to explore how natural variations in plant-based diets within industrialized contexts alter their influence on physiological health and how this co-varies with the effects of animal product restriction. A group of U.S.-born OCs will be followed through their Lenten period and a prior eight-week period of minimal church-guided dietary restrictions. Both individuals who do and do not follow the OC Lenten dietary traditions will be recruited for this study. Detailed dietary data, lifestyle information, and common markers of cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk will be collected to compare health indicators across the two time-points and relate any changes in health indicators to the degree of shifts in specific plant- and animal-based foods. These data will help answer the questions of whether restricting animal products from the diet necessarily confers a health benefit and to what degree any measureable health benefits might be contingent upon the amount and types of foods that comprise the baseline and restricted diets."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Christine Sprunger is  Belowground carbon: improving soil health in low carbon soils.  The host institution for this fellowship is the Earth Institute at Columbia University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Cheryl Palm.   Increases in soil carbon can lead to enhanced soil structure, biological diversity, and nutrient retention, all of which lead to healthier soils and increased crop production for agriculture. Soils also store large amounts of carbon, meaning that agriculture can help mitigate elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by retaining carbon in the soil. However, the effect of plant roots, nutrient inputs and soil moisture on soil carbon is not well understood. Identifying the mechanisms that control soil carbon is especially important in many agricultural areas, for example, Sub Saharan Africa, where soil carbon levels are consistently inadequate, leading to soil erosion and food insecurity. The fellowship research draws on biogeochemistry and social science disciplines to determine carbon dynamics in small-holder farms in Kenya and Tanzania as the study system. Specific objectives are to determine the influence of crop rotations and legume incorporation within maize based systems on root production, root carbon inputs, and soil carbon pools; measure the influence of nitrogen fertilizer on plant biomass allocation, root productivity, and soil carbon pools in tropical soils; and determine the influence of rainfall variability on soil carbon in agriculture and forest ecosystems differing in soil fertility.   Training goals include enhancing skills in both biogeochemistry and social science and the conduct of interdisciplinary and international research. To broaden participation in biology, the Fellow serves as a mentor and role model in the Summer Research Program at Columbia University, which specifically exposes underrepresented college students to graduate level independent research projects."

Only a few of the many SSPs encoded in plant genomes have been characterized functionally in plants. In this respect, SSP-encoding genes represent some of the potentially most important  dark matter  of plant genomes. Medicago truncatula is a premier model legume species, which is closely related to the most important forage species in the USA, Medicago sativa (alfalfa), and to food legumes such as soybean and common bean. Legumes are key components of sustainable agricultural systems because they form symbioses with bacteria called rhizobia that reduce molecular nitrogen to ammonium in specialized root organs called nodules. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation provides legumes with a source of nitrogen, obviating the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers for these important crop species. Recently, it has become clear that SSPs can control both nodule and root development in legumes and the hunt is on for more SSPs that control important developmental traits in legumes of importance to agriculture. A priority objective of this project therefore is to identify novel SSPs that affect root and nodule development in M. truncatula, with a long-term view of using SSPs in non-transgenic approaches to improve plants for agriculture. Datasets and biological materials generated in this project will be made available through appropriate biological databases and stock centers. A database (MtSSPdb) will be developed and maintained for both project and public access to store, link and present the information on the comparative genomics of peptide-coding genes and to integrate and manage all experimental data emerging from this project. With regard to outreach and training, the project will leverage existing programs to provide research training for postdoctoral associates and graduate, undergraduate and high school students.      A multidisciplinary strategy will be implemented, including bioinformatics, chemical genomics, genetics, biochemistry, molecular and developmental biology. Activities of this project comprise a genome-wide survey of SSP-encoding genes in Medicago truncatula and the identification of macronutrient (N, P, S, and K) -responsive SSP-encoding genes from transcriptome data. A library of genome-encoded, synthetic peptides will be established as a community resource for biochemical genetics and used to screen for developmental and molecular phenotypes in M. truncatula. Constitutive overexpression lines will be produced in Arabidopsis thaliana and M. truncatula for selected SSP-encoding genes that are prioritized because they have been shown to be either strongly responsive to macronutrients (N, P, S, K), produce strong visual/molecular phenotypes when chemically synthesized peptides are exogenously applied to M. truncatula, and/or have their mature peptides predicted to be produced through posttranslational modifications that make chemical synthesis and/or exogenous application impracticable. The synthetic peptides will be further tested for their effects on root nodule development and nitrogen fixation in M. truncatula. The Medicago HAPMAP genotypes will be employed to identify genetic loci associated with natural diversity in response to bioactive peptides, and specific SSPs will also be tested for their efficacy in improving alfalfa performance in the field. Identification of a peptide receptor through genetic or chemo-proteomic approaches is another activity included in this project."

To produce protein, some crop plants such as beans have a unique relationship with bacteria in the soil. These bacteria, called rhizobia, help plants obtain nitrogen, one of the major components of protein, from the air. Nitrogen can be used to make more than proteins, however; it can also be used to create chemicals that help protect plants from attack by pest insects. This project will examine how nitrogen provided by rhizobia is used by lima bean plants to help them grow and protect themselves against plant-eating insects. Lima bean plants have two ways to protect themselves from insects: they make poisonous cyanide and they provide nectar to ants, which act as bodyguards. Both of these defenses change when plants have rhizobia in their roots providing nitrogen. Plants with rhizobia make more cyanide but less nectar. These changes in protection can affect not only lima bean plants and the insects that feed on them but also the predators that feed on the plant-eating insects. The overall goal of this project is to understand whether rhizobia in the soil can impact an entire food chain.  This research has relevance for improving the quality of life among a growing human population because many members of the bean family provide nutrient-rich crops for humans and livestock. These crops depend on rhizobia to re-introduce nutrients in the soil when nutrients have been depleted by other crops.   This research incorporates rhizobia into food webs by using field experiments in the native range of wild lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), where it has evolved specific defensive and mutualistic relationships. To test the hypothesis that rhizobia influence aboveground invertebrate communities, researchers will combine physiological, ecological and theoretical approaches. Specifically, this research will test how rhizobia: i) affect production of extrafloral nectar used to attract ants, ii) impact aboveground food webs differently when bacteria cooperate by providing nitrogen or  cheat  by not providing nitrogen, and iii) influence production of plant defensive compounds. More generally, the native invertebrate community's response to rhizobia treatments will provide new functional insights into how belowground nitrogen-cycling bacteria affect aboveground ecosystems."

Senior Personnel: Ethalinda K.S. Cannon (Iowa State University)   Legumes play a central role in food security and nearly every cropping system worldwide. Among cultivated plants, legumes such as beans, peas and lentils are unique in their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen which is converted into a soluble organic form that can be taken up by plants through symbiosis with a soil bacterium. Approximately 33% of all nutritional nitrogen comes from legumes which are the most important source of protein in most developing countries. Genomic resources have been or are being developed for many legume crops, but the fragmented nature of these data resources limits the ability of researchers to leverage information generated in one species to infer function or identify candidate genes in another species. The overarching goal of this project is to address this deficiency by developing software and methods for a  Legume Federation  (LF) of diverse, independently funded and geographically separated genomic data portals (GDPs). The LF will facilitate utilization of genomic, genetic and phenotypic information across a wide range of legume species that will allow researchers and breeders to take full advantage of the data that are currently available at the GDPs. The project will provide research training opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds at different educational levels. In the context of outreach, the project will pro-actively engage the community of legume data providers through presentations and workshops at national and international meetings as well as through a central web portal that will provide information describing project goals, methods of implementation and progress reports to the community.    The pace of data collection across crop and model plants has increased dramatically. Most crop species have both a data management problem and great opportunities to access genetic  big data . The objectives of this project are to develop a federation model for legume databases, to facilitate data exchange across a wide range of legume species to enable cross-species translational genomics, and to adapt an existing set of open-source tools for biological information management that will provide a framework for project-oriented data management enabling both long-term integration and widespread use. The specific goals are to:    1). Adopt and port the data currently managed in each of the custom frameworks into a set of well-integrated, open source model organism database tools; 2). Define data formats, metadata standards, data exchange and Web service protocols to facilitate communications between species-centric databases at various levels;  3). Utilize orthology, synteny, and mappings of other significant features to integrate genetic, genomic, and phenotypic data across legume species, to enable identification of common molecular bases for important traits and enable traversal across database projects; 4). Improve the capacity of organism database projects to collect and manage complex phenotype data using ontologies, controlled vocabularies and well-defined protocols and schemas; and,  5). Facilitate productive data exchange by implementing a common, open, virtualized Data Repository for data exchange across sites and for stable, long-term archiving of data sets, standardized metadata, and robust methods for archiving, searching, and accessing data sets from federated GDPs.   It is anticipated that the LF will provide a model for a well-accepted open-source technology stack that can be adopted by other research communities that have limited resources or technical expertise. All data will be freely available to the general public through the project web site and through the associated GDPs that include but are not limited to MedicagoGenome (http://medicagogenome.org), SoyBase (http://soybase.org), PeanutBase (http://peanutbase.org), and the Legume Information System (http://legumeinfo.org)."

A prominent geological feature of this area is the Sunda Shelf, which is currently submerged beneath the South China Sea and underlies the Malay Archipelago. This region has a complex geological and climatic history, and serves as an excellent system to study drivers of biotic diversification. One group that occurs throughout this region is the rock gecko genus Cnemaspis.  Theses geckos live on various substrates including different types of vegetation and rocks, including limestone, which is heavily mined in Southeast Asia for the production of cement.  Mining and clearance of rainforest comprise serious threats to the unique biodiversity of this region.  Studies of the endemic organisms of this region can contribute to conservation planning through the discovery of cryptic species and identification of local areas of high species diversity. This kind of knowledge is crucial to the implementation of effective science-based conservation strategies. This study will also further our understanding of the processes of speciation and adaptation to unique local environments, and the long-term accumulation of biodiversity which make this part of Asia so rich in endemic species. Portions of this research will be used to train undergraduates, and to develop a public display about biodiversity and species discovery at the Bean Life Science Museum at Brigham Young University.   The genus Cnemaspis is widespread throughout Southeast Asia and is one of the most species-rich gecko genera in the region, with 54 described species. These presumed low vagility geckos live on a variety of substrates and vary in ecomorphology; and the clade is characterized by a number of micro-endemics, making it a great system for evolutionary study. In this project we will: (1) generate a well-supported multilocus time-calibrated phylogeny of the genus and test spatial and temporal divergence across the Sunda Shelf; (2) evaluate whether the polytomy in the preliminary phylogeny for the genus is 'hard' or 'soft', and if the former, whether it is an adaptive or non-adaptive radiation; and (3) investigate the effects on Cnemaspis species diversification (e.g. speciation and extinction rates) derived from the convergent evolution of ecomorphological characters.  Currently one mitochondrial gene and three nuclear gene sequences resolve well-supported clades towards the tips of the tree, but fail to resolve deeper nodes.  To test the hard vs. soft polytomy hypotheses, a 'Next Generation' sequence-capture method will be used to generate hundreds of loci.  From this dataset a phylogenetic tree will be constructed to explicitly test alternative biogeographic hypotheses for colonization of parts of Sundaland, as well as test morphological disparity through time (DTT), convergent adaptive regime shifts, and evolution of ecomorphological characters."

This project will increase mechanistic understanding of the biodiversity-productivity relationship to better explain how environmental conditions influence ecosystem services. Ecological theory predicts that differences among plant species underlie variation in the biodiversity-productivity relationship. However, the mechanisms underlying this variation among plant species are rarely experimentally quantified, leaving causal connections between plant variation and the biodiversity-productivity relationship elusive. Plants in the legume (bean) family are infected by beneficial soil bacteria called rhizobia, which fix atmospheric nitrogen (N) in exchange for carbon (C) from their plant hosts. As most plants obtain N from soil, access to atmospheric N via this mutualism can differentiate legumes from non-legumes, thus influencing the productivity-diversity relationship. This project will experimentally examine biotic processes that differentiate legume species from each other and from non-legumes to understand how these differences cause variation in patterns of primary productivity within a long-term biodiversity, CO2, and N manipulation experiment in Minnesota, USA--BioCON. To promote public understanding of science, middle school students will grow and observe legume seeds inoculated with local bacteria under two N treatments to test if bacteria from regions with high soil N are less beneficial than those from regions with low soil N. Undergraduates will be trained in relevant techniques and develop independent projects within the scope of this work. The research and outreach projects will inform management of ecosystem function under current and future global change scenarios, with important implications for human well-being.Niche differences (ND) and relative fitness differences (RFD) among legume species will be assessed by determining the composition and density of, and plant benefit from, the species-specific nodulating rhizobial community (NRC) in soil samples from the ambient condition BioCON biodiversity plots. Structural equation models will relate ND and RFD, and their underlying mechanisms, to relative yield totals calculated from each diversity treatment, to test the hypothesis that higher ND between legumes and non-legumes produces stronger richness-productivity relationships and higher RFD weakens the richness-productivity relationship. Evolution of the NRC in response to enhanced CO2 and/or N, and its consequences for the richness-productivity relationship, will be assessed by determining the composition and density of, and plant benefit derived from, the NRC of each BioCON diversity, CO2, and N treatment combination. Finally, variation among legume species in how CO2- and/or N-availability shifts enforcement of rhizobial cooperation (partner choice and sanctions), and the consequences of this variation for the richness-productivity relationship, will be examined through mixed-inoculation experiments."

To functionally disentangle the complex ecological effects of rhizobia, this project will use multiple rhizobial strains in combination with different host plants, wild lima bean (Fabaceae: Phaseolus lunatus) and wild pea (Fabaceae: Leptospron adenanthum). In the laboratory, these plant-rhizobia systems will be experimentally exposed to varying CO2 and nitrogen availabilities. Both plant species show fundamentally different chemical defenses against herbivores. While P. lunatus has an efficient nitrogen-based defense (via cyanogenesis), L. adenanthum invests in carbon-based defense (via phenolics). In addition to these direct defenses, both plants show an array of indirect defenses (extrafloral nectar and herbivore-induced volatiles) which act through the attraction of carnivorous arthropods. The project will provide an integrated picture of the effects of rhizobia on plant traits, plant-associated organisms of different trophic levels and the impact of variable abiotic conditions on these associations. As plant-microbe-arthropod interactions are relevant for multiple disciplines including chemical ecology, evolutionary biology, global change biology, conservation biology, agriculture and soil sciences, this research will have broad impact. In particular, in times of rapidly changing environments, the value in better understanding the mechanisms controlling natural and agricultural ecosystems cannot be overestimated. As part of this project, one graduate student and several undergraduates will be trained and opportunities for school teachers and K-12 students to participate in the research will be provided in weekly lessons and a three-week summer field course.   This project will assess bottom-up effects of rhizobia on generalist and specialist insect herbivores of different feeding guilds, as well as on parasitoid and predatory arthropods. Furthermore, different levels of rhizobial N2-fixation will be considered as rhizobia differ in quality as plant mutualists. While mutualistic rhizobia strains reciprocate, cheating rhizobia reside in root nodules and function as carbon sinks, but provide no nitrogen, and thus reduce the net fitness benefit for the pant host. Beyond lab studies, costs and benefits of the rhizobial symbiosis will be explored in a natural habitat of both plant species (Costa Rica). Specifically, the following questions will be addressed: 1. What are the independent and interacting effects of rhizobial strain, soil nitrogen and ambient carbon dioxide (CO2) on plant traits? 2. How do rhizobia-mediated plant traits affect insect herbivores and carnivores? 3. What are the ecological benefits and defense-associated costs of the rhizobial symbiosis in a mutualist-cheater continuum in nature? Spectrophotometric assays, GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry), will be used to analyze plant defensive and nutritive compounds. Plant resource allocation to rhizobia and effects of different nitrogen fixation rates will be quantified using isotope labeling techniques (15N) and N2 depletion studies with Argon chambers (setups in which atmospheric N2 is replaced with Argon). Effects of rhizobia-mediated plant traits on insect herbivores and carnivores will be studied with feeding and olfactometer choice trials. Accompanying field studies will serve to evaluate the effects of rhizobial strain and N2-fixation rate on multiple plant defense traits in nature and to test for the predicted bottom-up effects of rhizobia on arthropod herbivores and carnivores in the natural ecosystem."

These economically and ecologically significant plants range in size from tiny desert herbs to giant rainforest trees. While recent research has elucidated relationships among the major lineages in the family, little is known about many of the nearly 20,000 species, especially the processes that generate this diversity. This study will use recently developed 'next generation' DNA sequencing methods and statistical computer modeling to resolve the evolutionary relationships among a large and widespread group of tropical legumes and to infer what role, if any, adaptation to new environments has played in the diversification of these species.  Given their wide distribution and ecological diversity, understanding the relationships among these species will provide a framework for future comparative studies and enhance our understanding of the overall evolution of the legume family. The project will also include a significant training component to expose undergraduates in STEM fields to the latest tools and analytic methods.This study will combine phylogenomics, ecological niche modeling, and information from the fossil record to elucidate the relationships among the species of the tropical genera Cynometra and Maniltoa and will investigate the role niche conservatism plays in biogeography and speciation mechanisms. Next generation sequencing is revolutionizing the practice of systematics, biogeography, and evolutionary biology. While the technology has been applied to both very deep and very shallow evolutionary questions, its application to species level phylogenetics, particularly in plants, remains limited. However, it is at the species level that these new techniques hold the greatest promise to resolve previously intractable relationships. In addition, when combined with ecological niche modeling and geographic range data, the well resolved phylogenies these methods are capable of producing allow researchers to study speciation mechanisms and the role of niche conservatism in generating observed patterns of diversity. If, for example, allopatric sister species consistently segregate along environmental axes, then ecologically mediated selection may have a role in speciation, whereas if allopatric sister species are consistently identical or nearly identical in abiotic niche space, then ecological divergence is not a major factor driving speciation.  To address this question, the researchers will: 1) conduct field work and visit herbaria in Brazil (the center of diversity for the genus) to better characterize diversity and distributions of Brazilian species; 2) reconstruct a well resolved species level phylogeny using data generated with targeted sequence capture techniques; and 3) characterize the abiotic niche of the constituent species using ecological niche modeling and distribution data. Analyses of these data will provide a much more precise understanding of evolutionary and biogeographic history of Cynometra and Maniltoa and the mechanisms driving these processes."

The principal investigator will work with Advanced Placement students at DuVal High School (98% under-represented minority students) to prepare them for college, serve on the board of the National Academy of Sciences partnership with the entertainment industry and will also serve as a scientific consultant for programming by the Discovery and National Geographic Channels.The plant virus  Pea enation mosaic umbravirus  has a bipartite positive-strand RNA genome containing two 3' proximal T-shaped structures (kl-TSS and 3'TSS). These structures are critical for translation of the uncapped viral RNAs into proteins. 3'TSS is an example of the long-known, better-studied tRNA-like structures found in viral RNAs, but the existence of the kl-TSS was unsuspected and came to light during previous research. The newly found, internal kl-TSS, with its three-way branched secondary structure, binds to 40S, 60S and 80S ribosomes and can simultaneously engage in a long-distance interaction with 5H2, a coding region hairpin located near the 5'Untranslated Region (UTR). The 3'TSS is also likely to connect with 5H2, and the whole system will be exploited to learn how different tRNA-mimics interact with ribosomes to enhance translation. Specifically, a novel  pick-up and delivery  hypothesis will be evaluated, i.e., the idea that multiple TSS may be connected via RNA:RNA interactions with the ends of virus-encoded Open Reading Frames (ORF), to gather ribosomal subunits downstream of an ORF at the end of translation and relay them back to the 5'UTR for another round of translation. In addition, it will be tested whether the kl-TSS can enhance translation of capped mRNAs produced from expression constructs. These experiments will inform our understanding of how this novel and possibly widespread use of tRNA mimicry operates to enhance translation and to control plant virus life cycles. The project will also lead to the development of expression cassettes with enhanced translation of encoded proteins with potentially extensive agricultural as well as laboratory applications."

Nitrogen-fixing (NF) symbiosis and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis are two important examples. NF symbiosis has major growth effects on the crops that can form this relationship such as soybean, common bean, pea, peanuts, alfalfa, etc., while AM symbiosis can do the same for many crops that form this symbiosis such as maize and rice. Rice (Oryza sativa), specifically, can have a significant grain yield increase when inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi because of the enhanced nutrient uptake. This can be especially important in parts of the world that rely on this particular crop for the majority of its calories. This award supports research to investigate the role of the SYP132A gene in rice (Oryza sativa) by defining the mycorrhizal phenotype of rice SYP132A mutants.The research could ultimately shed light on a fundamental process in rice (AM symbiosis) that has the potential to greatly increase yield if optimized. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ertao Wang, an expert in AM symbiosis in rice, at the Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology in Shanghai, China.   The nitrogen-fixing (NF) symbiotic pathway in plants evolved from the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiotic pathway, and therefore the molecular mechanisms share many common elements. Protein trafficking from the plant to the bacteria during NF symbiosis has been shown to be indispensable, but protein trafficking during AM symbiosis is most likely important as well. For this proposed project, I will study the role of a syntaxin gene (SYP132A) in mycorrhizal symbiosis. This gene was previously identified to have a role in NF symbiosis in M. truncatula, namely, it specifically marks the membrane surrounding the intracellular bacteria for targeted protein delivery. I will investigate the function of SYP132A by characterizing the mycorrhizal phenotype of rice T-DNA mutant lines. My hypothesis is that this protein marks the membrane that separates host from the fungus within plant cells. This study will provide evidence that the function of SYP132A is universal and spans multiple host and microbial species. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

In particular, the production of plastics from renewable resources (bioplastics) is one of the fastest-growing materials sectors in recent years. Nylons 11 and 12 are extensively used in automotive and solar industries, and these two rapidly growing markets are expected to experience an annual growth rate that exceeds 33% through 2016. In 2012, safety-related closures of petroleum-based precursor manufacturing plants led to a serious shortage of precursor material for these two markets. Consequently, auto suppliers had to actively seek other sustainable options; including new synthetic pathways from renewable feedstock or new alternative materials. Nylon 13 is a promising, yet unexploited, material that has been reported to have properties similar to that of Nylon 12.The proposed technology enables oleic acid to be used as an economical bio-sourced feedstock for the production of Nylons 11, 12, and 13. Currently, Nylon 12 is produced from petroleum feedstock and Nylon 11 is produced from ricinoleic acid that is only available from castor beans.Over the past two years, this team has developed a new approach for the conversion of oleic acid (or oleic acid methyl ester) to Nylons 11, 12 and 13 that uses a ring-closing metathesis (RCM) step. Precursors of nylons (fatty amino acids) are currently manufactured via lengthy multi-step syntheses that produce the desired products from either a petroleum resource (Nylon 12) or from ricinoleic acid (Nylon 11) available only from castor beans. In addition, this synthetic process requires energy intensive steps involving high temperatures and pressures. In contrast, the proposed RCM method uses readily available oleic acid, and it requires fewer steps, all of which involve mild reaction conditions. Finally, the proposed approach forms fewer undesirable side-products such as isomers and oligomers (due to its mild conditions) or by-products (since all of the reagents are stoichiometric) thereby simplifying the isolation and purification of the final material."

Hampton (University of Minnesota-Duluth)Collaborators: Martin Heil (CINESTAV, Irapuato, Mexico) and Patrick von Aderkas (University of Victoria, Canada)One-third of all crop species produce floral nectar and are dependent on animals for reproduction. Moreover, crops such as cotton, bean, pea, apple, cherry, peach, and blueberry, all produce extrafloral nectar to attract mutualistic predatory insects, which protect plants from herbivores. U.S. pollinator-dependent crops alone have an annual value of nearly $25 billion, and extrafloral nectar represents one of the few defense mechanisms for which stable effects on plant health and fitness have been demonstrated. This project will employ genomics technologies to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the synthesis and secretion of nectar components across species and nectary types. If successful, this project will provide significant new insight into these processes and the plant-animal interactions mediated by specific nectar components that will allow targeted studies to improve overall pollination efficiency, enhance biological control of pests that attack crops, and have the potential to greatly impact apiculture.  With regard to outreach and training, the project will provide interdisciplinary research training for students and postdoctoral associates. Project graduate students at Iowa State University will also serve as GK12 Fellows in GK12 Symbi program (http://www.gk12.iastate.edu/). Supported by NSF, the Symbi program is a partnership between ISU and middle schools and high schools that serve primarily under-represented students in the Des Moines Public School District. GK12 Fellows will serve as  resident scientists  who will work with teachers to develop innovative, hands-on and engaging science activities for select middle school or high school science students.  Finally, the project will also provide research experiences for high school students from Cornell High School (Cornell, Wisconsin).   The central hypothesis driving the project is that the genetic programs underlying nectar synthesis, secretion and function are at least partially conserved between diverse species and nectary types. To address this hypothesis, the project will apply comparative genomics approaches to the characterization of the (i) synthesis, (ii) secretion and (iii) biological function of nectar components across a diverse set of core eudicots, including Brassica sp., cotton, tobacco, squash, Lima bean, and acacia. The specific objectives and approaches include:1. Comparative expression profiling of nectaries throughout the secretory process. Both the floral and extrafloral nectary transcriptomes and proteomes of the respective species will be examined at several time points throughout the secretory process;2. Comparative metabolomics of nectars. Nectar metabolites will be comprehensively characterized through a non-biased GC-GC/MS-MS and LC/MS-MS approach;3. Comparative and functional analysis of nectar proteins. Specific arrays of proteins have been reported in several nectars, which confer both protective and attractive properties. Thus, the proteomes of both floral and extrafloral nectars will be defined and functionally characterized across species.; and, 4. Informatics, database building & initiation of mechanistic studies. Mining of global expression data from actively secreting vs. inactive nectaries will allow the identification of genes and cellular processes central to the basal pathways for active nectar secretion across species. Metabolomic data will be linked to activities identified from expression data to assess their impacts on nectar production and composition. All validated data will subsequently be integrated into an existing public online database (www.nectarygenomics.org), with subsets of data also being made available to the public at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the iPlant Collaborative (www.iplantcollaborative.org)."

Deciphering this poorly understood yet fundamental aspect of plant biology will shed light on the evolution of tree species and have important implications for forest ecology and growth dynamics.   In a practical sense, the work will help transform the orchards and tree plantations of the future through the development of tree varieties suitable for high density planting- achieving productivity improvements analogous to those accomplished for cereal crops over the past half century. Commercial planting of these improved varieties will lead to more efficient land space utilization, reduction of chemical inputs, and increased industry profitability and sustainability.  To integrate education and research and broaden participation, the project will provide research training in plant genomics for undergraduate and high school students from underrepresented minority groups.  In addition, the project will organize and hold a series of workshops on plant architecture and biotechnology solutions that will educate growers and agricultural industry personnel about specific benefits biotechnology has to offer tree crops. Finally, the project will develop and hold short courses on a novel sequence-based mapping and gene identification method using pooled genomes or pnomes for fellow scientists working on trees and other horticultural crops.  All data generated in this project will be accessible to the public through the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) Short Reads Archive databases and/or the Genome Database for Rosaceae (http://www.rosaceae.org/). Trees can adopt a wide variety of architectural forms. Architectural plasticity plays important roles in forest ecosystems, agriculture, and landscape aesthetics. Tree architecture is a consequence of numerous developmental traits that include branching pattern, branch number, branch length, and branch angle. These traits are largely a function of two key developmental processes: apical dominance and apical control.  Apical dominance is a well understood process that inhibits lateral bud outgrowth through signals emanating from the shoot apex. Intensive studies have revealed the signals and the underlying molecular mechanisms that operate in herbaceous plants such as Arabidopsis and pea. In contrast, apical control is the process by which the apex influences the overall tree structure upon successive years of growth and development in woody species. Although some progress has been made from a physiological perspective, the genetic and molecular mechanisms of apical control are largely unknown.  The overarching goal of the project is to develop detailed knowledge about how trees adopt specific architectural forms, specifically with regard to apical control of the lateral branch angle and directional growth.  Using a combination of genome-scale studies to elucidate key gene networks and molecular pathways coupled with innovative whole tree imaging technologies that will enable non-destructive structural phenotyping, the project will address the following questions: 1) What gene expression networks differentiate the shoot apical meristem from lateral meristems? What changes take place when a lateral shoot meristem transitions to becoming the apical meristem? How are these expression networks altered in branch angle mutants including pillar/columnar tree forms and weeping types? 2) What is the genetic and molecular basis for these mutant tree forms in peach and apple? What are the identities of the mutated genes? 3) With regard to the identified genes, what protein-protein interaction networks are they associated with? Through which pathways do they exert their effects on tree form?"

In addition, the balanced intake of essential nutrients or metabolites is important for human nutrition worldwide, but their content is often sub-optimal in crop species, as is the case for the essential amino acid methionine in legume seeds. In higher plants, carbon and nitrogen are quantitatively the most important nutrients for plant development. The macronutrients are taken up by the plant and are assimilated into sucrose and amino acids. These are then transported in the vascular system to the seeds to support growth and accumulation of storage reserves such as proteins, starch, or oils. The goal of this project is to understand and manipulate carbon and nitrogen assimilate transport to legume seeds, and to overcome potential bottlenecks of assimilate movement. This study will provide clues as to how transporter proteins function in delivery of carbon and nitrogen nutrients to seeds, and on their critical role in seed yield and nutritional quality.  Technical Description of the Project: Transgenic modifications of amino acid and sucrose transporters have underlined their essential roles in assimilate partitioning; however, there has been only limited success integrating transporter function with seed development, seed metabolism, and the synthesis of seed storage compounds and their nutritional quality. Current data suggest that a bottleneck within the long distance transport pathway lies in the transporter activity, or the lack of it, in both leaves (i.e. phloem) and embryos. Furthermore, research supports strong regulatory control by nitrogen assimilate transporters over metabolic processes up and downstream of their function. In this study, Pisum sativum L. (pea) will be used as a model system. Transgenic plants will be analyzed, in which photoassimilate transporters are simultaneously overexpressed in the phloem and in cotyledon transfer cells, where assimilate import into the embryo occurs. Potential constraints will be overcome in source to sink transport of photoassimilates to promote sink development and seed storage product accumulation (Aim 1) and to resolve if and how different embryo uptake systems affect seed assimilate flux, metabolism and metabolite compartmentation (Aim 2). Molecular, biochemical, and cell-biological analyses, and physiological techniques, as well as a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assimilate flux studies in living seeds and modeling approaches will be used to answer some long-standing questions about rate limiting and regulatory processes in assimilate transfer to, and distribution and usage within, the main embryo storage sites. The proposed activities will further promote student and public education in plant biology by discussing research schemes in the classroom, by mentoring and training undergraduate and graduate students in research, by engaging students in international collaborations, and through demonstrations and activities involving the local community. Overall, this project will foster effective integration of plant biology education and research."

Phytophthora capsici a fungus-like plant pathogen is a scurge of vegetable crops known to infect over 45 species including peppers, cucumbers, squash, cantaloupe, watermelon, zucchini, pumpkin, eggplant, tomatoes, snap beans and lima beans.Its complex life cycle high genetic variability, sexual reproduction, and ability survive in the soll for many years makes this pathogen a nightmare for farmers. Although similar in appearance to fungi, it is an oomycete and more closely related to certain algae than fungi. Because of this most agricultural chemicals used for treating plant pathogens being designed to kill fungi, are not as effective against oomycete pathogens like P. capsici. Under idea growth conditions no chemical treatment is effective against P. capsici. When this is combined with limited success in the development of vacines against P. capsici it is clear that new control strategies are desperately needed.Guild Associates proposes to conduct proof-of-concept study to develop an antisense based agent against P. capsici. Antisense agents work by blocking the production of a target protein rather than blocking its function as most chemical agents do. Using a military analogy most cheimical treatments work like tanks engaging enemy tanks on the battle field, whereas antisense agents work like a bomber destroying the factory that makes the tanks. Our firm is currently developing a similar antisense agent for use against the fungal human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus using similar methods. We have already identified a type of transport peptide called a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) that is effectively transported into the fungal pathogens A.fumigatus and Candida albicans. The first part of this study will evaluate other CPPs identified from the literature against our current top CPP for their ability to be transported into P. capsici. Then the top performing transporter will be further improved using rationally designed CPP libraries to evolve an improved product. Next we will use an antisense molecule (PMO) attached to this CPP to demonstrate we can use this agent to knockdown the production of a model fluorescent protein introduced into P. capsici. Finally we will develop and test a CPP-PMO that blocks the production of protein that is essential for growth of P. capsici producing an early-stage anti-P. capsici agent. Further refinement and optimization through a Phase II grant would allow this agent to be developed into an agent ready for field testingIt is believed that through the efforts of this project, a new treatment option for P. capsici infestations in the fields of vegetable crop farmers will be attained, not borrowed from other similar looking plant pathogens, but designed and taylored specifically to eliminate P. capsici from the farms of America. Because agents of this type are the progeny of the genomics era, they can be quickly designed using the genome of the targeted pest, and since they like DNA gain meaning by the order of their component parts (similar to how words attain meaning by the order of the letters) not by a unique complex chemical structure, different agents against the same organism will have similar chemical properties reducing the amount of testing necessary to bring them to market, producing new more effective drugs quicker. Thus this project will open the door to a new age of treatment options for farmers around the world that will reduce crop losses and improve the profitability of vegetable farming."

We plan to use cutting-edge molecular genetics and epigenomics techniques to better understand the resistance and susceptibility mechanisms to this important disease. Differences in DNA methylation and gene expression will be compared among a rust-resistant wild type, susceptible wild type, and two susceptible mutants derived from the resistant wild type. This work builds on our previous common bean molecular genetics and genomics work in the area of disease resistance and comparative genomics along with the development of a reference DNA methylome project that is underway. This project will help us determine the effect of genome mutations affecting disease resistance on global DNA methylation and transcription simultaneously, under normal and biotic stress conditions. Additionally, the proposed project will also contribute to understanding of disease resistance mechanisms in soybean (Glycine max) and lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) which are closely related legumes of economic significance in the United States.

Drought and salinity are two major environmental factors determining alfalfa productivity. In the western United States, nearly all alfalfa hay acreage is irrigated. The costs associated with irrigation are significant. These costs are likely to increase as populations rise in these states. In addition, climate change may adversely impact water availability. The water use efficiency of alfalfa cultivars needs to be improved to help meet the challenges of finite water resources. The proposed research is to identify molecular markers (genes) and germplasm for drought and salt tolerance for developing superior alfalfa cultivars with enhanced water use efficiency. The first objective is to identify germplasm with drought and salt resistance in the primary gene pool and develop populations with a high percentage of resistant plants in elite genetic backgrounds through recurrent selection. Quantitative genetic analysis of inheritance of resistance will be carried out. The second objective is to map QTL associated with drought and salt resistance. Finally, the third objective will develop molecular markers tightly linked to the resistance loci for rapid selection of drought and salt tolerant alfalfa to accelerate breeding programs. Quantitative traits such as biotic and abiotic stress resistance are likely under the control of multiple genes and influenced by environmental factors. Identification of resistance loci that contribute to variation in such complex traits, is a primary challenge in plant breeding and population genetics. In the proposed study we will use an integrated framework that merges a QTL mapping approach called &#39;&#39;genome-wide association&#39;&#39; with high-throughput genome sequencing methodologies called  genotyping by sequencing (GBS)  in order to map traits quickly, efficiently, and in a relatively inexpensive manner. This framework provides a statistical basis for analyzing marker-trait association using linkage disequilibrium. It will help to identify molecular markers associated with resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses in alfalfa. In general, segregation population or association panel will be used for mapping genes/QTL. Parents or progenies will be phenotyped for traits of interest. The SNP markers will be used for mapping genes/QTL associated with drought/salt tolerance. SNPs tightly linked to the specific trait will then be used for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs. This project will provide new tools and strategies for improving resistance to abiotic stress that threatens alfalfa grown in the US and will train members of a new generation of alfalfa breeders in conventional and molecular breeding techniques."

Our completed, short-term feeding studies with fixed amounts of rice bran and navy beans in children with elevated cholesterol and adult colorectal cancer survivors provide a novel opportunity for assessing dietary biomarkers of intake. Rice and beans merit biomarkers for nutritional assessment without reliance on self-reported intakes for whole grains and legumes during nutrition assessments as wheat, barley, rye and soybeans have been studied in dietary patterns and for relationships with disease risk. A major challenge with validating dietary biomarkers is that an elevated level of consumption is often required for reliable quantification, and emerging evidence supports that the overall dietary pattern (e.g. vegetarian, omnivore) can influence the profile of metabolites detected. The identification and validation of dietary biomarkers using metabolomics is an emerging field of investigation with broad-spectrum applications of health importance, and is the major focus of the research strategy for developing rice bran and navy bean biomarkers in children and adults herein. These studies will set the foundation for evaluating Rice Bran (RB) and Navy Beans (NB) intake to other important diet-disease relationships."

Because the limited amount of fixed nitrogen very often limits plant growth, these associations often occupy foundational positions in natural ecosystems and are very important in traditional forms of agriculture. Increasing the utility of nitrogen-fixing symbioses is one way of changing the current dependence of agriculture on industrial nitrogen fertilizers, a practice that generates a number of types of pollution, from soil acidity to atmospheric greenhouse gas generation and ozone destruction. Establishing an effective symbiosis requires the development of root nodules, unique symbiotic organs in which the specialized metabolism of nitrogen fixation, nitrogen assimilation and transport can take place. Both the plant and bacteria change during nodule development. Recent work has shown that members of the CspA family of bacterial RNA binding proteins are highly regulated during symbiotic development. The CspA family is named for the archetypal Cold Shock Proteins, but it is clear that the striking changes in CspA family gene expression during nodule development are not a response to cold stress and suggests instead that their induction/repression is a programmed way of controlling gene expression. In preliminary studies we have found that the set of RNAs that co-purified with different Sinorhizobium meliloti CspA homologs after heterologous expression in E. coli were distinct and were significantly enriched for regulatory RNA sequences containing base paired stem-loop structures. These data support a hypothesis in which riboregulation mediated by different CspA family proteins participates in symbiotic development through their interaction with specific stress or environmentally responsive RNAs. We will specifically address what RNA molecules CspA proteins modulate and how CspA function influences gene expression during symbiosis. Achievement of the proposed aims will begin to define mechanisms of CspA homolog function in rhizobia and expand the current understanding of gene regulation and stress response mechanisms in symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Application of this understanding is critical in ameliorating the financial and environmental cost of industrial nitrogen fertilizer use and is essential to meet future agricultural needs."

To accomplish our second objective, we will measure the performance of aphids, weevils, and virus on rhizobia-inoculated and non-inoculated plants, and the rate of virus spread in field plots with or without rhizobia or synthetic fertilizers.

Many plant species are significantly impacted by sap feeding insects, which are able to subsist on a nutritionally unbalanced diet of plant sap with the aid of symbiotic bacterial partners that live within specialized cells of their insect hosts. After millions of years of co-existence, some symbiotic relationships are now obligate where neither can exist without its partner. Though these relationships have persisted over time, little is known about what mechanisms allow for the coexistence between insects and bacteria. This research will investigate how insect hosts functionally regulate bacterial symbiont populations and will address to what extent these insects can tolerate and coexist with bacterial symbionts. This project will use experiments performed on laboratory populations of pea aphids, which harbor obligate symbiotic bacteria. In addition to experiments, this project will use new genomic and molecular technologies to determine to how pea aphids maintain their symbiotic bacteria. This project will provide key insights into the interactions of obligate symbionts with their insect hosts, which will extend current understanding of how symbiotic bacteria affect the ecological tolerance and geographic range of their hosts. Aphids are considered one of the most significant pestiferous and invasive insect species in North America. Thus, all experiments will be performed on a North American pest species. These results will provide new insight into how these pest species interact with microorganisms, and will provide critical information on the role of environmental change in the persistence of local pests and the potential emergence of novel pest species."

Sometimes PGPR work reliably, and cost effectively. Often, however, PGPR are ineffective because they do not reach their sites of action on plant roots. This can be caused by: restricted movement of PGPR through soil; inefficient water-based transport of PGPR or competition with endogenous soil bacteria.We propose that soil protists have the capacity to move PGPR and that they could increase PGPR effectiveness by allowing PGPR to keep up with growing roots. We will isolate from Medicago truncatulaand soybean rhizospheres 30 types of cyst-forming protists. These will be characterized in an in vitro micromodel to select those that best transport bacteria to legume roots. In vitro data will be used to derive agent-based models of protist transport. The top 8 PGPR-moving protists will be used in a series of increasingly realistic experiments to determine their effectiveness in moving rhizobial bacteria. Experiments will measure the effects of protists on: rhizobial transport through soil, rhizobial effectiveness with competitors and rhizobial effectiveness on established roots.Rhizobia, the most frequently used PGPR for nutrient acquisition, are inoculated on soybean, alfalfa, bean, pea, clover and other legumes to provide cheap and sustainable nitrogen. Their use could increase if inoculation was more effective. Nitrogen acquisition in nonlegumes, phosphate acquisition, iron acquisition and biocontrol are also facilitated by PGPR and may be enhanced by protist transport of PGPR."

One of the constraints of relying on breeding techniques to improve crop traits is the issue of time. For most breeding programs, one selection cycle occurs annually, which means that we have only 35 breeding cycles until 2050--a critical global time point that centers on the question of how to feed over 9 billion people. It is unlikely that breeding alone will provide the solutions to increase yields for sustaining human population growth, while also responding to changes in climate. Our research project addresses this concern by initiating research that focuses on assembling collections of soil microbiota--bacteria, fungi, and viruses--that altogether, reinforce desirable crop traits. In essence, we are  breeding  groups of plant-associated microbiota that are able to enhance plant yield by enriching plant root zones with beneficial microorganisms. At present, many top agribusiness companies, including Monsanto, Syngenta, Dupont, and BASF, are investing in microbial-based methods that influence crop traits. Industry is relying primarily on a single species or strain of microorganism as an inoculant in plant seeds or directly into soils. Our approach differs in that it includes complex communities of microorganisms that are assembled through repeated selections on the plant host trait, such as biomass or seed yield. The short lifecycle of bacteria and their ability to shift population structure rapidly, in response to selection, facilitates the breeding of soil microbiota for plant production systems.By 2050, the human population is expected to reach over 9 billion people, with the majority concentrated in Africa, Southern Asia, and Eastern Asia. For parts of these sections of the world, it is challenging to develop intensive agricultural systems routinely using industrial ammonia fertilizers to sustain high yields. Synthetic fertilizers (based on the Haber-Bosch process) consume high amounts of fossil fuel energy in their manufacture and contribute to chronic nonpoint source pollution in hotspots of agricultural production, such as found in the Salinas Valley area of California. Developing a plant microbiome focus to international crop production will help promote sustained yields in major parts of the world lacking the capacity for industrial-based agriculture, in addition to maintaining crop productivity in the U.S. Many cropping systems already include a focus on the microbiome for improved nutrient management; these include rhizobia for legumes and several arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for cereal crops. However, plants that do not form associations with symbionts rely heavily on fertilizer additions. Brassica crop production (many cultivars of which serve as the green vegetable staple of many populations in developing countries) would benefit heavily from greater nitrogen management via soil biotic manipulations, and serve as a model for additional crops that do not form symbiotic relationships.The proposed research will include sequencing of the microbiomes in an effort to identify who comprises the microbiomes that are associated with an enhanced seed yield phenotype and corresponding high nitrogen capture traits. We will be using 16S and 18S bar-coded paired-end reads for characterization of the soil microbiome using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The sequencing methods will allow us to assess how the microbiomes change in community composition over generations of selection, in relation to the development of higher seed yield in the host plants. Functional analysis using plant RNA-Seq, soil extracellular enzyme activity, plant tissue 15N enrichment, and nitrogen mineralization will help explain how the microbiomes are modifying plant phenotypes via plant gene expression and coordinated resource gain. These fundamental investigations into the interactions of plants and their associated microbiota will help pave the way for microbiome-enhancement of agricultural production systems."

This project focuses on whether and how membrane lipids and associated enzymes modulate plant N utilization.The project will use soybean to determine the function of a specific group of phospholipase, PLD, providing opportunities to integrate basic knowledge with potential applications to increase crop production and quality. In addition, legume N2 fixation is the most important N source in agro-ecosystems. Thus, developing legume varieties with effective N2 fixation could have profound significance in improving agricultural sustainability. The project employs molecular, biochemical, cellular and whole-plant approaches towards improving N uptake, assimilation, accumulation, and/or utilization through studies in soybean and studies of plant-microbe interactions. It tests the hypotheses that PLD activity and membrane lipids modulate the nutrient-recycling, autophagic processes and plant N use efficiency. Potential conceptual breakthroughs from the study include revealing new mechanisms of regulation of autophagy, N remobilization, and N use efficiency. Also the study of soybean may offer an opportunity to determine how the lipid regulation of autophagy and N utilization impacts the tolerance of nodulation to soil N levels. An increased tolerance would allow increased N2 fixation in soils with a high residual level of N. Finally, manipulations of lipid regulated processes may lead to increased growth and seed production under N-limited conditions. Therefore, the proposed study addresses the program area: Plant Health and Production and Plant Products, particularly regarding the priority areas of Photosynthesis and Nutrient Use in Agricultural Plants (A1151). Such knowledge advances have the potential to reduce usage of N fertilizers, enhance the nation&#39;s natural resource base, and protect the environment."

This direct consumption means that consumers actually see the harvested product (grains, pods, leaves, or flowers, in the case of beans) before it gets processed (i.e., cooked, steamed, grilled, popped, etc.). Over time and locations, cultural preferences have become established regarding the characteristics of these products regarding size, shape, and color. Likewise, farmers expect certain characteristics of bean plants that make them fit into their cropping system, such as growth habit (e.g., bush vs. climbing) and phenology (e.g., early vs. late). From a breeding standpoint, this situation means that a significant part of the genome may already be  fixed . The genes coding for the traits determining farmer and consumer preferences have to be selected during the breeding process to recover these traits. Through linkage, not only these genes but adjacent regions will be selected as well. How big a genomic region will be fixed depends on the distribution of recombination around these genes, which in turn depends on their location on the bean chromosomes. The smaller the region, the easier it will be to recombine fixed traits with other desirable traits such as tolerance to heat and drought stresses, yield, and phenology. In contrast, large areas fixed by selection and relative lack of recombination will make the combination of desirable traits more difficult to achieve. In this project, we will investigate the distribution of recombination on the 11 chromosomes of common bean, especially in relation to the cultural and agronomic traits mentioned above. To achieve this, a large multi-parent, multi-generation (MAGIC) population was established, which includes some 960 lines. This population will be characterized in two ways. First, it will be sequenced to determine the DNA sequences of each line and the recombination distribution will be determined. Second, the same population will be characterized in the field for all the phenotypic traits mentioned above. Genotypic and phenotypic data will then be combined to determine the fixed part of the genome. Furthermore, we will then determine to what extent the genes for drought tolerance and other agronomic traits fall in this fixed genome part. The smaller the overlap, the more favorable the situation. In contrast, a large overlap suggests that breeding for drought tolerance will be more difficult to achieve and special breeding methods, such as additional recombination need to be followed."

The ability of plant-associated microbes to cause disease depends on virulence factors that manipulate host targets, often to alter host physiology, suppress host defenses, and/or promote disease symptoms. Thus, breeding, transgenic, or crop treatment strategies for combating plant disease will benefit from advanced fundamental knowledge about the mechanisms employed by virulence factors of pathogens and their targets in plants. The AvrE-family of virulence effectors are secreted from multiple genera of plant pathogenic bacteria into the cells of host plants, contributing to disease on a wide variety of crops ranging from monocots (e.g. maize) to dicots (e.g. tomato and bean) to fruit trees (e.g. apple and pear). Despite the widespread importance of this family of virulence factors, little is known about their mechanism of action. Preliminary data indicate that the AvrE-family effectors interact with a regulatory subunit of a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). PP2A plays key roles in the regulation of numerous plant processes, including responses to abiotic and biotic stress. We will describe the AvrE-PP2A interaction, determine its subcellular localization, and characterize the consequence on plant defense, including hormone and metabolic signals. Since the AvrE-family virulence effectors are widespread, the crop plants negatively affected by associated diseases are varied and numerous, and PP2A isoforms are key to a variety of plant responses to the environment, the potential long-range benefits to U.S. agriculture from applying the knowledge generated by this study will be broad and significant."

The disease is caused by the fungus, Cochliobolus victoriae which can only infect oats if it makes a peptide called  victorin  and interacts with oats carrying a gene called  Vb . Various analyses suggest that the Vb gene, which confers Victoria blight susceptibility and sensitivity to victorin, is identical to a gene called Pc2 which confers resistance to a different disease called  crown rust of oats  caused by the fungus Puccinia coronata. Consistent with this interpretation, molecular analyses reveal that victorin activates a resistance protein (NB-LRR) which leads to cell death and that C. victoriae exploits this defense response to cause disease. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that victorin sensitivity is conditioned by genes encoding resistance proteins across diverse crop species including barley, rice and bean. We hypothesize that these resistance proteins (NB-LRRs) are functionally, and perhaps structurally, related to the protein encoded by the Vb/Pc2 gene in oats. This proposal will address this hypothesis and in addition investigates the diversity of targets for victorin and the resistance proteins activated."

Identifying plant mechanisms that regulate symbiotic nodule development in legumes will enable mechanism-based strategies to optimize biological nitrogen fixation, transfer this trait to non-legumes, and thus reduce the use of chemical fertilizers. Existing knowledge indicates that a balance between auxinand cytokinin,two key plant hormones, is crucial for proper nodule development in soybean. It is not known how plants achieve a precise balance between these hormones to enable proper nodule development. This research project seeks to fill this gap in knowledge byidentifying molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the balance between auxin and cytokinin,two key plant hormones,isregulated during soybean nodule development.Through a previous research project funded by NIFA-AFRI, the PD&#39;s lab identified that a regulatory module comprised of a regulatory RNA (microRNA160) dictates developmental stage-specific sensitivities to auxin and cytokinin, and directs proper nodule formation and maturation in soybean. microRNA160 functions by regulating the levels of a family of transcription factors belonging to the ARF10/16/17 family (referred to as ARF10) that suppress the action of auxin.The major objective in this proposal is to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which ARF10 proteins regulate auxin-cytokinin balance and subsequent nodule development. Therationalehere is that knowledge on these mechanisms will meaningfully contribute to strategies for optimizing nodule formation and nitrogen fixation, and potentially transfer this trait to non-legumes.Methods and approaches:The research project willdetermine the sites of GmARF10 activitythrough molecular probing and microscopy analysis; identify and validate its interacting partner proteins through protein-protein interactions assays in yeast and in soybean plants; identify and validate its direct downstream targets using high throughput sequencing andin vitro binding assays; and evaluate the role of a selected set of ARF10 effectors and downstream targets in nodule development through loss of function assays.Ultimate goal(s):The long-term goal of this research is to sustainably meet our agricultural nitrogen needs and reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers.Studying nodule development in soybean, a major food, feed and potential biofuel crop, is of high relevance to modern U.S agriculture. U.S. farmers used ~13 million tons of nitrogen in 2011 costing them on average $10 billion (USDA-ERS data) which could be significantly reduced through enhancement ofbiological nitrogen fixation. Reduced use of chemical fertilizers also helps sustain clean water, fertile land and a benefiting habitat for future generations."

As the plant material is rapidly broken down, the bacterial cells inand on the matrix surface are released into an aqueous mixture. While the digestion has beenshown to rapidly liquefy the plant matrix, there has been no effect on the viability of the bacterialcells.

Falling Number (FN) is a widely implemented method used to test enzyme activity of PHS-damaged wheat and determine pricing, but has not shown to be a reliable predictor. These discrepancies have highlighted a knowledge gap in how PHS influences starch properties within wheat kernels. The proposed FN system will be critical to addressing these issues as it will serve as the only means of communication between quality control and research. Our goals are to address critical issues related to wheat quality through (1) elucidating the mechanism for the effect of PHS, (2) clarifying the relationship between FN and end-use quality, and (3) facilitating the development of new wheat varieties that are more resistant to PHS. The acquisition of a FN system in this proposal will enhance research capacity at the University of Idaho (UI), the teaching quality of the food science and plant science programs, and the collaboration between food science and wheat breeding program at the UI. Through performing experiments, graduate students who are involved in the proposed project will receive laboratory instruction, and gain skills in performing experiment, critical thinking and problem solving. Through teaching starch chemistry course, students will learn specific knowledge of starch chemistry and apply the knowledge to solve related problems in food and agricultural industries. Students will be also more competitive in job markets after graduation."

Global population growth is expected to increase to ~9 billion by 2050 and raises unprecedented and definitive environmental, economic, and societal challenges. The overarching challenge facing livestock production systems is one of demand for increased protein production (milk and meat) framed within growing consumer concern over food quality, safety, animal welfare, climate change, and long-term resilience and sustainability. Intensification of current confined livestock production systems are not efficient or sustainable, particularly when protein produced is balanced against land and water inputs. Furthermore, by 2050, &gt;80% of agricultural production is projected to come from increased productivity on presently cultivated land, however, increased agricultural production is frequently associated with management practices which degrade land and water resources. Therefore, to meet the growing demand for milk and meat, agricultural production will increasingly have to preserve and augment good quality land and water resources through enhanced efficiency and utilization of non-conventional resources and/or management practices.Grazing systems are part of the landscape and are an integral component of economically and socially viable livestock production. When compared to other sources of fodder production for milk and meat, grass/pasture based grazing systems represent an economically viable source of feed when compared to maize silage and/or alfalfa haylage. As such there is increasing interest in the development of livestock grazing systems which may foster environmental sustainability/resilience and maintain and/or improve long term livestock production capacity. The underlying challenge facing grazing systems is the need to develop production practices which maximize the utilization of grass per unit of animal product, promote mixed swards which balance nitrogen fixation (legumes) with high quality grasses balancing nitrogen and energy release in the rumen to maximize production efficiency (akin with sound TMR rations) along with sound environmental practices based on grazing science agro-ecology.However, there are few, if any, research facilities incorporating grazing lactating dairy livestock into agro-ecosystems research in the continental United States. Our goal is to integrate a lactating grazing herd into UW-Platteville Pioneer Farm agro-ecosystem research program. With this increased capacity we will investigate the impact of grazing on ecosystem services at the field, farm, and landscape levels; and, compare/contrast the proposed grazing herd with our current confined dairy herd. This goal will be achieved through the establishment of a new collaborative relationship with the United States Dairy Forage Research Center (USDFRC); and, by enhancing our collaboration within the Global Farm Platform (GFP) and Long-Term Agro-ecosystem Research (LTAR) networks."

Potato acreage in ND ranks in the top three and total production is among the top three or four states, depending on the year (Anonymous, 2013). Additionally, added value to the states&#39; potato production comes from the two French fry production facility and multiple wash plants that pack and nationally distribute fresh market potatoes. ND is the second largest seed potato producer, much of which is exported out of state to other potato producing regions. Clearly, potato production is a major economic factor among agricultural commodities in the state, and ND plays an integral part in the US potato production market.Potato diseases are an extremely important yield and quality-limiting factor for this crop. A significantly higher percentage of the variable cost inputs into the potato crop are directed at disease management compared to other crops grown in ND. A primary reason for this is that the crop is vegetatively propagated. There are approximately 150 diseases that affect potato, of which 30-40 are economically important, all of which can be harbored in or on the tuber. Plant diseases that would normally not be a problem in a true seed crop such as wheat, soybean, corn or dry edible beans are transmitted and harbored by the potato tuber, making diseases of the crop a major economic constraint and very difficult to control.In 2006 and 2007, potato producers in ND and MN lost in excess of $8 million due to storage rots, leak and pink rot and approximately $12 million to bacterial ring rot (RD Offutt, Co., Simplot, Inc., Lamb-Weston, Inc; personal communication). The cost of controlling Verticillium wilt by soil fumigation with metam sodium is estimated to cost growers in ND and MN approximately $25-28 million (estimate provided by the manufacturer, AmVac, Inc.). This clearly illustrates the need to improve our understanding of these diseases, their management and the means to predict their development. In addition, new and emerging diseases occur all the time in potato production, such as the recent immigration of the new viruses PMTV and TRV into the U.S. and the development of ZC caused by a very primitive bacterium. We must be prepared to address such disease issues as they arise.Research performed by this project has made significant progress in the management of potato diseases that improve the profitability and sustainability of this crop to ND producers and to the value-added constituency. However, due to the nature of the crop and susceptibility of the major potato cultivars to many diseases, further progress is needed to insure continued productivity of the crop to the region and the U.S. Much of the future progress will be directed at providing immediate disease development strategies that are research-based and through the development of cultivars that resist disease."

It not only provides an economically viable alternative to wheat, barley, or canola but also helps condition the soil for these other crops through its ability to add nitrogen, its low water use, and its alternate pests, weeds, and diseases. Relatively few public germplasm improvement programs service the region. In addition, the availability of a genomic sequence for barrel medic greatly increases the potential for rapid and dramatic improvement in the pea varieties available and our ability to manipulate the crop. As a species, pea possesses a high genetic diversity, and a wide range of crop types can be generated by traditional breeding techniques. We will focus on developing yellow dry pea varieties that have a high content of slow digesting starch. Such a starch content is particularly suitable for Type II diabetics or other individuals who desire to avoid high blood sugar levels. Products made from such peas or their flour are digested gradually and have a much lower glycemic index than other grains or starchy vegetables. Other genes that will be investigated include several that provide resistance to specific diseases of pea, including powdery mildew, enation virus and fusarium wilt. Each of these diseases is common in pea growing regions, and the loss of their effectiveness would greatly reduce our ability to grow this crop. The genetic basis of other, more complex traits critical for pea varieties in Montana and the Northern Great Plains with be investigated and markers developed so that these traits can be included in the growing number of characters possible to be screen for in pea breeding programs by marker-assisted selection."

Consequently, plant diseases cause dramatic losses in crop production in the U.S. and other countries around the globe. In the U.S. 500 million kg of pesticides are applied each year at a cost of $10 billion. Still more than a third (37%) of all potential food crops is destroyed by diseases. Conventional pesticides rely on direct toxic activity against microbes, which often leads to undesirable effects on human health and the environment. In response to these concerns the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established a program to conveniently register reduced-risk pesticides, which should have a reduced impact on human health and other non-target organisms. There is great need and a high potential for successful marketing of novel non-toxic types of pesticides.Using a high-throughput screen we have identified over 100 drug-like compounds that induce natural immune responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). Such synthetic elicitors are likely to facilitate the development of new reduced-risk pesticides designed to fight plant diseases by enhancing the plant&#39;s inherent defense capabilities. We also surprisingly discovered that low doses of some synthetic elicitors enhance plant root and shoot growth. These exciting new results warrant deeper and more extensive investigations on the utility of synthetic elicitors as new types of agrochemicals.We are currently characterizing a subset of these synthetic elicitors regarding their biological activity. We have extensive (published and unpublished) data that demonstrate the utility of such compounds in mediating natural disease resistance and enhanced growth in Arabidopsis. We also have some data showing positive effects in tomato and the legume cowpea. What is missing to be competitive in recruiting extramural support from applied-oriented federal funding resources or private sector sources are comprehensive proof-of-concept data demonstrating the broad applicability of synthetic elicitors in crops. The main purpose of this project is to provide such proof-of-concept data as well as to gain comprehensive knowledge about the mode-of-action of candidate synthetic elicitors. We are combining methods of molecular biology, chemical genetics, genomics and plant pathology to gain basic understanding about plant immune processes, develop synthetic elicitors and to understand their mode of action. As a long-term goal of our study we plan to provide a set of novel compounds that, when applied individually (or combined), enhance disease resistance and plant growth in crop plants."

CMV is transmitted efficiently to healthy hosts by aphid vectors in non-persistent manner. Despite its economic importance, information concerning how CMV and its satellite RNA (Sat-RNA) interact with its host and cause disease is still in infancy. However, development of DNA based expression system in plants, such as Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression (Agroinfiltration) and ever-improving functional genomic approaches would allow us to identify the host interactome network regulating the replication and pathogenesis of CMV and its Sat-RNA. Since tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) being one of most important vegetable crops in US and California in particular, all our proposed experiments will be performed using tomato as a model host. Most importantly, as proposed here, a recently discovered precise gene editing technology, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, can be adapted for the generation of tomato plants defective in essential target genes encompassing host interactome network. We are confident that mutant tomato plants generated by CRISPR technology will be resistance to CMV/Sat-RNA infection. Once established, this new technology can be successfully extended for other crop plants important for US/California agriculture. In addition, as proposed here, the ever-improving proteomics approaches promise further understanding of virus-host interactions that will likely result in new strategies for virus disease control."

Most of the production is located in the Red River Valley, which includes ND and MN (the third largest producer in the U.S.). Several cultivars released by the NDSU dry bean breeding program have been intensively used by the growers in the region as a result of their attributes such as high seed yield and quality, agronomic performance, and disease resistance in some cases. Approximately 50% of the MIN-DAK region planted with pinto beans used NDSU varieties Lariat, Stampede, ND-307, and Maverick (http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/plantsciences/research/releases/dry-bean). Also, 78% of the black bean acreage was planted with &#39;Eclipse&#39;, which was released by NDSU in 2004. In addition, 17% of the navy bean area was planted either with &#39;Norstar&#39; or &#39;Avalanche&#39;, which were released in 1991 and 2008, respectively. Developing and providing dry bean cultivars that are adapted to the region and have high yield, seed quality, disease resistance, and tolerance to abiotic stresses has been key for the success of the crop in the area. An active dry bean breeding program at NDSU will allow growers to remain productive and competitive in the local and global economy, delivering high quality beans to consumers throughout the world."

When growing together this mutualisms converts nitrogen from the air to a form the plant can use. In other words this plant-bacteria mutualism provides fertilizer that sustains plant growth. We propose to develop the resources that can be used to identify genes that are responsible for variation in the benefits plants obtain by interacting with different strains of rhizobia. Identification of these genes will lea to identifying or developing strains that fix more nitrogen and are particularly beneficial to plant growth and yield. Because nitrogen supplied through this mutualism takes the place of fossil fuel-derived fertilizer, increasing the beneftis plants obtain from rhizobia can contribute to the development of economically and environmentally sustainable agricultural systems."

This balance is especially difficult to achieve with the nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles. Agriculture is an important driver of changes in regional nitrogen cycles because inorganic nitrogen fertilizers and legume cultivation are integral high yielding crop production. Society is increasingly looking to agricultural ecosystems to mitigate changes in the global C cycle by storing more carbon in soils and expanding production of bioenergy crops with low global warming potential. The overall goal of this project is to increase our understanding of the fates of C and N in agricultural and bioenergy cropping systems of Pennsylvania and surrounding states. Our specific goals are to: 1) evaluate the potential to replace synthetic N fertilizer with biological N fixation by soil microorganisms and cover crops, 2) improve computer simulation models to provide new tools for soil fertility testing and N fertilizer recommendations, and 3) evaluate whether expansion of bioenergy crops in the region could provide a fuel with low global warming potential.To meet these goals we will monitor existing and establish new field experiments at the Penn State research station and on private farms. We are comparing nitrogen losses from corn-soybean-wheat rotations with no cover crop, with monoculture cover crops, and with polyculture cover crop mixtures. Our hypothesis is that the high diversity cover crop mixtures provide more ecosystem services than monocultures. We are monitoring C and N cycles in willow, switchgrass, miscanthus, and biodiverse conservation grasslands to determine which bioenergy cropping systems may have low global warming potential. In some of these experiments we assess greenhouse gas emissions from different portions of the landscape (e.g. well drained slopes vs excessively wet valley bottom positions) to determine how the placement of bioenergy crops on marginal land may affect emissions. We are coupling a new type of soil fertility testing (the CO2 burst method) with a computer simulation model to develop a new tool for farmers seeking N fertilizer recommendations on lands with high cover crop N inputs. Finally, we are quantifying how microorganisms (cyanobacteria) growing on the surface of the soil affect soil quality and N inputs to the ecosystem."

First, physical, chemical, and functional properties of raw chickpeas and the effects of different varieties and types are characterized. Further, the changes of nutritional, functional and structural properties of chickpea during different processing steps will be investigated. Finally, bioactive fractions from raw and processed chickpeas will be isolated and their properties will be characterized. The understanding of the changes of chickpeas during processes and development of new bioactive ingredients from chickpeas will except to add values to this crop and to increase the consumption of nutritious legume-based foods with the goal of reducing the prevalence of obesity in the nation. The proposed efforts will (1) serve as a bridge to connect farmers, researchers, and food industry; (2) help generate market demand for chickpea; and (3) promote the competiveness of specialty crop farmers by providing an alternative crop with a ready market.

Additional by-products are now being evaluated for their maximum inclusion rates in swine diets and what limitations (anti-nutritional factors, palatability, etc.) they have across all phases of swine production. Successful use of by-products as an alternative to more expensive feed options is dependent upon a pig&#39;s ability to utilize the nutrients available in the by-products to maintain a similar growth rate. The components of a diet containing by-products can be adjusted to be similar in energy content, but generally contain a higher fibrous fraction. The traditional question is if supplemental enzymes can be used in a by-product based diet to improve digestibility, nutrient utilization, and growth performance of pigs, which has been reported for mannans in swine only by Petty et al., 2002. Perhaps what is less understood is the difference in the negative impact to increased fiber content between or amongst fiber fractions or fiber sources and the alignment to an effective enzyme for improvement in nutrient utilization by the pig.Soybean Meal (SBM) and some non-legume feed ingredients contain the soluble non-starch polysaccharide &szlig;-galactomannan (&szlig;-mannan; Hsiao et. al. 2006) while dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) contains the non-starch polysaccharide &beta;-glucan. The 1,4-&beta;-D mannans and 1,3-&beta;-D glucans of various types are recognized by the innate immune system by several Pattern Recognition Receptors including the serum protein mannose binding lectin, cell surface receptors, and others (DC-SIGN) on key immune system cells (Stahl and Ezekowitz,1998; Huang et al., 2009). The stimulation of the immune system to a pathogen response consists of several proliferation and formation factors of clonal, lymphocytes, lymphoid tissue maturation of Ig, and the synthesis of effector molecules (e.g., complement) and communication molecules (e.g., cytokines). The recognition to non-pathogens is commonly known as a PAMP or MAMP - Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern and Microbe Associated Molecular Pattern - and is influenced by the innate immune systems capability to recognize these compounds as non-self due to their molecular pattern. Most are accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response, including metabolic and cellular responses that can markedly impact nutrient partitioning among tissues (Klasing 2007; Gabler and Spurlock, 2008). The feeding of a variety of by-products to swine has opened the door for more of these  anti-nutritional factors  to be present and cause possibly more than lower nutrient digestibility."

Iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency in America leading to anemia, fatigue, reduced cognitive function, decreased work productivity, and shorter-term pregnancies. In order to make sound recommendations to consumers about good (and safe) sources of iron, we need accurate food composition databases for iron.Clams, oysters and mussels are commonly listed on prominent healthcare websites (e.g. Web MD) as good sources of iron. In addition, these shellfish are listed as good sources of heme iron. Heme iron is the form of iron found in beef, and is known for its high bioavailability compared to the non-heme forms of iron found in plant-based foods (e.g. spinach and beans). However, our previous HATCH research (1) showed that not all clam products are high in iron, and preliminary studies indicate that clams contain very little heme iron. Therefore, the objectives of this project are: 1) to measure total iron, heme iron, and non-heme iron in a variety of mollusks available in Hawaii, and 2) provide accurate information to consumers and health professionals on the amounts and forms of iron in these foods.Samples of clams, oysters, muscles, and abalone will be obtained from local markets in Honolulu. The raw meat will be homogenized, and aliquots will be assayed for total, heme, and non-heme iron by established methods used for beef and poultry. Results will be published, disseminated to stakeholders and consumers, and to the aquaculture industry."

In Louisiana, the cattle industry had a value of $663 million in 2013, up 18% over 2012 (LSU AgCenter, 2014). Cattle and calves rank second only to poultry which is the largest animal industry in the state. Cow-calf producers in the United States typically market calves at weaning; most of these calves are born during the late-winter and or spring and consequently weaned in the fall. In general, producers have small numbers of cows (less than 100) and 90% of the calves weigh below 230 kg at weaning, leaving them with very little marketing opportunities for those calves. Only some producers have enough calves to market in a truck load (21,800 kg). Marketing alliances between small and medium size producers have had some success. For several weather-related reasons (drought, excessive cold/snowfall) in different areas of the country, cattle prices have been at an all-time high in recent years and have made a fresh weaned calf a valuable commodity, although analysts indicate that these times are not going to last and the cattle cycle will go back to  normal  by 2016. Regardless of the actual conditions, large economic benefits exist for beef cow-calf producers to retain ownership after weaning by growing calves to a heavier sale weight prior to finishing. Over the past two decades more cattle producers have been retaining ownership of their calves through the stocker phase, and in some cases, through the finishing phase as well (McKinnon, 2001; Rathwell, 2000). In addition, an increased number of summer row crop farmers are grazing stockers on winter cover crops, which include annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) and small grains. Each year, several million calves graze cool-season pastures in the Southeastern United States to add valuable weight as stocker calves. Utilization of cool-season annual forages is one of the primary venues for growing these calves in this region of the country.In Louisiana there is the chance to grow abundant forage resources. Warm season perennial grasses primarily bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) and bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) sometimes associated with dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum) are the  core  of perennial forages. Annual (sorghum-sudan hybrids [Sorghum sp.], pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum]) summer grasses can complement these resources. In winter, cool season annual grasses (rye [Secale cereale], annual ryegrass) or legumes especially Trifolium sp such as ball (T. nigrescens L.), crimson (T. incarnatum), berseem (T. alexandrium), and white (T. repens) clover among others can be successfully planted. Even though these many species can fit into the different ecoregions of the SE, they are the warm season perennial grasses that have been traditionally the forage base for beef cattle systems. Around them and depending on production objectives there are more (or less) intensive systems. The intensive use of greater nutritive value pastures are usually pursued with classes of cattle that demand them such as stockers (steers and heifers) and forage-fed finishing programs. In spring-calving systems having cool season pastures is a major advantage providing nutritive value to the diet of highly demanding cows around parturition and through the first few months of lactation when nutrient demands are at their peak (NRC, 2000). The use of mixed swards (grasses and legumes) is an attractive alternative for producers because: 1) ruminants show preference for a rich (more than one component) diet (Scaglia and Boland, 2014a), and 2) legumes can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, hence reducing the need for fertilizer.All these pastures, however, do not provide adequate year round supply of feed or an adequate nutritive composition. There are a few alternatives to extend the grazing season and try to reduce hay feeding periods, also called  transition periods  or  gap periods . These periods (usually May-June and October-December) of the year with these limitations are usually complemented with stockpiled or conserved forages, which, depending on the nutrient requirements of the animal, may or may not need to be supplemented. Forage brassica crops such as turnip, swede, rape, and kale can be spring seeded to supplement pastures in August and September or summer seeded to extend the grazing season in November and December. Due to the increase use of cover crops in the Northeast, Midwest and upper Midwest of the US, producers in the SE became familiar with other forage alternatives that can be used for grazing. Forage brassica crops such as turnip, swede, rape, and kale are annual crops that are highly productive and digestible and can be grazed 80 to 150 days after seeding, depending on the species. In addition, crude protein levels are high, varying from 15 to 25 percent in the herbage and 8 to 15 percent in the roots, depending on the level of nitrogen fertilization and weather conditions. Despite these advantages these forages require appropriate management not only for their own productivity but also for the grazing animals. Brassica crops can cause health disorders in grazing animals if not managed properly. The main disorders are bloat, atypical pneumonia, nitrate poisoning, hemolytic anemia (mainly with kale), hypothyroidism, and polioencephalomalacia (Hall and Jung, 2008).All around the US and Louisiana is no exception, there is a trend showing that consumers demand for  organic  or  natural  foods is increasing sharply. In recent years (up to 2012), there was annual growth in sales of 24 and 39% for natural and organic meats, respectively. Grass-fed beef is within these niche markets and its relevance has been noted by the USDA. In September 2013, The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#39;s (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) announced a new Market News report that covers grass fed beef (USDA-AMS, 2013). Furthermore, on April 2014 the USDA Grass Fed Program for Small and Very Small (SVS) Producers was presented as a verification tool for SVS producers to certify that animals meet the requirements of the AMS Grass (Forage) Fed Marketing Claim Standard. For this program, USDA is targeting producers that market 49 cattle or less each year (USDA-AMS, 2014). Adding to this trend, consumers are more inclined to support locally produced products, commercialized in farmers markets, favoring localized economies which by end result will strengthen the community&#39;s economy. From 1994 to 2013, the national count of farmer markets directory listings (which is voluntary and self-reported) increased from 1,775 to 8,144 with a 3.6% increase from 2012 (7864) to 2013. In Louisiana there are more than 120 farmer markets (LDAF, 2013).The present proposal plans to contribute to an already developing stocker and forage-fed beef industry in Louisiana and to improve the efficiency of utilization of the forage resources available in the Gulf Coast region."

A typical dry bean grower may use five to nine field operations over each acre of dry beans. Planting dry bean directly into previous crop stubble reduces input costs, and has the added benefit of reducing soil erosion and protecting the crop from wind damage early in the growing season. Another way to reduce input costs is to direct-harvest the dry bean crop instead of undercutting and windrowing. Previous experience seeding into wheat stubble and using direct harvest in dry bean has shown high levels of harvest loss (beans left on the ground after harvest). In 2013, harvest losses were over 30% in some fields, resulting in a loss of over $200 per acre in potential revenue. Growing conditions in 2013 were particularly problematic (wet conditions in the fall during harvest), which resulted in much greater harvest loss than usual. Even in a good year, direct-harvest may result in harvest losses of 5 to 10%, which would result in a loss of $40 to $90 per acre in potential revenue. This high potential for lost revenue is one reason we think more dry bean growers are not adopting a reduced-tillage/direct-harvest production system. There is great potential to increase the profitability and sustainability of dry bean production by minimizing harvest losses in a reduced-tillage/direct-harvest system.Here, we propose a project focused on reducing harvest loss through residue management and cover crops, while minimizing yield loss. To accomplish this, we will plant dry beans into wheat stubble of various heights, or winter wheat cover crop terminated at various times. If successful, this production system could greatly increase profitability of dry bean production, while also providing environmental benefits. If we can reduce harvest losses by even 2% (a very conservative estimate of what we think is possible) we could increase revenue by over $17 per acre. The reduction in input costs could result in an additional savings of $65 per acre."

A stable and continuous supply of plant genetic resources plays an important role in sustaining the crop productivity. Scientists and breeders rely on plant germplasm to provide desirable traits to improve major crops, minor regional crops, and to develop new crops. A cooperative approach is best in conservation, evaluation and utilization of plant genetic resources important to this region. The proposed project was developed and will be conducted under the guidance of our Technical Advisory Committee with members in multiple disciplines and from each of 13 Western States. Members of this committee are experts in areas such as agronomy, crop genetics and breeding, horticulture, statistics, and plant pathology. Most participants from the current project (2009-2014) will continue to play important roles in carrying out the project. Strong collaboration has been developed among the participants through the past years. The projected body of work for the next two years will ensure that valuable plant germplasm resources and associated information are optimally preserved and can be readily accessed by our customers of the current and future generations.The following Outputs are expected:Output 1. This project will continue to provide quality germplasm of common beans, cool season food legumes, forage grasses, oilseeds, vegetables, beets, ornamentals, medicinal crops, temperate forage legumes and related wild species maintained at this site to researchers in the western region, the U.S. and the world. The utilization of this germplasm in basic research will result in strengthening of plant sciences and in applied research will enhance pest resistance, improved end-user quality and increased productivity.Output 2. Efficient regeneration protocols will be established and refined based on the research information on pollination biology for effective regeneration of the respective species and accessions in the WRPIS collection. Potentially harmful fungi, viruses, and other pathogenic microorganisms as well as pests will be managed during regeneration to produce healthy seeds for storage and distribution.Output 3. More phenotypic data associated with priority accessions will be available to the U.S. and worldwide breeders and researchers who use our germplasm. Enhanced germplasm will be released for use in breeding programs.Output 4. Our molecular characterization program will generate information on molecular diversity and population structure of selected crop species and wild relatives. Application of this information to germplasm management will increase our overall efficiency and effectiveness by eliminating duplicated (redundant) accessions and monitoring allele frequencies to maintain genetic integrity during regeneration. Information on DNA markers associated with economic traits will be published in peer-reviewed journals, enabling breeders to incorporate novel traits into elite lines via marker-assisted selection in their cultivar development efforts.Output 5. New critically needed accessions of priority crop species will be added to the WRPIS collection for distribution. These new accessions will fill the existing gaps in our collection as revealed with DNA-based markers, morphological variation or geographical origin. The acquisition will be accomplished by collection trips and germplasm exchange between WRPIS personnel and their international collaborators.Projected Impacts:U.S. breeders and researchers will have access to additional accessions of crops, crop varieties, and native plant genetic resources for host-plant resistance and value-added nutritional traits. Our collections will promote continued genetic improvement of important agricultural crops and restoration of public and private lands. Important plant genetics resources will be more efficiently and effectively conserved, monitored for seed quality and health, and distributed upon request worldwide. Accessions of priority genetic resources will be evaluated for key traits related to adaptation, yield components, and host-plant resistance to diseases and insects. Diseases and their etiological agents will be identified and characterized from selected crops and native plants, and/or indigenous or endemic regional plants hosting diseases of WRPIS crops. Genotypic and phenotypic datasets for key genetic, agronomic, and/or horticultural traits will be incorporated into GRIN Global and/or other databases, thereby enabling worldwide access to critical information."

Nitrogen-fixing legume root nodules are the result of a symbiosis between legumes and soil bacteria collectively known as Rhizobium: only when the two symbiotic partners function together, can they fix nitrogen. The process of nodulation is an agriculturally important interaction, because not only are legumes productive without added nitrogen fertilizer, but they can also improve the nitrogen nutrition of plants grown nearby. The process of nodulation is sensitive to salt stress and is inhibited even at levels that do not have a large effect on plant biomass. Increased temperature, due to changes in overall climate, is leading to periodic drought stress, which results in the accumulation of salts in the soil as water evaporates. This increased salt in agricultural soils inhibits legume nodulation. We are studying the effect of salt stress on nodulation in the model legume, Medicago truncatula, which is closely related to the common forage crop, alfalfa (Medicago sativa).Although exposure to high salt can be stressful to plants, some studies show that pretreating plants with moderate concentrations of salt, called  salt acclimation , can reduce the negative effects of a subsequent high salt treatment on plant growth. Might M. truncatula plants also respond to salt acclimation by reducing detrimental responses when shifted to salt stress conditions? Would salt acclimation help protect M. truncatula nodulation against the stress of high salt? What is the mechanism of this response? We propose to test these questions in this project by examining the effect of salt acclimation and salt stress on nodulation by monitoring plant gene expression, cell division and Rhizobial infection. We will also examine the natural diversity of M. truncatula and ask whether certain genetic signatures correlate with salt resistance. We hope that together, these approaches will help us to better understand the effect of salt stress on nodulation and determine whether salt acclimation can ameliorate the negative effects of salt. In addition, we hope to identify some salt-tolerant or salt-acclimation associated genes, that may be useful to plant breeders selecting salt-resistant strains of crop legumes, such as alfalfa."

The U.N. estimates that food production will have to increase by 50-70% over the next 30-50 years (http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/food_security.shtml), whereas the increases in plant productivity seen in the early years of the  green revolution  have flattened out (Ray et al., 2012), at least in part caused by rapid climate change, depletion of nonrenewable resources, eutrophication of waters etc. that may severely diminish plant productivity (Lobell and Gourdji, 2012). At the same time, plants and algae are increasingly viewed as sources of fuel to supplant fossil fuels, leading to potential competition for arable land (e.g. Rathmann et al., 2010). There is thus an urgent need to develop highly productive, environmentally robust and sustainable energy and food production under a rapidly changing environment. Traditional breeding of crops have focused on maximized many of the easily modifiable plant parameters (e.g., crop architecture, plant growth cycle), leaving the (more challenging) energy storing reactions of photosynthesis and plant responses to environmental changes as the remaining opportunities for improvement (Zhu et al., 2010). The long-term aim of this proposal is to accelerate development and deployment of crop lines with improved photosynthetic efficiency and robustness. We will focus on delineating the responses of photosynthesis to environmental conditions, in particular combinations of fluctuating light, temperature and CO2 levels. The project will take advantage of novel high throughput plant phenotyping technologies developed at MSU, including the Dynamic Environmental Phenotype Imager (DEPI) platform that captures  videos  of plant responses to environmental changes. Work over the past two years has shown that DEPI and related technologies can be used in model systems like Arabidopsis to discover new genes and biochemical processes that are critical for efficient and robust photosynthesis. The proposed work will attempt to expand the utility of the DEPI approach to agriculturally important crops. The work will focus on the large, unsolved issue that many varieties, mutants or other lines perform well under the artificially stable conditions of the greenhouse or growth chamber, but perform poorly under the dynamic conditions of the field. This is an emerging area of research and many phenotypes have been shown to have  beneficial  or minimal effects in the laboratory but large deleterious effects under dynamic conditions of the field. In other words, phenotypes observed under controlled greenhouse conditions are not always transferable to the field. In addition, there are many  hidden  phenotypes that are not revealed by the current laboratory screening protocols. Preliminary work has shown that these phenotypes (particularly those related to photosynthesis) are often dynamic and transient, and can only be observed by continuous non-invasive probes. This has been a major problem for gene discovery since field-testing is time-consuming, costly, and difficult to reproduce due to variable weather conditions. This issue is especially relevant to improving photosynthesis because this process must respond to very rapidly changing conditions, e.g. strong fluctuations in light and temperature. We propose to capture the dynamics of field conditions and replay them reproducibly in environmental chambers while measuring the dynamic responses of photosynthesis, photoinhibition, growth, seed yield and other fundamental phenotypes. We will screen association panels of highly diverse common bean varieties (in collaboration with Phil McLean, North Dakota State University and Wayne Loescher, Michigan State University) to test the feasibility of using DEPI for genome wide association (GWAS) mapping of dynamic photosynthetic responses. We will explore several environmental parameters including light intensity and fluctuation, temperature (both heat and chilling). Once established, we will apply for external funds to perform large-scale experiments to map quantitative trait loci that condition photosynthetic responses to environmental fluctuations, which may be used by plant breeders to generate more robust and productive production varieties."

Finding the most economically viable system for cover crop use will result in greater farmer adoption. Cover crops can be grasses such as winter wheat or legumes such as crimson clover. The clover fix nitrogen from the air as they grow and can supply some nitrogen needs of a following crop.

However, because of economiccompetition from other land uses and changing demographics of land owners, the area of grasslands in the Midwest has decreased by over 21% in the past decade resulting in the loss of grazing lands and the ecological services provided by grasslands. A major reason for the loss of grasslands has been their low productivity and nutritional qualityresulting fromloss of diversity in the plant communities of pastures that either have been overgrazed or grasslands in government contract programs or used for recreation that have been ungrazed for long periods. Appropriate stocking managementshould control competition of dominant species allowing establishment and persistence of legume species that will enhance the nutritional value and productivity of grasslands. Similarly, by controlling plant growth, soil compaction, and manure distribution, appropriate grazing management should minimize emissions of methane from cows and nitrous oxide for the soil while optimizing carbon sequestration in organic matter to minimize the global warming potential of grasslands. As the largest cost inbeef cow-calf operations is the amount of stored feeds that are fed in the winter, the profitability of beef cow-calf enterprises may be enhanced by extending the grazing season through the use of stockpiled forages. However, the optimum system of summer management to maximize nutritional value of stockpiled forage and how this management would affect the plant community and soil properaties is unknown. Furthermore, because the response of plant communities to grazing is subject to considerable temporal/spatial variation, landscape and soil factors need to be considered when identifying the most effective management."

It is estimated that the total costs associated with losses, damage, and control of weeds in crops in the United States reaches $27 billion each year (Pimentel et al. 2005). Based on acreages and estimated chemical costs, in 2012 Michigan growers alone spent over 177 million dollars in pesticides to help control weeds and other pests (USDA-NASS 2013). Shifts in production practices and the substantial use of glyphosate-resistant crops have changed the landscape of many agronomic fields. These changes have led to the increased occurrence of glyphosate- and multiple herbicide-resistant weeds. Glyphosate-/multiple-resistant Palmer amaranth may be one of the most devastating weed species that has been found in field crop production in Michigan and throughout the United States. Future weed management strategies will rely on understanding Palmer amaranth biology and ecology, as well as, exploring potential new strategies that incorporate different crop rotations, the use of existing and new technologies, and cover crops to help manage this weed. Other changes in crop production practices have led to the use of preharvest herbicide treatments or harvest aids in crops such as dry edible beans and winter wheat. It will be important to understand the effects of these treatments on crop quality (more specifically black bean color retention), weed desiccation, and crop harvestability. The principle objective of a weed management is to reduce weed densities to levels that do not impact crop yield or quality. Chemical control is often the primary tool for controlling weeds. However, incorporating cultural practices, such as cover crops may help influence a crops ability to compete with weeds. Understanding what factors in current weed management strategies that may affect the establishment and growth of cover crops will be important. We need to design integrated weed management systems that not only rely on chemical control, but can include other tools such as cover crops to manipulate the crops ability to tolerate and minimize the effects of weed competition. One mission of the AgBioResearch is to generate knowledge through strategic research that enhances agriculture to improve food, energy, and natural resources. Developing weed management strategies that are effective, efficient, economical, and environmentally sound for the Michigan farmer is critical to this mission. The overall goal of this research is to explore multiple strategies that manipulate and manage weeds in agronomic systems."

Educated decision making also allows our intended target audience to take advantage of the positive implications of changing climate as well as to mitigate the adverse impact of our changing climate. One of the most important positive impact is the lengthening growing seasons which allowed growers to start planting corn with long maturing varieties that has better yield and economic benefits in the northern plains. Growers also need to realize the variability of extreme fluctuation in heat units accumulated throughout a given growing season can increases the risk.

The amount of N applied annually to these systems exceeds plant uptake, and relatively little N in protein, amino acids, and mineral forms in forages consumed by animals is subsequently removed from the ecosystem. Apparent N recoveries of 17% to 50% are commonly found for cool-season grasses in pastures receiving N fertilizer application. In addition to economic loss, an undesirable aspect of poor recovery of fertilizer N is the potential for leaching below the effective rooting zone and possible contamination of ground water. Although nutrient cycling in grazing systems is more self-contained or closed than in systems that rely on concentrate feed, such as poultry production, nutrients in animal excreta become concentrated in patches where they are susceptible to loss and remain an unsolved problem to which fertilizer N and supplemental feed contribute. In the Midwest, loss of N from agricultural systems contributes in a large fashion to periodic hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico, and gaseous nitrous emissions from pastures contribute to the greenhouse effect. The magnitude of N loss and resulting negative impacts on ecosystems are influenced by the timing, frequency, and intensity of management practices within the ecosystems.In recent years, scientists have focused on improving NUE of the products, i.e., crop plants and livestock, in order to reduce the amount of N going to the environment and to reduce fertilizer costs to farmers. Our proposed research will focus on improving NUE through use of legumes, supplementation strategies, and patch-burn grazing in pastures. Legumes grown in combination with pasture grasses have been shown to increase livestock production while minimizing annual N fertilizer requirements of the pastures. Nitrogen losses and NUE in grass-legume pastures, however, need further research. This project also will evaluate use of patch-burn grazing to improve NUE in mixed-grass pastures. Pastures in the eastern Great Plains tend to be mixtures of introduced cool-season grasses, with growth limited to spring, and native perennial warm-season grasses. Adoption of patch burning, a management strategy aimed at increasing vegetation heterogeneity, has potential to improve forage production in pastures by enhancing cover of the native perennial warm-season grasses. Presently, it is unclear whether patch burning, N fertilization, or their combination can be used to improve nutritive value of warm-season grasses, increase steer body weight gains, and improve NUE in pastures.In summary, increased demand for meat products by consumers during past decades has encouraged producers to respond with an intensification of meat production. Hence, there is an urgent need to provide scientific information to make decisions about how to best manage rural landscapes to produce agricultural commodities while maintaining soil, water, and air quality. Our project will determine the effects of pasture management practices on NUE, evaluate the spatial and temporal relationships between grazing strategies, and quantify differences in N cycling in forage systems with and without legumes."

This will be achieved by conducting research within two themes: (i)  mind the gap  and (ii) pre-plant risk quantification for monocyclic diseases. Research within the first theme seeks to quantify the impact of biotic factors on the gap between attainable and actual yield to reduce loss from diseases and enable the economic values of disease management programs to be calculated and fully realized. A strong focus of this work will be to design disease management strategies with a holistic focus, including considerations of edaphic factors such as manipulating the environment, varieties, plant density and rectangularity, the role of seedborne inoculum on epidemic initiation, residues, and off-target implications. Research conducted within this theme will also seek to characterize the variability of selected pathogen populations, such as fungicide resistance, virulence and aggressiveness of isolates, and variation using molecular markers, to make assessments of the durability of current disease management recommendations. Factors affecting disease epidemics and processes responsible for crop loss, such as depicting the spatiotemporal attributes of epidemics, characterizing spread from inoculum sources, and implications for risk predictions will also be studied where applicable.Research on the epidemiology of the following diseases will be conducted within this theme:White mold, caused by the fungus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, which causes substantial annual losses in a range of processing and fresh market crops annually. White mold has been rated among the highest priorities for research by members of the New York State Vegetable Research Council and Association for at least 10 years.Cercospora leaf spot, caused by the fungus, Cercospora beticola is one of the most prevalent and important diseases affecting processing and fresh market beet production in New York State. Resistance to the fungicide, azoxystrobin, has been reported within the C. beticola population, substantially limiting the management options for this disease.Dissecting the disease complex affecting lima bean production for processing which is increasing in area in New York State. Characterization of the spectrum of diseases affecting lima beans is vital for the development of holistic disease management strategies and continued realization of actual yield. This second theme will focus on improving the quantification of risk for soilborne diseases by developing pre-plant DNA-based soil tests. Tactical decisions for disease management made by growers and industry are currently integrated functions of crop loss risk, driven by personal experience and assumptions of the ubiquitous presence of disease inoculum. In this way, the majority of decisions surrounding pesticide application for soilborne diseases prior to planting are often routine and prophylactic. This work will develop highly sensitive and species-specific tests that can inform management decisions based on coupling of epidemiological damage thresholds. This research will also inform management recommendations for specific diseases to consider the variable importance of seed or soilborne inoculum for a range of diseases. Enhanced knowledge of soilborne disease risk may reduce the need for prophylactic pesticide application prior to planting and better inform crop rotations. Research to quantify the utility of this approach will initially focus on:Root-knot nematode (RKN) (Meloidogyne hapla) in potato and carrot. Prophylactic fumigation is currently being used as one of the major tools for soilborne diseases of potato, in the absence of quantitative information on pathogen populations. One of the major targets for fumigation is root-knot nematode. Damage and threshold relationships for root-knot nematode in carrot will also be quantified."

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide with nearly 1.5 million new cases every year and the leading cause of cancer death in women. The other type of cancer that deserves special attention is liver cancer with rising rates of incidence and deaths. The National Cancer Institute estimates that 76% of new liver cancer cases in 2014 in the US will result in death within next 5 years. Searching for new strategies that will prevent cancer, change behaviors and promote health has become the main goal of recent scientific efforts. Research has shown that poor diet is one of the key factors that can increase a person&#39;s cancer risk. On the other hand, certain dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet are known to be effective in health maintenance and lowering risk of cancer however active compounds and the mechanisms underlying these effects are yet to be determined. Therefore, the proposed studies are intended to elucidate cancer preventive effects and mechanisms, with focus on epigenetics, of two polyphenols, resveratrol and pterostilbene, that are active components of grapes and blueberries.Human DNA, a nucleic acid storing genetic information, undergoes specific modifications called DNA methylation in order to determine cell functions in different tissues. Every healthy tissue has a precise DNA methylation pattern that is part of a group of modifications called epigenetics. This pattern is drastically altered during cancer development forming a cancer-specific design. Dietary compounds such as bioactives from grapes, soy beans, and green tea have been shown to reverse cancer-specific changes in DNA methylation at target genes. We have enough evidence to hypothesize that dietary compounds change the DNA methylation patterns that consequently alter protein functions and interactions between different cell components leading to cancer prevention.In the proposed project using state-of-the-art technology and both cellular and animal models, we aim to establish the role of resveratrol and pterostilbene in health maintenance upon various negative triggers and test epigenetic modifications as an underlying mechanism. The latter compound is of special interest as its bioavailability is 4 times higher compared with resveratrol. Our project will address two overarching challenges in the field of human nutrition, delivering scientific evidence for beneficial effects of active compounds present in foods and elaborating on their mechanisms of action.Our findings are of interest to human nutrition and will increase our understanding of complex regulation of the epigenome by dietary polyphenols and consequences of this regulation to human health. This will increase awareness of the general community about beneficial effects of plant-derived bioactives and have the impact on introducing changes in public health policies and daily dietary recommendations. Our research will help people increase their quality of live by creating personal dietary plans rich in these health promoting compounds."

The focus areas are invasive species, and management of weeds and pests. Yields and profits of snap beans are impacted by several pests including herbicide resistant weeds, Mexican bean beetle, leaf hoppers, aphids, caterpillars and stink bugs. Growers rely mostly on broad spectrum and high-risk insecticides and herbicides to address these production challenges. This project proposes to evaluate ecologically based tactics such as the use of reduced tillage, cover crops, and associated conservation biological control to help mitigate weed and insect pest problems while increasing soil quality and reducing the need for pesticides characterized as having unfavorable environmental impacts. Thus, a novelty of this project is that it will allow us to deliver production tactics to vegetable growers that can be used to concurrently aid in insect and weed pest suppression while improving soil quality, associated crop productivity, marketable yield, and production profitability. Snap beans, an economically important crop of conventional and organic producers in the Delmarva region will be used as the study system but the concept is transferable to other crops.To support this research agenda, this project will evaluate effects of cover crop manipulation on: 1) insect and weed pests, 2) natural enemy densities and associated rates of egg parasitism and predation, 3) soil quality parameters that enhance weed suppression and reduce pest injury, and 4) crop productivity and marketable yield. Additional objectives will include 5) evaluating and comparing the economic cost of using cover crops and pesticides in tandem and alone for pest suppression, and 6) evaluating the efficacy of soft insecticides on pest and beneficial arthropods in snap bean plantings. These objectives will be accomplished by conducting replicated field studies in Virginia and Maryland. Our long term aim is to reduce pesticide use in food production and associated health and environmental risks, increase farm profits and lower production costs, and increase the number of farms engaged in local and regional food systems that use sustainable practices. We anticipate this project will inherently embody all priorities listed by the Delmarva Seed Funding program such as addressing stakeholders&#39; priorities impacting Delmarva states, using a multi-disciplinary approach, reducing conventional pesticides dependency, and establishing partnerships with Delmarva institutions to better insure that conventional and organic farmers&#39; interests are served."

Sheep and goats are able to utilize the various grasses, legumes, weeds, herbes, and browse that grow on millions of acres of cultivated and uncultivated lands in the US and other countries. We believe that grazing meats goats and sheep in both agroforestry and the conventional open grazing system can be economically attractive if goats and sheep are provided with suitable mixtures of cool-season grasses and legumes. Hence, the proposed project aims at evaluating meat goat and sheep performance when a suitable mixture of cool-season grasses and legumes are introduced into existing warm-season pasture. In this project, in addition to a total of fifty-one sheep (twenty-four ewes, twenty-four wether, three rams), a total of fifty-nine Kiko meat goats will be used in the twenty-four months trial to evaluate conventional open grazing system on animal performance. Prior to the start of the grazing period, animals will be fed hay and concentrated diets and will be observed daily for signs of morbidity. Then, in addition to utilizing the project in extending the grazing system, we intend on enhancing small ruminant biosecurity and maximizing meat production by using goats and sheep for mixed-species grazing. This will be achieved by: first, forage utilization and land productivity will be maximized since sheep and goats have different forage preferences; second, herbicide use and its adverse effects will be minimized as goats eat most weeds and brush that would normally be avoided by sheep and cattle; and third, gastrointestinal parasitic problem in goats will be reduced as sheep ingest a huge population of worm larvae along with forage and these larvae are killed once they are in digestive tract of sheep. Similarly, goats can minimize sheep worm larvae. Overall, we believe that the proposed project will provide a small ruminant producers in the Alabama and surrounding states with an innovative methods that enables them of efficiently produce meat goats and sheep. Additionally, this project will also provide researchers, including students at AAMU with the opportunity of assessing environmental sustainability of small ruminant production in a loblolly pine based silvopasture system. And, as a result, data generated during the project will be shared with stakeholders."

LRs are initiated in response to both developmental and primarily abiotic environmental cues (e.g. nutrients, mechanical stimuli). A better root architecture achieved through coordinated initiation of lateral roots promotes water and nutrient uptake efficiency. Leguminous plants initiate symbiotic nodule development in response to rhizobia-derived lipo chito-oligosaccharide nodulation (nod) signals specifically under nitrogen-deprived conditions. Biological nitrogen fixation in symbiotic nodules of crop legumes viz. soybean alleviates the use of environmentally damaging chemical fertilizers. Therefore, understanding the development of these root lateral organs in crop legumes viz. as soybean is crucial for enhanced management of agriculture, natural resources and the environment especially in South Dakota. We propose to identify transcripts and microRNAs (miRNAs) differentially expressed between lateral root primordia (LRP) and nodule primordia (NP) followed by functional analysis of selected candidates. It is our strong argument that our genome-enabled transcriptome, and silence-ome analysis would bridge the knowledge gap on distinct signaling mechanisms governing the development of LRs and determinate nodules.A number of microbes, specifically bacteria, colonize root surfaces and some of these contribute to plant protection, nutrient cycling, resource conservation and even protection against environmental stresses. Understanding the influence of rhizodeposits (compounds released by plant roots) on the composition of root surface microbial communities would help us elucidate plant-microbe communication in the rhizosphere. In turn, we might be able to formulate management practices (e.g. seed treatments) that positively impact plant productivity by influencing rhizosphere microbe composition. The goal of this proposal is to study the influence of isoflavonoids, a major group of compounds present in soybean rhizodeposits, on the composition of soybean root surface bacterial communities. We have developed methodology and resources to generate soybean plants with altered rhizodeposit isoflavonoid content and seek to analyze root surface bacterial communities in these plants by culture-dependent and independent methods.Advanced understanding of these processes is expected to help develop technologies to enhance sustainable production of soybean, a key food, feed and fuel crop in SD and the US."

Historically, Florida&#39;s food system was designed to leverage our seasonal advantage in the fresh produce market nationally and internationally. Florida&#39;s food systems operate at different scales: community, state, interstate and international, but this project will focus only on the community and state scales. Florida consumers and buyers are socially and economically diverse. Florida is the third most populous state in the nation, claiming over 19 million permanent residents and 84 million visitors in the state annually. However, over four million Floridians are considered food insecure, meaning that for 16.4% of adults and 25% of children, nutritious food is not available (food deserts) and/or not affordable. The population density is over 350 persons per square mile, much greater than the national average (87 persons per square mile). Development limits productive and affordable land that can be used for food production, and there are many competing demands on our natural resources. The bulk of agricultural production is produced by large farms (those having $1M or more in annual sales as defined by the USDA) that typically export commodities out of state. These large farms account for 3% of the total farms in the state. On the other hand, more than 90% of Florida&#39;s 47,500 farms are small farms, or those farms reporting gross annual sales of $250,000 or less according to the USDA. Most revenue from small farms is generated by direct to consumer sales. However, many of Florida&#39;s citizens lack opportunities to purchase fresh, nutritious food directly from a farmer, and many more lack that access from any retail outlet in their communities. Food desserts force citizens to make food choices that do not meet their nutritional needs. The large sector of small farm operators in Florida needs to be supported by research and outreach on market access and distribution strategies to enable them to contribute to Florida&#39;s food needs to the fullest extent possible. In response to current demand from consumers for local food and the state&#39;s lack of infrastructure available to process, pack and distribute food from small and medium sized farms to other outlets in the state, a significant number of new initiatives and brick and mortar businesses have established operations to take advantage of these economic and social/cultural opportunities. Additional opportunities exist as a result of the expansion of the national initiative Let&#39;s Move and popular interest in sourcing local food for cafeterias in Florida&#39;s 3,800 K-12 schools. Schools provide lunch and sometimes breakfast and afterschool snacks for over 3 million children a year. School food authorities maintain meticulous purchasing records and are an excellent opportunity to measure increases in local food purchases. At its heart, a food system cannot exist without farmers. Farms need to be profitable, food needs to be safe, and production practices need to conserve natural resources. Florida&#39;s numerous lakes and natural springs are a significant draw for tourists, and water quality and water demand are considered by the Florida public to be primary concerns. Florida farms are predominantly located on sandy soils with low fertility and fast water drainage. Because vegetables require 60-90 days to harvest, this relatively short period allows farmers to have three cropping cycles for each unit of land farmed. Extensive tillage is used to incorporate fertilizer, cultivate weeds, and incorporate remaining plant tissue after harvest. There is considerable interest in reducing tillage, reducing agricultural water, and minimizing off-farm inputs. Cover crops, or non-income producing crops planted to benefit the biological and ecological components of a farming system are an important tool used by farmers to conserve natural resources because the presence of living plant material keeps soil covered and in place during the hot, rainy summer, or cold winters when no income crop is present, and they can offset the following crop&#39;s fertilizer nitrogen requirement when legume species are utilized. In this regard, this project seeks to accomplish two primary goals: 1) Increase in-state consumption of specialty crops produced in Florida; and 2) Increase the rate of adoption of best management practices for soil and water conservation among certified organic and conventional specialty crop farms. Methodology for food systems efforts includes a census of current distribution and processing facilities and initiatives, an evaluation of farmer and buyer interest in new market channels including farm to school, a strategic plan for the development of Florida&#39;s food system, and development and dissemination of food safety best practices to school and community gardens. Methodology for farming systems efforts includes field experiments of replicated treatments utilizing factorial and systems designs that explore options to reduce tillage and off-farm inputs and increase soil health, and a decision support tool for farmers to guide them to make the best decisions for crop rotations that include cover crops. Expected outcomes include but are not limited to increased access of specialty crops to Florida consumers, reduced economic risk for participating farmers, statewide strategic plan for specialty crop food systems, a reduction of off-farm inputs, adoption of resource conserving practices, and improved cash flow for farmers."

Lower organic carbon status and high N and P fertilization costs are common production constraints in mechanically managed systems, a common cultivation practice in the Great Plains of USA, Texas and other parts of the world. Moreover, the N use efficiency (NUE) in most cereals and forages is about 30-50%. Significant proportion of applied N in agricultural systems is lost as nitrate through leaching, ammonia volatilization and NOx gas emission, with consequences on water quality and climate. Food production with minimal environmental consequences will be further complicated by increased demand for food and global climate change. Prolonged droughts (moisture stress conditions) are predicted to persist for decades in Southern USA and several other parts of the world and overall global soil moisture status is projected to decrease. Decreased soil moisture status over long time can impact C, N and P biogeocycling and accelerate soil fertility loss and nutrient imbalances over time. Not much is known about the plant-microbe interactions and C, N and P cycling under prolong droughts. Moisture stress can trigger number of physiological and metabolic responses by microbial populations. As a result both composition (actors) and functions (activity) of the rhizosphere microbiome can change and impact biogeocycles.Sustainable and alternative crop nutrition practices are essential to reduce the demand for fertilizers, and to mitigate the environmental consequences of fertilizer application on water quality and climate change. One of the attractive strategies is to harness soil micro-fauna and plant-microbe relationships to supplement plant nutrients. Crop rotations and management practices can be implemented to utilize N2-fixing rhizobia and mycorrhizal fungi symbiosis, which can increase bioavailable N and P pools significantly. However, the N2 fixing rhizobia and mycorrhizal symbiosis are not well understood in mixed cropping systems, in relation to N and P acquisition and turnover. Crop rotations with legumes, especially with a cover crop, can substantially improve organic carbon and nutrient use efficiency. However, legume-cereal or legume-forage rotation has not gained anticipated acreage in Great Plains and specifically in Texas, mainly because of producer&#39;s concern for moisture conservation with double cropping. Recent research suggests that the use of optimal cover crops can greatly improve soil health, soil microbial diversity, nutrient cycling and organic matter mineralization. Developing appropirate methods to demonstrate and quantify soil health and agronomic benefits of cover crops can increase their implementation on a wider scale.Methods: Experiments will be conducted to compare rhizosphere microbiome and chemistry of closely related varieties (inbred lines) with tolerance levels for P, acidity and moisture. Soil media will comprise of low P and high P absorbing soil types with soil moisture stress to permeate plant and microbiological adaptations to low P, soil acidity and moisture conditions to explore microbiome fitness and isolate competent beneficial microorganisms for the soil types. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of the rhizosphere N and P pools turnover rates will be performed. In a separate experiment, a long-term study site will be established at Overton, TX to study soil health and biogeocycles of nutrients under different crop rotations under forage and crop production systems. Soil health and biogeocycles will be monitored over time by estimating nutrients pools, microbial communities, and soil physical properties under different management practices. Additionally, microbial N and P cycling will be assessed by targeting specific gene markers. Biomass yield and nutrients uptake will be assessed for crops and forage combinations. For bioremediation related work, experiments will focus on understanding and exploring plant-microbe interactions to mitigate contamination of soil and water. Studies will focus on plant-microbe interactions for degradation of organics and stabilization of inorganic pollutants.Products: . Results of this project will identify competent plant beneficial microorganisms to improve soil P recovery and acid tolerance by plants. Results will also be useful for improving nitrogen fixation efficiency in agriculture fields and reduce fertilizer application. Results of this study will help forage and crop producers to increase nutrient use efficiencies. Appropriate cover crop combinations will be identified to improve soil health and reduce nutrients losses. Results of this study will help to improve N and P management in forage and crop production under drought conditions and improve resilience of the production systems. Appropriate management practices will be identified to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve carbon sequestration. Results of this project will help to develop sustainable and resilient bioremediation systems to reduce environmental contamination. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved to receive experiential training."

In concept, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) from this symbiosis should be able to meet the N requirements for all species in the system. However in reality, this may not occur because the amount of N required by many grass species, such as bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.], may exceed what is provided and mineralized through BNF on an annual basis. To further complicate matters, BNF also does not provide the immediate visual response in plant productivity that commercial N fertilizers provide which results in many producers applying these types of fertilizers to mixed species pastures against recommendations. This frequently shortens the lifespan of the legume component (and BNF) due to stimulated grass growth that increases competition for available resources. Enhanced efficiency (EE) N fertilizers that are designed to administer the availability of this soil nutrient at a slower rate and/or minimize losses through means external to plant uptake. Thus, a lower rate is required to gain an equivalent response as traditional N fertilizers and may provide both the supplemental N required by some grasses and the visual response desired by producers reducing legume population. My research has preliminary evidence that suggest slow-release N formulations favored maintaining legume species, but additional research is needed over a longer-term before any accurate conclusions may made about legume persistence. The results of this study will have a profound impact at a regional and national scale due to the potential negative impact the misuse of commercial N fertilizers may have on the environment. Forage systems constitute nearly 60% of the total acreage devoted to farmlands in the U.S. and receive considerably less intensive management compared to other crops. This more relaxed management style often leads to the over-application of N fertilizers despite the fact that legume species may be easily incorporated into the fields. The proper utilization of legumes in pastures requires additional or different managements in order to ensure their survival when interseeded into grasses. Many producers misinterpret this as being more complex management and prefer to use commercial N fertilizers for their simplicity and more immediate response. The proposed study will demonstrate how commercial N fertilizes may be effectively replaced with legumes and more efficient fertilizer formulations without compromising productivity. The conclusions of this study will be presented at professional meetings and be published as a scientific manuscript. The results will also be disseminated to producers through its inclusion in regional field days and publication in extension or public press articles."

A legume could make farming and ranching in the region more economically profitable and environmentally sustainable. A legume in rotation can integrate cereal and livestock production. In addition to providing high quality livestock feed as either forage or grain, legume benefits include added soil nitrogen, increased soil organic matter, reduced soil erosion, better pest control, increased soil water-storage and crop-water-use efficiency, and greater economic diversity. Growers elsewhere around the world have successfully integrated cereal and livestock production with winter feed pea in crop rotation.The traditional WW-SF system has helped to assure successful establishment of wheat in alternate years in a semi-arid environment. However, approximately 50% of native soil organic matter has been lost on the Central Great Plains since the inception of the WW-SF. Also, only 20-30% of precipitation during the long 14-month fallow is conserved. A WW-WP system might more efficiently use water and, at the same time, provide a sufficient short true fallow prior to wheat planting.Finally, many eastern Wyoming agriculture producers are both wheat growers and livestock producers but, generally, the two aspects of their operations are not integrated. Perhaps a locally adapted legume, such as winter feed pea, might sustainably and synergistically integrate crop and livestock production in Wyoming.This producer-driven project involving the University of Wyoming is to evaluate the initiation of a winter wheat-winter pea (WW-WP) rotation in comparison with WW-SF over two growing seasons at four sites, three farms/ranches in Laramie and Platte Counties, and UW SAREC in Goshen County. Producers will plant, manage, and harvest the crops. UW will evaluate wheat grain yield (in both rotations), pea yield (for both forage and seed in the WW-WP system) and changes in soil water content over time (in both rotations).This project is distinctive because it will utilize the first winter pea line bred in Wyoming for the Central Great Plains. In local trials, &#39;Wyo No.11&#39; has proven superior in terms of adaptation and yield to existing cultivars that were bred elsewhere in the U.S. &#39;Wyo No.11&#39; is currently under seed increase for cultivar release under the auspices of the Wyoming Crop Improvement Association. For both growing seasons, UW will provide 100 pounds of &#39;Wyo No.11&#39; seed in the Foundation Seed Class, more than sufficient to plant five acres. At harvest, most of that land (minus a small amount sampled for experimental purposes) can be harvested and sold by the growers as high-value Certified Seed, thus entering &#39;Wyo No.11&#39; into the marketplace and making it available to other Wyoming producers.In sum, UW has bred a winter pea for local adaptation and superior yield. However, the potential for adoption of peas into rotations by producers is not yet known. Ultimately, producers will determine whether or not these locally adapted peas can be adopted into their operations. Thus, we will evaluate performance of Wyoming-bred pea, and compare and contrast two rotations (WW-SF and WW-WP), on Wyoming farms/ranches in this producer-driven project."

Gastrointestinal parasites, particularly the barber pole worm, limit the ability of producers to raise grass-fed sheep and goats. Three classes of anthelmintics (dewormers) are used for parasite control in sheep and goats in the United States. Emergence of anthelmintic resistance in all species of gastrointestinal nematodes, particularly the barber pole worm, and growing concern over chemical residues in animal products and in the environment has made the development of alternative methods of parasite control for small ruminants vital. In recent years, plants containing compounds called condensed tannins, have been shown to reduce parasite loads in sheep and goats. Cranberries contain many condensed tannin compounds that have anti-inflammatory, bacterial anti-adhesion, and antioxidant activity in cell culture, animal models, and clinical research. Cranberry leaves, contain greater percentages of condensed tannins than the cranberry fruit and thus are an attractive, economical source of condensed tannin compounds that hold promise as a natural anthelmintic for gastrointestinal parasites. Birdsfoot trefoil, a condensed tannin containing legume forage, hardy in the climate of the northeast, has demonstrated anti-parasitic efficacy however no testing has been conducted using the commercially available varieties or the anthelmintic potential of non-commercial cultivars explored. During this project we will investigate the potential for the condensed tannins contained in cranberry leaf and birdsfoot trefoil to function as natural de-wormers.During this project we will determine the ability of 1) cranberry leaf powder and 2) different varieties of the condensed tannin containing forage, birdsfoot trefoil (BFT), to act as a dewormer for sheep infected with the barber pole worm. 1) Preliminary in vitro tests demonstrated anti-parasitic potential of cranberry leaf powder therefore during this project period the deworming potential of pelletized cranberry leaf powder fed to lambs experimentally infected with Haemonchus contortus will be determined. 2) The anti-parasitic efficacy of BFT will be evaluated in two stages. The first stage will use barber pole worm eggs from infected sheep to conduct benchtop tests investigating the effect of different varieties of BFT on the ability of barber pole worm eggs to hatch, develop and become infective. During the second stage we will feed sheep the most promising varieties of BFT from stage one to test the ability of these varieties of BFT to prevent the barber pole worm larvae from becoming infective in sheep. The successful completion of this project will ultimately enhance productivity and profitability of small ruminant livestock production in the Northeast US."

Although there has been a plethora of work performed on wheat drought tolerance, there have been fewer drought studies completed on species such as dry bean and barley. Until screenings of dry bean and barley genotypes are completed under Wyoming conditions, producers may not have the best adapted genotypes for their field operations and for economic/environmental sustainability.The proposed project will test experimental genotypes of major crops grown in Wyoming and nearby regions (including but not restricted to dry bean, hard red winter wheat, and barley) for their performance under limited-irrigation conditions. Some experiments will also be conducted in the greenhouse where water availability can be controlled very closely. Field studies will be performed in northwestern and southeastern Wyoming. As drought-tolerant genotypes are identified, the PI will work with breeders to make crosses between the drought-tolerant types and adapted public lines with the ultimate goal to develop new cultivars with higher yield and/or quality than existing varieties."

In fact, the U.S., including NWUS, meets its canola (Brassica napus L.) oil and meal demands through imports from abroad. Given the shortage of biodiesel feedstock in the region, it is appropriate and timely to introduce dynamic and viable cropping systems that include dual-purpose canola as a main crop. In this project, an intensive sustainable cropping system for growing 3-4 harvestable crops in two seasons under irrigation and up to three harvestable crops under rainfed environment will be studied. Here we propose pea-canola double-crop cropping system. The green pea-canola double-crop system can provide new opportunities for producers in the region through: (i) providing additional annual farm income with the production of green pea and canola forage, (ii) protecting the soil from wind erosion through vulnerable with crop coverage, (iii) producing canola seed in the subsequent year for oil (biofuel or food) and high-protein meal, and (iv) preventing the decline of soil health.Studies will be conducted across four states- Montana (3 sites), Oregon (1 site), Idaho (1 site) and Washington (1 site). The studies will focus on double-cropping canola with green pea. We plan to perform the project for at least three cropping cycles; a cropping cycle for a double-crop requires a total of 20 to 22 months. In the first year, green pea will be planted in spring/winter and harvested in early summer. Following the precursor crop, in the same year we will plant dual-purpose biennial canola, which will be harvested for forage in early fall, and for oil in the summer of the second year. Cover crop (silage corn) will be planted following the canola harvest, which concludes a complete cropping system cycle. Following the harvest of the summer crop, growers will go back to the traditional winter crop before starting another biennial canola cropping system in the same field. The design of the experiment will include three factors that will be implemented on 1 to 1.5 acres in the first two cycles of the study, and 5 to 10 acres in the third cycle (includes only adaptable practices). A team of researchers and producers from participating institutions will perform the project. At least three of the studies will be conducted in producer field. Outreach is an integral part of this project. The project team anticipates that two to five years after the completion of the project (1) acreage under biennial-canola will triple in the target area, (2) growers will save $30.50/Ac in N fertilizer due to free N contribution from legume, (3) growers will receive additional net profit of $65/Ac due to the addition of green pea as part of the cropping system, and gross margin of $650/Ac from the harvest of canola as forage/hay, and (4) nitrate leaching will be reduced by 40%."

We will pursue testing of winter wheat and dry bean as new varieties and experimental lines become available. For example, Colorado State University has been developing upright varieties of dry bean, which offer advantages in terms of disease control, drying, and harvesting. In 2014, irrigated malting barley averaged 145 bu/acre and met or exceeded all the quality standards for malting. We will continue testing malting barley for its yield potential, quality, and economic viability. There is a lot of interest in industrial hemp but information about its adaptability or potential benefits for southwestern Colorado is lacking. We will test several industrial hemp varieties in 2015 to evaluate their performance and adaptation to our environment. One opportunity that may generate additional income for growers in southwestern Colorado is the production of virus Y-free seed potatoes. Potato Y virus (PVY) is a serious threat to potato production in the San Luis Valley and even though potatoes have been grown sporadically in southwestern Colorado on a small scale, it is conceivable to find isolated areas where the likelihood of PVY infestation is small. We will explore this possibility as well as the potential to produce specialty potatoes, which may have additional benefits compared to conventional (e.g., white-fleshed) potatoes. Regardless of the crops grown, water is the most limiting factor to crop production in southwestern Colorado. There are approximately 169,000 acres of irrigated land in southwestern Colorado but water availability fluctuates from year to year. For example, there were severe irrigation water shortages as recently as 2013. We will continue developing management practices and strategies to conserve water and optimize its use efficiency. The emphasis will be on alfalfa, which is the largest irrigated crop in southwestern Colorado and the one that uses the most water compared to other field crops. We will determine the effects of water stress on alfalfa stand, dry matter, and time of recovery. Even though irrigation accounts for a significant percentage of crop production in southwestern Colorado, dryland farming is still important. Constraints include low and erratic precipitation, low soil organic matter, wind and water erosion, and low yields. We will test cover crops as an environmentally friendly way to enhance soil quality and health and to reduce soil erosion. Cover crops will be grown during the fallow period in (winter) wheat-fallow, wheat-bean, and wheat-safflower-fallow rotations. We will monitor soil moisture, soil fertility, soil erosion, weed infestation, soil biological activity, and crop yields and returns. We will identify cover crop mixtures and management practices that will enhance the sustainability of dryland farming in SW Colorado and SE Utah. The information generated by this project will be shared with a large audience via field tours and workshops, social media, annual technical reports or bulletins, journal articles, and presentations at relevant events. Success will be measured by how well the research and outreach objectives are met and by the impact this project will have on the sustainability of crop production in southwestern Colorado."

It is estimated that 70% of Texas cotton is exported and must be marketable, both in terms ofprice and quality to compete in global markets. Producers must increase efficiencies by utilizing new technologies includingimproved transgenic varieties, tillage systems, and irrigation technology. Advances in genetics have improved fiber quality,however other quality parameters related to crop maturity vary due to weather and crop management. Integrated productionsystems must be developed to optimize yield, profitability and more importantly, lint quality. An economically andenvironmentally sustainable cropping system must optimize soil and water resources, manage insects, weeds, and diseases,and respond to changing commodity markets. Two trends which influence cropping systems include the adoption ofconservation/no till systems and herbicide-tolerant crops. The Texas Southern High Plains (TSHP) is a semi-arid region withapproximately 50% of crop acreage irrigated from the non-recharging Ogallala aquifer. Improved irrigation technology, such aslow-energy precision application (LEPA) and more recently sub-surface drip (SDI) has made irrigation more viable where wateris limited. These systems have replaced furrow irrigation and allowed producers to use water more efficiently, but have notreduced the quantity of water pumped. Returns are higher from cotton than from alternative crops leading to a cottonmonoculture. Crop rotations, when combined with conservation tillage can have significant impacts on soil, crop yields andprofitability. Cover crops, including small grains or legumes have been investigated to provide crop residue in cropping systemswhich do not produce sufficient residue to provide adequate cover, such as with cotton or soybean. The use of conservationtillage to maintain crop residues on the soil surface offers great potential for reducing soil erosion by wind and water, which isespecially important for the sandyland areas of the Southern High Plains. Cotton seedlings are extremely susceptible toabrasion damage. Studies have attempted to identify amounts of crop residue needed to protect soil in the Northern GreatPlains from wind erosion, and to estimate losses under various tillage systems and crop residue combination. Previous researchhas established effective weed control programs in conventional tillage cotton for the Southern High Plains. In several states,including Tennessee and Arkansas, intensive glyphosate use has led to the development of glyphosate-resistant horseweed.New and improved GR crops continue to be developed with multiple herbicide resistance genes to meet changing weedmanagement needs to help sustain the efficacy of glyphosate. Widespread development of Palmer amaranth resistance toglyphosate has been reported in numerous states. The control of volunteer GR crops is an increasing problem. Control ofvolunteer GR cotton in GR cotton has been investigated with postemergence directed herbicides."

In Washington State, awareness of the serious nature of virus infections was evident in the foreword to the report of a 1942 disease survey:  The increasing seriousness of the virus disease problem of fruit trees has been a matter of growing concern to orchardists, nurserymen, and investigators  (Reeves, 1943). The critical roles of grafting onto woody indicators for pathogen detection, and the need for replacement of infected trees with virus-tested trees were also discussed by Reeves (1943). It was demonstrated that aggressive tree removal in an effort to control Western X disease in Washington orchards was an effective tool to halt the increase in the numbers of infected trees in a defined growing region (Blodgett et al., 1949). To replace the infected trees that were removed, a reliable source of non-diseased trees was needed. This marked the genesis of the currently existing fruit tree foundation and certification programs that have ensured a continuous flow of virus-tested planting stock into nursery and production planting schemes over the past seventy years, which has led to a substantial reduction in economic loss from VLA infections in specialty crops.Today, the ability to provide virus-tested planting stock of vegetatively propagated specialty crops has become increasingly complex. The collective industries no longer depend on a few selections to support the industry. For example, the Clean Plant Center Northwest (CPCNW) at Washington State University receives an average of 139 temperate climate fruit tree selections each year for introduction and virus-testing (Eastwell, unpublished observation). The same intensive movement to establish niche markets with new selections is occurring in the grape and hop industries as well. Propagation source material originating from domestic and foreign locations is screened for VLAs before they are propagated and distributed throughout the industry. It takes many years for a single virus-tested plant to be expanded to an economically relevant planting that provides adequate product for marketing and sales initiatives. To meet the demand to have new distinctive product available in the market sooner, tremendous pressure is placed on programs to provide this service expeditiously. Rapid access to productive new clones is essential in allowing U.S. producers to remain competitive in the global marketplace. Consequently, the initial virus testing must be completed in a timely fashion. Similarly, much of the material distributed from the programs providing the virus-testing service enables plant breeders and developers to provide their product to foreign markets. Over the period 2011 to 2013, 9,914 out of the total of 36,979 or 27% of the distributions from the fruit tree program were to recipients outside of the U.S. Testing procedures used for the development of plant material must therefore be accepted by the regulatory agencies with authority in the recipient state or country. The goal of this project is to address issues associated with the demand for rapid detection and elimination of VLAs from planting stock. Overall, the three perennial specialty crops represented in this project constitute a large segment of U.S. agriculture. Nationally, the farm-gate value of these specialty crops are $11,162 million for temperate climate fruit and nut trees, $6,158 million for grapes and $249 million for hops (USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2014). The ultimate goal of the CPCNW is to assist the industries it serves by providing propagation material as quickly as possible while maintaining the highest standards possible for plant health and quarantine security. Research is conducted to help achieve this goal.In addition to the vegetatively propagated perennial crops, the seed industry is also a critical component of U.S. agriculture. In 2012, the U.S. exported seed valued at $1,522 million, of which $70 million was produced in Washington State (Mertz et al., 2013). The CPCNW provides seed testing services for viruses to support Washington State quarantine regulations governing seeds for planting in the state and to satisfy requirements for products to be exported from Washington to many other states and countries. Two major seed crops serviced by the CPCNW are beans and peas with a combined production value of $174 million in Washington State (Mertz et al., 2013). Many other seed crops are tested on a sporadic basis."

The cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne, the drugstore beetle, Stegobium paniceum and merchant grain beetle Oryzaephilus mercator are serious stored products beetles, cosmopolitan in distribution and pervasive and common pests found in South Carolina and the Southeastern United States. Methyl bromide, a space fumigant widely used to control these insects since 1930s, is been completely phased out in the United States due to its adverse environmental effects. Phosphine fumigation is a long-established effective method to control stored-product insects, but its continuous and indiscriminate use has resulted in the evolution of resistant populations and control failures. Therefore, food and feed industries are constantly looking for effective pest management alternatives, especially those are environmentally benign. Ozone application is currently attracting the attention of scientists, because of its inherent advantages in controlling insects and moulds associated with grain. Ozone is a toxic gas, can kill insects effectively, meantime degrade rapidly to molecular oxygen in atmospheric conditions. Therefore, ozone can be safely and effectively used in food processing industries to disinfest insect infestations. However, there aren&#39;t much data available assessing the level of ozone susceptibility to populations of above mentioned insect species and their strains obtained from various geographical locations in the US. In this research, I propose to evaluate the susceptibility of various life stages of above selected species to various doses and exposure time of ozone to effectively establish a dose-time-mortality relationship and to compare that model to strains of adult beetles collected from various states in the US. This proposal is designed to provide cutting-edge training to South Carolina State University students, in addition to train a Research Associate for academic career and to educate farmers, industry representatives and pest control operators in stored products industry. The work also seeks to disseminate information via scientific publications, extension bulletins and internet sources. South Carolina State University (SCSU) is a public university, located in an area that has a traditional, rural, agricultural economy. Being located in an agricultural economy and fulfilling its land grant mission, success in 1890 agricultural research programs is crucial for SCSU. The proposed project will complement the achievement of the institutional land grant mission by training students emphasized in food safety and security, thus, SCSU can produce highly skilled, competent, and socially aware graduates to enable them to work and live productively in a dynamic, global society."

The amount of N applied annually to these systems exceeds plant uptake, and only little of this N is removed by animals and subsequently the ecosystem. Significant quantities of N fertilizers are applied to forage crop and grazing systems because N is usually the most limiting nutrient for plant growth.Although nutrient cycles in grazing systems are less open than in systems that rely on concentrated feed such as poultry production, loss of N from pastures is an unsolved problem to which fertilizer N and supplemental feed contribute (Li et al. 2012). In the Midwest, loss of N from any agricultural systems may contribute in a large fashion to periodic hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, gaseous N emissions from pastures contribute to the greenhouse effect (Mosier et al., 1998). The magnitude of N loss and resulting negative impacts on ecosystems are influenced by the timing, frequency, and intensity of management practices within the ecosystems.Increased demand for meat products by consumers during past decades has encouraged producers to respond with an increased intensification of forage-based livestock production. Hence, there is an urgent need for scientific information to help producers make decisions about how to best manage rural landscapes and to produce agricultural commodities while maintaining soil, water, and air quality. Our experiments will examine alternative strategies to enhance legume establishment and persistence, improve N harvest efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) footprints in pastures; assess secondary plant metabolites in forage legumes for increased N retention and altered N cycling in dung and urine excretions from grazing ruminant animals; and quantify the effects of intensive pasture management strategies on N harvest efficiency and spatiotemporal patterns of N cycling in grassland agro-ecosystems.Expected outcomes and predictions will include advice on management strategies in terms of N use efficiency, particularly as it relates to the capture and excretion of N in the environment. The ultimate goal is to help producers adopt strategies/practices that ensure efficient use of N in order to positively influence environmental quality. In addition, this work will facilitate the identification forage systems that minimize N inputs and production costs. Minimizing expensive N inputs (e.g., fertilizers) in forage-based livestock production systems has tremendous potential to enhance their profitability. These impacts are most likely achieved through the development and implementation of a multiple-state project. The members of our proposed project represent a geographically diverse set of states from the Southeast through the Midwest and Great Plains and to the Intermountain West. Our objectives of analyzing N use efficiency of grassland production systems will be based on a wide range of environments (humid to semi-arid) and levels of management intensity (irrigated pasture to low-input pastures). The expertise, facilities and other resources required to design and conduct the proposed research are not found at a single institution. The synergy coming from a multiple-state effort in this area greatly enhances the likelihood of success in characterizing N use and developing appropriate management strategies for grassland agro-ecosystems. Furthermore, the technical feasibility of this type of research is questionable for a single university but becomes realistic when several institutions combine resources and expertise.We propose to continue to conduct complementary experiments to help stakeholders make informed decisions about rural landscapes. Multifunctional farming systems provide multiple ecosystem services. These services can include provisioning (i.e., meat, milk, and fiber production) as well as supporting, regulating, and cultural services. Supporting services include soil building and nutrient retention whereas carbon sequestration and water storage are regulating services, and cultural services include spiritual, aesthetic, and educational factors. Perennial grasslands vary greatly in their ability to provide these types of ecosystem services because of differing environmental and management characteristics. We will assess tradeoffs amongst these services, which should allow more informed decision-making and long-range improvements in U.S. agriculture as a result."

Tofu is a perfect protein rich food, often used as meat substitute in vegetarian meals, and contains about 8% of protein. About 2.2 ounces of tofu contains about five grams of protein, an equivalent to one ounce of meat. In 2012, USDA permitted to use tofu as a meat alternative in school lunches. Tofu is made by coagulating soymilk and then pressing the resulting curds into soft white block. Tofu is made to be soft, firm and extra firm in texture. Coagulation, the suspension of protein and oil in boiled soymilk is the most important step towards tofu production. Generally, salts and acids are used for coagulation. Also, a few enzymes are used for production of tofu. Demand for tofu, as an inexpensive source of plant protein, is increasing both in the USA and in other countries (Chianu et al., 2010; Yamaura, 2011). Food-grade soybean varieties used for tofu and soy milk production are distinct from commodity soybean that does not require any particular characteristics. However, soybeans for tofu production require specific seed composition, shape, size and color, which include high protein content, clear or yellow hilum, large and round seed shape (Cai and Cheng, 1999; Poysa et al., 2006). In 2013, about 93% of all soybean produced in the United States were genetically modified (GM) and rest 7% were conventional (non-GM) soybeans (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2014). However, demand for conventional soybeans especially, food-grade type is increasing constantly. Customers in Asia are willing to pay a higher price for non-GM food-grade soybeans thus soy food companies are willing to pay premiums for non-GM food-grade soybean. There are large markets for specialty soybean in China, Japan and Korea. Also, demand for food-grade soybean is increasing in other countries of the world. The US farmers can meet growing demand of food-grade soybeans in Asian markets as well as in other countries. By growing and exporting food-grade soybeans, US farmers have a larger profit margin (United States Soybean Export Council-USSEC, 2008). Food-grade soybean varieties generally yield less than commercially grown transgenic (GM) soybean varieties. Yield is negatively correlated with seed protein content. But soybean varieties for tofu need larger seed with higher protein content. Currently, a few tofu types, high yielding varieties are available for soybean growers, particularly in maturity groups (MG) III, IV and V adapted to Missouri. In addition to a premium price, growers need food-grade varieties with higher yield potential to increase profitability comparable to commercially grown transgenic varieties. Development of high yielding, value added (high oleic acid with low linolenic acid content) non-GM food-grade soybean with high protein, clear hilum and larger seed size will motivate US small farmers towards variety selection for lucrative farming. Production of food-grade soybeans needs extra care than production of commodity soybeans. The objective of this project is to develop high yielding tofu type, conventional soybean varieties of MG III-IV. Both small and large soybean farmers will increase profitability by growing and exporting these high yielding value added tofu type soybean varieties."

Crop response to management can vary due to climate, geography, soils, pest problems, field history, and other factors; therefore, research to generate management recommendations on crop inputs for Utah farmers and ranchers is most relevant if conducted within the state. Moreover, the dynamic nature of input costs, commodity prices, technology, equipment, production practices, and crop genetics warrants ongoing research to maximize production efficiency and returns.Field experiments well be conducted in fields of Utah growers to generate the information necessary for Utah agricultural producers to make management decisions regarding crop inputs on their operations. Specifically, research experiments will be conducted to 1) characterize the effect of cover crops and compost carryover on wheat yield and quality, and 2) evaluate strategies for integrating legumes into existing grass pastures in Utah.As a result of this project, we expect farmers, crop advisors, and other participants will increase their knowledge and awareness of new corn and alfalfa management tecniques that can improve profitability. We also anticipate that a change in action of some participants will occur as they adopt the techniques and methods they have learned."

Two methods to overcome low profit per ha margins are to increase the acreage farmed or increase income per ha. Due to extended financial responsibilities, many North Dakota producers are not able to increase farm size in an attempt to streamline production. However, diversifying operations to include high-value crops such as blackberries, cabbage, edamame, garlic, juneberries, and onion can increase income per ha. Such crops require higher management inputs, but may also provide increased profit potential. In addition, this money would most likely stay in the state since several state farmers market studies have shown that for every $100 spent at a farmers&#39; market, $62 is spent in the local economy and $99 is spent within the State (Brown, 2014; Kantor, 2014). The most recent survey on the economic impact of farmers markets in North Dakota occurred in 2011, a very difficult year for fruit or vegetable production (Baldus, 2011). During that year, they monitored the Lewis and Clark Farmers Market and the Sakakawea Farmers Market. On average, each farmers market had approximately $25,000 in sales, and if that was true for the 60 eat local grown, then an estimate of $1.5 million is spent at North Dakota Farmers Markets and 99% stays in North Dakota."

These species are of significant importance for ground nesting birds, small mammals, and insects, however, the use of these species as dedicated forage grasses is relatively un-researched in this region of Mississippi. This project seeks to accomplish several goals, including: comparing traditional, non-native perennial forage grasses (bahiagrass, bermudagrass, and tall fescue) to NWSG and evaluating animal performance on these species; determining optimal fertility and harvest management of several combinations of NWSG stands; and assess the potential of adding domesticated and native legumes to NWSG in hopes of increasing forage quality and extending the grazing season."

According to the 2013 Florida Agriculture by the Numbers publication, in 2012 Florida ranked first in the United States in value for the production of oranges, grapefruit, fresh market snap beans, fresh market cucumbers, processing cucumbers, squash, sweet corn, fresh market tomatoes, and watermelons. Florida also ranked second in value for the production of bell peppers, strawberries, and tangerines. In 2012, Florida growers harvested vegetables for fresh market from 186,700 acres with a value that exceeded $1.1 billion. Commercial vegetable production in Florida typically requires the use of soil fumigation to limit the impact of soil-borne pathogens, nematodes and weeds on crop yields. Growers relied on methyl bromide as the primary fumigant since the 1950&#39;s to maintain economical production levels of vegetable and fruit crops. Methyl bromide readily moves through the soil and effectively controlled pathogens, nematodes, and weeds over a broad range of environmental conditions. In 1993 it was classified as an ozone depleting chemical under the Montreal Protocol and subsequently production in the U.S. was phased out by 1 Jan. 2005. A significant number of alternative fumigants have been evaluated and registered for use. Unfortunately, most of the alternatives provide moderate to weak levels of weed control. For example, a three year trial conducted at the University of Florida examined four of the most promising methyl bromide alternatives and found that nutsedge density increased over time in all alternative fumigants. Given the poor efficacy generally associated with alternative fumigants, weed control is usually assigned the highest pest management priority for most methyl bromide alternative systems. To address this need, research trials will be conducted to developintegrated weed management programs for fruit, vegetable, and ornamentalcrops in Florida that includes a solid understanding of pest ecology, fallow programs, evaluation of new herbicides and fumigant-herbicide combinations, adoption of new application technology and cover crops as pest management tools."

This region covers 1,557,000 cropland hectares and is, by far, the largest contiguous cropping zone in the Western United States. A single family operates most farms and average farm size is 1,800 hectares. Since land was broken out of native grassland and sage in the 1880s, farming has been almost exclusively a tillage-based winter wheat-summer fallow system, where only one crop is grown every two years.Intensive tillage operations during fallow often bury surface crop residue, pulverize soil clods, and reduce surface roughness. Blowing dust from excessively tilled fields leads to major soil loss and reduces air quality. Wind erosion from dryland farms is a major cause of soil loss and degrades off-site urban air quality by small particulate emissions. These soils are dominated by particles &lt;100 um in diameter that are readily suspended and transported long distances during windstorms. Farmers need to convert to minimum and delayed conservation tillage methods using herbicides instead of tillage whenever feasible to reduce wind erosion. No-till fallow is successfully used in many regions of the world, but is not yet widely practiced in the low-precipitation winter wheat-summer fallow zone in the Pacific Northwest because of seed-zone drying during the summer. Wide-spread adoption of conservation-till and no-till fallow would, without question, sharply reduce wind erosion, blowing dust, and air quality problems.The overriding goal of all research conducted under this CRIS is to develop and extend new cropping systems and farming methods that reduce wind erosion and that can be profitably practiced by farmers. The long-term dryland cropping systems experiments (objectives 1, 3, and 6) will provide an in-depth knowledge base for the feasibility of intensive no-till and conservation-till systems with wheat, barley, triticale, canola, pea, and camelina.Removing emergence-impeding dwarfing genes from winter wheat varieties (objective 2) will enhance seedling emergence from deep planting depths in the winter wheat-fallow region of east-central Washington. Development and testing of a commercial-size deep-furrow drill prototype that will pass through and retain residue (objective 4) will reduce, and hopefully eliminate, the last road block (i.e., plugging the drill during planting) that farmers face in the adoption of conservation-till fallow of summer-fallowed soils.The irrigated winter canola planting method experiment (objective 5) will identify environmentally friendly methods for winter canola production in lieu of burning and heavy disking of winter wheat stubble prior to planting.Research on winter triticale agronomy (objective 7) will determine how this crop can compete with winter wheat and the rotation advantages (if any) that it provides.Approximately 80 percent of the research under this CRIS will be conducted in the field and 20% in the laboratory. Research results will be disseminated through local, regional, national, and international meetings, through field tours at research sites, and through popular and scientific journal articles."

Therefore, with this project, we will focus on the characterization of food safety outcomes in Salmonella-tomato interactions; the roles of novel types of signal interactions in Medicago-Rhizobium symbiosis; and promoting health of coral-associated microbial communities. In Florida, addressing these three questions is important as they represent pressing needs of the state, in which marine ecosystems are critical for tourism and fisheries; vegetable production has been affected by outbreas of foodborne illness and pasture-based beef production requires wise investment of resources into forages. We anticipate that upon completion of this work, safer crop production practices will be identified, opportunities to improve health of marine ecosystems will be defined and the ability of forage legumes (such as alfalfa and medics) to form more efficient symbioses will be described. In process, at least two cohorts of post-doctoral scientists will be better prepared for independt careers, graduate and undergraduate students will gain valuable research experience."

Sweet sorghum is currently being evaluated as a biomass feedstock for bio-fuel and other bio-products. Thesecrops fit well in the semi-tropical, humid environment of south-central Louisiana. Sugarcane variety developmenthas been relegated to governmental agencies, including the LSU AgCenter. The Bayou Teche region has unique soils and production environments that require screening of experimental sugarcane clones for local adaptation. Upon assignment of permanent numercial designations in year six of the breeding program, experimental clones will be evaluated in the region using both hand-harvested and combine-harvested nurseries. Successful clones will be advanced to the final yield trials and ultimately released to the industry. The fallow period between crops in the sugarcane production cycle is longwhich subjects soil in those fields to erosion for about a year. Occupation of this fallow period with legume cover cropswould protect against sediment removal, provide nitrogen for the subsequent plant-cane cropand allow the use of grass herbicides to controlimportant grass weeds of sugarcane. Both sunn hemp and ironclay cowpea will be evaluated for suitability as cover crops, with emphasis for effects on sugarcane yield and the possibility of N fertilizer credits. Sugarcane residue remaining after combine harvesting is typically burned on the ground to prevent lower yields in the subsequent ratoon crop. While the yearly effects on crop production have been well quantified, the long-term effects of post-harvest residue managementon sugarcane production and nutrient cycling have not received the same amount of attention. A study, in place since 1997 andcurrently in crop cycle number five, is designed to measure the temporal changes in the soil andcrops of the cycle. The environmentally responsible approach to reduce non-point source of pollution in sugarcane production is to eliminate burning in favor of the development of management practices that retainresidue for sediment control and soil organic matter maintenance. Sugarcane loses about 1,362grams of sucrose per ton of sugarcane biomass for each 454grams of vegetative and soil material present during processing, but such interference in sugar recovery is not completely known for sweet sorghum processing. A project will measure the influence of difference components of the vegetative materials (stalks, leaves and panicles) of sweet sorghum on the amount and proportionality of sugarsplant juice (sucrose, fructose and glucose). This information on sugar profile may be important for the production of biofuel products other than ethanol orfor the need of a particular ethanol quality standard."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial ôrhizobacteriaö, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or ôgapsö, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments. Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics.  Approach: Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems. Hypothesis: Dry bean genotypes interact with tillage management to affect yield performance under drought conditions.  Eight pinto bean genotypes with varying drought tolerance will be tested in a field previously sown to wheat. A split, split block with four replications with irrigation level the main plot, tillage level the split plot, and genotypes the split, split plot will be used. Irrigation will be manipulated to impose a terminal drought stress. Conventional tillage and strip tillage will treatments will both include use of a nonselective herbicide. Variables will include plant biomass, soil compaction, soil moisture, measures of plant stress and various yield components.    Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments.   Hypothesis a) Timing of herbicide application when available soil moisture and likelihood of precipitation is greater impacts weed control in chickpea.  Four herbicides will be tested at three application timings; 4 and 2 weeks prior to seeding chickpea, and post-plant, preemergence. Herbicide treatments will be replicated in a randomized complete block. Soil moisture will be monitored gravimetrically for 4 weeks after each application. Weed control and chickpea tolerance will be determined by taking weed counts and visual control ratings at 3 and 6 weeks after planting (WAP) and crop stand counts at 4 WAP, and chickpea seed yield.  Hypothesis b) Roller-packing impacts performance of pre-emergence herbicides in chickpea in dry soil conditions.  Four herbicide combinations applied post-plant, pre-emergence will be tested in chickpea with and without roller-packing. Experiments will be designed as a split block with herbicide as the main treatment and roller packer as the split treatment and each treatment replicated four times. Half of each plot will be roller-packed immediately after herbicide applications. Weed control and chickpea injury will be evaluated and visually compared to a non-treated check. Analysis of variance will be used to statistically separate treatment effects in all experiments.   Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Hypothesis: Rhizobacteria strains, soilborne pathogens and cultivar class significantly impact biological nitrogen fixation and yields of pea and chickpea genotypes.  The interactions between the root rot pathogen Fusarium solani, commercial rhizobacteria inoculants, and foliar applications of phosphorous acid, on nitrogen fixation and rhizobial colonization of the most popular dry pea cultivars grown in Washington and Idaho will be assessed in field and greenhouse trials. Plants will be evaluated for elemental content, plant height, dry shoot/root weight, root disease severity, nodulation and yield."

Approach: Oilseed press cakes and pulse crops are two potentially valuable sources of functional food ingredients and biobased products from plant seed tissues which have not been fully exploited. New processing methods are critically needed in order to (1) identify new applications for currently low-value oilseed press cakes such as pennycress, coriander, and camelina, and (2) provide functional food ingredients from pulse crops in a form that facilitates incorporation into various food products while minimizing negative characteristics. In coordination with collaborating projects, pulse and press cake feedstocks will be obtained and their protein, starch, and fiber components separated by milling, extraction, or treatment with chemicals or enzymes. Thermo-mechanical processes such as steam jet cooking, steam explosion, and extrusion will be investigated as methods to separate, modify, or combine isolated components or remove undesirable components. Functional characteristics such as texture, particle size, microstructure, solubility, compatibility, and organoleptic properties will be determined and suitability for specific food and industrial applications will be investigated. The performance of prototype industrial products will be evaluated and the most efficient methods for the isolation of functional components determined. Anticipated biobased products include gums, adhesives, lubricants, thickeners, fibers, composite fillers, and coatings. Pulse fractions enriched in specific functional or nutritious ingredients will be incorporated into food formulations and evaluated for consumer acceptability. Successful utilization of these feedstocks will enhance the economic viability of the respective crops for farmers and thus provide agronomic benefits such as nitrogen fixation by legume crops and off-season cover crop benefits for oilseed producers."

Objective 2: Enable new, commercial functional foods from high protein–based waste materials (nuts, legumes, rice, fish).  2.1: Analyze nutrient content of processed farm waste (soybean, peanut, rice and salmon) for functional properties and nutritional quality of protein fraction.  2.2: Formulate and test high protein gluten free health promoting products for consumer acceptability.   Objective 3: Enable value-added commercial applications of nanofibers from specialty crop waste materials to deliver bioactives in new functional foods.   Objective 4: Increase the utilization of post-harvest waste materials by identifying and removing astringent and mineral components that detract from taste, quality, nutritional value and consumer acceptance.  Approach: Objective 1: Determine if processed food wastes or their components from regional fruit and vegetable food processing have health promoting properties by using animal models of obesity and related metabolic diseases to evaluate bioactivity. Animal models are necessary since many bioactive compounds are not absorbed directly but are mediated by gut bacteria. Some waste materials may require fractionation, for example seeds from peels, in order to concentrate bioactive components to a useful level. Bioavailability and bioactivity of more bioactive compounds such as polyphenolics and plant sterols may be increased by removing and modifying dietary fibers that block accessibility to enzymes and gut bacteria. Bioactive food wastes such as mushrooms with high vitamin D content will be processed into films or coatings.   Objective 2: Develop new healthy and flavorful foods from high protein waste materials. Processing wastes from soybeans, peanuts, rice and salmon will be analyzed for protein composition and food related physico-chemical properties. The waste materials will be formulated into foods to increase protein content and improve protein quality. Waste ingredients are often high in insoluble fibers that reduce functionality and may require fractionation from fiber to improve useful properties.    Objective 3: Develop blow spinning technology to efficiently produce natural nanofibers for controlled release applications and evaluate potential pulmonary toxicity effects of nanofibers in mice after intratracheal instillation of nanofibers. Using blow spinning processes nanofibers will be created from food ingredients such as gelatin, chitosan, and fruit and vegetable pomaces (grape, carrot, tomato and olive) in order to eliminate or reduce potential inhalation inflammation or toxicity. Although the nanofibers will be used for encapsulation of bioactive compounds for oral delivery the potential for inhalation during process requires toxicity testing. The ingredients as well as the nanofibers will be evaluated for inflammation and toxicity in a mouse model to determine degree and persistence of inflammation or toxicity if any. Ingredients that are most biocompatible will be used in subsequent studies.  Objective 4: Develop strategies to mitigate astringency in post-harvest materials in order to increase their utilization.  Tannins and minerals contribute to astringency and the identification and characterization of these components is essential. Total and free mineral contents in waste materials (nut shells, hulls, pits, pomaces, skins and seeds from stone fruits, nuts, and persimmons) will be measured using microwave-induced plasma atomic emission spectrometry following microwave-assisted digestion or leaching.  Tannin levels in the same materials will be measured using total soluble phenolic, potassium iodate (hydrolysable tannin), and vanillin (condensed tannin) assays.  The metal (Zn, Cu, Fe) and protein binding properties of waste material tannins will be measured and compared to the properties of commercially available tannins."

Observe x-ray images for differences between potato classes and develop detection algorithms. 1B: Design, build, and test x-ray based irradiation units was alternatives to traditional gamma based units using two technologies: traditional x-ray tubes and a higher power prototype x-ray emitter system.   2A: Extract aroma compounds from grapes and olives using GC. Identify precursors and study flavor variation in plant varieties. Have judges evaluate ability to detect odor from each compound’s effluent from a GC column, with compounds detected in the most dilute sample considered to be impact aroma compounds. Identify acquired capillary GC-MS spectra using established libraries to identify food constituents. Quantify food constituents by GC-MS by comparing the areas of characteristic mass fragment ions of the compounds with that of 2-undecanone (m/z 170). Calculate odor activity values by dividing the determined concentrations by their odor thresholds. For confirmation, compare synthetic blends of identified odorants with those of the original raw and processed products using sensory panels.  2B: Extract homogenates from processed and unprocessed food components and analyze using an HPLC-diode array detector.

As a result, the Consortium to AlleviatePTSD (CAP) was formed to a) significantly advance treatment strategies for PTSDincluding interventions for early, chronic, and latent onset cases, and b) to identify andconfirm clinically relevant biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of PTSDand co-occurring disorders. This project aims to fill gaps identified in the NRAP byexamining the validity of genetic-based biomarkers to identify PTSD, PTSD course, andresponse to PTSD treatment. We plan to leverage extensive existing resources in theSTRONG STAR Repository to examine a comprehensive set of genetic and epigeneticmarkers associated with PTSD. These resources include: (1) a collection of humanpostmortem tissue of PTSD (n=30) and matched control (n=60) brains; (2) a cohort ofservice members treated for PTSD with blood collected prior to treatment and at 6months post-treatment (n=600); and (3) an epidemiologic cohort of Soldiers assessedprior to and after deployment in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedomand New Dawn that included blood collection and PTSD assessment at eachassessment (n=4,112). Using a combination of whole-genome microarray andsequencing approaches, we will: (1) identify genetic (SNP, mRNA) or epigenetic (DNAmethylation, microRNA) alterations in PTSD; (2) characterize the neuronal morphologyof selected brain regions in PTSD and matched controls through Golgi impregnation; (3)identify top gene regulatory networks among the identified set of genes across thesamples to guide biomarker analyses; and (4) systematically identify, validate, and testbiomarkers based on the mRNA, SNPs, DNA methylation, and microRNA markers ofidentified genes. We have assembled a collaborative team of scientists consisting of agenetic epidemiologist (Dr. Williamson), a psychiatric geneticist (Dr. Gelernter), ageneticist (Dr. Carless), a neuroanatomist (Dr. Selemon), human postmortem experts(Drs. Young, Kleinman, Hyde, Thompson, & Cruz), biostatisticians (Drs. Mintz, Gelfond,Michelek, & Jaffe), and a clinical psychologist (Dr. Litz). In addition, we propose tocollaborate with the DoD Integrated Systems Biology group (Drs. Jett & Hammamieh) toleverage SysBioCube in order to gain a systems level perspective of our “-omics” datathat will in turn guide our biomarker discovery work. It is expected that this project will bean important first step in filling the genomic and biomarker gaps in PTSD identified bythe NRAP and facilitate the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarker panelsto aid in the detection, treatment, and prevention of PTSD."

A methodology called mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for the imaging of chemical distributions, but standard MSI platforms lack the spatial resolution needed to examine the chemical exchange between microbes in microbiome contexts, e.g. the scale of single bacterial cells or groups of cells. The HSR-MSI platform and accompanying protocols the researchers develop will provide a critical new tool for advancing our understanding of the basic biological and chemical mechanisms that govern microbiome function, namely the exchange of metabolites at the scale of single microbes in situ. As such, the project directly addresses the critical gap in tools available to identify the metabolic activities specific to particular microbes within a microbiome, and seeks to facilitate the elucidation of biochemical communication between microbes, and between microbes and their hosts. The researchers are well-equipped to undertake the proposed activities since 1) they have direct access to a dedicated high-resolution mass spectrometer for long-term experimentation and 2) they have training that spans the disciplines of microbiology, mass spectrometry (including MSI), and ecology. The integrated HSR-MSI system and protocols that they develop will be readily implementable in any facility with a comparable high-resolution mass spectrometer. To facilitate this goal, their efforts will utilize components with minimal hardware modifications and lead to a set of easily implementable protocols for standardized sample preparation. Doing so ensures that their advances can be rapidly adopted by the broader scientific community engaged in microbiome research. One postdoctoral fellow will gain interdisciplinary training in microbiome analysis and innovative MSI techniques. Starting in the fall of 2016, the researchers will partner with the UC Berkeley Biology Scholars Program (BSP), which works to make scientific careers accessible to students from diverse backgrounds. Over the past 20 years, there have been ~2000 BSP graduates; and 80% are from low-income backgrounds and/or are the first in their family to attend college. This fall, the BSP is piloting a new initiative called the Program for Early Researchers, which provides stipends, travel funds, and a limited research budget to enable URM undergraduates to become involved in research for the first time. The investigators will recruit at least two URM undergraduate students each year, for the two-year funding period. These students will be immersed in cutting-edge microbiome research while working closely with the postdoctoral scholar whose primary research activities are outlined in this application. Additionally, the PI will serve as a pro-active mentor to these students throughout the academic year, and continue to engage with them as they consider and apply for graduate schools.This project seeks to develop a widely accessible version of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) with spatial resolution sufficient to visualize chemicals originating from single bacterial cells, and a set of companion protocols for robust chemical imaging of microbiomes. In support of the first goal, the researchers will optimize the performance of a newly developed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) source. This source uses enhanced laser optics and ion funnel technology to dramatically boost instrument sensitivity. The researchers will systematically optimize the laser, vacuum, sample voltage, ion funnel, and other parameters to obtain the maximum spatial resolution achievable with this source, which is theoretically capable of detecting chemicals made by single bacterial cells. In support of the second goal, the researchers will develop a standardized set of protocols that facilitate both the identification of individual bacterial cells via microscopy, and optimized application of MALDI sample matrix that insures high-quality, reproducible results with high-spatial-resolution (HSR) MSI. As a test plant/microbiome system, the researchers will use legume root nodules that contain a relatively simple bacterial community, which includes multiple members with specialized metabolisms. This system is ideal in that it represents a tractable model microbiome for study with HSR-MSI, is chemically complex, and is of agricultural importance."

In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into the parent ion and its fragment ions and their masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph provides additional structural identification power by separating mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. It also provides training opportunities to a large number of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students as well as high school students through a variety of internship programs, such as the STEM-to-Store Academy and Sooner Upward Bound.The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) analyzing chemical and biochemical species in single cells; (b) studying changes to the biomolecules inside of single plant root hair cells in response to environmental stresses; (c) mapping the spatial distribution of molecules in biological tissues; (d) studying the spatial distribution of metabolites of grass stems to investigate cell wall development; (e) characterizing the proteomics of regulatory networks controlling legume nodulation such as detecting the transcription factor binding partner networks involved in nodulation; (f) analyzing the metabolites of plant stem cell wall synthesis and regulation; (g) analyzing the proteomics of fungal secretomes for biomass degrading enzymes and (h) quantifying the diversity of the fungal natural product chemosphere."

At the cellular level, plant growth involves two distinct processes, cell division, which produces new cells, and cell expansion, which increases the size of the cells.  During division, the cell doubles its DNA content and subsequently the cell divides to form two cells, a process known as the mitotic cell cycle.  During the cell expansion phase of growth, many plant cells continue a modified version of the cell cycle, in which the DNA content doubles but the cell does not divide.  Examples of economically important cell types that double their DNA without division include cereal endosperm, cotton fibers, and nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodules in legumes.  In addition, this process plays important roles in cell differentiation, and is essential for nitrogen fixation in legume root nodules, but the detailed mechanism of this modified cell cycle remains poorly understood.  A protein (known as SIM) has been identified that functions as an inhibitor of cell division, but allows DNA replication.  The goal of this project is to understand how SIM regulates the balance between division and DNA replication during plant growth.  The project will also play a role in the education of graduate students and undergraduates from diverse backgrounds, will test the effectiveness of the film as a classroom teaching tool, both in learning course content, and on student attitudes towards science, and will train undergraduates in mathematical modeling for the biological sciences.The SIAMESE (SIM) gene encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that blocks mitosis without blocking DNA replication.  Although SIM is clearly plays a key role in the transition from mitotic growth to endoreplication, the control of the G2/M transition in plants is complex, and many questions remain about how endoreplication is established, and the role of SIM and related proteins in this process.  The proposed work will use a combination of molecular genetic manipulations, live cell imaging and mathematical modeling to test specific hypotheses about the role of SIM and the related SMR proteins in the mitosis/endocycle transition.  The Specific Objectives of this proposal are to answer the following questions: Can a combination of mathematical modeling, genetic and cell biological experiments be used to create a coherent model of inhibition of G2/M during the transition to endocycles? How is degradation of SIM protein regulated?  Do SIM or other SMRs play a role in controlling progression through G2 during the regular mitotic cycle?"

This community of symbiotic bacteria, known as the microbiome, lives inside their host's cells and tissues and is passed directly from mother to offspring. These bacteria often benefit their hosts, for example, by producing required nutrients missing from the diet. But symbionts also can undergo genetic changes detrimental to hosts. This project addresses whether and how detrimental evolution of symbionts affects their host insects. The focus here is on one such group, aphids, which attack most of our agricultural crops and require symbiotic bacteria in order to grow and reproduce. The research will be used as a basis for teaching basic biology and genetics to University of Texas undergraduate students, including participants in a large freshman research program. Also, the results will further understanding of a significant group of agricultural pests, potentially contributing to the development of new methods of crop protection.The experiments address how genetic variation of pea aphids affects their ability to regulate symbiotic bacteria and how genetic variation of the symbiotic bacteria affects their own multiplication within aphid hosts. The researchers measure how variation in symbiont regulation affects aphid growth and reproduction. Experimental genetic crosses of aphids that vary in levels of symbiotic bacteria will be combined with modern DNA sequencing methods to identify the parts of the aphid genome that affect symbiont numbers. In addition, symbiont strains will be transferred between aphid hosts using microinjection, to determine how different symbiont strains affect hosts."

The relationship between these two very different types of organisms is called symbiotic because both partners benefit from the association. The plant converts sunlight and carbon dioxide into sugars and other organic compounds that are supplied to the microbes in the roots. The microbes provide phosphate and nitrogen to the plant in forms that the plant can readily ingest. These symbiotic associations permit the growth of some crops without added fertilizer. For example, plants are unable to convert gaseous nitrogen in the atmosphere into a reduced form that can be incorporated into the proteins, vitamins and other critical biomolecules that allow them to germinate, develop and grow. Certain crops, such as the legumes (e.g., beans, peas and alfalfa) harbor nitrogen-converting bacteria within specialized structures in their roots that provide this reduced nitrogen to the plant. Most crops do not have these bacteria and must rely on the application of nitrogen fertilizer for optimal growth. This project seeks to obtain a molecular understanding of this symbiotic association between plant and microbes, with a long-term goal of enabling such an association in non-leguminous crops like corn and wheat, which currently require extensive fertilization to sustain crop yield.  A broader impact of this project is a summer Plant Proteomics Workshop, which provides training in proteomic and genomic profiling to the entire plant research community.Part 2: Technical abstractThis project seeks to profile the early molecular events in the recognition of and response to symbiotic microbes (nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) by the model legume crop, Medicago truncatula and the model monocot, rice. This approach will enable a comparison at the molecular level of the mechanisms by which these two crop groups recognize their beneficial microbes. The analysis of the shared and distinct chemical and genetic factors in these two systems should provide tools and information to enable the engineering of beneficial associations between cereal crops (e.g., rice, corn, wheat) and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. The specific aims are (1) the identification of host proteins modified by phosphorylation, acetylation or ubiquitinylation in first hour following signal reception, and validation of potentially active candidates from this and from the previous project award period, (2) the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic responses into networks that can be compared in the two species, using informatics and computational modeling, and (3) a high-throughput screen for symbiosis factors using a newly developed chemical genomics chip system. This project will expand a Plant Proteomics Workshop for training in the latest large-scale proteomic and genomic profiling technologies."

Torrefied/carbonized agricultural waste, as a platform technology, has many commercial applications ranging from water filtration and environmental remediation to advanced biocomposites. Each year agricultural waste, that has little to no nutritional value, is tilled under or burned in open-fields to dispose of waste vegetation before the next growing season. The burning of agricultural waste can add nutrients back into the nutrient depleted soil after a long growing season however this practice creates undesirable pollution. Through the use of microwave heated on-site torrefaction (a thermal process that converts the biomass into a coal-like substance having better fuel characteristics than the original biomass), the once unwanted waste can be used in value-added applications such as soil remediation, water filtration, and advanced biocomposites while alleviating the pollution created from open-field burning. Any of the unused torrefied biomass at the torrefaction site can be sold for profit with lower shipping costs than untreated biomass due to the densification that occurs during the torrefaction. If brought to commercialization this technology would have a broad impact on the agricultural, construction, automotive, and plastics markets, while alleviating pollution due to open field burning of agricultural waste and bring increased utilization of biomass that helps emerging biomass suppliers enter new markets.This I-Corps project is looking at the commercialization of on-site or integrated torrefaction of agricultural waste using microwave energy for use in environmental remediation, soil amendment, and advanced biocomposite applications. Torrefaction is a process similar to the roasting of coffee beans and is a well-known process used to produce alternative energy. The solid by-product of torrefaction, biochar, has many uses from energy production to soil amendments. However, the transportation of biochar in large quantities has proven to have several risks associated with it including spontaneous combustion. On-site torrefaction allows for the production of biochar  where it will be used, thus eliminating explosion, fire, and health hazards associated with the transport of large quantities. The implementation of on-site torrefaction for agriculture also eliminates the smoke pollution created from open-field burning, while still allowing for the utilization of biochar as soil amendments to return much needed nutrients back to fields. The current torrefaction technology is too large and cumbersome to warrant mobile torrefaction units that are easily moved from one site to another. This project looks to microwave technology to scale down the size of mobile torrefaction units making them more feasible to take from job site to job site."

While much is known about the properties of invasive plants and animals, much less is known about the beneficial microbes (microscopic organisms) that accompany introduced species. Rhizobia are beneficial bacteria that inhabit leguminous plant root tissue where they convert nitrogen from the atmosphere to a plant-available form. Leguminous plants provide these microbes with sugars from photosynthesis. Legumes that disperse to habitats that lack these bacteria are typically unable to persist, however the bacteria can also spread through the soil or air. The aim of this research is to examine whether invasions change the nature of a mutualistic interaction.  The investigators will study specialization and the evolution of cooperation in both natural and experimentally staged invasions for two plant species and their beneficial microbes. While this question has been addressed in aboveground systems, this is one of the first to utilize a belowground plant mutualism. This project will promote diversity in the sciences, provide research training and education in the biology of plant-microbe interactions, and inform efforts to control invasive plants. Diverse undergraduate students from Florida International University will participate in summer research at University of California at Riverside and Michigan State University. An educational module will also be developed on rhizobium-legume interactions in neighborhood soils, to be distributed to school children via MSU's Kellogg Biological Station Bioenergy Sustainability Program and the Fairchild Challenge, an environmental education program that reaches over 100,000 children a year in Miami.To understand whether mutualisms become less beneficial in the process of species invasions, this project will test the hypothesized trade-off between partner breadth and mutualism benefit across legume and rhizobium genotypes from the native and invasive range for two Medicago species. Medicago is the genus that includes alfalfa. Both species are native to Europe and invasive in the US. The researchers will 1) compare genetic diversity in native vs. invaded host range mutualists, using high marker density genotyping for hosts and whole-genome sequencing for symbionts, 2) assess divergence in mutualism properties between the native and invaded range to test hypotheses of reduced specialization, partner choice and mutualism dependence in invaded range mutualists using cross-inoculation trials, 3) test the impact of invasion on symbiont genome dynamics and mutualisms by simulated symbiont invasions in soil mesocosms under contrasting host density and diversity, and 4) identify the molecular underpinnings of mutualism specialization using a transcriptomic approach to nominate host-symbiont pathways. This research will shed light on the long-standing question of whether beneficial microbes face a trade-off between having a broad partner range and providing a high degree of benefit to a partner."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan and also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Alice MacQueen is  Genomics of yield variation and physiology of genotype-by-environment interactions in common bean.  The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Texas at Austin and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Tom Juenger.Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is the most consumed source of plant protein worldwide and is a particularly important source of protein in the developing world. A question of pressing importance is how important crop traits, such as protein or yield, were influenced by interaction of genes with the environment, so called GXE interactions. Common bean was domesticated to grow in a wide variety of environments and is thus an excellent candidate to explore how crop traits are determined by GXE interactions. An extensive dataset of over 500 common bean varieties grown at 36 locations across the United States over 34 years links bean traits in different environments. This research project leverages these historical datasets and will document genetic variation in common bean, thus providing an exciting opportunity to connect the traits to their genetic drivers. Undergraduate students will be trained in cutting edge genomic analysis and the public will learn about plant genomics through outreach activities with the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.This project combines experiments and computational analyses to determine the interactions of GXE on yield variation and other traits of common bean. New association mapping populations will be produced, and these will be directly connected to historically robust datasets containing phenotype and yield data for common bean. The genetics of yield variation will be determined through genome-wide association approaches, both for regions with genomic variation between varieties and genomic regions fixed by local adaptation between bean races. The project will test for differential expression and physiology between varieties with and without GxE in response to specific climate drivers."

While most crops rely on nitrogen fertilizer, much of it chemically synthesized, legumes have the remarkable ability to provide their own nitrogen nutrition by entering a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, converting otherwise inert nitrogen gas in the air into ammonia. Because synthesizing chemical nitrogen fertilizers consumes massive amounts of fossil fuel and fertilizer runoff causes environmental degradation, harnessing the full potential of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis can contribute to a sustainable future. This project aims to understand at the molecular level how legumes have the capacity, absent in other crops, to engage nitrogen-fixing bacteria in a productive symbiosis. It will identify the function of key plant genes necessary to allow the bacteria to work in concert with the host. Discovering the mechanism of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis will have broad beneficial impacts on the society, which will be communicated at multiple levels to a scientifically literate public. Plants and animals engage in complex and elaborate interactions with microbial partners, some detrimental and others beneficial to the host. During the symbiosis between legume and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, individual bacteria are ingested by the host and converted to membrane-bound nitrogen-fixing organelles. Recent advances in the field showed that this intracellular compartment is sustained by a specialized protein secretory system from the host, which delivers key proteins to modulate the host- microbe interface. This research project centers on understanding the mechanisms by which host secretory proteins interact with the microbe to ensure the survival of the bacteria during the intracellular stage of the symbiosis. The findings will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular dialog between hosts and their microbial partners."

This research will determine the number of origins of selenium hyperaccumulation in milkvetch species by reconstructing the group's evolutionary history using DNA sequence data. The project will also sequence genes thought to be involved in selenium hyperaccumulation to determine if they have been subject to natural selection. This research will provide one graduate student and undergraduates with training in molecular, chemical, and bioinformatics techniques and will also supply molecular resources for population genetic studies of poorly known North American Astragalus species.Twenty-five Neo-Astragalus species from two traditional taxonomic groups have been identified as selenium hyperaccumulators; however, it is not known if these groups are monophyletic. The researchers will sample these selenium hyperaccumulators and other species from across the clade and reconstruct a phylogeny using a target-enrichment approach for sequencing low-copy nuclear loci in order to infer the number of times selenium hyperaccumulation has evolved. Analytical chemistry methods will be used to survey selenium accumulation in relevant species, and phylogenetic ancestral state reconstruction will be used to characterize the number of origins of selenium hyperaccumulation from the resulting phylogeny. This approach can quantify the relative contribution of ecologically driven speciation and allopatric speciation in light of the number of origins of the cryptic trait, their phylogenetic position, and geographic ranges of the different species."

When cowpea is combined with starchy grains such as corn, sorghum or rice, the result is a complete source of major nutrients for energy and growth. It also provides protein-rich leaves and is used for animal feed.  Cowpea is the primary source of protein for people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where it is presently produced on over 20 million acres mainly by farmers with small land holdings. Its popularity is also due to its resilience to low rainfall and heat while also enriching the soil. Despite its relevance to food security in Africa and elsewhere, there has been relatively little basic research on cowpea. Advances in next generation sequencing technology have made it possible to  read  the genetic material of cowpea and decipher the instructions (genes and genetic variation) that ultimately provide for crop improvement.  Producing an optimized reference genome sequence for cowpea is one of the main goals of this project, a feat that has been accomplished for human, mouse, cow and economically important crop plants such as corn, soybean, rice, bean and poplar. A broader purpose is to provide genetic resources to improve decision-making abilities within an existing network of African cowpea breeders. Breeders develop new varieties by making crosses between parents that carry favorable traits and selecting progeny containing favorable characteristics of both parents. This project will provide new materials for progeny selection in addition to knowledge that will facilitate the development of new cowpea varieties for increased food production. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is in the family Fabaceae, tribe Phaseoleae which includes other warm season legumes such as soybean, common bean and pigeon pea, as well as Vigna species adzuki bean and mung bean. Cowpea is diploid with 2n=22 chromosomes and a genome size of 620 Mb. Unlike other legumes, cowpea lacks a published reference genome. A highly fragmented draft genome sequence assembly has been available from previous work since 2011 (harvest-blast.org; harvest-web.org) and is derived from 60x short-reads combined with BAC-end and gene survey Sanger sequences. This project will elevate the sequence of cowpea to state-of-the art by: (1) adding long-read sequences and an optical map; (2) anchoring contigs to a recently developed genetic map containing 37,372 SNPs; and (3) improving browser access for the broader legume community. This will enable deeper utilization of cowpea germplasm for gene discovery and marker development, while providing a stronger foundation for the cowpea genetics and breeding community. Genetic intercrosses will be conducted to produce new pre-breeding lines that will theoretically carry optimal combinations of traits present within elite lines using a recently developed multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population based on eight parental lines. Marker-trait information, in the context of the genome sequence and haplotypes, will be disseminated for broad adoption of marker-informed breeding. This work is tightly linked to leading breeding programs in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria and Senegal through USAID Feed the Future and CGIAR Tropical Legumes projects."

The cells in the edible parts of corn, beans, rice, wheat, and peas undergo a specialized process called endoreduplication where the cells replicate their DNA many times. Although individual cells undergo different amounts of endoreduplication, the proportion of cells remains constant from plant to plant. When geneticists try to increase endoreduplication, they find that the response of seemingly identical cells is somewhat random: some cells respond strongly, some moderately, and some not at all. This observation raises one of the biggest questions in developmental biology: how do identical cells make different decisions? The proposed research will investigate the counterintuitive hypothesis that individual plant cells make these decisions about how much to endoreduplicate utilizing small, random molecular differences. This hypothesis is surprising: biologists would normally expect randomness to be suppressed, since development is highly reproducible, always creating the same proportion of endoreduplicated cells. Instead, randomness may in fact be required to produce this regular portion of endoreduplicated cells. Testing this hypothesis will require advanced use of computers to examine individual cells over time. University students and middle school girls will simultaneously be involved in this analysis as well as being trained in computational skills.Endoreduplicating cells of crop plants are buried deep within the seed coat where they are experimentally inaccessible. Endoreduplication will thus be studied in Arabidopsis thaliana sepals, whose epidermal cells are accessible for live imaging as they endoreduplicate. The transcription factor Arabidopsis thaliana MERISTEM LAYER1 (ATML1) drives sepal endoreduplication, and may cause it to occur randomly. Since ATML1 is expressed in all epidermal cells, it is unclear how ATML1 causes only a few cells to endoreduplicate. Preliminary data show that ATML1 triggers endoreduplication in a dosage-dependent manner: high ATML1 makes all epidermal cells endoreduplicate, low ATML1 prevents any endoreduplication, and individual sepal cells have varying levels of ATML1. The hypothesis tested here is that randomly fluctuating ATML1 causes different levels of endoreduplication in different cells; a few cells exceed ATML1's threshold, triggering endoreduplication, while other cells remain below the threshold and do not endoreduplicate. In Aim 1, we will determine whether ATML1 fluctuations initiate endoreduplication. The associated education goal will be to work with undergraduate students to analyze images generated in this aim. For Aim 2, we will determine whether ATML1 feedback loops drive endoreduplication by amplifying differences in ATML1 expression and, in an associated educational aim, students will write and publish a computational modeling glossary to better understand the newly generated models. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine the molecular mechanism through which ATML1 induces endoreduplication in a dosage-dependent manner. We will also develop an outreach to middle school students for the analysis of images from Aim 3 in a hands-on, web-based image analysis workshop."

Many of these areas have very poor soils that are low in nutrients for plants, like nitrogen and phosphorus, but the growth of the grasses is often higher than expected. A key process in maintaining unexpectedly high grass growth is called nitrogen fixation, where plants acquire their nitrogen from the air. In previous work in Serengeti National Park in east Africa, it was discovered that grass roots, like more familiar legumes or members of the bean family, host abundant, active bacteria that can fix large amounts of nitrogen. The result is a complex web of various nitrogen-fixing bacteria, other associated soil microbes, the host grasses, and a diversity of grazing animals. This project builds on a long history of ecological research in Serengeti National Park and will explore how grazing, rainfall and the availability of other soil nutrients combine to affect nitrogen fixation. The work will also explore if mycorrhizal fungi, which also live in association with grass roots and benefit plants in other ways, compete with nitrogen-fixing bacteria for sugars and other forms of carbon supplied by their host plants and thus reduce bacterial nitrogen-fixation. Nitrogen limits productivity and ecosystem services in most terrestrial ecosystems, and nitrogen-fixation by bacteria associated with grass roots may prove to be the most important source of nitrogen and driver of productivity, ecosystem services, and rural human livelihoods in many tropical and subtropical grasslands and savannas. The results will be used in an ongoing collaboration with The Nature Conservancy and other non-government organizations to help more than 40 local human communities in Tanzania and Kenya adopt new livestock and fire management practices that sequester soil carbon, improve sustainable livestock production, and potentially generate the sale of carbon credits on voluntary markets. This project will also employ and train undergraduate and graduate students through summer field courses and participation in the research.This project will explore, for the first time, the key interactions among grazing animals, plants, and beneficial soil microbes centered on nitrogen fixation. It has four parts: (1) to determine the occurrence and magnitude of nitrogen fixation by many different grass species across a range of soil, grazing, and rainfall conditions, (2) to conduct experiments that will test if grazing and water, nitrogen, and phosphorus affect nitrogen-fixation by grasses differently than legumes under the same conditions, (3) to conduct experiments in large pots where AM fungi and bacteria are controlled to test for competition between these different groups of microbes, and (4) to develop and test a simple computer model that integrates how rainfall, grazing, competition with mycorrhizal fungi, or nutrient limitation interact to control nitrogen-fixation and grass productivity. This new modeling will show how the abundance of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and beneficial fungi changes the storage of carbon as soil organic matter and leads to the development of herbivore-plant-mutualist webs that ultimately produce the key carbon inputs of above- and belowground plant litter, dung, and AM fungal hyphae to soil organic carbon. These model outcomes will be linked with recently validated modeling of soil carbon dynamics in the Serengeti to understand how nitrogen-fixation links to possible soil carbon sequestration and removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere."

The result is differentiated bacteria living inside the cells of a plant organ that allows the bacteria to reproduce and fix nitrogen due to the provision of carbon skeletons and a low oxygen tension by the plant. While transcriptome profiling of whole roots during nodule development has expanded our knowledge of what genes are involved in initiating symbiosis, such experiments are unable to resolve the progression of events at the tissue/cellular level. In order to understand the signaling occurring between these cells in space and time in a coherent manner, it is necessary to analyze the transcriptome of the individual cells at specific points in time, as neighboring cells may have very different transcriptomes. The training components of this grant include training mid-career of the principal investigator (PI) in genomic techniques, training postdoctoral scholars and a graduate student in genomics and informatics through their participation in this research, training graduate students, postdocs and PIs from underserved groups in the summer workshop, and exposing underserved and economically disadvantaged middle school students to science and higher education through field trip lab experiences. Transcriptomes will be measured for each cell type involved in nodule formation at specific time points tied to critical events during the progression of nodule development by use of laser capture microdissection (LCM) followed by RNAseq and a systems biology analysis of the libraries.  The following questions will be addressed: What genes are differentially expressed relative to uninoculated plants in a given cell type at a given time? What genes show conserved patterns of differential expression from uninoculated plants over time within a cell type? Is there a synergistic effect of multiple genes showing small changes in expression but a conserved pattern? Which gene networks contain known nodule regulatory genes and therefore, by association, what do these genes control? What genes are misregulated in autoregulatory mutants at these early time points that allow too many nodules to develop? Applying time series analysis and systems biology tools, datasets will be created that will allow for these and other queries. Understanding gene regulation during the establishment of symbiosis is key to being able to recreate nitrogen-fixing symbioses in other plants, and understanding at the level of individual cells is required to generate a structure similar to a nodule.  The work proposed here will provide information about what genes are being differentially regulated in a specific cell type in the part of the root responding to rhizobia, about what genes are coordinately regulated within a cell type, and combined with published knowledge from mutant analyses, will yield information about which groups of coordinately regulated genes in which tissues are critical to early nodule development. The end result will be a spatiotemporal model greatly expanding our knowledge of nodulation signaling in roots and a data mining resource for the symbiosis community."

Sub-objective 2b: Develop and compare weed management systems in edamame, utilizing cover crops, herbicides, and physical weeding.  Approach: Multi-tactic integrated weed management (IWM) offers one potential approach to address the problem of multiple herbicide resistant (MHR) weeds. In IWM systems, suites of multiple complementary tactics are deployed throughout weed life cycles to increase efficacy of weed suppression, prevent survival of weeds that escape earlier management, and reduce weed populations over the long-term. In this project, we evaluate the utility of chemical, cultural, biological, and physical tactics in IWM systems for weed suppression and crop yield protection in fields with MHR weed populations. Edamame (vegetable soybean) cultivars tolerant to cover crop residues will be combined with cover crops, recently registered herbicides, and physical weeding to examine the potential of IWM in legume vegetable production systems. The contribution of improved knowledge of soil N cycling to aid better prediction of weed seedling emergence and community composition also will be evaluated in this production system. In field crops, interactions among weed seed destruction at crop harvest, cover crops, and tank mixtures of herbicides will be quantified for their impact on MHR weeds in corn and soybean. Finally, in a continuation of previous research, the impact of escaped invasive bioenergy crops on weeds of arable areas will be measured."

Sub-objective 1.A. Correlate genetic markers with phenotypic traits of interest in European corn borer, western corn rootworm and western bean cutworm. Sub-objective 1.B. Determine how larval movement and adult dispersal influence insect resistance to transgenic corn.   Objective 2: For corn agro-ecosystems, determine potential impacts of changing farming practices on the demographics and ecology of pest and non-pest arthropods, such as the monarch butterfly. Sub-objective 2.A. Assess the potential value of neonicotinoid insecticide seed treatments to growers of major row crops under different agronomic conditions. Sub-objective 2.B. Develop strategies for improving monarch butterfly habitat in modern farm landscapes.    Objective 3: Characterize genetic and biochemical responses associated with corn defenses to rootworm and lepidopteran caterpillar pest injury to enhance conventional and transgenic crop protection strategies.  Sub-objective 3.A. Develop genetic markers and genomic tools for western corn rootworm, European corn borer, western bean cutworm, and other pests of corn. Sub-objective 3.B. Characterize genetic regulation of surface lipids on corn silks and assess protective capacity of these lipids on corn earworm feeding.  Approach: Field-resistance in western corn rootworm (WCR) to Cry3Bb1 Bt toxins and in European corn borer (ECB) to Cry1Fa and Cry1Ab toxins will be mapped by using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) protocols and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Pedigrees will be constructed from Bt resistant and susceptible individuals of both species. GBS will be performed by constructing genomic DNA libraries from non-size-selected fragments, to which adapters with a unique barcode are ligated.  A population mapping approach using a high density of SNP markers will be taken to identify loci that differ significantly between E- and Z-race ECB. The premise of population mapping is similar to quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, but SNPs with skewed frequencies between races are assumed to result from either selection for race-specific adaptations or genetic drift facilitated by restricted gene flow. GBS-derived SNP markers will be used to estimate gene flow among WCR populations. The strategy will be to estimate Wright's neighborhood area for WCR, the radius of which constitutes a measure of the typical distance genes move per generation. Dispersal and survival rates of fall armyworm (FAW) will be measured in field plot trials. FAW egg masses will be placed in the whorl of vegetative-stage corn plants surrounded by uninfested plants. Living and dead larvae on plants will be counted periodically using destructive sampling. Planting arrangements will include various combinations of Bt and non-Bt isoline plants.  Flight behavior and capacity of WCR will be characterized and compared across three Cry3Bb1-resistant and two susceptible strains using flight mills to determine the degree to which resistance affects dispersal.  In collaboration with other ARS laboratories and as a NP304 effort, a comprehensive review of the literature will be conducted to provide information on the usefulness of seed treatment with neonicotinoid insecticide in controlling target pests and protecting crops from yield loss.  A series of studies will be conducted related to milkweed species selection (larval performance and oviposition preference), and milkweed plant establishment (determining patch sizes and maximizing sustainability of milkweeds). Initially, studies will focus on four Asclepias species found in Iowa: common milkweed, A. syriaca, swamp milkweed, A. incarnata, butterfly weed, A. tuberosa, and whorled milkweed, A. verticillata. Also, studies will be conducted to determine how to maintain these plants in the landscape while avoiding loss from plant competition. This will require identifying the best companion plants for the targeted milkweed species.  Two sources of corn germplasm will be used to screen for silk activity against corn earworm (CEW). These corn lines and CEW resistant checks will be grown in the field. Emerged silks will be harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, and ground to a powder using a knife mill. One cohort of powdered silks will be used for surface lipid metabolic analysis, while another will be used for CEW bioassays, allowing the metabolomic analysis and CEW feeding studies to be conducted in parallel."

Approach: The project brings together a research team with diverse expertise for multiple approaches to insect management.  The proposed project will focus on control of key insect pests in small farms and urban gardens, both organic and non-organic.  Bio-based integrated pest management approaches to be developed will include: (i) discovery and deployment of natural insect attractants and repellents; (ii) conservation and augmentation of beneficial insects including use of their semiochemicals; (iii) pest-specific microbial controls [bacteria (including Bacillus thuringiensis strains and Chromobacterium spp.) and baculoviruses]; and, (iv) crop genetic resistance using molecular-based gene discovery.  Research will target insect pests that cause major damage to key crops such as cucurbits and cole crops, although other important crops such as small fruit, beans, and potatoes may receive attention for specific problems.

Sub-objective 2B: Study new methods to produce extracts from the yellow mealworm Tenebrio molitor and the house cricket Acheta domesticus and incorporate them into artificial diets for the predators Podisus maculiventris and Coleomegilla maculata. Sub-objective 2C: Evaluate agricultural by-products as sources of food for the production of Tenebrio molitor and Acheta domesticus.  Objective 3: Develop effective biological control strategies for insect pests of crops grown under cover (e.g. high tunnels and greenhouses).  Approach: Climate matching software will be used to determine the most likely locations of natural enemy adapted populations across native ranges of M. cribraria and B. hilaris. The USDA-ARS European Biological Control Laboratory near Montpellier, France, will play a key role regarding parasitoid introductions of B. hilaris from many regions of Asia and Africa. Scientists at the university in Japan will make additional collections across the geographic range of the host within Japan. Scientists at USDA-ARS-IIRU, Newark, DE, will provide his host specificity expertise and make his Asian contacts available for the Kudzu Bug project.  Development of artificial diets for N. viridula will be approached by detailed chemical analyses of plant foods suitable for development and reproduction of N. viridula approximating their nutritional requirements. Artificial diets will be formulated to replicate the concentration and ratios of major nutritional components of broccoli, green lima beans and raw peanuts, which have been used to rear N. viridula. Diets will be compared to natural food sources broccoli, green snow peas, and raw peanuts plus a nutrient supplement previously developed  (unpublished). Rearing conditions other than diet, such as optimal rearing density and adult reproductive curves, will also be studied.  Extracts of T. molitor larvae and pupae and A. domesticus nymphs will be produced by freeze-drying them at -25ºC and by spray drying of homogenized insects. Dry samples will be ground to particles of at least 30 µm. Extracts produced from dried T. molitor pupae will be used to produce artificial diet formulations for C. maculata. The diet formulations will be compared on their suitability to produce quality predators using life table analysis of C. maculata. The formulations will also be compared to a control consisting of natural food. The same procedure will be used for artificial diet formulations for P. maculiventris.  Four different types of agricultural by products will be tested as viable options to formulate diets for T. molitor and A. domesticus. 1) Peanut shells, 2) corn cobs, 3) discarded cabbage, and 4) residual from corn fermentation for ethanol production. Each by-product will be chemically analyzed to determine the content of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate. Diets will be formulated by mixing ingredients with wheat bran at different ratios depending of their nutrient content based on the chemical analyses. Diets will be evaluated by determining and comparing immature survival, development time and the efficiency of food conversion for each of the two species of insects.  Release and evaluation techniques for lady beetles as predators of strawberry will be develop and evaluated. This study will involve (A) testing the effectiveness of augmentative releases of lady beetles to control aphids in high tunnels, (B) testing the predation potential of larvae in the presence of aphid-tending ants in the laboratory and in high tunnels, and (C) testing the assertion that molecules in wax filaments on the cuticle of S. creperus larvae subdue ant aggression."

For example, they can be used to assess whether or not a process deviation results in a one log cycle increase of Clostridium perfringens during cooling of a cooked meat product during commercial processing. Models that predict behavior of pathogens can be integrated with data for pathogen contamination to predict dynamic changes in pathogen prevalence and number in food across unit operations of a production chain. Predictions of consumer exposure can then be used in a dose-response model to form a process risk model that predicts consumer exposure and response to pathogens in food produced by specific scenarios. Process risk models have great potential to improve food safety and public health by providing a better assessment of food safety and identification of risk factors. In the past, we have developed predictive models and process risk models that have proven highly useful in providing regulatory agencies and the food industry with an objective means of assessing food safety and identifying risk factors. The goal of the proposed research is to elevate that successful effort to the next level of sophistication by considering additional variables and developing new and improved models and more effectively transferring this new research to the food industry by providing updated and improved versions of our software products: the Predictive Microbiology Information Portal, ComBase, and the Pathogen Modeling Program.  1: Develop and validate predictive models for behavior of stressed and unstressed pathogens in food with added antimicrobials. This includes development of validated dynamic models for spores and vegetative foodborne pathogens for evaluating heating and cooling process deviations.   2: Develop and validate process risk models for higher risk pathogen and food combinatio  Approach: Effects and interactions of time, temperature, pH, acidulant, water activity, humectant, or preservatives (phosphates, organic acid salts, and nitrite) in meat and poultry products, as well as in rice, beans, and pasta will be assessed to collect kinetic data for pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus).  Kinetic data will be modeled using primary and secondary models.  Predictive models performance will be evaluated using the acceptable prediction zone method.  Once validated and published, predictive models will be incorporated into the Pathogen Modeling Program and data will be archived in ComBase.  Kinetic data for development of predictive microbiology models for survival and growth of pathogens (Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, and Listeria monocytogenes) on higher risk food (tomatoes, lettuce, raw milk, and crab meat) will be obtained in inoculated pack studies.  Pathogens will be enumerated on higher risk food during storage trials using an automated miniature most probable number method.  Kinetic data will be modeled using neural network modeling methods and models will be validated against independent data using the acceptable prediction zone method.  Whole sample enrichment real time polymerase chain reaction (WSE-qPCR) will be used to obtain data for prevalence, number, and types of pathogens on higher risk food.  Predictive microbiology models and contamination data obtained by WSE-qPCR will be integrated to form process risk models that predict consumer exposure and response to pathogens on higher risk food produced by different scenarios.  All new models will be added to both versions of the Pathogen Modeling Program.  A link to ARS, Poultry Food Assess Risk Models website will be provided in the portal.

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial “rhizobacteria”, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or “gaps”, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and f  Approach: Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems. Hypothesis: Dry bean genotypes interact with tillage management to affect yield performance under drought conditions.  Eight pinto bean genotypes with varying drought tolerance will be tested in a field previously sown to wheat. A split, split block with four replications with irrigation level the main plot, tillage level the split plot, and genotypes the split, split plot will be used. Irrigation will be manipulated to impose a terminal drought stress. Conventional tillage and strip tillage will treatments will both include use of a nonselective herbicide. Variables will include plant biomass, soil compaction, soil moisture, measures of plant stress and various yield components.    Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments.   Hypothesis a) Timing of herbicide application when available soil moisture and likelihood of precipitation is greater impacts weed control in chickpea.  Four herbicides will be tested at three application timings; 4 and 2 weeks prior to seeding chickpea, and post-plant, preemergence. Herbicide treatments will be replicated in a randomized complete block. Soil moisture will be monitored gravimetrically for 4 weeks after each application. Weed control and chickpea tolerance will be determined by taking weed counts and visual control ratings at 3 and 6 weeks after planting (WAP) and crop stand counts at 4 WAP, and chickpea seed yield.  Hypothesis b) Roller-packing impacts performance of pre-emergence herbicides in chickpea in dry soil conditions.  Four herbicide combinations applied post-plant, pre-emergence will be tested in chickpea with and without roller-packing. Experiments will be designed as a split block with herbicide as the main treatment and roller packer as the split treatment and each treatment replicated four times. Half of each plot will be roller-packed immediately after herbicide applications. Weed control and chickpea injury will be evaluated and visually compared to a non-treated check. Analysis of variance will be used to statistically separate treatment effects in all experiments.   Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Hypothesis: Rhizobacteria strains, soilborne pathogens and cultivar class significantly impact biological nitrogen fixation and yields of pea and chickpea genotypes.  The interactions between the root rot pathogen Fusarium solani, commercial rhizobacteria inoculants, and foliar applications of phosphorous acid, on nitrogen fixation and rhizobial colonization of the most popular dry pea cultivars grown in Washington and Idaho will be assessed in field and greenhouse trials. Plants will be evaluated for elemental content, plant height, dry shoot/root weight, root disease severity, nodulation and yield."

As of February 2010, the USDA reports that the southeastern US has over 12 million cows that are born and raised on in forage-based production systems, and approximately one-third of the feeder cattle nationally come from states in this region. Cow-calf producers in the US typically market calves at weaning in the fall; however, tremendous economic opportunity exists for these producers to retain ownership after weaning by growing calves to a heavier sale weight on pasture. Developmentof forage?based beef production systems necessitates research to evaluate its potential for growing stocker steers, replacement heifers and/or harvest (market) for forage-finished beef systems.As beef cattle numbers continue to decline in Southeastern states and consumer demand for beef remains high, most economists conservatively forecast a sustained period of rebuilding, and this project is especially relevant within a framework of herd rebuilding. Given the current volatility in concentrate-feed prices that is expected to continue into the future, forages offer options for adding value to calves locally with less expense, lower input volatility, and lower overall dependence on concentrate feedstuffs. For these reasons, research leading to development of sustainable forage systems that reduce dependence on concentrate feedstuffs and throughout the entire beef supply chain is needed.Using accepted field, laboratory and statistical methodologies germane to grazing research, this project will evaluate beef cattle performance and forage management systems based on regionally adapted annual and perennial grass species;evaluate forage systems that incorporate the use of legumes in conjunction with improved grasses on stocker and finishing cattle performance, forage nutrient availability, optimization of fertilizer inputs, and nutrient cycling; evaluate the role of industrial by-products/co-products as supplements for increasing forage utilization of beef cattle grazing pasture or receiving forage-based diets, and their impact on beef cattle production efficiency; andevaluate grazing management strategies for extending the grazing season; e.g., stockpiling forage for deferred grazing."

One nursery corporation alone earns $300 million per year in production that is shipped nationally to retail markets around the country. The greatest financial costs to the industry are plant diseases, insect pests, and a well trained workforce. Producing high quality plants while minimizing production costs is vital for the nursery industry. Part of this goal includes cost effective management and containment of plant pathogens. Cannas are one of the most popular garden plants and a large horticultural industry depends on this plant (Cooke, 2001). In recent years, viral diseases of cannas have spread globally (Malcolm, 2006). Viruses cause streaks/breaks in flower color, while leaves show yellow mottling, striations, and severe discoloration (Figure 1). There are five viruses that infect Canna: Canna yellow mottle virus (CaYMV, genus Badnavirus), Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV, genus Potyvirus), Tomato aspermy virus (TAV, genus Cucumovirus), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV, genus Cucumovirus) and Canna yellow streak virus (CaYSV, genus Potyvirus) (Lockhart, 1988; Fisher et al., 1997; Monger et al., 2007; Hayward, 2008; Pappu and Druffel, 2008; Monger et al., 2010).

The general outcomes of this work is to implement an industry-wide strategy to limit the spread of disease, reduce the impact of viruses on production, and revive an industry that is at the brink."

Although stress tolerant, most tall fescue plants are infected with an endophyte fungus that produces toxins that negatively affect livestock in many ways, often producing a malady termed fescue toxicosis. Recent evidence suggests that tannin-containing legumes when consumed by livestock may help reduce fescue toxicosis problems. This proposed study will investigate the use of the tannin-containing legume sericea lespedeza in forage-livestock systems to determine if this legume can help reduce tall fescue toxicosis and improve pasture productivity. Two experiments will be conducted. One will evaluate sericea in different tall fescue grazing system treatments. The second experiment will compare four tannin-containing legumes planted across three locations in Virginia to determine their overall adpatability to this region of the US. Introduction of tannin-containing legumes to forage-livestock systems could represent a simple, cost effective way to improve animal health and increase overall pasture productivity."

Soil is of critical importance for agroecosystem function, providing a nutrient reserve, moisture retention capacity, and source of microbial communities that help cycle nutrients and make them available to crops. Indeed, due to the key roles soils can play in overall system function, soils are thought by many to be the cornerstone of organic production systems. However, organic vegetable production is challenged by nitrogen (N) limitations that can severely limit yields. Poor nitrogen management, coupled with the intensive tillage that is typically used in organic systems to control weeds, can result in reduced soil function, necessitating research to understanding how management practices affect overall soil health and quality. Cover crops are non-harvested crops planted in rotation with cash crops that have multiple purposes, including soil health improvement, nutrient delivery, and pest control. Many cover crops are legumes, fixing atmospheric nitrogen that is then returned to the soil as a form of N fertilizer once cover crops are terminated and incorporated. Legume cover crops are extraordinary sources of fertility, and if well managed can completely replace external N fertilizer additions in organic systems, while also contributing sufficient C to improve soil organic matter levels. Hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) is one promising legume cover crop for organic producers as it is fairly winter hardy and holds potential for cool northern climates. For this reason, this project emphasizes understanding the capacity of hairy vetch to meet soil quality and fertility goals in agroecosystems. Rhizobia bacteria (Rhizobia leguminosarum), either indigenous to the soil or added at planting, are required for N-fixation to occur in vetch. Results from our lab have shown that in some regions of the U.S., nodules of hairy vetch are more likely to contain native rhizobia strains rather than rhizobia inoculants added at planting, leading us to question the competitive ability and N-fixing potential of background rhizobia typically present in soils. Our laboratory investigates processes that control nitrogen cycling in organic systems, including the activity of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria associated with legume cover crops, and how agricultural management and environmental conditions interact to influence the rate of nitrogen fixation and delivery to the cash crops that depend on that nitrogen."

These programs develop improved common bean varieties to support the growing demand for the crop. Because of the expense and time required to incorporate the new genes necessary for variety improvement, common bean researchers have actively pursued marker-assisted selection. This requires a close collaboration between those collecting phenotypic data with those who perform the genotypic scoring and genetic screening. While SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) are a very abundant marker source and provide a rich source of variation from which markers can be derived, they can be costly and beyond the means of resource limited bean improvement programs in the US and throughout the world. Indel (insertion/deletion) markers, while not as abundant as SNP markers, are a relatively abundant marker class, and importantly a low cost alternative that can be applied to MAS by any breeding program in the world. The objectives of this project are to collect phenotypic data for architectural (growth habit, lodging) and disease resistance (white mold) traits on appropriate mapping populations, identify the location of the gene(s) controlling those traits, and identify indel markers that can be used to map those traits in a common bean improvement program. Given that bean is a member of the billion dollars crops club in the US and North Dakota is the leading bean producer in the US, this researcher will benefit North Dakota citizens by providing producers with varieties tolerant of the a major production constraint with the preferred architectural type."

The European corn borer (ECB) (Ostrinia nubilalis) and western corn rootworm (WCR) (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) account for over $1 billion each in control costs and grain losses annually. Rootworms are particularly problematic because of their propensity to evolve resistance to management tactics, including crop rotation (Gray et al. 2009), insecticides (Meinke et al. 1998), and now Bt toxins (Gassmann et al. 2011, 2014).There are numerous other corn insect pests that cause significant economic loss to U.S. corn producers. The southwestern corn borer (Diatraea grandiosella) causes several million dollars in damage to corn in the Western High Plains (Morrison et al. 1977). Recently, the sugarcane borer (D. saccharalis) has emerged as an important corn pest in the south (Castro et al. 2004, Porter et al. 2005). Significant foliage and ear feeders include the two most important lepidopteran pests of corn in the southeast, corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea) and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) (Buntin et al. 2004). Losses attributed to corn earworm in sweet corn can be as high as 50% (Wiseman 1999). The western bean cutworm (Striacosta albicosta) has recently expanded its range to become an increasingly serious corn pest as far east as Pennsylvania and north into Canada (e.g. Michel et al. 2010). Among underground pests, the northern corn rootworm (NCR) (D. barberi) is a perennial pest in much of the Corn Belt, and the southern corn rootworm (D. undecimpunctata howardi) is occasionally important, especially in the southeast. Many secondary pests, such as wireworms (Elateridae) and white grubs (Scarabaeidae), can cause serious local problems, and may be resurging with the decrease in soil insecticides used to manage rootworms following wide adoption of transgenic Bt corn. Widespread prophylactic use of neonicotinoid seed treatments to control these secondary soil pests may not be sustainable because of increasing environmental concerns (Mullin et al. 2005, Krupke et al. 2012).Established in 1953 to address ECB, earlier versions of NC-205 evolved to include a broader array of corn pests. First other stalk-boring Lepidoptera were included, and then other above-ground Lepidoptera. This was a natural progression for the committee, as 1) these pests increased in economic importance, and 2) a pest species does not exist in isolation, but as part of a pest complex and arthropod community. NCCC-46, the Multistate Research Coordinating Committee &#39;Development, Optimization and Delivery of Management Strategies for Corn Rootworms&#39;, originated in 1964 as WCR was spreading eastward from the Great Plains into the Central Corn Belt (Gray et al. 2009). NCR was already an economic pest in the Corn Belt, but it was becoming clear that WCR was an even bigger threat to corn production.During the 1990s, NC-205 and NCCC-46 began to co-locate and meet sequentially during the same week. This was in part because several members were on both committees, but more importantly to invite Industry for discussing the deployment, efficacy, non-target effects, and insect resistance management (IRM) implications of transgenic Bt corn, topics of broad interest to both committees. This sequential meeting model became even more valuable upon the introduction of Bt transgenic corn targeting corn rootworm in 2003, its rapid adoption (Rice 2004), the stacking of genes targeting both corn rootworm and corn Lepidoptera in the same plant, and the discovery of WCR field resistance to Cry3Bb1 toxin (Gassmann et al. 2011). Because of the increasing interaction of NC205 and NCCC46, merging of the committees was discussed during the 2014 annual committee meetings. It was felt that a formal merging of the committees would be of mutual benefit, both scientifically and logistically, and after additional discussion, each committee voted to merge. Therefore, this NC-205 renewal proposal reflects the decision to merge the committee membership and address the larger corn insect pest complex, with emphasis on above-ground Lepidoptera pests and below-ground Coleoptera pests.Since the commercial release of Bt transgenic corn against ECB in 1996 and against rootworms in 2004, a revolution in corn insect pest management has occurred. Seed companies continue to develop genetically-modified (GM) crops for pest protection. New GM corn hybrids have resistance to a broader range of lepidopteran pests, some have resistance to coleopteran pests, and most current GM hybrids have genes targeting both Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. This technology often eliminates the need to store and handle insecticides and it increases the efficiency of grower operations and pest control (Rice 2004, Sappington 2014). However, the development of resistance by WCR to some Bt toxins is threatening to reverse these gains. Keeping abreast of these changes with timely and relevant research over an area as large and diverse as the U.S. Corn Belt lends itself to a coordinated, committee approach.Bt corn acreage in the U.S. has increased from 8% in 1997 to 80% in 2014. At this level of adoption, the potential for resistance increases. Research conducted by this committee was used to develop models predicting the rates of resistance evolution and efficacy of refuge in preventing resistance. This led to the IRM approach that used a 20% independent refuge planting; however, as GM technology has evolved, so has IRM. Recently deployed GM corn hybrids use multiple genes that target ECB and WCR. The IRM plan for these hybrids requires a smaller refuge, and seed mixtures (Bt and non-BT) are now being deployed. The models supporting these IRM modifications were constructed using the best information available, but a number of assumptions had to be made. These assumptions must be tested and research conducted to move them from assumptions to quantified variables. Furthermore, information is needed on the economics of this evolving technology at the field, farm, and regional levels. Addressing these knowledge gaps forms the basis for several objectives of the project. The long-term goal of our research is to develop sustainable ways to manage the corn insect pest complex. This is a high regional priority, and in the context of demonstrating sustainable practices, it also is an important national priority."

Demand for dry and snap beans is expected to remain strong or increase as consumers search for healthy alternatives in their diet and there are greater numbers of citizens in the U.S. with a culinary tradition of consuming beans. In order to compete with other commodities such as soybeans and maize, dry bean seed yields need to continue to increase. More efficient use of inputs such as water and nitrogen is needed to reduce production costs and to preserve scarce resources. Numerous abiotic and biotic stresses can threaten both dry and snap bean production. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases are among the main production constraints, whereas drought, heat, soil mineral deficiencies, and short growing seasons reduce productivity and contribute to a yield-gap between on-farm and potential seed yield in many production areas.In addition to human health benefits, beans promote soil and environmental health through biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen which allows beans to be produced with less N-fertilizer than other non-legume crops. The nitrogen fixation characteristic of common bean and other legumes promotes sustainable agriculture practices by reducing fertilizer use, the potential for water contamination through run-off, and crop expansion in low nitrogen soils.Several diseases can occur simultaneously and reduce dry and snap bean yield and quality within and across different production regions. Yield losses can range from 10 to 90%, depending on the diseases involved and the severity. For example, in the Western U.S., Beet curly top virus (BCTV), Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), Fusarium root rot (caused by Fusarium solani f.sp. phaseoli) and Fusarium wilt (caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. phaseoli), and white mold (caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), can simultaneously infect susceptible cultivars. Similarly, in Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, anthracnose (caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum), bacterial brown spot [caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Psp)], BCMV, common bacterial blight [caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli (Xcp) and X. axonopodis pv. phaseoli var. fuscans (Xcpf), Syn. with X. campestris], halo blight (caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola), root rots (in most cases caused by a complex of fungal pathogens), rust (caused by Uromyces appendiculatus), and white mold can occur together and cause severe yield losses. Similarly, the root rot pathogens cause serious problems in snap beans and kidney beans across all production regions. In addition, snap beans are vulnerable to regional epidemics of viral diseases including Beet mild curly top virus (BMCTV) in the western states (e.g., California, Idaho and Washington), and to a virus complex in the Great Lakes states which includes Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV), and Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV), among others. Many of these pathogens are highly variable in their virulence and new races or strains can appear in different regions.This interdisciplinary, multi-state, collaborative W-3150 project proposal comprises several complementary sub-projects. Key collaboration among participants in these sub-projects is designed to achieve our overall goals and objectives of developing high yielding cultivars with enhanced culinary and nutritional qualities and resistance to major abiotic and biotic stresses. These cultivars will help reduce production costs and pesticide use, increase yield and competitiveness of the U.S. bean growers, and sustain production for domestic consumption and export. Researchers participating in each sub-project have complementary expertise and represent two or more institutions. This research scheme has been very successful as evidenced by the  Excellence in Multistate Research Award  given to the W-1150 multistate project by the Western Association of Agricultural Experiment Station Directors (WAAESD) in March of 2009. The inclusive group of bean researchers jointly prepared the project renewal and is committed to collaborating with each other to achieve the overall objectives. For simplicity, these projects are grouped into the following priorities: biotic stresses, abiotic stresses, characterization/utilization of exotic germplasm, applied genomics, nurseries, nutritional and health related benefits in the human diet, and production/sustainability."

NE is the No. 1 and No. 2 producer of great northern (GNB) and pinto bean (PB), respectively, while ranking No. 3 (2011) in overall yield. DEB production occurs primarily in the NE Panhandle and to a lesser extent in other southwestern and central counties. Although CO-DEB production is ~2/3 less than NE (2), the most predominant growth (PB) occurs on our mutual borders thereby interconnecting our economies and natural resources. Annual average DEB sales have contributed ~$167 million per year to counties in both states that are currently suffering flat or declining populations.Yet, DEB acreage has been steadily decreasing in the CHP states over the past 2 decades, i.e., (-50% for NE, -80% for CO).Significant issues facing the long term future of CHP-DEB include higher prices of competing field crops and influxes of DEB from international suppliers. Perhaps most importantly, DEBs are severely under-consumed in the US and other western societies. For example, instead of the recommended 2 cereal: 1 legume ratio for optimal consumption, the ratio has reached 8 or 9:1.This is unfortunate because DEBs are nearly perfect foods due to their high protein, fiber, prebiotic, mineral, vitamin, and other micronutrient contents. The lower legume based diet may also contribute to the obesogenic environment that has emerged in the US over the last 60 years.However, many of phytochemicals in DEB have been shown to remediate macrophage mediated chronic inflammation (MMCI), which is an insidious self-perpetuating cellular stress that is strongly associated to multiple disease risk factors (high cholesterol and insulin) prevalent in obese individuals but also afflicting the general population. Indeed, chronic inflammation has been cited as the secret killer of industrialized nations. Despite its importance, research on CHP-DEBs as potent protectors against MMCI is virtually non-existent. Therefore, the rationale for this project is that CHP-DEB market demand will increase by firmly establishing this specialty crop as dietary system that prevents or remediates MMCI. This project is significant as it is the first to promote CHP-DEB as a health promoting dietary system that targets a serious health condition prevalent in western cultures."

We have used quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping information to facilitate introgression and pyramid genes for favorable disease resistance and quality traits in snap beans. The consistent limitation has been that our linkage maps, though extensive, are based on marker systems (i.e. RAPDs) that do not allow ready communication to other mapped bean populations or comparisons to the genomes of other species of Fabaceae. The cooperative Bean CAP project provides not only sequence information but also the tagged SNP markers that will allow us to communicate and compare our results not only with other bean populations but also throughout the Fabaceae and even allow for potential gene discovery with Arabidopsis or maize.Common bean is 2n=2x=22 and soybean is 2n=2x=40 and both are members of the family Fabaceae. In early macrosyntentic level studies, genome comparisons of soybean, common bean, and mung bean determined that common bean shares a large synteny with soybean. The doubling the chromosome number in Glycine max is due to genome duplication followed by rearrangements leading to diploidization. In addition to soybean, genes in other Fabaceae, including alfalfa, may also be present in common bean, and will likely map to a similar genomic position relative to other genes. The objective of our research is to take advantage of our extensive years of research and collection of field and molecular-based data and utilize it to connect to the genomic databases to enhance gene discovery and utilize this knowledge to develop improved snap bean cultivars with enhanced disease resistance, better adaptation to sustainable production and improved flavor and nutritional value."

All these result in low animal output and economic loss to the producers. Recently focus has been given to increased use of warm-and cool-season forages, in order to extend the period of grazing and reduce costs feeding. An optimal and profitable livestock operation scenario is theoretically possible if forage production inputs are not limiting and animal product prices are high. This optimal economic scenario rarely occurs and as a consequence, we must design management systems that are self-sustaining without continual inputs and yet yield sufficiently to feed livestock for optimal growth performance. Mixing grasses and legumes top this list of management options for agricultural systems based on diverse pasturelands. Diverse and mixed pastures can support and improve livestock production and health. This practice also has a number of environmental benefits, including soil conservation and improved nutrient cycling.Little information is currently available regarding relative forage contribution, forage quality, compatibility, competition, or persistence of native warm-season grasses when mixed with annual or perennial legumes in the southern regions. The inclusion of adapted legumes with grasses in a mixture can increase forage yield and quality compared to unfertilized grasses. Red and white clovers seem to be adapted to southern region of Louisiana. This study is designed to evaluate the traditional stands of summer forage (Bermuda grass) mixed with selected warm season legumes during the summer and ryegrass and clover mixtures during the cool season in southern Louisiana. The development of compatible, persistent, warm- and cool-season grass-legume mixtures could increase forage yield and quality to improve livestock productivity and profitability."

In each study, ruminal and total tract fiber digestion and passage kinetics will be measured in vivo, and compared to estimates of ruminal and total tract fiber digestion that have been derived from mathematical models that use in vitro estimates of fiber digestibility and an assumed rate of fiber passage. Two in vitro methods for measuring rates of fiber degradation will be compared. The traditional in vitro method (Goering and Van Soest, 1970) that is widely used in research in commercial forage testing will be compared to the in vitro method developed in our laboratory in which fermentative activity of rumen fluid inoculum has been standardized (Goeser and Combs, 2009).

These include important crop plants such as soybean and other legumes (Ilarslan et al. 1997), tomato and other members of the Solanaceae (de Kreij et al. 1992), sugar beet (Mostafa and Ulrich 1976), grape (Webb et al. 1995), banana (Li et al, 2014) and many other fruits, vegetables, and horticultural crops. Calcium oxalate crystals in plants exhibit distinct patterns of morphology and distribution, indicating that plants control the sites and modes of calcium oxalate crystallization (reviewed in Webb 1999; Franceschi and Nakata 2005).Calcium oxalate provides several important functions in plants:Calcium oxalate crystallization removes excess calcium from active plant metabolism. Many plants respond to increases in external calcium supply by increased accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals (reviewed in Webb 1999; Franceschi and Nakata 2005). Thus calcium oxalate accumulation provides an essential mechanism for sequestering excess calcium in plants.Calcium oxalate crystals protect plants against animal herbivory (Salz and Ward 2000; Molano-Flores 2001; Korth et al. 2006). In some plants raphides are associated with toxic or acrid proteins (Perera et al. 1990), which confer a bitter taste and/or cause an inflammatory reaction when the plant is eaten (Bradbury and Nixon 1998). Raphides are particularly common in monocots, but also occur in dicots (www.mobot.org).Calcium oxalate in deciduous leaves favorably impacts retention and recycling of calcium in soils of forest ecosystems (Bailey et al. 2003). The oxalate component of calcium oxalate also provides a store for CO2, relevant to amelioration of climate change.Recent studies have revealed that calcium oxalate crystals and calcium carbonate cystoliths in some plants function to scatter light within leaves to promote photosynthesis (Gal et al. 2012).Calcium oxalate can also be harmful to humans and other animals that consume plants. High levels of oxalates in plant foods can be toxic, and in some house or garden plants poisonous substances are associated with calcium oxalate crystals. Calcium transport and partitioning contribute to disorders in fruits and vegetables, such as bitter pit, blossom end rot, and fruit softening, resulting in localized calcium deficiency, even in plants that contain large amounts of calcium oxalate (Mostafa and Ulrich 1976; Millaway and Wiersholm 1979). Some plants accumulate levels of calcium oxalate up to 80% of plant dry weight (Zindler-Frank 1976) or 80-90% of total calcium (Fink 1991). Research that clarifies factors mediating calcium oxalate pools and crystallization of calcium oxalate in cells will contribute to understanding harmful diseases or disorders caused by excessive calcium oxalate.Calcium bioavailability is reduced in foods containing calcium oxalate (Heaney et al 1988; McConn and Nakata 2004). Foods with high oxalate content contribute to elevated urinary oxalate and can lead to kidney disease (Holmes et al. 2001) and diets for patients with susceptibility to kidney stones recommend eliminating high-oxalate foods. Normal human urine contains a variety of proteins, some of which inhibit crystal growth (Ryall et al. 2000). Identification of additional inhibitors of calcium oxalate crystallization in plants could contribute to prevention and treatment for this serious disease."

Also, I frequently answer questions from area growers or extension agents about forage and cover crop cultivar selection and production management. The information generated by the research in this project allows me to give growers advice to improve their forage crops performance and quality.The optimization of alfalfa management (fertility, seeding rate, and harvest frequency) greatly impacts the productivity. The studies in alfalfa fall dormancy, fall harvest, and alfalfa-grass mixtures will increase the forage yield on average at least 0.3 ton/acre/year. Pure alfalfa acreage in North Dakota in 2014 was 395,711 acres and alfalfa grass mixtures 1,000,961 acres (USDA FSA, 2014). An increase in forage yield of 0.3 tons/acre x 1,396,672 acres at a price of $100/ton of hay equals an economic impact of $41,900,160/year. Any improvement in alfalfa yield or reduction in cost by management has a tremendous economic impact. Forages are ranked third in value and acreage among all other crops in the USA. North Dakota is the second most important state in alfalfa acreage in the USA (USDA FSA, 2014).My program has additional impact by testing new forage sources and improving the management of the existing traditional forages. The economic impact of sorghums, forage brassicas, and other annual forages is difficult to estimate, because most of their benefits are indirect. North Dakota cover crop acreage in 2013 was 218,000 acres with a potential to increase which merits a need to provide management information to producers of cover crops.My project also includes bioenergy crops and cover crops research. The impact value of these are hard to estimate, but as a reference legume cover crops planted after wheat in one of our studies (Samarappuli et al., 2014) reduced the need of nitrogen fertilization in corn by 100 lbs N/acre/year. With a N credit of only 50 lbs N/acre, the economic value of reducing the fertilization in corn in 2,693,677 acres x 50 lbs N/acre at a saving of $0.3 lb N, is $40,405,169 per year."

Several associated factors are (1) the critical need to find an organic source of methionine, an essential amino acid (protein building block) for poultry production, (2) the extraordinary consumer acceptance and call for more organic poultry products, (3) the extreme loss of nutritious by-products from harvesting, processing and distribution of horticultural byproducts, (4) the enormous need to reduce deposition of waste in landfills and contribute less to environmental damage, (5) continuing increased production of organic corn and soybean and (6) the ever present void of a comprehensive database coupled with an efficient technological process to formulate diets quickly and inexpensively. These factors are discussed below. Organic source of methionine. The national list for organic poultry feeds ingredients permits use of DL-Methionine, DL-Methionine-hydroxy analog, and DL-Methionine-hydroxy analog calcium (CAS #&#39;s 59-51-8, 583-91-5, 4857-44-7, and 922-50-9) at two pounds per ton for layers and broilers and three pounds per ton for turkeys. These synthetic products are allowed due to lack of a suitable organic methionine source. Beans also contain methionine. A combination of mostly organic cowpeas known as black-eyed peas (but actually a bean) and other beans (black, kidney, Great Northern) can be mixed with organic by-products (remaining after processing of fruits, grains, nuts, seeds and vegetables) and organic corn and soy to produce diets for broilers (meat-type birds), laying hens and turkeys. Many beans are high in anti-nutritive factors that may be difficult to digest by poultry. Therefore, we will use various procedures to remove anti-nutritional factors while maintaining most of the protein/methionine content. There is a continuing upward trend for consumption of organic poultry meat, eggs and their products in the U.S. Approximately 2.0% of the food supply and 1.0% of U.S. cropland is devoted to organic production of food. Some experts suggest that the organic food markets grew by 15 - 20% in previous years and upwards of 40% of U.S. consumers favor some organic food products. With 19% of national organic farms and 36% of all sales, CA, the leading agricultural state, also leads the nation in organic production of food. The state produces 14%, 47%, 58% and 14% of the organic berries, fruits, tree nuts and vegetables, respectively, for the US. CA is the second largest producers of organic chicken and laying hens and the first in production of organic turkeys.Poultry, found in many retail and conventional groceries, leads in the sale of organic meats. As the most popular organic meat, it is purchased by 73% of shoppers. Its domination of the meat market is due to a short production cycle, low price and mostly integrated production in comparison to beef or pork. Price, due to production costs, continues to outstrip demand; thus, organic poultry products remains out of reach for many in the US population. Use of organic horticultural by-products to replace part of the organic corn and soy could reduce the overall production cost. Moreover, in conjunction with beans, organic by-products can be used to improve the quality and efficiency of meat and eggs production. Many discarded by-products contain antioxidants that retard the deterioration of lipids (fats) and cholesterol in feed, post-mortem tissue and possibly in humans. For instance, &alpha;-tocopherol can be fed to broilers in diets containing tomato pomace, be stored in cell membranes of poultry muscle tissue during growth and remain in meat after processing to prevent lipid oxidation during storage, heating and freezing. Lycopene from tomato pomace can be stored in egg yolk Chlorogenic acid is an antioxidant in sweet potatoes while apples skins, another novel feed ingredient, contains more antioxidants than in the flesh of the fruit. Many  second rate  berries, larger fruits, broccoli stems/ leaves meal and nuts also contain valuable nutrients and antioxidants that could be stored in poultry meat and eggs and ultimately consumed by humans. Indeed, feeding nutrients such as antioxidants to broilers and layers, followed by tracking their deposition in meat and eggs, then monitoring their uptake in humans has received some attention by the medical profession; however, this area of research has not been sufficiently explored. Loss of nutritious by-products. Ranking third in production of fruits after China and India, the US is fourth in production of vegetables following China, India and Brazil. For US raw and processed fruits, vegetables and grains, about 23.4%, 25.4% and 32.0%, respectively, were wasted from production to consumption in 2010. While there is no separate data for loss of organic material, it is easy to realize that the loss of organic by-products will increase with demand for organic food.Reduction of depositions in landfills is a significant benefit from our research. When managing waste of any type, disposal in landfills is the seventh and last method listed after all others. Even with technical advances, post-harvest food loss remains a great concern in CA. Because CA leads the nation in the production of many fruits and vegetables, the lost in by-products is not manageable except for deposition in landfills. Increase in production of organic corn and soy. Corn and soy are major sources of protein for poultry. Feed costs for mostly corn and/or soy is 65 - 70% of the total financial input for production. With the demand for more organic poultry, use of these important crops can be extended if feed for organic poultry include organic beans and by-products. Need for extensive databases. Presently, researchers substitute one novel feedstuff for corn or soy for each investigation - a very slow process while the proof of concept for feeding by-products has been proven many times. Thus, an up-to-date database for by-products is under development in the PI&#39;s laboratory. This information is being coupled with the Nutrient Requirements of Poultry (1994) and updated information from poultry nutritionists across the"

In PR it has remained unaltered over the last 30 years, despite improvements in the genetic potential of cows. However, despite climate limitations there is the potential to produce high quality forages in the tropics. Research in PR has determined the high nutritive value and digestibility of the tropical legumes &#39;Henorico&#39; perennial peanut (HPP) and perennial soybean (Neonotonia wightii), and of the grass &#39;Maralfalfa&#39; (Pennisetum spp). The proposed research aims to evaluate the productivity of these three nutritive and highly digestible forages for their ability to produce higher milk production when fed to lactating dairy cows. Production of the forages will be recorded for HPP in experimental plots under subterranean drip irrigation and for Maralfalfa grass and perennial soybean under aereal irrigation. Milk production potential (quality of the forages) and dry matter intake will be evaluated in feeding trials with early lactation dairy cows. A second objective will be to evaluate short-hair Holsteins with the &#39;slick&#39; gene as to their potential for higher milk production under grazing management or under a confinement management where locally grown high quality forages will be fed. Major findings of the research will be disseminated to stakeholders through periodic field days and farmers and industry personnel visits to the project. It is expected that the results will validate the high quality of the forages evaluated and the superior productive performance of short-haired Holsteins in tropical conditions. The feeding of high quality forages should significantly improve the effciency of milk production under tropical conditions."

Fungicides are available for control of this disease, but these are costly and require more than one application. Before white mold was a major problem, the crop was a profitable one; now growers barely break even and they need cultivars that are resistant and do not require fungicide applications. Genetic resistance is generally conditioned by multiple genes with small individual effect and resistance is generally found in unadapted bean lines. These can be crossed to snap bean to create populations for breeding for resistance and that can be used to study the trait, how it is inherited and what markers and genes are linked to resistance.

Swainsonine consumption causes severe economic losses as locoweeds have a widespread distribution across the western U.S. The fungal endophyte, Undifilum oxytropis, is primarily or completely responsible for SWA in locoweeds. Vertebrate herbivores avoid locoweeds presumably because of SWA or cues from other secondary metabolites, but locoweed consumption occurs when preferred food plants are unavailable. Individuals can habituate to eating locoweeds and social interactions yield other locoweed consumers. Interestingly, the plant does not pay a growth penalty whether it is a high or low producer of SWA, and production is under tight fungal or plant genetic control because SWA production is locoweed taxa specific and possibly also Undifilum taxa specific. Understanding locoweed-fungal endophyte interactions are important for several research areas: plant/microbe interactions, microbe-induced plant defense against herbivores, rangeland management, secondary metabolite production (plant or fungal production control), plant resource investment into an asymptomatic endophyte, plant abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, plant biogeography, and the continuum between mutualistic and commensalistic interactions where locoweed/endophyte system seems to fall. Locoweed-fungal endophyte interactions are also of interest by being quite different from the tall fescue-fungal endophyte complex where the fungus produces a toxic alkaloid, but also enhances plant growth. This work can benefit society by helping to understand locoweeds and how a toxic alkaloid is produced by a fungus, which in turn may ultimately protect the food supply by aiding ranchers whose livestock suffer from locoism."

Most of the food crops consumed are considered specialty crops, are grown on limited acres and have a high economic value to the state of Idaho. The pesticide industry lacks financial incentives to support registrations for these specialty crops. They have concerns about reduced return on their registration investment due to lower acreages, and liability associated with product stewardship. Many of the pesticide products do not have sufficient crop safety and performance data, for these specialty crops. Idaho has always played a major role in specialty crop production, with crops such as malt barley, dry beans, dry bulb onions, dry peas and chickpeas, table and wine grapes, hops, lentils, mint, seed crops, sweet corn, teff, and tree fruits. Idaho ranks 19th overall in agricultural products sold.Several organophosphate and carbamate pesticides have been cancelled or have new reduced usage patterns due to residue concerns, worker protection concerns, or lack of registrant support to supply additional data. Many Idaho commodities are dependent upon these pesticides for their pest management needs. Other concerns with pest management tools may be pesticide resistance, impacts to pollinators, and lack of diverse mode of action. In Idaho and many western states, most specialty crops only have one or two choices for pest control options. The loss of one or both pesticide tools could result in crop devastation. Production costs will increase due to changes in agronomic practices, and may disrupt production of these specialty crops. This disruption in production could also have impacts to society in the lack of affordable, diversified and nutritious foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables, so important to a healthy diet.It is important that the Idaho IR-4 program continue to support the development of specialty crop pesticide registrations for Idaho and Pacific Northwest producers."

Demand for dry and snap beans is expected to remain strong or increase as consumers search for healthy alternatives in their diet and there are greater numbers of citizens in the U.S. with a culinary tradition of consuming beans. In order to compete with other commodities such as soybeans and maize, dry bean seed yields need to continue to increase. More efficient use of inputs such as water and nitrogen is needed to reduce production costs and to preserve scarce resources. Numerous abiotic and biotic stresses can threaten both dry and snap bean production. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases are among the main production constraints, whereas drought, heat, soil mineral deficiencies, and short growing seasons reduce productivity and contribute to a yield-gap between on-farm and potential seed yield in many production areas. A multi-state collaborative research project for common bean is needed because many constraints are shared among bean production regions in the U.S. Collaborative research promotes efficiency, accelerates genetic progress, avoids duplication of work and conserves economic and physical resources. Collaborators are more likely to share information that can have broad impact. Communication during the formative stages of research allows for emerging information and shared experience to improve study design. New cultivars can be selected to have wider adaptation and more durable resistance to pathogen variability and environmental fluctuations that occur year to year. A multi-state collaborative research project promotes communication among dry and snap bean researchers to address the constraints that are shared. Ultimately, the whole bean industry (both seed and food) benefits from the knowledge and products developed by this project."

Locoweeds commonly occur in rangelands in the western United States, where they pose a hazard to livestock. Although many species of legumes in genera Astragalus and Oxytropis can contain swainsonine, other species may lack or have very little swainsonine. In such instances, it is not known if the plants lack or have very little endophyte, or their endophytes lack the ability to produce substantial levels of swainsonine. It is also unclear what environmental or agroecological factors might promote swainsonine synthesis or favor plants with swainsonine-producing endophytes, or even whether swainsonine somehow protects or enhances fitness of the plant that contains it. Experiments to address these questions will be facilitated by the identification of genes for biosynthesis of this alkaloid, as well as linked genes and sequences governing regulation of swainsonine expression and where the swainsonine may be localized within fungal or host plant. Complete genome sequences will be determined for swainsonine producers, and bioinformatic tools will be employed to identy genes and their likely functions, and to compare genomes of different fungi, to help identify swainsonine biosythesis genes.

One way to link these two is through the use of crop models by using the genetic background of the plant to define coefficients used in the model. These models would be particularly useful for plant breeders or farmers to either developor select genotypes for specific environments.However, many limitations to the use of crop models for breedingor at the field levelexist. For example, crop models have crude representations of the environment (many lack the effects of diseases, soil compaction, among other factors) which limits their ability to represent interactions between genotype, environment and cropping system. Several  genetic traits  are considered independent and may in fact be directly linked, while many of the parameters representing these  genetic traits  are not yet linked to any gene(s) per se. In addition, some of the subroutines that represent specific traits may not adequately represent the variance in the gene pool, thus are optimized for a narrow range of genotypes. Finally, crop models will likely never be able to incorporate the complete complexity of all gene networks due to limitations in resources and propagation of uncertainties within the models. Despite the limitations, the next generation of crop models will need to include more genetic and physiology linkages which this project will provide.We will approach the G2P problem from several approaches. First, we will usestatistical (empirical) models can that can link quantitative trait loci (QTL) to the parameters in these empirical modelsthrough multi-environment studies. Second,we (Correll, and colleagues) have developed an algorithm using a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method to estimate the GSPs in the DSSAT CROPGRO-Bean model using a staged approach to estimate crop model parameters. This approach estimates GSPs in the order of developmental growth (i.e., planting to emergence (PLEM) is estimated before emergence to flowering (EMFL)) and targets specific crop traits rather than all outputs of the model. Once the GSPs for the model are estimated, a QTL analysis on the GSP can be conducted and then integrated into a mathematical function (now a gene-based function)to estimate the GSP value. Third, the crop model can be used for selection schemes for the breeder and provide outputs of crop traits that may then be used in identifying QTLs. Finally, we expect to develop new or improve existing modules for predicting crop traits Regardless of the approach, we expect to improve the prediction of key traits ofcrops that are based on the genotype of the plant thus building a tool for plant breeders to optimizecrops or a variety of environments and management scenarios. These tools will be key to selecting and developing crop cultivars to feed the 9 billion people by 2050 especially as Climate Change puts our food security at risk."

In particular, we aim at understanding the function of genes essential in this process. Moreover, most symbiotic genes characterized in legumes are involved in the early steps of nodulation, such as establishment of the symbiosis and very early nodule development (the so-called nod- genes, since the mutant roots are not able to develop nodules). Very few nod+/fix- genes (those which knockout allow normal nodule development but no nitrogen fixation) have been functionally characterized.

The development of new genomic technologies, play akey role in global food security and sustainable agriculture (Michael and VanBuren 2015). In contrast to traditional molecular biology techniques, where a small number of genes, proteins or metabolites are analyzed simultaneously, genomic technologies allow scientists to generate data at the whole genome scale.This has the potential to advance systematic understanding of biological mechanisms and significantly accelerate crop improvement. For example, genome sequencing can provide tens of thousands of genetic markers that enhances the power of marker-assisted breeding (Morrell, Buckler, and Ross-Ibarra 2011; Deshmukh et al. 2014). Transcriptome profiling with RNA sequencing can quantify changes of all genes for a given species, allowing the identification of key genes torespondto stress or other environmental conditions (Huang et al. 2014; Rodrigues et al. 2015; Wakasa et al. 2014).During the past few years, the cost of obtaining genomic information using next generation sequencing technology has reduced dramatically (Edwards, Batley, and Snowdon 2013). Because of this, genomic information such as reference genome sequences, single nucleotide polymorphisms, epigenomic modifications, and transcriptome profiles, have become readily available for many crop species. The challenge is how to translate the  big data  into knowledge of gene functions and genetic variation, and to apply such knowledge to facilitate a mechanical understandingof crop improvement. Bioinformatics and computational biology, play a fundamental role in this process. Using tools of statistical inference and machine learning, bioinformatics is the principled approach for data mining on genomics data to identify genes and genetic variations that underlie traits of economical importance. For example, RNAseq and genome re-sequencing data, have been used to identify genes involved in regulation of seed oil content (Goettel et al. 2014) or seed development (Fan et al. 2013). In the past few decades, most gene functions and molecular mechanisms in plants, have been characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana (Krishnakumar et al. 2015), a model plant species. As compared to Arabidopsis, genetic experiments for crops are typically more time consuming (Edwards, Batley, and Snowdon 2013). Unlike traditional genetic experiments, genomic experiments such as RNA sequencing are fast and can now be routinely performed in a variety of crops species. However, crop genomes are typically more complex than Arabidopsis, thus new bioinformatics tools and databases are needed to help breeders and other plant scientists to analyze and interpret genomic data in order to better understand the information embedded in such data. One of the main functions of these tools will be to compare crop species and Arabidopsis in order to identify key genes and pathways that are conserved and involved in important biological processes, such as seed filling, seed germination, disease resistance, and drought/flood tolerance.In the next five years, my lab will focus on building bioinformatic platforms (Figure 1) that enable scientists to extract information from comparative genomic data and to facilitate crop improvement. We will use soybean (Glycine max) as a model system to build our bioinformatics resources and pipelines. We will focus on three biological processes: seed development, stress tolerance and microbial interactions. Seed development is the key process that is related to the product quality of soybeans. Environmental stresses such as drought and flood are major abiotic factors that negatively impact soybean productivity. As a legume species, soybean-microbial interactions are crucial for the process of nitrogen fixation and determines the protein content of soybean seeds. Many research groups at Virginia Tech as well as in other institutions have studied these biological processes, and have already generated ample amount of sequencing data for soybean and Arabidopsis. We will use these existing data in our research. The bioinformatics platform developed in this project can be easily extended to analyze data from other crop species such as maize, rice and wheat."

These policies have impacts on consumer and producer welfare, as well as the welfare of farm input suppliers and food processors, rural communities, and taxpayers. This project examines the effects on the natural resource base and economic welfare of ranches, agri-businesses and rural communities in the United States, Montana, and developing countries of agricultural commodity policies, agricultural trade policies, natural resource and environmental policies, and agricultural science policies. Several of the areas of research within the project will also be supported by external funds and involve collaboration with federal and state agencies and other universities.Agricultural policy is complex and derives from many different elements of federal and state policies and agency implementation rules and practices. The 2014 Farm Bill, with twelve titles addressing commodity, agricultural insurance, disaster, conservation, trade and science policies that directly affect agricultural producers is a central piece of legislation. The Farm Bill is due to expire on September 1, 2018 and either a new Farm Bill must be passed by Congress and signed by the Administration by the then, or the current legislation must be extended. Many of the provisions of the current Farm Bill are being heavily criticized, especially because of the magnitude of the federal outlays associated with them. Most farm organizations believe that some changes to commodity programs, disaster aid programs and crop insurance programs are likely to be made, especially in relation to new price and income support programs introduced in the 2014 legislation (e.g., Agricultural Risk Coverage, Price Loss Coverage and an expanded federal crop insurance program). These programs currently are expected to provide between 10 and 15 percent of total farm receipts for Montana agricultural producers.This project will continue to examine the economic effects of these and other programs and variousproposed changes to them on Montana and U.S. agricultural producers, consumers and agribusinesses, as well as rural communities and the environment.Topics of particular interest will include the economic impacts on Montana and U.S. farmers and ranchers, processors, consumers, and other groups of the following:- Reforms targeted for the agricultural insurance industry, which delivers crop insurance to farmers and receives over 25 percent of all government subsidies for the program.- Changes in agricultural trade policy and multilateral trade agreements, including theproposed Trans-Pacific Partnership and suggested changes to the current World TradeOrganization Agreement, as well as several current trade disputes.- Emergency food aid programs managed by USAID and USDA. Current programs havebeen the subject of recent criticism, and modifications related to food sourcing and cargopreferences have been suggested.- The current and future health status of pollinators. The economic consequences ofColony Collapse Disorder and other pollinator health concerns will be estimated, andseveral other issues related to pollination markets and commercial beekeeping will beanalyzed.-Policies related to the management of natural resources, including Pacific Northwestfisheries, federal wilderness management, and price gouging regulations that areactivated during natural disaster-induced emergencies. One focus here will be on tribalsystems of property rights and management practices in the context of Northwest tribalfisheries. Research will also be initiated on the impacts of changing crop productionpatterns through the expansion of acreage planted to pulse crops on incentives for the useof risk management tools, including USDA programs, by American Indian producers onMontana&#39;s seven tribal reservations.- The value of information in the context of several important marketing practices, including retail pricing practices for produce, and the choice between auctions and negotiations for selling timber and cattle. Additional analysis of the cattle industry will beundertaken with a focus on (1) the impacts of recent federal programs designed to provide relief to cattle producers during drought periods, and (2) the determinants andimplications of important changes in cattle carcass weights over time."

The state of Idaho is the largest producer of potatoes in the U.S., with about one-third of the national production and more than 30% of the acreage in 2014; more than a quarter of U.S. potato processing capacity resides in Idaho. Other significant crops grown in Idaho include sugar beet, dry and snap beans, peas and other cool-season food legumes. Virus diseases cause significant losses in these crops and require monitoring and managing virus disease problems. Viruses, in particular aphid-transmitted Potato virus Y (PVY), are especially damaging in potato, a vegetatively propagated crop where special potato seed certification programs are employed to mitigate effects of degenerating virus diseases. Leafhopper-transmitted Beet curly top virus (BCTV) is one of the main problems for sugar beet and bean production in Idaho, and in other Western states with dry climate. Two more viruses are important in beans in Idaho, in addition to BCTV, both transmitted by aphids and through seed: Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) and Bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV). Three aphid-transmitted viruses are of a major concern in peas, Pea enation mosaic virus, Bean leafroll virus, and Pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV). Understanding the infection cycle, virus-host interactions, transmission, epidemiology, and strain composition of these viruses affecting major Idaho crops facilitates development of more profitable and sustainable management strategies for crop protection and production."

Swainsonine consumption causes severe economic losses as locoweeds have a widespread distribution across the western U.S. The fungal endophyte, Undifilum oxytropis, is primarily or completely responsible for swainsonine in locoweeds. Vertebrate herbivores avoid locoweeds presumably because of swainsonine or cues from other secondary metabolites, but locoweed consumption occurs when preferred food plants are unavailable. Individuals can habituate to eating locoweeds and social interactions yield other locoweed consumers. Interestingly, the plant does not pay a growth penalty whether it is a high or low producer of swainsonine, and production is under tight fungal or plant genetic control because swainsonine production varies by locoweed and fungal endophyte species. However, there have been several reported instances of biological control of locoweed by insects. Understanding herbivorous insect-locoweed-fungal endophyte interactions are important for research areas such asplant/insect/microbe interactions, microbe-induced plant defense against insect herbivores, rangeland management, secondary metabolite production (plant, insector fungal production control),plant abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, and wild land management. Hebivorous insect-locoweed-fungal endophyte interactions are also of interest by being quite different from other known rangeland plant-fungal endophyte complex where the fungal productionof a toxic alkaloid enhances plant growth.

Sorghum is a critically important crop in Africa and India and though the U.S. is the world&#39;s top producing country, there is great potential for increased cultivation. In Nebraska alone, as recently as the 1980s, more than 2M acres of sorghum has been replaced with corn requiring irrigation and greater amounts of fertilizer. If all or part of this land were returned to sorghum cultivation, substantial input cost savings would be realized by farmers and there would also be environmental benefits in terms of reduced aquifer depletion and nitrogen run-off. Despite the input efficiency of sorghum, the protein in its grain, like maize, is deficient in amino acids such as lysine, which are essential in the diets of humans and non-ruminant livestock. Compounding this issue in sorghum is the fact that the alpha kafirin storage proteins, which make up most of the grain protein, form highly indigestible protein bodies. People consuming sorghum as a primary protein source are thus susceptible to malnutrition when they rely too heavily on this staple. Monogastric livestock require supplementation from legumes or synthetic amino acids. Improving the composition and digestibility of sorghum proteins would significantly enhance its potential as a food and feed both in the U.S and in developing countries. Although sorghum currently has limited application for human consumption in the U.S, there is a growing interest in gluten-free sources of whole grain, and sorghum has several attractive nutritional characteristics which could be exploited if the digestibility issues can be overcome.Despite the fact that the sorghum genome sequence is known, functional genomics resources are limited. The platform being developed here will enhance our ability to generate mutants in sorghum for forward genetic screens of seed and whole plant variants and when scaled up, may be used for reverse genetic screens by other sorghum researchers.The work uses targeted &#39;CRISPr&#39; genome editing as well as random deletion mutagenesis to create a suite of lines which have variably reduced alpha kafirin proteins with improved protein quality and digestibility. The genome editing approach is designed to generate a series of variably and partially silenced kafirin variants which will have improved digestibility and protein quality while still maintaining an acceptably hard kernel texture. Kafirin variants will be identified using a next-generation sequencing approach of kafirin PCR products from pooled primary transformants. Identified mutants will be further propagated and outcrossed for transgene removal. After characterizing the initial transgenic events and demonstrating proof of concept, we will initiate a process to patent the technology for partial ablation of prolamin gene families in cereals. After that, we will publish a timely paper describing the novelty of targeting an entire gene family to create novel improved output trait.The deletion approach uses gamma-irradiation to create variably sized deletions across the sorghum genome. Because some of the deletions induced are large, we will screen for deletions which fully or partially knock out the alpha kafirin gene cluster on chromosome 4. Kafirin variants created genome editing or deletion mutagenesis will be bulked up for larger scale testing and if necessary, breeding. On the basic science side, we have shown using our maize deletion mutagenesis platform, that many of the deletions are small enough to affect single genes. Thus, we will leverage the sorghum population for general functional genomics of kernel development. We will use our optimized mapping and candidate gene identification platform for mapping causal mutations and identifying candidates within the mapping interval. We will publish a general paper describing the phenotypic and genotypic repertoire of the sorghum deletion mutant population and subsequently, follow-up papers describing the biology of individual mutants. All the RNA and DNA sequence we obtain will be made publically available on the website of my long term bioinformatics collaborator, Chi Zhang (http://sysbio.unl.edu/services/).The goals that the project should address through the above methods are as follows:Provide important insight in the emergent field of CRISPr genome editing about the feasibility of down-regulating gene families of duplicated genes using a single short RNAGenerate reduced kafirin sorghum lines through genome editing and random mutagenesis which have direct application as increased protein quality and digestibility food and feed stocksProvide a novel platform for sorghum functional genomics to investigate kernel and potentially other agronomic traits"

Current summer annual crop rotations often 1) leave soil bare and unprotected from erosion and losses of organic matter and nutrients during fall, winter, and spring and 2) have little biodiversity. The lack of biodiversity leads to issues with pest management, labor distribution through the growing season, and economics and profitability. The purpose of this research project is to increase crop species diversity on the Iowa farming landscape. This will be achieved by developing longer crop rotations that include summer and winter annual species as well as perennial species. Oilseed crops such as canola and cereal grains such as wheat exhibiting summer and winter annual life cycles as well as perennial legumes such as red clover could possibly fit into an Iowa crop rotation, providing growers with alternative options. Additionally, the inclusion of summer and winter annual crop species in rotations increases the potential of economically viable double-cropping scenarios. The inclusion of species with different life cycles such as these can also serve to improve cropping systems by increasing the amount of ground cover throughout the year and help disturb life cycles of problematic weed species. Incorporating multiple species into a crop rotation may also improve yields of other crops such as corn and improve a farmer&#39;s economic stability, while at the same time reduce the ecological footprint as a result historical land cultivation. The potential to reduce the amount of off-farm, synthetic inputs also exists when longer, more diverse crop rotations that include legumes are employed. Before growers can reap the benefits of alternative crop rotations, the ecological and economical viability of &#39;alternative/non-corn/soybean&#39; crops and double-cropping systems must be evaluated with a strong emphasis on making any information as a result of this research readily available to growers. This study investigates the agronomic and economic potential of planting winter canola into full sesaon soybeans with the intent of harvesting high soybeans yields while seeding winter canola at optimum planting dates for Iowa. In order to increase adoption of alternative crops, it is critical that yield trials be established that can identifythe yield potential of winter canola varieties that are most suited to Iowa climate."

After honey bees, the alfalfa leafcutting bee is the second most economically-important, commercially-managed pollinator in North America. However, multiple problems presently exist that limit its sustainable use. This often forces alfalfa seed growers in Montana to import bees from Canada, sometimes on a yearly basis. Increasing bee health and reducing mortality could also contribute to its use on other crops, such as canola, blueberries, and non-alfalfa forage legumes. In addition, a better understanding of how to manage this species could contribute to attempts to  domesticate  other solitary bees as commercial pollinators. The second area of research in the proposal addresses studies of populations of native bees that can contribute pollination services in agroecosystems and natural habitats.The results will provide information relevant to 1) increasing the health and sustainability of alfalfa leafcutting bee populations, thereby increasing the efficfoncy of seed alfalfa production, 2) providing better data. on how alfalfa leafcutting bee mortality factors interact, which could lead to a better understanding of how bee mortality could be reduced in the most cost-effective manner, and 3) improving our baseline knowledge of native communities of pollinators (bees) and predatory insects (wasps) in a time of increasing habitat disturbance and climate change.The proposed studies involve a variety of field, laboratory, and statistical methods. Field methods include the use trap-nests for surveying bee and wasps populations, and their large-scale equivalents: alfalfa leafcutting bee nest shelters that contain thousands of potential nesting sites within polystyrene  nest boards . Lab methods include the use of 1) a laboratory temperature gradient, 2) a petroleum-ether based method for assessing fat content of insects (used as a measure of bee health), 3) the well-kilown Bradford Analysis for estimating protein content of pollen, and 4) standard staining and microscopic techniques for identify pollen.

This agriculture is placed within mountainous and forested areas with significant topographic relief, resulting in complex and unique spatial variability at multiple scales. Nearly 60% of the land is forested, 11% of the land is in crops, and it is in this non-forested land that agriculture is concentrated and co-existing with urbanization. These farms are among the oldest intensively farmed areas in the U.S., often with 200 or more years of farming history. Most of the farm acreage is in field and forage crop production, in part to support the strong animal agriculture in the state. Many of the farms are multigenerational, and they often integrate higher value fruit and vegetable agriculture, and some have become certified organic operations, allowing them to charge a premium for their products. In a time of vertical integration and increasing farm size, the contribution from this diverse agricultural mosaic can be too-easily overlooked. Interestingly, however, it is in this northeastern mosaic where diversified small farms are being sustained, and crop diversity ranks among the highest in the nation (Pfleeger et al. 2006). The integration of large acreage field and forage crops with higher value production (fruits, veggies, organic), rapid access to markets, and a strong generational tie to the farms helps farms persist and enter new markets. This diversified and integrated agriculture also creates value-added production which helps sustain agriculture and jobs within local environments, and sustains family farms. To support this industry, we need to advance environmentally sound invertebrate (insects, mites, slugs, and other pest species) management practices that are economically feasible, effective, improve farm-worker safety, and relevant to conventional and organic growers. Pest management practices that meet these goals are based on an understanding of local pest population, community ecology in these agroecosystems, and migratory pests that may arrive. Understanding species composition, densities, trophic roles, and bottom-up and top-down factors that influence abundance of key pest species and effectiveness of beneficial species, along with phenology to determine the time of life stages, are all critical components of applying insect ecology to pest management. This research contributes towards sustaining farms in the northeast by enhancing our understanding of insect populations and community dynamics of both pest and beneficial species, including natural enemies and wild pollinators, in northeastern field, forage, vegetable, and vineyard agroecosystems.Field and forage crop production dominate Pennsylvania agriculture with about 4 million acres of corn, soybean, alfalfa, and grass hay supporting a vibrant livestock business raising dairy cows, beef cattle, swines, poultry, among other animal species. For good reason Pennsylvania is known as a dairy state (we have around 7000 dairies) but the other diverse animals raised on Pennsylvania farms need feed and forage also. By some estimates, as much as 100% of the conventional corn production in Pennsylvania receives insecticides each year, while about 50% of soybean acreage does (Douglas and Tooker 2015). It is clear that most of this insecticide use is preventative and much of it could be avoided if growers relied on scouting and using the framework of Integrated Pest Management to direct any insecticide usage. Vegetables are grown commercially on &gt; 4,300 Pennsylvanian farms that produce over 30 crops, and the state ranks in the top 10 in production of sweet corn, several species of Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae, and processing snap beans. Sweet corn dominates diversified fresh-market farms: it is grown on approximately 75% of these farms. About 85% of the acreage is chemically treated for control of a complex of lepidopterans, but resistance to several relevant insecticide options is now common in the US. Cucurbits rank high: Pennsylvania now ranks second or third in pumpkin production and a diverse array of other cucurbits are produced. Grapes are grown on over 14,000 acres of land in Pennsylvania, ranking the state fourth nationally in grape production and eighth larges in wine production. These crops are chemically treated for multiple species of insects that vector pathogens, increasingly with systemic neonicotinoids that can negatively influence pollinators and natural enemy species (Henry et al. 2012, Whitehorn et al. 2012, Douglas et al. 2015). At least 5 newly invasive species are now causing dramatic changes in management practices. Transgenic cultivars that are genetically modified to be insect resistant are commercially available for field corn, sweet corn and squash, more approaching the marketplace pending further research, and seed- and transplant-based technologies are increasing. Reliance on pesticides, however, is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain. Over 500 arthropods are resistant to insecticides, including two relevant to northeastern agroecosystems with field resistant to transgenes (Storer et al. 2010, Gassmann et al. 2011), and non-target and pollution effects are getting harder to ignore (Hladik et al. 2014; Douglas et al. 2015). Societal, environmental, and legislative pressures push towards biologically intensive insect management options, and various  green-labelled  systems provide a marketing premium, or are required for participation in some marketing chains."

First, the dairy industry within the state has experienced a steady increase in cow numbers since the late 90&#39;s from about 83,000 to 140,000 head at present which brings with it a concurrent need for additional high quality forage, especially alfalfa. This expansion is expected to continue into the near future due to the Leprino cheese and whey plant that started production in Greeley in 2012. Estimates are that an additional 50,000 to 70,000 dairy cows are needed in northeastern Colorado to supply the milk demand of the plant. Second, the state is experiencing a conversion of agricultural land to other uses. Large acreages are being subdivided into smaller parcels (less than 35 acres) which are being purchased by people from predominately urban backgrounds that have little knowledge of land management practices. Most like to keep a few animals on their property, but need help with such things as what forage species to plant, how to establish the plants, and weed and grazing management. The clientele base for research and extension information on forages is basically changing from traditional agricultural producers to these new  small acreage landowners . Finally, the urban development and subsequent population growth that Colorado is currently experiencing has brought about a need for more water for municipal uses. About 90% of the water used in Colorado is for agricultural purposes. One of the easiest ways for municipalities to obtain more water is to buy irrigation water rights from agricultural users. This creates a need for information on how to reclaim these formerly irrigated lands by establishing dryland forage species. If active restoration is not pursued, it may take years for succession to reach a point where the land is once again productive for both livestock and wildlife uses. To meet the above needs, various forages (annual and perennial grasses and legumes) will be evaluated for their adaptability in various environments throughout Colorado. Management practices will also be concurrently evaluated that ensure the long-term productivity of these forages which will ultimately minimize input costs to landowners. Results will be disseminated through referred journal articles, AES technical reports and bulletins, Extension fact sheets, workshops and seminars, and field days. Results will also be incorporated into campus-based courses (i.e. Forage and Pasture Management and Integrated Forage Management). Most of the information generated will be easily available to the public through the World Wide Web."

During 2015 South Dakota was ranked 7th in the U.S. for soybeanproduction (235,520,000 bushels), 6th for wheat production (103,406,000 bushels), and 1st forsunflower production (1,230,040,000 lbs). When the annual production of these crops is compared between 2013 and 2015 there was a 12% increase for soybean, a 9.7% increase for wheat, and a 21% increase for sunflower (NASS 2016). As the harvested acres and observed yields of soybean, wheat, and sunflower continue to increase, there is also an increased need for improved management recommendations for the insect pests of these crops. One strategy that has been employed is the use of insecticide seed treatments, and as a result their use in South Dakota has been steadily increasing (USGS 2016). Soybean, wheat, and sunflower productivity is often negatively affected by early season soil dwelling and also foliar feeding insect pests. Due to a limited selection of products available for management of these insect pests, and the systemic nature and ease of use associated with insecticide seed treatments, they are often used for insectmanagement. The insecticide active ingredients used for seed treatments for soybean, wheat, andsunflower are exclusively neonicotinoids.Insecticide seed treatments are used on approximately 31% of soybean acres across the U.S., however, it is believed that in areas of the Midwest they are used on as much as 73% of the planted soybean acres (Douglas and Tooker 2015). Although these insecticide products are applied to seed that is planted on millions of acres of cropland there are limited use recommendations available, and as a result they are often used prophylactically (Douglas and Tooker 2015). Concerns regarding the value of insecticide seed treatments for soybean in the Midwest have been a topic of discussion since 2014 when a report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was released. The Biological and Economic Analysis Division (BEAD) of the EPA determined that the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments in soybean most likely provided farmers with a $0/acre benefit, and at most $6/acre benefit (EPA 2014). However, an analysis of the same data by AgInformatics, LLC determined that the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments provide a net yield benefit of 2.8%(approximately $10.60/acre) when compared to untreated soybean (Mitchell 2014). In their report, the EPA BEAD also stated that according to surveys of soybean farmers the insect pests that were being managed through the use of insecticide seed treatments included soybean aphids and bean leaf beetles (EPA 2014). Although they are major commodities, there is limited data available regarding the use of insecticide seed treatments for wheat and sunflower production.Identifying early season above-ground insect pests is relatively easy, and relies on observing the insect or signs of defoliation. However, identification of belowground insect pests can be difficult and as a result they are often overlooked and ignored. The early season insect pests associated with soybean include wireworm, seedcorn maggots, white grubs, and bean leaf beetles (Bailey et al. 2015). Early season pests of both spring and winter wheat include bird cherry oat aphid, English grain aphid, greenbug, Hessian fly, and wireworms (Dyer at al. 2012, Hunger et al. 2012). An additional concern, aside from yield losses due to direct feeding is that the three aphid species that feed on wheat are also competent vectors of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). Exploration of the impact of insecticide seed treatments on the incidence of BYDV in wheat is necessary. For sunflower, early season insect pests include wireworms, seedcorn maggots, striped flea beetle, and sunflower beetle (Knodel and Charlet 2007). While this list does account for bean leaf beetles as an early season pest, it does not account for soybean aphids due to their late season arrival in soybean. The contradiction between the EPA&#39;s survey data and the known early season insect pests of soybean are likely due to a lack of extension and outreach from state universities. Also, if this discrepancy exists for one crop such as soybean, it likely exists for other crops including wheat and sunflower. Although insecticide seed treatments are labeled for wheat and sunflower there is limited data available regarding their efficacy and benefit to farmers in the U.S., and especially in South Dakota.Therefore, it is critical that the use of insecticide seed treatments is explored in soybean, wheat and sunflower in South Dakota to determine their benefit for farmers. In addition, for each crop itwill also be imperative to explore factors (e.g., planting date, seeding density, soil type, weatherconditions) to determine when insecticide seed treatments provide the greatest economic benefit to farmers. Through these efforts, management recommendations for insecticideuse on soybean, wheat, and sunflower will be developed."

Profits will not depend exclusively on any one market example, such as corn or soy beans. Therefore, strategic diversification improves the overall economic picture of the small farmer. However, help is needed to determine which alternative crop would be the best. The project aims to identify and test novel native and exotic plants which have non-conventional uses like medicinal plants, anti-bacterial and anti-allergic properties. Apiary could be a multi-pronged benefit to the small farmer and aid the diversification. It not only produces honey wax and propolis, but also enhances pollination and increases fruit tree production. Small animals for fiber production could also add to the diversification, such as the fiber yielding English Angora rabbit. The Ohio climate is ideal for Angora rabbits and the ease with which it is grown makes it an ideal product for diversification on an animal farm. In order to make the small farmer sustainable, it is essential to conserve natural prairies and wetland in the area. Ninety percent (90%) of the native prairies and wetlands are lost to land-use pattern changes in Ohio; therefore, what remains has to be carefully conserved and managed in order them to play a role in the environment. Natural wetlands, apart from cleaning up the water and providing a stock of underground water, also harbor rare plants and animals that aid in the sustainability of the farmer.This project proposes to develop methods to measure the biological integrity of the wetlands through long-term monitoring. It is envisaged to expand the research capability of CSU inorder to 1) develop novel plant-based products and suggest alternative crops for small farmers. 2) identify varieties of rabbits for fiber and 3) develop winter-hardy, mite-resistant honey bees. It is the small farmer, federal and state agencies, that manage prairies and wetlands that will most benefit from this research project."

While prominent in the Southeast, bermudagrass does have its limitations from a grazed ecosystems standpoint. It requires large amounts of fertility and the forage quality of bermudagrass is moderate at best, especially relative to other potential forage options. While bermudagrass provides a significant contribution to the forage-base of most livestock production systems within the region, in recent years it has become increasingly susceptible to insect pest damage, specifically the bermudagrass stem maggot (BSM). This has made these primarily grass-based ecosystems incur greater production risks, decreasing overall system sustainability for livestock producers within the region. There has been great success and a growing interest in interseeding high-quality legumes, such as alfalfa, into existing bermudagrass stands. This combination reduces the need for commercial nitrogen fertilization, increases relative forage quality (RFQ) by 30+ points, better meeting the nutritional needs of livestock, decreases the need for supplemental feed, and increases aboveground sward-species diversity, reducing the damage done by the BSM. Many interseeding demonstrations have been conducted across Georgia in a large variety of soil types related to hay production systems. In that work, it has been proven that alfalfa can be successfully established into bermudagrass. However, many of these projects have focused solely on yield and forage quality of bermudagrass-alfalfa mixtures as a dry hay. This work now needs to be expanded to other forage management scenarios, specifically baleage and grazing systems within the region. Little work has addressed the practicality of using alfalfa-bermudagrass mixtures as baleage or within pastures, nor has it evaluated the change in sward diversity on expected animal productivity and soil-plant-nutrient interactions. Thus, research and educational efforts are needed that will quantify these improvements in orderto evaluate whether the integration of alfalfa intoexisting predominately bermudagrass forage systems is feasible in the Southeast. These strategies are needed to determine if the integration of alfalfa can decrease risk in forage-based livestock systems within the Southeast. This project will determine the relative contributions of alfalfa-bermudagrass mixtures to forage based cattle ecosystems within the Southeast. The overall objective of this project are to assess the suitability of incorporating alfalfa into bermudagrass from an animal-plantmanagement perspective.Note: Project does not use animals - we will be simulating grazing using mechanical harvests."

This falls under the standard research program area 5b.  Assessment of the impacts of genetic engineering on plant-pest interactions, including impacts on plant-pest populations . Field-evolved resistance has developed in populations of corn ear-feeding species of Lepidoptera, including the western bean cutworm (WBC). This has resulted in feeding on transgenic corn plants that express Bt toxins despite the use of the high-dose refuge (HDR) strategy in Environmental Protection Agency-mandated lepidopteran insect resistance management (IRM) plans. Aspects of plant-insect interactions may contribute to this rapid accumulation of Bt resistance among insect populations, including WBC resistance to Cry1Fa transgenic corn. The potential exists for a similar fate with the newly commercialized Vip3A toxins if current shortfalls in IRM strategies remain unaddressed. In the proposal, WBC will be used as a model for corn ear-feeding Lepidoptera. Assumptions of the HDR strategy will be addressed by Objective 1: Evaluate WBC mortality following different toxin exposures; Objective 2: Evaluate the effect of cross pollination on refuge strategies on larval survival; Objective 3: Determine instar-specific movement of WBC larvae. All Objectives will evaluate potentials for WBC survival on different toxin exposures, and determine the effects on the accumulation of resistance alleles in the WBC population. Outcomes from this proposal will provide critical data for stakeholders (e.g. Industry registrants) and governmental agencies (e.g. Environmental Protection Agency) responsible for the development and implementation of IRM plans for plant-incorporated protectants (i.e. transgenic corn)."

The United States enjoys the most productive and abundant supply on earth but too much of the food goes to waste  says Tom Vilsack. By reducing wasted food in landfills, we cut harmful methane emissions that fuel climate change, conserve our natural resources, and protect our planet for future generations  says EPA Administrator Gina McCarty.Food waste is the single largest component of solid waste in US landfills. The EPA estimates this amounts to 34 million tons with an extimated cost of $1.3 billion (Schwab, 2013). While there are multiple efforts to reduce and recycle food waste, only 3% is recycled (EPA, 2012). These food wastes are lost at multiple levels of the food supply and consumption chain.Therefore, it is clear that food waste is an increasing concern.The EPA has published the Food Waste Hierarchy (EPA 2012) that identifies best practices for managing food waste. After source reduction and reuse feeding hungry people, the highest recycling priority is converting food waste to animal feed. This is ahead of industrial recycling options such as anaerobic digestion, composting, and ahead of landfills.Feed is the largest single cost item for livestock and poultry production, accounting for 60% to 70% of the total cost in many years (Naylor, 2005). The demand for feed corn has been impacted by the use of corn for ethanol raising the cost of feed for livestock producers and adding to the volatility of prices.Our proposal will prove the feasibilty of diverting food waste to animal feed. This will offer hog producers a viable nutritionally beneficial alternative to corn and soybean meal.Our mobile modular food waste processor (MMFWP) is a patent pending vessel that collects food waste from food waste generators. The food wastecollected and contained in the MMFWP tank is delivered to a central location, the tank with the food waste still contained within is unloaded from the vehicle, and the tank hooked up to a heat transfer unit. Through a thermal process, the food waste is dehydrated to a level of 12% or less eliminating the potential for pathogen regrowth and allowing for a shelf life.In this thermal process, the pathogens are killed while not degrading the nutritional content of the food waste.The patent pending MMFWP has been built as a prototype and successfully operated.The goal of the proposal in Phase 1 is:1) To validate to hog producers that converting food waste to animal feed with the technology applied by the MMFWP has equivalent if not superior nutritional benefits compared to soybean meal and corn. This is critical to the business model by ensuring an outlet for the animal feed. 2) To validate that this nutritional benefit is indeed digestible by swine even after the thermal processing. Again necessary to give confidence to hog producers that the output has been proven to be an acceptable source of animal feed. This then supports the economics of the business model dependent on the feed market for the sale of the output.3) To establish the bench mark price of the output. Pricing the output is critical to building a viable commercial operation.For this proposal, arrangements have been made to collect food waste from three generators and process the food waste utilizing the MMFWP:1) Fish distributor/processor (fish waste)2) Produce distributor/processor (fruitand vegetable waste)3) Grocery store (mixed food wastes). A good representation of the heterogenity of food waste expected from generators such as restaurants andcafeterias. It will be a broad mix of waste from the deli (both hot &amp; cold), butcher department, fruits and vegetables, bakery and dairy.The proposal includes critical research performed by the the University of Minneaota Department of Animal Science under the direction of Dr. Gerald Shurson and Dr. Pedro Urriola both of whom are swine specialists.THe processed food waste (output) will be transported to the University of Minnesota Southern Research Center in Waseca, Minnesota. At this site, through established testing methods, 36 pigs will be fed the output. Targeted nutritional components will be analyzed for digestibility of the processed food waste by swine.Preliminary results from operating the MMFWP have shown the nutritional content of the output is comparable to corn and soy bean meal. With the proposed research, we will demonstrate that the processed food waste and the nutritional content of the output is also digestible by swine. This is critical in satisfying any concerns from hog producers that processed food waste can be a viable alternative to current feeding diets.The impact could be considerable:1) The University of Minnesota Department of Animal Science estimates 125 million market pigs couldbe fed on food waste (Dr. Pedro Urriola, 2015) making a significant reduction in the pressure of planting corn and soy beans for feeding these pigs.2) Food waste could now be viewed as a resource with economic benefits. Eliminating landfilling and contributing to a cleaner environment.3) Once digestibility is proven and the benchmark pricing for the output is established, the potential commercial application is promising. The MMFWP is designed to easily scale to meet the market sizes of any metro area, to easily add capacity as the supply of food waste and demand for animal feed grows. The system has a relatively low capital cost compared to current alternatives such as anaerobic digesters and composting facilities and will cost no more than a single refuse truck. Our process produces an animal feed that will be nutritionally benefical to swine and pathogen free. It will be dried to allow for a shelf life and the ability to ship to hog producers regardless of location."

With funding from the Community Food Project Grant, there will be an immediate increase of 20%-30% of the supply of fresh food during the first year into Kansas City&#39;s most impoverished neighborhoods.The center of this project is Ivanhoe; the poorest neighborhood in the Lower East Side of Kansas City, Missouri. A statistical overview of the community targeted for this project; an inner-city community of ~10,000 in the neighborhood of Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe has a density of 5,186 people per square mile. Approximately 63.8% of Ivanhoe Southwest&#39;s population has an annual household income below $25,000 which means that most residents live in low-income households. The neighborhood is 90% African-American and most of the population has only attained a high school degree, which suggests that this is a poorly-educated neighborhood. Roughly 40% of the land in Ivanhoe is vacant or abandoned.This Community Food Project is to help Good Natured Market overcome obstacles in order to get as much healthy, local food as possible into homes in Kansas City&#39;s vulnerable communities through increased food inventory, site improvements, promotion, EBT incentives and memberships. This initiative will directly lead to significant, measurable sales increases. This program is vitally significant because it addresses a problem that is plaguing inner-cities throughout the United States.Inner-cities have very few grocery stores; what is still the only source of food is the local convenience store. The only thing convenient about it is the location. There are very few healthy items you can buy at such stores, usually a few loaves of white bread, milk, and eggs. Limited access to affordable quality fresh food in many urban areas all over American has increased the problem of childhood obesity and diabetes. There is a direct link to the startling numbers of childhood obesity, juvenile diabetes, as well as diabetes developed in adults years later, after growing up in food deserts. In 2004 study from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found, $1 could buy 1,200 calories of potato chips and 875 calories of soda, but only 250 calories of vegetables and 170 calories of fresh fruit. This is why we must look at accessibility and affordability if we want to change what people are eating in the urban areas.Good Natured Family Farms, the workhorse extention of the 501(c)(3) Kansas City Food Hub (AKA The Food Conservancy) is vastly experienced in providing healthy, local food to Kansas City residents, specifically minorities and low-income persons. Effective relationships, partnerships, and strategic use of federal and private foundation grant funds for worthy causes have led GNFF&#39;s small-farm, marketing alliance of over 150 farmer members to become a premier provider of local, healthy food to vulnerable populations.Additionally, GNFF has pioneered a nationally-recognized Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) pilot and many other food-related projects. GNFF&#39; mission is to support local farmers and to provide access of wholesome, fresh food to needy populations. As such, GNFF has developed many strong, working relationships and linkages with community-focused organizations in the Kansas City region; a few examples: Bistro Kids and Treat America to bring fresh, wholesome foods to kids, University of Missouri, Beans&amp;Greens, Menorah Legacy Society, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, United States Department of Agriculture, Ball&#39;s Food (Hen House and Price Chopper stores), Sysco Food Distribution, and many more.What will be interesting to note and track during this project&#39;s time period:  To what degree will making fresh food more available and affordable in inner-city communities change the food choices of this targeted population?  The year-end evaluation, which includes a customer survey, plus sales tracking from the upgraded scanning computer, will help to enlighten us in this query.The Final Report will include significant data collected throughout the year on how better eating habits are linked to fresh food availability and affordability - and the effectiveness of using a clergy coalition in promoting and encouraging its inner-city parishioners to use Good Natured Market&#39;s generous EBT incentives for fresh food."

However, one of the major limitations for feeding high-forage rations is decreased milk production and nutrient use efficiency and increased outputs of nitrogen (e.g.,N2O in manure) and carbon (as enteric CH4) to the environment. On the other hand, energy-dense forages may improve the balance and synchrony of water soluble carbohydrates and nitrogen release in the rumen of dairy cows, while increasing organic matter digestibility ultimately reducing nitrogen and methane outputs to the environment. Perennial legumes and grasses grown in mixtures and selected to increase forage quality via energy-dense stored feeds (e.g., baleage) have strong potential to increase milk production and decrease greenhouse gas emissions of dairy farms transitioning to organic agriculture. However, the feasibility of maintaining species composition within legume-grass mixtures throughout the growing season during multiple cropping years remains to be determined. It is also unknown how microbial fermentation impacts the energy to nitrogen ratio of legume-grass mixtures when they are harvested as stored feeds. This project will fill these knowledge gaps by advancing the scientific understanding about how potential changes in species persistence and forage botanical composition in various legume-grass mixtures across multiple years affect forage quality and stored feed fermentation characteristics and, consequently, milk production and greenhouse gases emissions when fed to organic dairy cows. Through this project, we will partner with three organic dairy farmers in the Northeast who will set up demonstration plots and coordinate field days, thus becoming peer leaders in their rural communities. With guidance and evaluation provided by a Research and Extension Advisory Board, we will enhance learning opportunities among other organic dairy farmers, researchers, educators, and general public via workshops, field days, social media, newsletters, and webinars."

Research in plant breeding, genetics, genomics and other methods improve cropcharacteristics (80%).a. Product taste, quality and appearance, b. Environmental responses and tolerances, d. Pest and disease management, including resistance to pests and disease resulting in reduced application management strategies. We will investigate the feasibility of R gene pyramiding for durable resistance.2. Identify and address threats from pests and diseases (20%). The proposed work includes the use of molecular markers to investigate genetic diversity among isolates of Anisogramma anomala, the causal fungus of eastern filbert blight (EFB). We will also collect Corylus germplasm, evaluate accessions for response to EFB inoculation, and study the inheritance of resistance from our native Corylus americana.Note that production is the primary system, although components address the consumer and markets system (human nutrition and health, vitality of rural communities).Critical stakeholder needs addressed and long-term goals. Hazelnuts are a profitable, high-value, low input, sustainable crop for which steadily increasing world demand now exceeds supply and stakeholders (from producers through consumers) show a significant desire for expanded US production. However, susceptibility to eastern filbert blight (EFB) caused by the fungus Anisogramma anomala and the limited climatic adaptation of existing cultivars severely limit production in the eastern and Midwestern regions and threaten the sustainability of current production in Oregon. The genetic resources and knowledge to overcome these limiting factors now exist. This SREP  Center of Excellence  project leverages substantial resources and prior investments to develop genomic tools for hazelnut (Approach 1), study gene expression following EFB inoculation (Approach 2), map dominant R genes and study R gene Genomic tools, genetic resources, and outreach to expand commercial U.S. hazelnut production - 7 pyramids and resistance in Corylus americana (Approach 3), enhance Corylus americana germplasm collections (Approach 4), improve knowledge of the pathogen A. anomala (Approach 5), identify superior cultivars and pollenizers (Approach 6), and bolster and implement strategic, coordinated outreach efforts (Approach 7) to address these limiting factors in a targeted, effective, and comprehensive way with longterm goals that include: a) the expanded planting of hazelnut as a food crop, b) the development of new economic options for producers and entrepreneurs, and c) the improvement of national food security by enhancing crop, farm system, and product diversity, adaptation to climatic fluctuations, and improved disease resistance.Outreach plan. Our outreach plan (Approach 7, pg. 27) will directly engage new and existing stakeholder groups and address stakeholder concerns and needs that are related but vary across three climatic zones: the Pacific Northwest where commercial production now exists and is rapidly expanding; the temperate  Fruit Belt  region of the eastern US, where new EFB-resistant cultivars are expected to be released in 3-4 years; and the Midwest and Great Plains, where new hybrids are in the process of being identified with superior nut quality, yield, and adaptation to demanding climates. We will use comprehensive, coordinated, and innovative high-touch, high-tech outreach approaches for education and training activities in the three regions bolstered by demonstration trials and new cooperator field trials, including field tours and  edutainment  events, social media campaigns, stakeholder trainings, and webinars, with publications and presentations focused on the translation of new knowledge and practical applications to engage new and existing local, regional, and national partner stakeholder groups. The Oregon industry has many newcomers who need educational programs. In the Fruit Belt, an emphasis will be placed on  train-the-trainer  meetings early in the project to rapidly disseminate knowledge in support of the first cultivar releases for the region (to be made during this grant period). Targeted, comprehensive, and coordinated national outreach efforts will also be made through the PI institution&#39;s web resources and social media, including the Arbor Day Foundation&#39;s extensive national membership and related partner connections via their educational website devoted to hybrid hazelnuts and a print newsletter that reaches one million people per year, and a hybrid hazelnut membership program with 80,000 members.Potential economic, social, and environmental benefits. Extensive and strong national/international markets (currently $3.26 billion) exist for hazelnut products and powerful environmental and economic benefits (for producers and rural communities) would be generated by large-scale production of hybrid hazelnuts in the US. Hazelnuts are an ideal choice to integrate into profitable, sustainable agricultural or agroforestry production systems, and are family-friendly for small producers focused on local food issues. Hazelnuts could become a  third crop  in the Midwest and Great Plains (along with corn and soybeans), and have considerable value as a specialty crop in eastern states (Fruit Belt region). Environmental benefits of hazelnut production include reduced runoff and soil erosion, enhanced water quality, relatively few inputs of fertilizers and pesticides, improved wildlife habitats, and increased carbon sequestration - impacts that benefit farm families and residents of both rural and urban communities. Further, they can be grown without irrigation in many regions and do not require bees for pollination. Hazelnut kernels are widely recognized for their health promoting effects, have a long storage life, and have robust local-to-international markets for a variety of value-added products. The economic potential of hazelnut is documented by Oregon&#39;s annual acreage increase (3,000 acres since 2009), world annual production (870,000 metric tons/year), the wholesale price/pound of dry, unshelled nuts ($1.70) and the world annual hazelnut revenue ($3.26 billion). Across the central states, many producers looking to diversify their operations beyond corn and soybeans have shown intense interest in hazelnuts. Ten-year average yields of superior selections grown in field trials in NE indicate that net returns from hybrid hazelnuts will likely compete very well with or exceed returns from agronomic crops."

The long term goal for this integrated project (Research, Education), based on extensive feedback from growers, is to develop a comprehensive and economically viable model to address soil health issues in high tunnels across a wide geographic reach, resulting in increased adoption of practices such as legume cover crop incorporation that promotes sustainable management of organic high tunnels and financial stability for farmers. We propose to evaluate a range of farmer-selected rotations in three distinct regions ranging from the far north to the south, build a predictive understanding of soil quality management and economics of season extension, and facilitate knowledge exchange via University coursework, organic information clearinghouses (hightunnels.org, eOrganic), and community partners (NGOs), with a focused emphasis on limited-resource farmers and historically underrepresented groups. We will develop three organic agriculture course modules, a hands-on short course addressing issues and applicability of high tunnels for limited-resource growers, a mobile nutrient management phone app, and a webinar series. We will also work closely with NRCS&#39; new Division of Soil Health to connect to existing resources, network farmers, and expand resources via our project results.

Most growers manage wireworms with prophylactic seed treatments of neonicotinoid insecticides because few other options are available. Our goal is to evaluate alternative integrated pest management (IPM) tactics for wireworms in cereal crops that would allow growers to reduce their use of prophylactic seed-applied neonicotinoids in cereal crops. We will achieve three complementary objectives: (1) Investigate the use of entomopathogenic pathogens as a complement or replacement to neonicotinoid seed treatments in wheat and barley crops; (2) Examine whether the use of pesticides in rotational legume crops provides benefits for wireworm control in subsequent cereal crops; and (3) Develop an extension program focused on wireworms. Overall, our project will develop new tactics for wireworms that are cost-effective and targeted for specific species and environmental conditions. Our research could have broad applicability beyond cereals as the resurgence of wireworms is a matter of national concern, with over 45 crops affected. Our project addresses three CPPM Focus Areas: (1)  Plant Protection Tactics  (by developing IPM tactics for a major crop pest); (2)  Diversified IPM Systems  (by evaluating IPM strategies that integrate biological, cultural, and insecticidal controls); and (3)  Developing the Next Generation of IPM Scientists  (by training two MS students in IPM tactics and extension)."

Many organic produce farms are diverse, based on the notion that crop diversity increases ecosystem services such as pollination. However, while crop diversity often correlates with bee diversity, the relationship between crop diversity and pollination services remains largely untested. In this proposal we propose two objectives to assess whether farm diversity promotes pollination: (1) determine the effect of crop diversity on pollination services and (2) develop a citizen science program to assess whether plant diversity increases pollinator diversity and function. Our project stems from two years of cooperation with an engaged group of organic farmers in western WA. To achieve the first objective, we will compare pollination services in experimental mesocosms containing a single crop (runner bean) to those containing the Three Sisters polyculture system (runner bean, corn, and zucchini). To achieve the second objective, we will work with a network of 40 citizen scientists to evaluate bee diversity and pollination services on diversified compared with low-diversity organic farms in western WA. Our project will provide insight into whether farmers can directly increase pollination services provided by wild bees by diversifying the crops grown on their farms. If so, it would provide an incentive for organic farmers to transition away from monoculture-based production systems. Accordingly, our project aligns with the USDA AFRI goal of Increasing Agricultural and Natural Resource Sustainability while addressing the Plant Health and Production foundational area and the Food Security challenge area."

Corn is the most important crop in the USA and globally. Drought stress is the most important limitation for corn production in the USA and globally, and drought stress is expected to become more severe in coming decades as a result of global climate change. We have observed that corn lines with a large number of small vessels perform better under drought. In this project we will confirm and extend these results, and also identify genes that are responsible for this natural variation.Defining and understanding traits improving the drought tolerance of crops is needed to breed crop varieties with better yield, better drought tolerance, and less reliance on irrigation. Insufficient information exists regarding the value of xylem vessels in crop breeding. Should the importance of xylem vessels for drought tolerance be demonstrated, an entirely new tool will be available for targeted crop improvement. This project will provide validated breeding targets, germplasm sources, molecular markers, and candidate genes that could be used directly in maize breeding. Our close collaboration with maize geneticists will ensure that any useful results will be readily applied in the maize community. While this project focuses on maize, xylem vessels may also be useful breeding targets in wheat, rice, legumes, and other crops. This project therefore addresses novel scientific issues that are of demonstrable relevance to human welfare."

First, we will assemble a yellow bean diversity collection of 200 bean lines with origins encompassing the two major regions of bean domestication. We will compile genotypic information on the lines through DNA markers. The collection will be evaluated for agronomic characteristics and end use attributes, including convenience, nutrition, and taste. Secondly, a bean population developed from two yellow parental lines with contrasting cooking times, iron nutritional value, and palatability will be evaluated similarly.

These forage crops respond to rather high rates of fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, and near monoculture stands of these grasses have often been maintained. Economics, environmental concerns, and less-predictable weather patterns combine to indicate a need for enhanced options for perennial forage crops in the region, even though these perennial forage crops have represented superior conservation options on erosive and marginal soils of the region for decades. Natural ecosystems have been used to suggest that biodiversity can be used to enhance sustainable production and ecosystem services from such agricultural enterprises as forage crops. It is ascertained from previous research that combinations of species are complementary in their pattern of resource use and can increase productivity and nutrient retention but plant species diversity in forage crop production has not been well explored.The research conducted under this proposal will determine the feasibility of introducing plant diversity into warm-season perennial grass systems to enhance soil properties and subsequent herbage production. Annual cool-season species will be over-seeded (no-till or minimum-till planting) into a warm-season perennial sod each fall. The over-seeded crops will include species from several plant functional groups such as grass, legume and brassica. Species within each functional group will be planted separately and in combination with other functional groups. Herbage production will be monitored through the growing season using a relatively frequent and relatively infrequent harvest schedule. Another management strategy allowing the over-seeded crop to grow full season and then mulching will also be employed. Measured herbage mass will be analyzed for nutrient characteristics. Chemical, physical and biological soil parameters will be monitored through lab analyses of soil samples collected periodically during the study. Results from this study will provide insight into the potential for these management strategies to possibly enhance herbage production and soil function. Rangeland and permanent pasture production based on ecological processes with reduced dependence on chemical inputs has tremendous potential to enhance sustainability of the regions overall agriculture. The production systems evaluated in these studies could potentially contribute broader scale ecosystem benefits ranging from wildlife habitat, pollinator habitat, water quality protection, and rural recreation plus income diversification in some single-crop production areas."

We will also identify candidate insect RNAi suppressor genes by a genome-scale association study between genetic variation in pea aphids and RNAi-responsiveness; and then validate these genes by stacking RNAi against the candidate gene with essential insect genes. Building on preliminary evidence that RNAi against suppressor genes substantially improves RNAi efficacy, this project will provide a qualitative advance in RNAi against phloem-feeding aphids and whiteflies, and can be adapted readily to other key phloem-feeding pests, notably psyllids, coccids, leafhoppers and planthoppers."

They are different from the majority of plant species because they have beneficial associations with a particular type of bacteria in their roots. These bacteria (from the genus Rhizobium) are capable of converting atmospheric nitrogen to a form that plants can use through a process called nitrogen fixation. When the plants die, some of this additional nitrogen is returned to the soil leading to higher soil fertility. Farmers have known this for years: they rotate nitrogen-fixing and non-fixing species in their fields to improve crop and fiber production. However, the ability to access additional nitrogen through these bacteria has a cost. Plants give the bacteria sugar in exchange for this nitrogen. Some legume species (facultative fixers) have the ability to terminate the bacterial colonies when they are growing in fertile soil, which allows the plant to use that sugar for other functions like growth and reproduction. Some legume species (obligate fixers) cannot adjust the relationship with their bacterial partners and this may have wide-reaching effects on leaf and root physiology. This project will identify legume species with facultative and obligate fixation strategies and examine how fixation strategy relates to a number of leaf and root physiological processes. Facultative fixers, by optimally regulating fixation to match nutritional demand, should align more with current models of leaf economics and plant carbon gain than obligate fixers and have higher performance under conditions of high soil fertility. Twenty-four legume species will be grown in a greenhouse setting and a suite of leaf, root, and plant-level traits will be measured. Obligate fixers should have lower rates of photosynthesis and growth and higher root respiratory costs. Understanding how nitrogen fixation strategies influence plant performance has strong implications for agriculture and agroforestry by paving the way for genetic improvements to maximize productivity by improving the efficiency of nitrogen use by legumes. This project will also train high school and undergraduate students through hands-on research, which may increase their success in science courses and lead to careers in science."

Grain legumes are typically grown in rotation with cereal grains, including wheat and corn. This rotation is advantageous for multiple reasons. Studies suggest that it may disrupt the life-cycle of diverse pathogens, while promoting symbiosis with rhizobacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia which benefits legume roots. Grain legumes also complement the nutritional qualities of small cereal grains. U.S. agriculture currently generates 18.2M cwt of dry pea and 2.5M cwt of chickpea annually, with the northern states leading in production volume. Given the increasing global demand for vegetable protein that will be needed in coming years, the U.S. is well-positioned to establish itself as an even larger exporter of these crops with successful breeding programs. In the last two decades, advancements in DNA sequencing and molecular technologies have significantly improved plant breeding. Phenotyping is a key adjunct to these genomics approaches, which allows for thorough evaluation of desirable plant traits and confident se-lection of high-performing breeding lines that can be widely distributed. Unfortunately, the capacity for high-throughput plant phenotyping is non-existent due to the lack of applicable sensing and automation technologies that are well-established and able to be implemented into breeding programs. Therefore, a critical need exists to develop sensor-based approaches for high-throughput crop phenotyping that rapidly and accurately assess breeding materials and bring this important analysis into the 21st century. The overall goal of this research is to develop novel and advanced sensing tools that enable accurate and unbiased plant phenotyping at a rapid pace using grain legume as a target crop. Besides being important for sustainable cereal crop production through efficient rotation, such efforts will ultimately result in improved selection of high yielding legume crop varieties that can be grown in the U.S. In addition, these phenotyping techniques can be easily adapted to other crops."

This project aims to reduce crop loss (optimize disease control) for white mold in snap beans by improved detection of spectral and structural signatures associated with disease severity related to flower phenology and canopy architecture and density, respectively. The effect of canopy density on white mold severity will be modeled to develop a site-specific disease risk model to facilitate reduced fungicide usage when not economically justified. Hyperspectral imagery and lidar data will be obtained using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to fully capture the benefits of precision agriculture for applied agronomic outcomes. Outcomes will be immediately available for adoption by industry and growers using currently available sensors and UAS. Dissemination of research findings is ensured through our partnership with Cornell Cooperative Extension. Industry and grower engagement and adoption will be maximized by their pledge to strongly support the project in an advisory role. This project offers a unique opportunity to realize the benefits of precision agriculture to reduce crop loss from this important disease by providing robust and reliable support to agronomic decisions influencing profitability and productivity."

However, only 10% of Missouri&#39;s calf crop are finished in the state, representing a loss of 1.0 billion dollars. A goal of Governor Nixon&#39;s 2015 Agriculture Initiative is to retain some of this value in Missouri. Profitability of beef production in Missouri can also be enhanced by management strategies that optimize nitrogen use. Methods to increase nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) include adding supplemental feed or forage legumes and utilizing cattle management practices that evenly distribute excreta across the pasture.The NUE of beef and forage production will be studied in two separate experiments conducted during 2017 and 2018. Experiments in northeast Missouri will study the addition of sunn hemp, a warm season forage legume on productivity of stocker-cattle production, while experiments in southwest Missouri will study the role of supplemental feed on grass-based cattle finishing systems. Results from the two studies will be used to identify practices that improve NUE and economic returns.Beef producers need the economic and environmental information generated by this research project to enhance the sustainability of their enterprises. However, Missouri State University (MSU) lacks the institutional framework and culture associated with outreach and extension programs found at land-grant institutions. Therefore, a collaboration with the University of Missouri (MU) will be developed to incorporate MSU research into MU Extension programs and the establishment of an annual Beef and Forage Field Day hosted by MSU in cooperation with MU Extension. In addition, we propose the development of the Beef Environment and Economics Forum (BEEF) website to promote MSU research of interest to beef producers.Students seeking degrees related to cattle production require relevant experiential learning opportunities as part of their undergraduate curriculum. This program is designed to provide real-world training for students interested in career opportunities in beef production and marketing. The program will also enhance the incorporation of the Shealy Farm in the teaching program at MSU and broaden student experiences through partnership with MU.The long-term goals of the project are to demonstrate sustainable forage-based beef production finishing systems in Missouri, provide high-impact educational experiences for MSU students, and enhance outreach through strengthened linkages between MSU and MU. We expect: 1) to demonstrate that N fertilizer applications can be reduced when nutrients added to pastures as supplemental feed or forage legumes are accounted for, which will optimize economic returns; 2) to improve student learning as a result of experiential learning opportunities; and 3) to enhance MSU outreach activities by establishing a precedence for MSU-hosted field days, which will encourage producer implementation of sustainable forage management systems."

Most individuals with lung cancer die of their disease because of drug resistance, invasion andmetastases, features closely linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells(CSCs). Importantly, this resistant phenotype includes targeted agents (e.g., EGFR inhibitors), conventionalchemotherapy, radiation, and escape from immune destruction by upregulation of PD-L1. The identificationand therapeutic targeting of molecules contributing to the aggressive and resistant properties of lung cancercells are key to tumor cell eradication and cure. Recently, we discovered that TGFβ-mediated EMT involvesupregulation of the cell surface receptor, Neuropilin-2 (NRP2). Importantly, NRP2 knockdown inhibits TGFβ-mediated migration, invasion, metastasis and tumorsphere formation, a feature of CSCs. More recently, wediscovered that TGFβ induces the preferential translation of a previously uninvestigated isoform, NRP2b,which is identical to the prototype NRP2a in its extracellular domain, but diverges substantially before thetransmembrane segment to encode a distinct, yet highly evolutionarily conserved, C-terminus. Our studiesdemonstrate that NRP2a and NRP2b have opposing effects on tumorigenesis, with NRP2b specificallypromoting tumorigenesis, as well as signaling from the receptor tyrosine kinase, MET. The isoforms also differin their binding to the PDZ domain protein, GIPC1, which is specific to NRP2a, and which is also known tofunction in receptor endocytosis and trafficking. Importantly, mutations that disrupt NRP2a-GIPC1 binding donot result in NRP2b-like activities, whereas C-terminal deletions of NRP2b attenuate its ability to enhancemigration. These results suggest that the NRP2b C-terminus is critical to its pro-tumorigenic properties, whichmay result from differential interactions or trafficking of cell surface receptors, including MET. Understandingthe mechanistic underpinnings of how NRP2b functions has therapeutic implications. This may come fromidentifying which cooperating receptors are most important, or elucidating the mechanisms by which NRP2baffects receptor trafficking, thus suggesting new therapeutic strategies. Aim 1 will use genetic approaches tofurther examine the role of MET in NRP2b function and tumorigenesis, as well as determine if NRP2 isoformsdifferentially interact with MET, or affect its endocytosis, trafficking and recycling. In addition, we will examinepatient samples for co-expression of NRP2b along with markers of MET activation and EMT. Aim 2 will test thehypothesis that the effects of NRP2b on MET can be generalized to other receptors. Their contribution toNRP2b function and tumorigenesis will be examined. In Aim 3, we will use site-specific mutagenesis anddomain swaps to identify critical residues in the 93 amino acid NRP2b C-terminus (JM, TM and cytoplasmicsegments) responsible for its distinct activity. The JM segment is unique, extracellular and predicted to beantigenic. We will make monoclonal antibodies against this segment and test them for specificity and inhibitoryactivity. NRP2b represents a highly innovative avenue of research, which can be exploited for therapeutic gain.In addition, EMT plays a major role in inflammation, fibrosis and normal development, where the role of NRP2bis unknown. Thus, our proposed studies should have broad applicability to lung cancer and other humandiseases."

PEComasarise most commonly at visceral (especially gastrointestinal and uterine), retroperitoneal, andabdominopelvic sites. Most PEComa lesions are benign and slow-progressing, however, a small subsetof them are malignant PEComas, with an aggressive clinical course including distant metastases andultimate death. Malignant PEComa is extremely rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.12-0.24/1,000,000 or approximately 42-84 new patients per year, and an estimated prevalence of 0.22-0.48/1,000,000 or approximately 77-168 patients in the United States.Currently, no effective medical treatment has been prospectively investigated or approved for advancedmalignant PEComa, including metastatic or locally advanced disease where surgery is not an option.The prognosis for these patients is poor, with an estimated median survival of 12-17 months.Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not demonstrated significant clinical benefit. Therefore, asignificant unmet need exists for effective therapies to treat this aggressive and life-threatening disease.The cytosolic kinase mTOR plays a major role in cell survival and proliferation. Limited case studiessuggest that the mTOR pathway is frequently deregulated in sporadic malignant PEComa (mostly withmutation or loss of TSC2), making mTOR inhibition a promising therapeutic strategy. Rapamycin blocksmTORC1 signaling, resulting in decreased protein translation and G1 cell cycle arrest. In some casestudies, patients with PEComa benefited from treatment with mTOR inhibitors, including oral rapamycin.Oral mTOR inhibitors have low and highly variable oral bioavailability, poor solubility, and dose-limitingGI toxicities and require therapeutic monitoring of blood levels to ensure adequate dosing. A novelalbumin-bound nanoparticle rapamycin (sirolimus) was developed (nab-rapamycin, ABI-009; originallyby Abraxis Bioscience/Celgene Corporation and licensed to AADi, LLC). In a phase 1 clinical study,ABI-009 administered intravenously showed a promising safety despite high dose with evidence ofresponses and stable disease in a variety of solid tumors. Albumin bound drugs have shown enhancedtumor penetration, and ABI-009 shows significantly improved activity in animal models at equal doseand superior pharmacological properties with significantly higher Cmax and AUC without compromisingsafety as compared to the available mTOR inhibitors.AADi, LLC, a small start-up company and applicant for this grant, has filed IND 125,669 (submitted Jul13, 2015 and approved Aug 13, 2015) to conduct a single arm phase 2 clinical study (NCT02494570) toassess the efficacy and safety of intravenous ABI-009 for advanced (locally advanced and metastatic)malignant PEComa. There are no other ongoing trials for this patient population. Thirty-five patients willbe enrolled and the primary endpoint will be ORR; the secondary endpoints will be duration of response(DOR), PFS rate at 6 months, PFS, OS, and safety/tolerability. PK/PD and tumor biomarkers will beanalyzed as correlative and translational components to determine mechanisms of tumor response andresistance. In agreement with the FDA (DOP2) in a pre-IND meeting, this single-arm study design andstatistical considerations may be sufficient to support a marketing application for ABI-009 in advancedPEComa [Appendix - Attachment 2: AADi-FDA Pre-IND Meeting Minutes 7/7/2015] if the primaryendpoint of ORR is of sufficient magnitude and duration. As of the date of this grant resubmission, all 9of the planned US clinical sites have been IRB approved and activated. From April 2016 to October2016 (date of the resubmission), 7 patients have been enrolled in the study.This program represents a unique opportunity to develop and get approval of a new drug withpotentially improved efficacy and safety over existing therapies, for an extremely rare disease andpatient population for which there are no approved therapies."

As a result, the Consortium to AlleviatePTSD (CAP) was formed to a) significantly advance treatment strategies for PTSDincluding interventions for early, chronic, and latent onset cases, and b) to identify andconfirm clinically relevant biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of PTSDand co-occurring disorders. This project aims to fill gaps identified in the NRAP byexamining the validity of genetic-based biomarkers to identify PTSD, PTSD course, andresponse to PTSD treatment. We plan to leverage extensive existing resources in theSTRONG STAR Repository to examine a comprehensive set of genetic and epigeneticmarkers associated with PTSD. These resources include: (1) a collection of humanpostmortem tissue of PTSD (n=30) and matched control (n=60) brains; (2) a cohort ofservice members treated for PTSD with blood collected prior to treatment and at 6months post-treatment (n=600); and (3) an epidemiologic cohort of Soldiers assessedprior to and after deployment in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedomand New Dawn that included blood collection and PTSD assessment at eachassessment (n=4,112). Using a combination of whole-genome microarray andsequencing approaches, we will: (1) identify genetic (SNP, mRNA) or epigenetic (DNAmethylation, microRNA) alterations in PTSD; (2) characterize the neuronal morphologyof selected brain regions in PTSD and matched controls through Golgi impregnation; (3)identify top gene regulatory networks among the identified set of genes across thesamples to guide biomarker analyses; and (4) systematically identify, validate, and testbiomarkers based on the mRNA, SNPs, DNA methylation, and microRNA markers ofidentified genes. We have assembled a collaborative team of scientists consisting of agenetic epidemiologist (Dr. Williamson), a psychiatric geneticist (Dr. Gelernter), ageneticist (Dr. Carless), a neuroanatomist (Dr. Selemon), human postmortem experts(Drs.

However, providers worry that responding to patient injury by using a CRP could trigger involvement of regulators such as state medical boards with unpredictable and punitive consequences. We have collaborated with Washington State's board of medicine, the Medical Quality Assurance Commission (MQAC), to develop a novel and potentially groundbreaking fix, a process known as CRP Certification. CRP Certification involves a panel of CRP experts and patient advocates reviewing voluntarily submitted CRP cases to determine whether the response contained all the CRP key elements (early event reporting, disclosure to patient, event analysis and prevention planning, resolution with patient, disseminated learning). Cases meeting this standard will be  CRP Certified . It is anticipated that MQAC will close CRP Certified cases as satisfactorily resolved without imposing discipline. Cases involving gross incompetence, provider impairment, or boundary violations are not eligible. We propose a 3-year demonstration project of the CRP Certification Program with the following specific aims: 1) pilot test and evaluate the CRP Certification Program in Washington State; 2) expand and evaluate the CRP Certification Program in two additional states; 3) analyze policy and ethical questions associated with taking the CRP Certification Program to scale nationally. We anticipate that over the course of the project approximately 200 cases will be presented for review by the CRP Certification panel. We will conduct a multi-modal evaluation of the effectiveness of the CRP Certification Program. This will include: 1) descriptive analysis of cases presented for review and their disposition, including assessing case-level predictors of certification and case closure without discipline by the state board of medicine; 2) reviewing state board of medicine records to describe how the boards responded to CRP Certified cases; 3) conducting key informant interviews with institutional risk managers, liability insurers, board f medicine members, patient advocates, and participating physicians to explore their perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the CRP Certification Program; 4) holding focus groups with patient advocates; and 5) surveying physicians who submitted CRP Certification Applications. In addition, we will analyze core policy and ethical questions surrounding CRP Certification, including its potential relationship to National Practitioner Data Bank reporting requirements, extension to certification of high-performing institutional CRPs and link to possible pay-for-performance incentives, expansion to include other health professional boards and regulators, and suitability as a substitute for disciplinary action by state boards. Close collaboration between CRPs and state medical boards around the response to adverse events will be important to incentivize physician participation in CRPs, promote more robust use of all key CRP elements, and enhance patient-centered accountability and learning."

Legumes are integral to sustainable agricultural systems by virtue of symbiotic nitrogen fixation with bacteria called rhizobia, which injects 50 million tons of fixed-nitrogen into such systems annually. Legumes also form beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses with soil fungi, which enhance the acquisition of soil phosphorous and other nutrients. These two symbioses enable productive plant cultivation with less fertilizer, which reduces the environmental impact of agriculture.  Focusing on the legume species, Medicago truncatula this project will identify key plant genes required for symbiosis with bacteria and/or fungi and advance our understanding of what are arguably the two most important plant-microbe symbioses in agriculture. This project brings together seven research groups from six research and teaching institutions in five states to form a world-class, virtual center for legume symbiosis research that will generate great synergy and provide outstanding trans-disciplinary training opportunities in genomics, bioinformatics and other disciplines. Training will be provided at career levels ranging from postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, to undergraduate students with the aim of developing skillsets necessary for successful scientific careers. Outreach components of this project will engage high & middle school students, adults in the general public and children in educational and fun scientific experiences.

Focusing on the legume, Medicago truncatula this project will take advantage of a very large existing Tnt1 transposon-insertion mutant population for functional genomics of SNF and AM symbiosis. One hundred and ninety Tnt1 insertion mutants with novel Nod+Fix- or regulatory phenotypes have already been identified in a genome-wide non-biased forward genetic screen. New sequence-capture technologies will accelerate the identification of the causal mutations enabling the identification of new genes involved in nitrogen fixation and autoregulation of nodulation. Functional genomics activities, enabled by a large Tnt1 mutant population and indexed flanking sequence tag resource will focus on transporter proteins involved in nutrient transport during rhizobial and AM symbioses. A combination of Tnt1 mutants and mutants generated through CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing will be used to investigate a set of 138 genes conserved for AM symbiosis identified previously through a comparative phylogenomics approach. Together, these activities will identify key symbiotic genes and advance our understanding of two plant-microbe symbioses that are crucial for sustainable agriculture."

Poole (John Innes Centre, Oxford University, UK)Nitrogen is an essential element of biological molecules and life on earth.  Lack of usable nitrogen limits growth of microbes, plants, and animals. Scarcity of nitrogen in agricultural soils limits plant production of food, feed, fiber and fuel.  Nature solved the nitrogen limitation problem via evolution of biological nitrogen fixation in a type of bacteria, diazotrophs, that are able to reduce atmospheric N2 to NH3, which is readily assimilated into biological molecules.  Biological nitrogen fixation is promoted by a complex metal containing enzyme called nitrogenase, whose oxygen-sensitivity may explain its restricted distribution amongst bacteria.  Some plants, including most legumes and a few non-legumes form intimate, nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs that provide the plants with ammonia.  As a consequence, legumes have been an integral part of sustainable agricultural systems for thousands of years.  Unfortunately, many important food species, including the grasses maize/corn, rice, and wheat cannot establish effective nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs, making them dependent on nitrogenous fertilizers for high yield. Large-scale use of industrially-produced nitrogen-fertilizer has doubled the influx of nitrogen into the terrestrial biogeochemical nitrogen-cycle, with serious negative consequences for human health and the natural environment.   Therefore, the long-term sustainability of massive nitrogen-fertilizer inputs in agriculture has come into question. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators from the US and UK to solve the dual nitrogen problems of nitrogen-fertilizer over-use in developed countries and soil nitrogen-paucity in developing countries by developing effective endophytic (bacteria inside the root) and associative (bacteria attached outside the root) nitrogen-fixing symbioses in a model and a crop plant species.  The overarching goal of the project is to develop effective N2-fixing symbioses between the model C4-grass, Setaria viridis, as well as the related crop species, Zea mays, with the endophytic bacterium, Rhizobium sp. IRBG74, as well as the associative bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescenes Pf5.  Successful deployment of biological nitrogen fixation in model or crop grass species will pave the way for a second Green Revolution to increase crop yields for resource-poor farmers and decrease the use and environmental-impact of industrial nitrogen-fertilizers by wealthier farmers. This project will establish a powerful new model system for the study of plant-microbe interactions and demonstrate the power of synthetic biology in engineering new associative relationships and interdependencies that have the potential to be universal for all crop plants.  It will test this potential in the important crop, maize.  The integrated US-UK research partnership will provide a unique training opportunity for students and post-doctoral associates with active exchange of personnel between academic laboratories and research foundations in both countries.  Data and materials generated in the study including plasmid constructs and genetically modified bacterial and plant species will be made available via websites maintained in the US and the UK.  To broaden the impact of the work, traditional and non-traditional outreach strategies will be used to help K-12 teachers, students, and the public understand the fundamentals and benefits of interdisciplinary research and the implications of synthetic biology for the next generation of biotechnological solutions in agriculture."

Nitrogen is also one of the most important nutrients required by plants, and it is normally applied as fertilizer in agricultural systems. However, legumes have the ability to establish a symbiotic association with specialized nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria through the formation of root nodules where the bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen; the fixed nitrogen is used by the plant for protein synthesis. The symbionts have mechanisms that recognize molecular signals from each other, which in turn initiate processes that lead to the formation of root nodules.  However, there is significant genetic variation among bacterial strains and among legumes in their abilities to interact symbiotically. The objective of this proposal is to identify bacterial and plant genes and gene variants responsible for the most efficient and effective interactions. This objective will be accomplished by identifying the bacterial strains that outcompete other strains in a large mixture in their ability to form nodules in roots of Medicago truncatula, the barrel medic. These experiments will be carried out with a large collection of barrel medic accessions representing most of the variation in the species. Thus, the results are expected to identify the most competitive strains and plant accessions. Quantitative analysis of the DNA sequences of the most competitive types is expected to reveal the identity of the bacterial and plant genes that are the most effective in the symbiotic interaction. The project will train several undergraduate students. Biological N-fixation mediated by legume-rhizobium symbiosis contributes N to both natural and agro-ecosystems, and results in legumes having N-rich leaves and seeds that make them some of the most important sources of dietary protein. For this reason, this symbiosis is a critical component of sustainable agricultural systems. The legume-rhizobia symbiosis represents an ideal system to study the coordination of function between a bacterial and a plant genome. Although both partners benefit from this relationship, not all partnerships are equally beneficial. The outcome of host-rhizobia interactions depends on the genotypes of the partners. This means that there is not a single rhizobium strain that confers the greatest benefit to all plant genotypes, and that different rhizobia strains are favored by different plant genotypes. The objective of this proposal is to identify the genomic basis that underlies G x G variation in mutualism, which could enable manipulation of the interaction to maximize biological N-fixation. The PIs have developed a select and resequence assay to identify strains with the greatest fitness in a diverse multistrain community. The PIs are proposing to refine and evaluate the robustness of the performance of this assay that will satisfy various biological and statistical challenges. The Broader Impacts of this project include the direct benefits to the agricultural sector and the environment that will result from more efficient nitrogen-fixation systems and the training of undergraduate students."

Legumes like soybean annually fix 60 million metric tons of nitrogen, which have a fertilizer replacement value of $7- 10 billion. A long-term goal of N2 fixation research is to transfer the symbiotic ability of legumes to non-legume crops like corn or tomato. However, there are gaps in our understanding of the complex events that occur after the bacteria penetrate the root. These gaps are hindering efforts to engineer nitrogen fixation into non-legumes. Hence, the main objective of this project is to elucidate the initial events that take place during the formation of structures that mediate the movement of bacteria through the root. This project will use high-resolution methods to characterize macromolecular events at a single-cell level. The experimental data will be analyzed with sophisticated modeling tools to improve our understanding of the first events of the legume-bacterial interactions that lead to symbiosis. The knowledge gained will support efforts to transfer the rhizobial symbiosis to non-leguminous plants. In addition to the research mission, the project will create new programs to provide transformative elementary education, as well as training programs for the professional development of middle school and high school teachers. Finally, this project will develop an innovative Sophomore Bioinformatics/Plant Science program to provide integrated training in plant research and bioinformatics.Data integration and system modeling of complex biological processes require detailed, functional genomic data, preferably obtained in a cell-specific way in order to avoid the effects of signal dilution due to the presence of non-responding cells. The long-term goal of this project is to further basic understanding of the agronomically important soybean N2 fixing symbiosis. A unique focus of this project is the ability to sample and analyze the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome at a single-cell resolution. These methods, as well as sophisticated data analysis and modeling tools, will be applied to the intermediate stages of soybean nodulation; specifically, the infection thread progression and bacterial release into nodule cells. These are key events in nodule formation/function that remain largely undefined. The data generated will be used to construct predictive, computational models of the plant response to rhizobial infection thread initiation and growth. The knowledge gained from this research, together with precision breeding techniques, will be instrumental to improving soybean quality and meeting the growing demand for food and fuel expected in the forthcoming years. Moreover, filling in the gaps in our understanding of the rhizobial-legume infection process will be critical to ongoing efforts to transfer this symbiosis to non-leguminous plants (e.g., maize). The project also includes strong outreach programs focusing on the introduction of plant science to elementary, high school and undergraduate students."

While there is a high-level understanding of viral impacts on ecosystems, the details of the viral-microbe interactions are largely unknown. The ability to predict the biological and ecological features, or phenome, of any particular virus-microbe system based on DNA sequence alone is highly limited. This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII Track-2 FEC) award seeks to advance the ability to predict the phenomic features of the viruses of microbes (VoMs) from genomic data. A collaborative team of researchers from Delaware, Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Hawaii will study viruses that infect marine and freshwater phytoplankton, and viruses that infect a bacterial group that forms a symbiosis with important legume crops, most notably, soybean. Collectively, global phytoplankton populations are responsible for creating vast stores of biomass that support the nutritional needs of larger aquatic organisms. In this process phytoplankton sustain half of the oxygen within the atmosphere.  Enhanced understanding of genome to phenome links within phytoplankton viruses will aid in improving models that predict the impacts of excess carbon and nutrients on ecosystems.  Within the food supply chain, legumes, soybeans in particular, are an extraordinarily important source of plant protein supporting the nutritional needs of billions of people.  Better understanding of genome to phenome connections for viruses infecting bacterial symbionts of legumes could eventually lead to new technologies for improving the productivity of critical agronomic crops such as soybean.  The project team includes faculty, postdocs and students who will engage in collaborative research and share methodologies, best practices, and results through workshops and meetings.  Four early career faculty will be mentored by six other well-established faculty investigators.  The entire project team will prepare educational materials and provide summer camp opportunities for middle and elementary schools students.Technical descriptionThis RII Track-2 FEC award is for a collaborative effort among University of Delaware, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, University of Hawaii, and Roger Williams University.  The planned research seeks to connect genomic features of viruses of microbes (VoMs) with phenotypic life-history traits and use these connections to advance scientific understanding of the role of VoMs in ecosystems.  The project team will test several genome to phoneme hypotheses in VoMs, focusing on phenomic features such as host range, burst size, latent period and infectivity.  An integrated high-throughput approach including emulsion-droplet microfluidic technologies, next generation sequencing, and bioinformatics, will be used to study viral-host systems representative of picophytoplankton, eukaryotic phytoplankton, and diazotrophic bacteria.  The project team will collect samples across environmental gradients from soybean fields, tropical oceans, and lakes, hypothesized to select for different VoM phenomic traits.  The researchers will build a new bioinformatics analysis tool known as the Viral Informatics Rulebook for Genome Organization ? VIRGO and incorporated it into an existing community resource for bioinformatic annotation of viral metagenomes known as the Viral Informatics Resource fOr Metagenome Exploration (VIROME).  Four early-career faculty members engaged in this project will be mentored by successful mid and later career faculty.  The team will work together in training postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students as well as in communicating the importance of environmental virology to diverse audiences including K-12 students and the general public."

Boom and bust cycles have long shaped relationships of international commodity production and trade. As more producers become entangled in the global economy, they become increasingly exposed to these often dramatic price fluctuations. In this research, the investigator focuses on two overarching questions: (1) When prices for market crops rise and fall, how are social, economic, and environmental relationships altered? and (2) How and to what extent do individual producers then re-position themselves within these larger environmental, economic, and cultural systems of exchange? These questions are important because in both the United States and the world at large, crops subject to boom and bust cycles are frequently produced by vulnerable smallholder operators. Local successes and failures can affect the larger system as well as have consequences for local households and communities.  Findings from this research will be of interest to both social scientists trying to better understand the dynamic linkages that comprise globalization and to policymakers who seek to control economic extremes and mitigate negative effects. The research will be conducted by Indiana University anthropologist, Dr. Sarah R. Osterhoudt, in northeastern Madagascar.  This is an appropriate site for this project because families in this region have been cultivating an important international commodity -- vanilla -- within agro-ecological systems for multiple generations.  The researcher will follow vanilla from the growers that produce the beans through the many specialists in packaging, transport, export, certification, and sales that bring it to international markets. She will collect data at all points of this commodity chain by employing a combination of ethnographic methodologies, including: participant observation, agro-forestry inventories, semi-structured interviews, market narratives, and analyses of court and police records concerning land disputes. These data, collected in the current  boom period,  will be combined with comparable data collected during the 2010-2011  bust  period. The result will provide a unique, in-depth, longitudinal analysis of the dynamic social and ecological dimensions of a key international crop across a boom and bust cycle."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. This award supports a collaboration between an anthropologist and a soil and crop scientist to investigate several lost crops - plants that were cultivated by Indigenous people in Eastern North America (ENA) for several thousand years, but which fell out of use hundreds of years ago. When the indigenous foods of ENA are invoked, most people imagine maize, beans, and squash - the bountiful harvest spilling out of the archetypal Thanksgiving cornucopia. These crops, also known as the Three Sisters, were historically grown together by Indigenous people across ENA by the time European colonization began. But maize, beans, and many squash varieties (including pumpkins and closely related varieties) were not domesticated in ENA, nor were they a part of its earliest agricultural system. These plants were obtained through trade from Mexico then adapted by eastern farmers to local conditions by around AD 1000 (later for beans). For thousands of years before, beginning in the Late Archaic period around 3800 years ago, ancient farmers in ENA cultivated a group of native seed crops. These pre-maize crops are referred to as the Eastern Agricultural Complex (EAC). They are a botanically diverse group that includes familiar crops that are still widely grown, such as sunflower and acorn squash, as well as lost crops that are native North American relatives of barley, quinoa, and canary grass, among others. Most of the EAC crops fell out of cultivation before the arrival of European chroniclers and are not recalled in the oral traditions of Indigenous descendent communities, leaving many questions about how they were cultivated. The objective of this research is to study the living progenitors of these crops in the wild and under cultivation in order to better understand the deep history of North America and the dynamics of human-plant co-evolution in general. In addition to these research goals, this project expands the Lost Crops Garden Network, a collaboration among several anthropologists using experimental gardens as tools for experiential learning and research. Several of the EAC crops are now endangered by increased herbicide use and invasive weeds. This project documents the locations of remaining populations of lost crops, an important first step towards conserving a group of plants that have the potential to be re-domesticated and commercialized. One of the key activities funded by this award is the creation of a seed bank, which will facilitate further experimental studies by providing correctly sourced and viable seed to other researchers. These plants were important crops for millennia. With further study and improvement, they have the potential to enhance the food and economic security of contemporary farmers.This project 1) establishes the current range and habitat of EAC crop progenitors and assesses their conservation needs; 2) creates an institutionalized seed bank for EAC crop seeds; 3) studies the effects of different cultivation techniques and environmental factors on plant phenotypes and yield; 4) investigates the role of developmental plasticity and epigenetics in plant domestication; and 5) establishes an accurate range of yield estimates for each crop. This research creates interpretative links between morphologies and/or ancient DNA attributes of archaeobotanical specimens and the agricultural practices that created and maintained them. By doing so, it also 1) helps bridge the gap between historically and ethnographically recorded maize-based agriculture, and the unknown EAC agricultural system that preceded and gave rise to it; and 2) contributes to the study of social change in the eventful last 500 years prior to European colonization, an era which saw the rise of maize agriculture, structural inequality, and regional political confederacies. Globally, this project contributes to an emerging body of research on the role of developmental plasticity and epigenetics in domestication, in particular, and in evolutionary biology in general. Growth experiments will measure the effects of the agroecosystem on plants' development and reproduction, allowing the construction of more accurate optimal foraging models that take into account the immediate effects of cultivation and environmental engineering. This project also explores the epigenetic effects of DNA methylation on crop morphology. Comparative methylome sequencing of control and experimental plants can be used to identify epigenetic signals underpinning phenotypic effects. DNA methylation survives in ancient tissues, so the ancient DNA of archaeobotanical specimens can be used to assess the influence of epigenetics in the domestication process. This research requires an interdisciplinary effort, while also providing training that will enable its recipient to make an experimental approach to the study of ancient agriculture central to her future research and teaching."

These mutualisms are important for stabilizing pristine natural communities, restoring degraded environments, and plant productivity in agricultural systems. Rhizobial bacteria (rhizobia) benefit leguminous host plants (peas, beans, soybean) by fixing atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms, essentially fertilizing their plant hosts. As a result, legumes are high in nitrogen and provide an abundant source of plant-derived protein. Rhizobial strains, however, are diverse in nature and vary quite a bit in partner quality, or the level of benefits they provide to the plant host. This project focuses on a genetic model system (the legume Medicago truncatula and its partner bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti) to investigate the range of partner quality variation and its underlying molecular basis in rhizobia, integrating various approaches including whole-genome DNA sequencing, gene expression, and metabolomics. These techniques provide insight into the genetic determinants and cellular-level metabolism that characterizes highly-beneficial interactions, versus low-quality interactions that are less beneficial for plant hosts. Understanding what determines partner quality at a mechanistic level is critical foundational knowledge that informs efforts to engineer the plant microbiome as part of plant improvement programs and sustainable crop production. Moreover a basic understanding of what determines partner quality is important for understanding how mutualisms evolve through time and how crucial mutualisms persist in current environments. This project provides biological and computational training at the undergraduate and graduate level, provides internships for local community college students, and generates online outreach and analysis tools.Technical:Mutualists in nature vary widely in partner quality, often with important implications for natural and managed systems, yet the molecular basis of mutualist partner quality variation is not well-understood. Recently studies have demonstrated mutualism decline in response to environmental changes, resulting from dis-association of partners, ecological shifts towards less-mutualistic species, or evolutionary decreases in mean partner quality. A predictive understanding of mutualisms is needed to understand their coevolution, persistence, and potential decline. This project will integrate natural genetic variation with physiological and molecular traits into symbiosis networks to uncover the genetic and molecular architecture underlying the mutualism between the rhizobium Ensifer (Sinorhizobium) meliloti and its host plant Medicago truncatula. The central hypothesis is that naturally-occurring variation can be used to better resolve the genetic regulation of plant and rhizobium metabolic pathways that contribute to high-quality symbiosis. This project integrates rhizobium genome-wide nucleotide variation with both rhizobia and host plant phenotypic and molecular traits to address the molecular basis of rhizobium partner quality (how much rhizobia benefit their plant hosts), a trait relevant to both natural and managed ecosystems. Network analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic data will result in comparative models of high and low quality symbiosis, enabling gene-to-trait predictions for the ecologically- and evolutionarily- important symbiosis between leguminous plants and nitrogen-fixing rhizobium bacteria. Hypotheses generated by network analysis will be validated in both rhizobia and host plant systems for physiological and molecular phenotypes underlying important partner quality traits."

Theory predicts that rapid adaptation can also potentially affect the establishment of species in new habitats, but there is little evidence from natural systems to support this. This project will investigate rapid adaptation in recently established plant populations, as well as how symbiotic microbes might influence plant rapid adaptation. By conducting this work at an ecological restoration site, this project will not only expand our understanding of basic ecological processes, but results of the project can be applied to make restorations more successful. This is important, as the restoration of degraded landscapes can play a critical role in biodiversity conservation, yet species sown into restorations often fail to establish. Additionally, this project includes the mentoring of undergraduate students and development of online educational materials for K-12 students.By using field experiments, reciprocal transplants, and greenhouse studies, this project aims to expand understanding of the role of rapid adaptation in population establishment in several ways. First, although empirical evidence suggests that evolution may occur rapidly enough to influence establishment, few studies consider the demographic effects of adaptation. This study will examine the demographic effects of adaptation in recently established plant populations. Second, this work aims to identify the selective agents and traits responsible for local adaptation, which few studies attempt to do. By combining selection analyses with reciprocal transplant experiments, this study will both predict evolutionary responses and test whether those predicted evolutionary shifts have actually occurred. Finally, this work will investigate the role of microbial mutualists in plant rapid adaptation by examining interactions between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria and how traits mediating interactions with rhizobia have evolved in response to field environments that differ in soil nutrient availability and rhizobium community properties. The results of this work will elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationship between rapid adaptation and population establishment."

They are ubiquitous in nature and extremely diverse, yet their ecological roles are not well-defined. In this project, wild lima bean, passion vine and a defined set of fungal endophytes isolated from leaves of these plant species will be studied to understand ecological functions of endophytes as plant symbionts. In particular, the research focuses on endophyte-mediated effects on plant defenses against insect herbivores. Lima bean and passion vine are both well-established model systems and express a range of well-characterized direct and indirect defenses. This allows for disentangling of the interplay of plant-derived and endophyte-mediated effects. Beyond a better understanding of the ecological implications of plant-endophyte interactions, this research also provides novel insights for agricultural sciences, as endophytes can potentially be used to enhance plant stress tolerance to a broad variety of biotic (e.g. insect pests and pathogens) and abiotic stress factors (e.g. soil salinity, drought, high temperature, and heavy metal accumulation). The exploration of novel ways to enhance crop production, through the utilization of beneficial microbes that enhance plant stress tolerance, may help to alleviate the impending socio-economic challenges facing humanity. ?Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in chemical analytical and molecular techniques, data analysis and scientific writing. Opportunities for K-12 school teachers and students to participate in this multidisciplinary research will be provided through lectures, lab experiences and summer field courses.Fungal endophytes are exceptional biochemical engineers that produce a variety of ecologically relevant compounds. These compounds potentially affect the interaction of host plants with plant consumers and higher trophic levels. In addition to the production of fungal compounds, endophytes may alter the defensive plant chemical phenotype through up- or down-regulation of primary and secondary plant compounds. However, the functional interactions between plants, endophytes and other plant-associated organisms in natural ecosystems are virtually unknown. The aim of this research is to provide a new and functional understanding of these complex interactions by integrating laboratory and field studies to answer the following specific questions: 1) Does endophyte colonization affect herbivorous and predatory insects? 2) How does endophyte colonization alter the plant chemical phenotype? 3) Does inoculation with endophytes affect host plant performance in nature? and 4) Are endophyte-mediated traits transferable across plant species boundaries and generations? In a comparative metabolomics approach, effects of endophyte inoculations on complex compound pools are analyzed in planta. Beyond this non-targeted approach, high-throughput bioactivity profiling studies will be used to search for bioactive fungal compounds. Bioassays with natural, plant-associated arthropods will illuminate the effects of the endophyte-mediated chemical plant phenotype and its consequences for plant interactions with consumers and predators in the field. These studies are combined with tests on endophyte host-specificity as well as on quantitative plant performance under natural conditions."

The nitrogen-fixing symbiosis between bacteria called rhizobia and legume plants benefits both partners. For the legume, the symbiosis gives them access to biologically active nitrogen, an essential nutrient that the rhizobia can  fix  using inert nitrogen gas. The bacteria get a place to live in root nodules, organs formed on the legume after bacterial infection. Nodule formation requires the rhizobia to communicate with the host plant.  The plant wants successful infection by bacteria that can fix nitrogen but must still defend itself against pathogens. Because rhizobia want to infect where they can, legumes also limit nodule formation using selectively applied defenses. One plant defense, called autoregulation of nodulation (AON), blocks the formation of too many nodules. A newly identified rhizobial gene, glx, increases nodulation in pea and in alfalfa, possibly by interfering with AON. This project investigates the physiological and biochemical mechanisms by which glx stimulates nodulation. The research will contribute a better understanding of one of the most accessible stories about a mutualistic symbiosis, a highly beneficial relationship between humble, non-pathogenic rhizobia and their green and often delicious legume hosts. Since poor nodulation can limit nitrogen fixation and plant growth, being able to increase nodulation could be helpful in agriculture, where it might reduce the need to apply ammonia fertilizer and would decrease the associated environmental problems. Broader impacts include the training of graduate students and working with undergraduate and high school students to develop their understanding of hands-on science. In addition, outreach to grower communities in the region, especially with regard to the major pulse and forage legumes produced in the state of Washington, will focus on how new scientific developments might influence agriculture.Control of nodulation by legumes is not understood very well. In order to establish a symbiotic interaction, signaling and signal transduction are crucial. The glx gene, which significantly increases nodulation when introduced into rhizobia that nodulate pea and barrel medic, shows that glx can alter development in two different symbioses and hints that it may act by affecting fundamental circuitry. In a pathogenic context, glx would be called a virulence determinant because it stimulates infection. The systemic plant defense called autoregulation of nodulation (AON) limits the formation of too many nodules after an initial infection. glx appears to be able to bypass or overcome AON. AON is mediated by peptide signals that are generated in a newly infected root then transferred to the shoot, where a receptor then generates a factor, called the shoot-derived inhibitor, that is transported to the roots and inhibits further nodulation. The glx gene is annotated as a glyoxalase/dioxygenase, suggesting it is involved in oxidation of small molecules. The putative small molecules may interact with the AON signal transduction pathway or with similar circuits the legume uses to limit nodulation in response to abundant nitrogen or low pH.  Determining how the glx gene acts to increase nodulation through its activity or metabolites that it generates will provide a bacterial probe into the controlled response that the plant uses to optimize its interaction with rhizobia. The knowledge gained will increase fundamental understanding of plant-microbe communications and may have practical consequences in agriculture."

This project will enhance knowledge about coupled human-ecological relationships, fire ecology, biogeography, and human behavioral ecology.  By employing the conceptual framework of alternative stable states, this project will provide new insights about the potential influence of intentionally set fires and Native American resource use on ecological community dynamics.  The project will assist the Yurok and Karuk tribes as well as the U.S. Forest Service with their efforts to reinstate prescribed fire as a means to improve access to cultural and subsistence resources and reduce wildfire risk, and it will contribute to assessment of the potential utility of employing prescribed fire in other locales.   The project also will provide new perspectives and data regarding the historical characteristics of fire regimes.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.Small-scale subsistence groups and land managers worldwide intentionally set prescribed fires to improve accessibility to natural resources, enhance resource abundance and distribution, and reduce the spread of wildfire.  After decades of fire exclusion in North America, efforts to revive the use of prescribed burning face several obstacles, such as restrictions, administrative processes, and financial constraints.  Combined with changing climate and land-use regimes, fire exclusion has altered fire regimes, often leading to increases in wildfire size and intensity.  In some parts of the nation, Native American communities are leading prescribed burning efforts because of their cultural connection and reliance on fire-dependent resources.  The restoration of prescribed fire by Yurok and Karuk tribal members provides an opportunity to test hypotheses related to the use of prescribed fire and ecological community dynamics.  Prescribed fires also help meet multiple tribal objectives, including increasing the availability of hazelnut stems for basketry materials; maintaining savannas for deer and elk forage to improve hunting; and reducing wildfire risk.  The doctoral student conducting this project will compare hazelnut stem densities, deer frequencies, and surface fuel loads in burned plots along with matched plots in unburned areas.  He will evaluate the effects these fire regimes may have on resource access by observing the harvesting trips of tribal members as they search for fire-dependent resources, and he will conduct interviews focusing on fire histories at harvesting sites.  He will establish vegetation plots at these harvesting and prescribed fire locations in order to monitor ecological change at each site, and he will analyze aerial photographs and satellite imagery ranging from 1944 to 2016 to compare historical and contemporary savanna characteristics. Transects will be stratified along remnant savanna borders, recent prescribed burns, and adjacent unburned areas to assess species composition under distinctive fire regimes.  To assess effects on wildfire risk, the student will contrast surface fuel loads between prescribed burn and non-burn areas with wildfire models in those ecological communities."

In particular, converting the spending in developing countries into U.S. dollars with nominal exchange rates makes poor counties appear even poorer and rich countries even richer. Instead, it is essential to correct for the lower prices found in poor countries as compared to rich countries. This project studies the feasibility of using  Big Data  methods and online prices to convert spending across countries into a common currency (U.S. dollars), and to establish extreme poverty lines in a common currency (e.g. $1.90 per day). The source of internet price data is the Billion Prices Project (BPP), an academic initiative associated with Alberto Cavallo, one of the principal investigators. The BPP has access to global price information at a very fine level of detail, as is essential in order to compare price for the same goods (e.g. Arabica coffee beans) across countries. These online prices have the potential to improve both the frequency and accuracy of price observations in comparison to traditional price data collection methods, For example, the World Bank currently engages in a labor-intensive collection of prices across countries in what is called the International Comparisons Project (ICP). Because it involves actual visits to stores in so many countries, the ICP can collect prices only at infrequent intervals (the most recent years were 2005 and 2011, with another collection planned for 2017). Furthermore, traditional data collection methods require the cooperation of local statistical agencies and their adherence to strict quality and methodological standards that are often impossible to control. The results will be valuable for the World Bank and other international agencies engaged in measuring real GDP and extreme poverty; for policy-makers that rely on accuracy of these measurements to design and implement solutions; for the work of academics engaged in the Penn World Tables and related international comparison databases; and for scholars from Economics, Political Science, and other disciplines who rely on the measurement of real GDP in various countries. The main goals of this project are to: a) utilize  Big Data  internet sources from the Billion Prices Project to obtain a database of average online prices for comparable products across countries that is independent of the methods used to collect prices by the World Bank; b) to use this online price information to construct measures of the standard of living across countries that can be compared to those from the World Bank, but which will potentially differ due to the new sources of price data; and c) do this at a monthly frequency, rather than once every 6 years, to more accurately track and pinpoint changes in prices and living standards. Large-scale micro-price data from various sources (government surveys, scanner datasets, or web-scraped online sources) have become available for researchers in recent years, but they are not yet suited for comparing prices across countries because prices are not collected according to the same classification or identification system and use differing price collection methods can invalidate international comparisons. The approach will be to access the large-scale, multi-country dataset of prices available at the BPP, build a standardized method for matching products across countries, and develop an appropriate methodology to scale up from individual product prices to an overall consumer price comparison. The project will focus on key practical and methodological issues and lay the groundwork for the use of online price data in research applications that make cost-of-living comparisons across countries. The research will be published in academic papers and the researchers will also publish a monthly database of average price levels in various countries computed during the duration of the project. The investigators will share this database publicly with other researchers via data depositories such as the Harvard/MIT Dataverse. The website of the Penn World Table (www.ggdc.net/pwt) will also provide a platform for disseminating the results from integrating online price information with other macroeconomic data series.This award was made as part of Round 4 of the Digging Into Data Challenge, an international funding opportunity designed to foster research collaboration across countries and to encourage innovative approaches to analyzing large data sets in the social sciences and humanities. The U.S based researchers will collaborate with scholars in Canada and the Netherlands to achieve the goals of this project."

Application of light-activated inoculates for crop fertilization will result in an increased legume production and will potentially benefit other crops that are grown in the same fields after harvesting the legumes, as legume crop remnants left in the fields may fertilize those additional crops. The potential customers for this novel technology are the soybean farmers of the Midwestern states and the alfalfa growers in the southwestern USA. The expected yield enhancements using this technique will potentially result in higher profit margins in these important crops.The I-Corps project develops an innovative way to process bacterial inoculates currently used to fertilize legumes. Legume crops are sprayed with bacteria that live inside the plant roots providing the plant with fertilizing compounds that they produce from air nitrogen. The core technology involved is based on a recent discovery that illumination of these bacteria is required to activate their capacity to penetrate the roots. Spraying the fields with light-activated inoculates constitutes a new, state of the art methodology that could significantly improve fertilization and crop yields over current yields."

These pathogens are known for their extensive virulence diversity that may change from one year or location to another.  Thus, one very important target of this project is to identify broad-spectrum disease resistance genes from the Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools of the wild and cultivated common bean. This will be accomplished by inoculating common bean with selected races of the aforementioned pathogens.  Studies of the inheritance of disease resistance will be conducted to characterize and map the new disease resistance genes.  Simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers linked with the newly discovered disease resistance genes will be identified to expedite the incorporation of these genes into new bean cultivars using marker-assisted selection.  Conventional and molecular breeding approaches will be used to develop bean germplasm lines in various market classes that combine several genes with broad-spectrum resistance to the rust, anthracnose, and angular leaf spot pathogens with high yield and other valuable agronomic attributes.   The specific objectives of this project are: Objective 1: Evaluate available common bean accessions from various geographic regions to identify potential sources of resistance to various pathogens, characterize new resistance genes, and develop molecular markers for use in introgression.   Objective 2: Introgress useful disease resistance genes, combine with good agronomic and quality trait genes in adapted backgrounds, and release germplasm lines or cultivars that can be used to broaden the genetic base of common bean."

Despite much research, many determinants of host resistance and their roles in signaling remain unknown. Pseudomonas syringae, a plant pathogenic bacterium, causes disease in more than 150 plant species. ZAR1 is the R protein responsible for recognizing the acetyltransferase HopZ1a, a P. syringae type III secreted effector protein (T3SE). ZAR1 is found in many plant species, including the Solanaceae, castor bean, and rice. However ZAR1 defense signaling does not depend on any components previously implicated in plant resistance, including salicylic acid. Further investigation of ZAR1 signaling gives us a unique opportunity to identify novel genes involved in plant resistance and potential targets for improving plant immunity. This project plan will address three major questions:  1) What other genes are genetically implicated in resistance to HopZ1a? Preliminary data from a forward genetics screen has identified several mutants that lack HopZ1a-mediated defense responses (hopz-effector-triggered-immunity-deficient or zed). The proposed work will map these mutants and characterize their roles in resistance.   2) What is the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance? The proposed work will identify other proteins that contribute to ZAR1-mediated resistance.   3) Is ZAR1 resistance conserved in other plant species? The proposed work will examine ZAR1 resistance in wild and domesticated tomato. Using a multi-pronged approach, this work will identify and characterize new sources of resistance to protect plants from disease.  The specific objectives are: Objective 1:  Conduct genetic screens coupled with next-generation DNA sequencing to identify genes that contribute to pathogen resistance in plants.   Objective 2:  Characterize the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance using molecular, genetic, and proteomic approaches.   Objective 3:  Evaluate susceptibility and resistance of plant species to bacterial pathogens to determine the conservation of resistance."

This limits the opportunity to include cover crops in rotations. The primary focus of this project is to produce information, management tools, and technologies to help farmers integrate cover crops and compost into intensive vegetable and strawberry production systems, maximize the benefits from cover cropping, and reduce production costs.    The main objective of this project is to develop ecologically-based soil management strategies that enhance soil quality, nutrient cycling, pest and disease management, and profitability, and reduce off-farm inputs, organic vegetable and strawberry production systems. The subobjectives are as follows:   1. Evaluate the effects of cover cropping frequency and compost on soil quality, vegetable and strawberry yields, soil borne disease, and system profitability. 2. Evaluate the effects of a legume-rye mixture versus non-legume cover crops on vegetable and strawberry yields. 3. Evaluate the effects of cover crop seeding rates on weed density and weed management costs in subsequent vegetable and strawberry crops grown in rotational sequences. 4. Identify pathogens causing emerging bacterial diseases of organic vegetables and small fruit."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B.

Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics."

Identify botanical components of dietary supplements throughout the supply chain by use of chemical analysis and integrated pattern recognition software2. Detect the presence of adulteration by use of HPLC (and UHPLC) analysis of bioactive compounds and by use of orthogonal data from other analytical instruments (e.g. terpene analysis by GC).3. Automate the quantification of the key bioactive compounds.Innovative aspects of the proposed research are the restructuring of proven MIDI Inc. software for HPLCanalysis of bioactive components of botanical dietary supplements and use of orthogonal GC data frommetabolites, such as terpenes. The MIDI software has been cited in more than 4,000 publications and both theHPLC and GC microbiology systems have FDA 510 (k) clearance as medical devices for species-levelidentification.1,2 Thus, the basic system is shown to be scientifically valid but needs modification and additionsto target botanical dietary supplements (proposed MIDI platform). Botanical reference materials (BRMs) will beanalyzed and the patterns stored electronically, reducing the need for these expensive materials. Chemicalanalysis patterns of materials throughout the dietary supplement supply chain will also be electronically storedto enable changes due to processing and authentication in all steps of manufacturing.The proposed technology should improve precision of compound naming, lower labor costs, reduce humanerrors, improve turn-around-time for analysis, as well as meeting the objectives above. However, the keys tosuccess are that it should improve human health due to improvements in quality control of botanical dietarysupplements, make it possible for the industry to largely self-regulate and aid the FDA in regulation of theindustry. The result should improve human health though removal of adulterated or low quality products fromthe market."

Little isknown about the causes or correlates of ASD. While diagnostic practices are improving ASD identification,much remains to be discovered about risk and protective factors for ASD and about the phenotypic variationand prevalence of co-morbid conditions. In response to growing concerns, the Children’s Health Act of 2000mandated CDC to establish ASD surveillance and research programs that address the magnitude, incidence,and causes of ASD and related developmental disabilities. The Centers for Autism and DevelopmentalDisabilities Research and Epidemiology (CADDREs) were established at six national sites (California,Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania) to fulfill this mandate and are currentlycarrying out the second phase of the Study to Explore Early Development (SEED), a population-based case-control study. SEED addresses hypotheses including: ASD phenotypic variation, including clustering of coresymptoms, cognitive status, and presence of co-morbidities; gastrointestinal features; genetic variation andgene-environment interaction (GxE); infection, immune function, and autoimmunity factors; and hormonalfactors and maternal reproductive characteristics. Data collection includes developmental assessments andpre- and perinatal health and environment via interviews, medical record review, self-administeredquestionnaires, and biologic samples. As of December 2015, SEED 1 & 2 had completed data collection on4652 families - 1341 with ASD, 1722 with other developmental disorders, and 1589 controls. This proposalseeks to carry out SEED 3, collecting another 625 children in each study group. This increased, combinedsample size will enable well-powered assessment of SEED hypotheses, particularly for phenotypic subgroupsand GxE interactions. Given the experience of SEED 1 & 2 and the infrastructure in place at each CADDREsite, SEED 3 can be quickly implemented, creating a combined SEED sample of clinical, risk factor, andbiological specimens and data on over 6500 families. SEED would be the largest study of ASD of this kind,making significant contributions to our understanding of the complex autism phenotype andidentifying potential risk and protective factors for ASD."

The deposits disrupt tissue structure and eventually compromise organ function. Commonsites of deposition include kidney, spleen, liver, and intestine. In humans proteinuria due to glomerulardeposits is often the first clinical manifestation, and with increasing deposition, the nephrotic syndrome usuallyprogresses to end-stage renal disease. AA amyloidosis usually develops as a complication of chronicinflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, andthe hereditary auto-inflammatory syndromes (e.g., familial Mediterranean fever). It also occurs in associationwith long-standing infections (osteomyelitis, decubitus ulcers, bronchiectasis). Veterans with paraplegia are atrisk of developing AA amyloidosis due to chronic decubitus ulcers, urinary tract infections and osteomyelitis. Inaddition, ankylosing spondylitis is common in our male veterans which also increases risk for AA amyloidosis.At present, there is no specific therapy for AA amyloidosis. Only control of pro-inflammatory stimuli to reducehepatic SAA synthesis has shown an effect on AA amyloid progression. In a recent Phase III clinical trial, apotential new therapy [eprodisate (Kiacta)] failed to show significance in retarding AA progression. Promptedby the unmet needs of patients, our initial aim will be to initiate development of a therapy for AA amyloidosisusing as framework translational studies we have conducted on transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis. Thetherapeutic strategy will be administration of human SAA-specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) thatfacilitate degradation of SAA mRNA resulting in lower SAA levels in blood and less substrate available foramyloid formation. A transgenic mouse model carrying a human SAA1 genomic segment encompassing SAA1promoter and regulatory elements will be generated and employed for this study. Human SAA1-specific ASOswill be provided by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and screened for ability to downregulate SAA1 expression in humancell cultures. Promising compounds will be conjugated with N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc); this modificationconfers targeted delivery to the liver and increases potency 6-10-fold, allowing for lower dosing. After furtherscreening in normal mice to evaluate tolerability, ASOs will be given to human SAA1 transgenic mice todetermine the level of suppression achieved at various doses. The human SAA1 transgenic mice we generatewill be crossed with mice that do not express mouse SAA1 or SAA2; these mice will be provided by Drs.Frederick de Beer and Nancy Webb, University of Kentucky. The offspring of this cross-breeding, i.e., miceexpressing human SAA1 but not mouse SAA1 or SAA2, will be induced to develop AA amyloidosis usingstandard protocols and also treated with selected human SAA-specific ASOs and control random ASOs todetermine the extent to which ASO therapy reduces deposition of human AA amyloid. In a second aim we willexplore the role of post-translational modification of SAA in the genesis of amyloid fibril formation. Our in vitrostudies show that carbamylation of residues in the amino-terminal portion of mouse SAA1.1 has a potentiatingeffect on amyloid formation. This region of SAA is most crucial to the initiation and propagation of amyloidfibrils, suggesting that modifications in this region may have important consequences in vivo as well as in vitro.AA amyloid protein extracted from amyloid deposits of humans and mice, as well as SAA in serum, will beanalyzed by tandem mass spectrometry to identify modified residues. Mouse models will be used to testwhether conditions that promote in carbamylation in vivo also promote AA amyloidogenesis. Other studies willinvestigate the effects of carbamylation on SAA association with HDL. If modifications are found to impactamyloid formation in vivo as they do in vitro, targeting such modifications may offer new therapeutic options totreat this progressive, fatal disease."

Through public debate and private consultation, theactivities of the Forum strive to facilitate discussion and inquiry into the most challenging and cross-cutting sets of challenges within and across the spectrum of “microbial threats.” Activities of the Forum are designed to examine emerging as well as long-standing challengesin microbial ecology in “health” and “disease”. The Forum has been instrumental in changing theinfectious disease paradigm from “the only good ‘bug’ is a dead ‘bug’” to a more ecologically-informed view of the beneficial contributions of the microbiome in health maintenance and how thesemicrobial communities influence and are influenced by their environmental context. The summaryreports of Forum workshops have highlighted and often anticipated some of the most importantinfectious disease issues of the past decade, including the challenge of emerging fungal diseases and thepersistent problem of antimicrobial resistance. Through dissemination to public leaders, privateindustry, and policymakers, these summary reports have served as useful and timely educationalresources and records of these public discussions and deliberations. Today, the complexities and challenges posed by vector and non-vector borne diseases and thecorresponding trends that contribute to their emergence and reemergence continue to confound theworld’s public health, scientific, medical, pharmaceutical, and policymaking communities. The globalvulnerability of human, plant, and animal populations has been increasingly recognized as a challengenot only to personal health, but also to public safety, economic stability and development, and nationaland international security. The realities of the unrelenting resurgence of once manageable diseases, theemergence of multidrug resistant infectious diseases, the emergence and spread of newly identifiedpathogens such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the global challenge of multi-drugresistant microorganisms, the reemergence of vector-borne disease as a major, global, public healthconcern, and the emergence of the first global influenza pandemic of the 21st century—H1N1—serveas timely reminders of the continuing evolution of infectious diseases and their attendant impacts onhuman, plant, and animal health—domestically and internationally. The activities of the Forumcontinue to track and anticipate these evolving challenges. As a result of such cross-sector dialogue, priority issues for infectious disease research andpublic health policy have been recognized; critical issues warranting further investigation have beenidentified; and there have been increased opportunities for more effective collaborations and dialoguebetween the private and public sectors represented on the Forum, as well as between the medical,veterinary, and plant disease communities. The Forum’s membership consists of individuals from awide range of disciplines and organizations in the public and private sectors, including the publichealth, medical, pharmaceutical, veterinarian, academic science, agricultural, and environmentalcommunities."

PEComasarise most commonly at visceral (especially gastrointestinal and uterine), retroperitoneal, andabdominopelvic sites. Most PEComa lesions are benign and slow-progressing, however, a small subsetof them are malignant PEComas, with an aggressive clinical course including distant metastases andultimate death. Malignant PEComa is extremely rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.12-0.24/1,000,000 or approximately 42-84 new patients per year, and an estimated prevalence of 0.22-0.48/1,000,000 or approximately 77-168 patients in the United States.Currently, no effective medical treatment has been prospectively investigated or approved for advancedmalignant PEComa, including metastatic or locally advanced disease where surgery is not an option.The prognosis for these patients is poor, with an estimated median survival of 12-17 months.Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not demonstrated significant clinical benefit. Therefore, asignificant unmet need exists for effective therapies to treat this aggressive and life-threatening disease.The cytosolic kinase mTOR plays a major role in cell survival and proliferation. Limited case studiessuggest that the mTOR pathway is frequently deregulated in sporadic malignant PEComa (mostly withmutation or loss of TSC2), making mTOR inhibition a promising therapeutic strategy. Rapamycin blocksmTORC1 signaling, resulting in decreased protein translation and G1 cell cycle arrest. In some casestudies, patients with PEComa benefited from treatment with mTOR inhibitors, including oral rapamycin.Oral mTOR inhibitors have low and highly variable oral bioavailability, poor solubility, and dose-limitingGI toxicities and require therapeutic monitoring of blood levels to ensure adequate dosing. A novelalbumin-bound nanoparticle rapamycin (sirolimus) was developed (nab-rapamycin, ABI-009; originallyby Abraxis Bioscience/Celgene Corporation and licensed to AADi, LLC). In a phase 1 clinical study,ABI-009 administered intravenously showed a promising safety despite high dose with evidence ofresponses and stable disease in a variety of solid tumors. Albumin bound drugs have shown enhancedtumor penetration, and ABI-009 shows significantly improved activity in animal models at equal doseand superior pharmacological properties with significantly higher Cmax and AUC without compromisingsafety as compared to the available mTOR inhibitors.AADi, LLC, a small start-up company and applicant for this grant, has filed IND 125,669 (submitted Jul13, 2015 and approved Aug 13, 2015) to conduct a single arm phase 2 clinical study (NCT02494570) toassess the efficacy and safety of intravenous ABI-009 for advanced (locally advanced and metastatic)malignant PEComa. There are no other ongoing trials for this patient population. Thirty-five patients willbe enrolled and the primary endpoint will be ORR; the secondary endpoints will be duration of response(DOR), PFS rate at 6 months, PFS, OS, and safety/tolerability. PK/PD and tumor biomarkers will beanalyzed as correlative and translational components to determine mechanisms of tumor response andresistance. In agreement with the FDA (DOP2) in a pre-IND meeting, this single-arm study design andstatistical considerations may be sufficient to support a marketing application for ABI-009 in advancedPEComa [Appendix - Attachment 2: AADi-FDA Pre-IND Meeting Minutes 7/7/2015] if the primaryendpoint of ORR is of sufficient magnitude and duration. As of the date of this grant resubmission, all 9of the planned US clinical sites have been IRB approved and activated. From April 2016 to October2016 (date of the resubmission), 7 patients have been enrolled in the study.This program represents a unique opportunity to develop and get approval of a new drug withpotentially improved efficacy and safety over existing therapies, for an extremely rare disease andpatient population for which there are no approved therapies."

Most individuals with lung cancer die of their disease because of drug resistance, invasion andmetastases, features closely linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells(CSCs). Importantly, this resistant phenotype includes targeted agents (e.g., EGFR inhibitors), conventionalchemotherapy, radiation, and escape from immune destruction by upregulation of PD-L1. The identificationand therapeutic targeting of molecules contributing to the aggressive and resistant properties of lung cancercells are key to tumor cell eradication and cure. Recently, we discovered that TGFβ-mediated EMT involvesupregulation of the cell surface receptor, Neuropilin-2 (NRP2). Importantly, NRP2 knockdown inhibits TGFβ-mediated migration, invasion, metastasis and tumorsphere formation, a feature of CSCs. More recently, wediscovered that TGFβ induces the preferential translation of a previously uninvestigated isoform, NRP2b,which is identical to the prototype NRP2a in its extracellular domain, but diverges substantially before thetransmembrane segment to encode a distinct, yet highly evolutionarily conserved, C-terminus. Our studiesdemonstrate that NRP2a and NRP2b have opposing effects on tumorigenesis, with NRP2b specificallypromoting tumorigenesis, as well as signaling from the receptor tyrosine kinase, MET. The isoforms also differin their binding to the PDZ domain protein, GIPC1, which is specific to NRP2a, and which is also known tofunction in receptor endocytosis and trafficking. Importantly, mutations that disrupt NRP2a-GIPC1 binding donot result in NRP2b-like activities, whereas C-terminal deletions of NRP2b attenuate its ability to enhancemigration. These results suggest that the NRP2b C-terminus is critical to its pro-tumorigenic properties, whichmay result from differential interactions or trafficking of cell surface receptors, including MET. Understandingthe mechanistic underpinnings of how NRP2b functions has therapeutic implications. This may come fromidentifying which cooperating receptors are most important, or elucidating the mechanisms by which NRP2baffects receptor trafficking, thus suggesting new therapeutic strategies. Aim 1 will use genetic approaches tofurther examine the role of MET in NRP2b function and tumorigenesis, as well as determine if NRP2 isoformsdifferentially interact with MET, or affect its endocytosis, trafficking and recycling. In addition, we will examinepatient samples for co-expression of NRP2b along with markers of MET activation and EMT. Aim 2 will test thehypothesis that the effects of NRP2b on MET can be generalized to other receptors. Their contribution toNRP2b function and tumorigenesis will be examined. In Aim 3, we will use site-specific mutagenesis anddomain swaps to identify critical residues in the 93 amino acid NRP2b C-terminus (JM, TM and cytoplasmicsegments) responsible for its distinct activity. The JM segment is unique, extracellular and predicted to beantigenic. We will make monoclonal antibodies against this segment and test them for specificity and inhibitoryactivity. NRP2b represents a highly innovative avenue of research, which can be exploited for therapeutic gain.In addition, EMT plays a major role in inflammation, fibrosis and normal development, where the role of NRP2bis unknown. Thus, our proposed studies should have broad applicability to lung cancer and other humandiseases."

As a result, the Consortium to AlleviatePTSD (CAP) was formed to a) significantly advance treatment strategies for PTSDincluding interventions for early, chronic, and latent onset cases, and b) to identify andconfirm clinically relevant biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of PTSDand co-occurring disorders. This project aims to fill gaps identified in the NRAP byexamining the validity of genetic-based biomarkers to identify PTSD, PTSD course, andresponse to PTSD treatment. We plan to leverage extensive existing resources in theSTRONG STAR Repository to examine a comprehensive set of genetic and epigeneticmarkers associated with PTSD. These resources include: (1) a collection of humanpostmortem tissue of PTSD (n=30) and matched control (n=60) brains; (2) a cohort ofservice members treated for PTSD with blood collected prior to treatment and at 6months post-treatment (n=600); and (3) an epidemiologic cohort of Soldiers assessedprior to and after deployment in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedomand New Dawn that included blood collection and PTSD assessment at eachassessment (n=4,112). Using a combination of whole-genome microarray andsequencing approaches, we will: (1) identify genetic (SNP, mRNA) or epigenetic (DNAmethylation, microRNA) alterations in PTSD; (2) characterize the neuronal morphologyof selected brain regions in PTSD and matched controls through Golgi impregnation; (3)identify top gene regulatory networks among the identified set of genes across thesamples to guide biomarker analyses; and (4) systematically identify, validate, and testbiomarkers based on the mRNA, SNPs, DNA methylation, and microRNA markers ofidentified genes. We have assembled a collaborative team of scientists consisting of agenetic epidemiologist (Dr. Williamson), a psychiatric geneticist (Dr. Gelernter), ageneticist (Dr. Carless), a neuroanatomist (Dr. Selemon), human postmortem experts(Drs. Young, Kleinman, Hyde, Thompson, & Cruz), biostatisticians (Drs. Mintz, Gelfond,Michelek, & Jaffe), and a clinical psychologist (Dr. Litz).

The efforts targets a proxy crop, snap bean, and three proxy applications prioritized by our industry partners as key to their commercial efforts, namely disease risk modeling, harvest timing/scheduling, and yield prediction to propel FARMS into a sustainable innovation ecosystem. This is essential, since although the UAS agricultural market is pegged at US$34.2B globally, the USA is lagging due to past restrictions on commercial UAS flights. The FARMS Alliance will find fertile ground for growth in Upstate NY, where the Finger Lakes Regional Economic Development Council has identified agriculture as a strategic growth area. This effort will afford the Finger Lakes region an opportunity to be a hub in the Eastern USA for agriculture and food production and with coordination, will lead to leadership and growth in the industry. Finally, at least four imaging science and six business graduate students will be trained at the nexus of imaging-precision-agriculture-business, equipped as truly trans-disciplinary scientists and managers.The proposed project will contribute significantly to the identification of both spectral (color) and structural (3D) signatures from UAs platforms that are coupled to specific precision agriculture applications. We will improve on the relatively simple and generic current approaches, and develop new methods to distill oversampled UAS remote sensing data to the essence of metrics required for each application. This close collaboration between imaging scientists and plant physiologists will lead to turn-key, specific (optimized) solutions for our industry partners, to then market to the burgeoning precision agriculture economy. In short, expensive UAS systems will be used to derive commercial, affordable, and practical UAS solutions that can transition to the precision agriculture sector. Finally, this approach will hedge consistent, reliable image processing via proper spectral calibration of the target scene and the instruments themselves - this sets the FARMS Alliance apart from similar, simple spectral metric solutions that currently are being offered by precision agriculture service providers.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have proven to be a successful educational innovation that have enabled more students to do research. The biological context for this education research project is a CURE that is based on the gut bacterial microbiome of the bean beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus. College and university faculty from a range of institutions and geographic locations will attend workshops as a part of this project to learn how to work with bean beetles, study their microbiome, evaluate microbial community data, and implement bean beetle microbiome CUREs in their courses. Working with bean beetles will allow student researchers to readily manipulate factors that might affect gut bacteria in ways that would not be possible with vertebrates or other insect model systems. Students will have the freedom to design their own experiments and to develop their own research questions, as practicing scientists do. The project is designed to examine the importance of student autonomy (i.e. choosing their own research questions) in the context of course-based research classes, and to guide science educators as they change the way in which science is learned and taught. This project has the potential to benefit students at a range of institutions including minority serving and two-year colleges by increasing the retention of students in science and fostering interest in pursuing STEM careers or graduate school. The overall goal of this project is to determine the importance of student autonomy in a discovery CURE across diverse institutions. This goal will be achieved by disseminating, implementing, and assessing a data-intensive bean beetle microbiome CURE that will simultaneously advance our understanding of insect host-microbe interactions. The first objective is to examine the importance of student autonomy in a discovery CURE. Student outcomes will be assessed using a mixed methods approach with surveys, structured interviews, and focus groups. The second objective is to foster research on insect host-microbe interactions using experimental approaches with the bean beetle model system. The third and fourth goals are to develop faculty expertise with hands-on workshops in research protocols for examining microbial communities in bean beetles, and in data science for bioinformatics and microbial community analyses. The fifth objective is to foster the implementation of data-intensive course-based research at diverse institutions.

Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have proven to be a successful educational innovation for enabling more students to do research. The biological context for this education research project is a CURE that is based on the gut bacterial microbiome of the bean beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus. College and university faculty from a range of institutions and geographic locations will attend workshops as a part of this project to learn how to work with bean beetles, study their microbiome, evaluate microbial community data, and implement bean beetle microbiome CUREs in their courses. Working with bean beetles will allow student researchers to readily manipulate factors that might affect gut bacteria in ways that would not be possible with vertebrates or other insect model systems. Students will have the freedom to design their own experiments and to develop their own research questions, as practicing scientists do. The project is designed to examine the importance of student autonomy (i.e. choosing their own research questions) in the context of course-based research classes, and to guide science educators as they change the way in which science is learned and taught. This project has the potential to benefit students at a range of institutions including minority serving and two-year colleges by increasing the retention of students in science and fostering interest in pursuing STEM careers or graduate school. The overall goal of this project is to determine the importance of student autonomy in a discovery CURE across diverse institutions. This goal will be achieved by disseminating, implementing, and assessing a data-intensive bean beetle microbiome CURE that will simultaneously advance our understanding of insect host-microbe interactions. The first objective is to examine the importance of student autonomy in a discovery CURE. Student outcomes will be assessed using a mixed methods approach with surveys, structured interviews, and focus groups. The second objective is to foster research on insect host-microbe interactions using experimental approaches with the bean beetle model system. The third and fourth goals are to develop faculty expertise with hands-on workshops in research protocols for examining microbial communities in bean beetles, and in data science for bioinformatics and microbial community analyses. The fifth objective is to foster the implementation of data-intensive course-based research at diverse institutions. Faculty from the hands-on workshops will implement a bean beetle microbiome CURE in two different semesters. The project is designed to increase the number of minority and two-year college students who participate in CUREs, stay engaged in science, and pursue graduate degrees in STEM disciplines.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Aaron R. Leichty is  Characterization of Genetic Regulatory Networks Controlling Bifacial and Unifacial Leaf Morphology in Legumes . The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California-Davis and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Neelima Sinha.The morphology of a leaf impacts plant physiology, which in turn determines where a plant can grow and reproduce. Plants adapted to arid environments often have leaves with morphological traits that are not found in plants that grow in wetter environments. This project examines the development of a striking adaptation to arid environments: the leaves of many woody legumes are vertically oriented and radially or vertically symmetric. Examining the similarities and differences in genetic regulatory networks underlying the leaves of major legume crops and the leaves of woody legumes may allow for the engineering of crops better adapted to a warmer, dryer, more variable climate. Training objectives include comparative developmental genomics, systems biology, bioinformatics, and gene expression and regulation in legumes. Broader impacts will include training opportunities for undergraduates and high school students and development of high school curriculum related to plant molecular biology, husbandry, and tissue culture. The goals of this project are to determine how bifacial and unifacial leaves develop in legumes. To determine how each leaf type is constructed, laser capture microdissection will be used to sample a series of developmental stages very early in leaf morphogenesis, when leaf identity and polarity are specified. These samples will be used for RNA-seq and the resulting data will be used to construct gene co-expression networks. Bioinformatic analyses will be used to identify important communities in the resulting networks. Communities from bifacial and unifacial networks will be compared to identify conserved components of each leaf type across species. Molecular and reverse genetic techniques will be used to validate the resulting networks. Specifically, transient and stable transformation will be used to perturb key genes in the identified genetic regulatory networks to confirm differences in regulatory connections within Acacia and Medicago. For the most promising genes, their unifacial expression pattern will be emulated in Medicago to see how easily bifacial development can be transformed into a unifacial-like morphology. The findings of this research will be shared publicly through presentation and publication. Sequence data and assemblies will be deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), the NCBI Genome resource (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome) and linked through an applicable NCBI BioProject (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/).Keywords: comparative genomics, plant development, systems biology, gene networks, legumes, Medicago truncatula, AcaciaThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how plants and microbes interact will help researchers develop tools and resources to avoid crop damage and reduce the spread of disease from pathogens. Recently, scientists have discovered microscopic bodies in the spaces between plant cells, and these so-called extracellular vesicles (EVs) are thought to play a role in signaling between microbes and host plants. Although well studied in animals, how EVs function in plants is not fully understood. To understand their function, new biochemical techniques were developed and it was found, surprisingly, that EVs contain  stress response  proteins, and carry small molecules (sRNA), which are known to shut down (or silence) genes. The project tests the hypothesis that plant EVs may carry and transfer these important sRNA signaling molecules between microbes and plant hosts. The team will also study how plant EVs are produced, and how plants and pathogens exchange EVs. The outcomes of the research will provide key knowledge to improve plant disease resistance, with long-term practical outcomes for society. Notably, controlling disease spread will improve food security while reducing production costs and use of environmentally harmful fungicides. Understanding the role of EVs could yield targets for engineering resistance to pathogens and will advance analytical methods for studying how molecules are transferred between host plant and pathogen. Educational impacts will be achieved through interdisciplinary training of students and post-doctoral scientists in the area of plant - microbe interactions and in computational biology. This project will focus specifically on EVs from Arabidopsis, plus a model legume, Medicago truncatula (a relative of alfalfa), with pathogen analyses focused on Colletotrichum, a genus of fungi that include many highly destructive species, and Phytophthora, a genus of oomycetes that includes P. infestans, the causal agent of the Irish potato famine. The work will be done in these species because there are significant, existing genetic and molecular resources and background work, including from the European partners of the project. The questions to be addressed by this project include whether EVs are a primary mechanism for transfer of information between plants and their fungal pathogens? What are the contents of the EVs? How are the EVs transferred and delivered? Ultimately, the project will address whether altering the contents of the EVs has a significant impact on plant-fungal interactions. The project will characterize phenotypes of plants and potentially fungal and oomycete strains altered in their EV contents. Project members will be trained broadly in plant and fungal interactions, small RNA biology and genomics, cell biology and microscopy, and computational methods through individual and group projects in the analysis of the localization, biogenesis, and biochemistry of EVs.

This project uses the environmentally-cued production of winged or wingless variants in pea aphids to examine the developmental genetic basis of plasticity, as well as to investigate the genetic basis of plasticity variation within and between species. This integrative research uses a variety of approaches, including genetic mapping, genomics, gene knockdown, pharmaceutical manipulations, and careful developmental observations. This research will significantly advance knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that control phenotypic plasticity and the genes responsible for the evolution of that plasticity. The research team will include graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. Community engagement activities will broaden the impact of the research and broaden the training of the students. The team will offer a summer course to high school students, and will present the research outcomes to the general public and to high school audiences. Moreover, a participation-based teaching module developed from the research will be implemented in a core undergraduate genetic course, helping to train the next generation of scientists. This research addresses the fascinating and understudied problem of how developmental processes are influenced by environmental cues to cause phenotypic diversity and, importantly, how those processes evolve. The research comprises three objectives that capitalize on the powerful comparative framework provided by the environmentally-cued wing dimorphisms of aphids, working from within to between species investigations. The first objective is an in-depth molecular investigation of wing morph determination within a single species, the pea aphid. The research team will discover the molecular mechanisms that control wing morph determination in this species, testing the interactions of three candidate pathways using RNAi and pharmaceutical manipulations. Second, variation in the strength of the plasticity response exhibited by different pea aphid genotypes will be examined. The research team will identify the genes responsible for this intraspecific variation using genetic mapping and gene expression analyses. Third, the focus will shift to comparing species that exhibit differences in the developmental timing of their plasticity responses. The research team will use gene expression analysis, RNAi, and pharmaceutical manipulations to ask how wing morph determination mechanisms have changed between species.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sinorhizobium meliloti is a member of a larger group of bacteria called rhizobia, and is environmentally and economically vital in the field of agriculture. Sinorhizobium beneficially infects legumes and provides useable nitrogen to increase crop yield. An efficient and productive rhizobium infection reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. Expanding our knowledge of the genetic systems that control the behavior of this bacterium has the potential to allow manipulation to optimize the rhizobium-plant interaction.

The overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate and understand the role of a hybrid phosphotransferase system (PTS) and a unique two component signal transduction system in regulating gene expression in the bacterial nitrogen-fixing gram-negative symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti. The project will study a recently identified and novel interaction between the two systems that regulates several cellular processes. Additionally, the systems themselves are interesting and insufficiently characterized: the phosphotransferase system is an abbreviated nitrogen-sugar hybrid while the two-component system has an intriguing multiple-sensing domain HWE kinase (Sma0113) and an atypical response regulator with no effector domain (Sma0114). One of the processes under dual regulation is catabolite repression. This is a complex process through which bacterial cells adapt to obtain energy and raw materials, and, in related bacteria, controls the expression of genes associated to their ability to interact with their hosts. Three approaches will be used to elucidate how the systems are integrated into the cellular network. Transcriptome analysis will allow identification of the combined regulon of the two systems. Genetic, biochemical, and proteomic methods will reveal their downstream partners. Genetic tools will be used to characterize the promoter structure that allows dual regulation.

These include a few species of bryophytes, ferns, cycads, and a small group of flowering plants. Because of their importance to crops, a lot of research has focused on the relationship between legumes and the bacteria that fix nitrogen for them - rhizobia. Much less is known about an even more widespread partnership between plants and cyanobacteria. Because cyanobacteria are generally less dependent on the plant host than rhizobia, they could be an excellent partner for engineering helpful nitrogen fixation into crop plants. However, our current understanding of plant-cyanobacterium partnerships is poor. The species and genetic diversity of helpful cyanobacteria is virtually unexplored. Similarly, the plant genes involved in these partnerships remain unknown. Hornworts, one of the three bryophyte lineages, are an outstanding system to study plant-cyanobacterial relationships. This study will investigate phylogenetic, functional, and genetic aspects of the hornwort-cyanobacterium partnership. In doing so, the research will explore an array of questions that will provide new insights into how these unique plants interact with their bacterial partners to fix nitrogen. One postdoctoral fellow, three graduate, ten undergraduate, and five high school students will be trained. In partnership with the Science Teachers Association of New York State, an educational video will be made. This video will showcase the various forms of plant-cyanobacterium relationships. The goals of this research are first to uncover the phylogenetic diversity of hornworts and cyanobionts. Then to elucidate the functional diversity of symbiotic nitrogen-fixation. Finally, the research will reveal the genetic components of the association between hornworts and their cyanobionts. The researchers will reconstruct the hornwort tree-of-life using a phylogenomic approach. Then, for each hornwort sample, the genetic diversity of the cyanobiont community will be characterized. Comparing the hornwort and cyanobiont diversity will shed light on host-symbiont specificity. The research will also study patterns of co-evolution, and the roles of cyanobacterial symbiosis in hornwort evolution. Next, population and microcosm studies will be used to test the interaction among hornwort microbiome diversity, environmental variables, and nitrogen-fixation rates. Finally, multiple pure hornwort and cyanobiont cultures will be isolated. Once isolated, their symbioses will be reconstituted under controlled environmental conditions in the laboratory.

The specific focus is on the fungal plant pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the cause of white mold disease in soybean, sunflower, cole crops, pulse crops and a variety of others. In total, this agricultural pathogen infects over 600 plant species and accounts for an estimated $200 million in annual economic loss in the U.S. Market losses can be extremely high when disease outbreaks occur on a large scale; the U.S. soybean stem rot outbreak in 2009, for instance, directly reduced harvests by approximately $560 million. In the field, diseases caused by S. sclerotiorum are challenging to control for the lack of resistant cultivars effective against this pathogen and the long survival properties of the fungus. In Florida, losses occurring in crops of green bean, carrot, Brassica carinata, bell pepper and cabbage are of perennial concern. This research addresses the need to elucidate the genetically based mechanisms of S. sclerotiorum that are required for its aggressiveness and the genetic factors from the host that account for susceptibility or resistance to the pathogen. This information is fundamentally important for the long-term purpose of developing effective disease control strategies against this devastating fungal pathogen. This research will have the broader impact of training undergraduates recruited from the University of Florida Undergraduate Research Minority Participation Program in molecular genetic techniques using cutting edge tools for genome manipulation. This project aims to elucidate factors that underlie the establishment of basic compatibility in broad host range necrotrophic pathogens. The working model is that these pathogens, exemplified by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, utilize a two-phase strategy for establishing basic compatibility and host colonization. From this model two hypotheses are possible.The first hypothesis is that basic host-pathogen compatibility across a broad range of hosts is established by pathogen targeting of universally conserved host targets (e.g., MED16). The alternative, but not mutually exclusive, hypothesis is that these pathogens have evolved and utilize independent virulence factors and effectors for different hosts to overcome host-specific defenses (e.g., glucosinolates). One discovery-based and two targeted Specific Objectives will test these hypotheses. The first is to create and phenotype gene-specific loss-of-function mutations for select members of the predicted S. sclerotiorum secretome chosen from transcriptome data. The second objective is to characterize the pathway of Arabidopsis Mediator complex subunit 16 (MED16) protein modification and degradation to understand its role in broad host range necrotrophic pathogen susceptibility and resistance. The final objective is to determine the role of MED16 degradation in host susceptibility to S. sclerotiorum and other broad host range necrotrophic pathogens. Plant disease resistance to this class of pathogens lags behind the understanding of other classes of host-pathogen interactions. The genetically complex nature of these interactions is a major factor limiting understanding. Utilizing new molecular genetic tools and genomic resources, the proposed research will establish greater mechanistic understanding of broad host range necrotrophic pathogen-host compatibility.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Biological nitrogen fixation is the process of converting nitrogen gas to nitrogen that is used by the majority of organisms on Earth. Nitrogen fixation is accomplished by bacteria. Plant-associated bacteria (called rhizobia) are responsible for fixing 100 million metric tons of nitrogen in nature, and provide a critical ecosystem service. However, anthropogenic nitrogen inputs have the potential to change this bacteria-plant relationship. The fellow will use historical museum specimens to understand how increases in environmental nitrogen have changed the relationship between plants andplant-associated nitrogen fixation bacteria. The fellow will focus on Legumes and their rhizobia because these plants are important for ecosystem health and function. In areas with high nitrogen deposition, legumes decrease in frequency and are at risk for extinction. This project will better describe the legume-rhizobia relationship in environments with high nitrogen conditions and potentially illuminate conservation strategies and ways to preserve critical ecosystem functions.This project will incorporate biological collections to achieve two main objectives: 1) To conduct population genomic analyses across space and time to identify regions of host and symbiont genomes under selection and test whether anthropogenic nitrogen increase alters these patterns. 2) To use revived historical germplasm to experimentally test if there is evidence for antagonistic coevolution between host and symbiont in high nitrogen environments. This work will be done using contemporary and historical collections of legume species, Medicago lupulina and their rhizobial symbionts, Ensifer meliloti, that will be isolated from the roots of contemporary and historical plant specimens. Biological collections are an untapped resource for studying historical patterns of coevolution and as a source of material to perform manipulative experiments to better understand coevolutionary patterns. Collections can effectively act as a  time machine  allowing us a glimpse at the trajectory of coevolution in the Anthropocene. Broader impacts of this project include the development of protocols that allow researchers to revive historical bacteria. These protocols will be made publicly available and revolutionize the types of questions researchers can ask about mutualistic coevolution. The fellow will also develop active learning exercises about coevolution. Active learning is an incredibly effective pedagogical technique and one that leads to better learning outcomes for women and underrepresented groups in the classroom, and thus is one force that can be employed to level the playing field in academics.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the use of industrial fertilizers has contributed substantially to feeding the world, the production of nitrogen fertilizers requires fossil fuels and excessive fertilizers cause serious environmental pollution. In contrast, plants of the legume family can make their own nitrogen fertilizer by forming symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, called rhizobia. This symbiosis culminates in the formation of specialized root organs, called nodules, within which the bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia for use by the plant. One important property of the legume-rhizobial symbiosis is its high level of specificity. Such specificity can take place at various stages of the interaction, ranging from initial bacterial infection and nodulation (nodulation specificity) to late nodule development associated with nitrogen fixation efficiency (nitrogen fixation specificity). This project aims to elucidate genetic and molecular mechanisms that regulate symbiotic specificity in the legume-rhizobia interaction. Such knowledge will facilitate development of novel strategies to enhance the benefits of symbiotic nitrogen fixation for sustainable agriculture. This project will contribute to the training of students at graduate, undergraduate and high school levels. The research group will particularly encourage the participation of members of under-represented undergraduates to join the project.Despite recent advances in our understanding of the signaling pathways leading to root nodule development, the molecular mechanisms underlying natural variation in nodulation capacity and nitrogen fixation efficiency are still not well understood. In the Medicago truncatula- Sinorhizobium meliloti interaction, the Zhu laboratory recently cloned two host genes, NFS1 and NFS2 that regulate nitrogen fixation specificity concerning S. meliloti Rm41 and an NS1 locus containing two receptor-like kinases that restricts infection and nodulation by Rm41. The polymorphic NFS genes encode nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides. In contrast to the predominant notion of NCR peptides as effectors of endosymbionts' differentiation to nitrogen-fixing bacteroids, this finding demonstrated that specific NCRs negatively regulate symbiotic persistence. NFS1 and NFS2 provoke bacterial cell death and early nodule senescence in an allele-specific and rhizobial strain-specific manner, and their function is dependent on the host's genetic background. This project addresses how NCR peptides, on one hand, can induce terminal bacteroid differentiation needed for nitrogen fixation, and on the other hand, some NCR variants result in lysis of bacteroids. Specifically, the project will determine whether the pro- and anti-symbiotic peptides interact with the same bacterial targets, how amino-acids of the peptides affect their function, and how the functions of these peptides are affected by the genetic background. The specific objectives of the research include: (1) characterization of the NFS1 and NFS2 genes and their roles in negative regulation of symbiotic development with Rm41; (2) cloning and characterization of a suppressor of NFS1; and (3) characterization of the NS1 locus that restricts nodulation by Rm41.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These symbionts influence aphids' interactions with food plants, protect aphids from attack by parasites and pathogens, or alleviate the effects of temperature changes. Since insects are important vectors of human disease and major agricultural pests, understanding the roles of these 'hidden players', and the mechanisms underlying symbiont function is important to further human interests in crop protection and preventing disease spread.

However, just a subset of such partnerships is likely favored as pairings between rare symbiont partners could heighten costs or emergent pathogenicity. Alternatively, rarity of some co-infections may stem from within-host symbiont interactions, including competition and resulting decreases in transmission rates. Conversely, common co-infections may stem from non-competing, cooperative symbionts that reciprocally enhance transmission. This award will test these different scenarios through manipulative experiments on engineered aphid lines that measure the impacts of co-infection context on symbiont-mediated protective phenotypes and rates of symbiont transfer.

Many plants in the legume family are invasive weeds, perhaps because they cooperate with bacteria called rhizobia to obtain a reliable supply of nitrogen. For example, the legume French broom and its rhizobia have become invasive in America after being introduced from Europe. Introduced species might become invasive by escaping enemies that plague them at home. Like other bacteria, rhizobia are often attacked by viruses. Did French broom become invasive in America because its partner rhizobia escape viruses that plagued them back home? To begin answering this question, rhizobia and associated viruses will be collected from European (native) and American (introduced) populations of French broom. If American populations of French broom rhizobia have escaped their enemies, they should be infected by fewer viruses. However, American rhizobium viruses might have evolved to infect the introduced rhizobia. To test this idea, rhizobia and associated viruses will be collected from a native legume and the viruses will be tested to discover if they can infect rhizobia associated with French broom. This work will help understand how viruses could be used to manipulate host populations. A postdoctoral scholar will be trained in research and communication skills as part of this project.For release from bacteriophage infection to explain invasiveness of rhizobia and their partner legumes, bacteriophages must control rhizobium populations in their home range but not in the invasive range. This pattern requires that bacteriophages be specialized and more easily infect sympatric than allopatric rhizobia. As a first step toward addressing this issue, the host ranges of rhizobial bacteriophages collected from three European and three American populations of Genista monspessulana will be assessed in vitro by inoculation onto single-isolate  lawns  of Bradyrhizobium genotypes isolated from these same populations. The number of bacteriophages isolated from native and non-native range populations will also be compared. To test whether indigenous American bacteriophages might control introduced Bradyrhizobium populations, the host ranges of bacteriophages isolated from bradyrhizobia associating with the native legume, Lupinus arboreus, will also be tested against Bradyrhizobium genotypes isolated in the survey described above. This work will test whether the Enemy Escape Hypothesis applies to an economically and ecologically important microbe associated with an invasive legume. It will further examine how bacteriophage host ranges evolve in response to shifts in host population changes. In so doing, it will enhance scientific understanding of how bacteriophages affect mutualistic interactions between hosts and beneficial bacterial symbionts.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In short, a thin layer (about 100 microns, as thin as a human hair) of interfacial water was found to exist with a slightly higher pH, net negative charge, and a tendency to exclude impurities. These findings were similar to those found by other independent research groups working with xylem cells in plants and muscle cells in animals. Several hydrogels and polymers were also found to contain interfacial water with similar properties. Initial studies regarding the practical use of the interfacial water were conducted in a plant system. On average, initial results show a rapid growth rate of around 10% to 20% improvement compared to the control group; preliminary findings that have now been confirmed to be similar amongst four different plants, namely chick pea, wheatgrass, basil, and pea shoots.

Aquafeeds represent >50% of the cost of production, and losses due to mortality can be as high as 50% in certain commercial species. A novel feed ingredient that contains immuno-nutritional properties to address these inefficiencies could be considered a game-changer to the industry. Fish are the most resource-efficient sources of animal protein, a healthy source of food for people, and will be one of the ways to address food security. As the surface of the planet is greater than two-thirds ocean, one estimate suggests, if managed properly, just 2% of this vast resource could produce enough food for all of mankind. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to expand previous studies that suggested a novel single cell protein (SCP) is a significant candidate to serve as a fishmeal alternative. In addition, SCP also may contain functional properties that improve growth performance and survival. The SCP tested previously supported improved feed conversion ratios (FCR) as compared to conventional diets, while at the same time, statistically relevant improvements in survival of carnivorous fish and shrimp. It also was observed that SCP relieved secondary disease complications associated with diets, such as gastro-enteritis. With hundreds of marketable species in aquaculture, and an industry that is just 50 years old, the collective understanding of aquatic animal nutrition is in its infancy. In this project, a carnivorous Seriola species will be used as a model organism to serve as an additional reference point beyond salmon. Targeted components of the SCP will be enhanced (or deleted) to determine the effect of leading immuno-nutritional candidates on the animals' ability to digest more completely inputs like soy bean meal (SBM). The effectiveness of SCPs in emerging commercial fish diets has yet to be fully elucidated, and the results of this study may have implications towards lower-cost feed formulations and optimized nutrition.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One unique group of motile soil bacteria are rhizobia, which can live freely in the soil, as well as engage in specific symbiotic relationships with leguminous plants such as peas, soy beans, and alfalfa. This symbiosis supplies the host plant with nitrogen, which is the most limiting nutrient for plant growth. The process of chemotaxis in the model rhizobium Sinorhizobium meliloti allows the organism to recognize its host, which improves the symbiotic relationship, and consequently, enhances plant growth. The PI discovered multiple and diverse chemoreceptors in S. meliloti, which are used to sense chemical compounds. However, little is known about the attractant spectrum or the specificity of rhizobial chemoreceptors. The overarching goal of this project is to characterize the specific adaptations of S. meliloti chemoreception to the range of host-derived attractants. Results from this research will transform our current concepts of bacterial behavior in soil through discovery of emergent properties of legume-rhizobia interactions. Chemotaxis of the soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti is a critical prerequisite for the establishment of its symbiotic relationship with alfalfa. The discovery of a new type of bacterial chemotaxis, namely attraction to plant-borne betaines, and the identification of the rhizobial chemoreceptor for these compounds expands our understanding of plant-bacteria communication. The results of this research will open avenues for developing novel and innovative strategies to enhance chemoreception in the symbiotic bacterium S. meliloti, which will increase symbiotic efficiency, result in higher level of nitrogen fixation, and may ultimately increase crop yields. This project can directly benefit future agricultural and environmental issues by reducing the use of chemical fertilizers. Broader Impacts activities will involve the interdisciplinary training of graduate students. The team is committed to mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, especially underrepresented minorities and women. Public outreach activities include hands-on demonstrations for elementary and high school students, both on- and off-campus, and involvement of high school students in research.Using the Alfalfa-S. meliloti interaction as a model system, the investigators aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that govern legume-rhizobia communications. Understanding these mechanisms could open important new avenues for addressing daunting agricultural and environmental issues. This research will characterize S. meliloti chemoreceptors for which functional understanding is lacking. In an orthogonal approach, the investigators will define the nature of plant-derived compounds responsible for the recruitment of S. meliloti to the host rhizosphere. The composition of compounds exuded by plants into the rhizosphere has specifically evolved to attract symbiotic microbes to the roots of their corresponding hosts. First, the investigators propose to characterize the diverse phytochemicals secreted by the S. meliloti host alfalfa using mass-spectrometric metabolome analysis and quantitative chemotaxis assays. This study will uncover the S. meliloti attractome and establish the contributions of individual compounds to chemotaxis. Second, they propose to identify receptor ligands for individual chemoreceptors and determine receptor-ligand interaction through behavioral, genetic, biochemical, and structural analyses. The already highly advanced biochemical and structural characterization of McpX serves as blueprint for these analyses. The proposed research will advance our knowledge of the role of exuded root metabolites in the dialogue between plants and microbes.The Project is jointly funded by Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (CDF Cluster) and Integrative Organismal Systems (PBI Cluster), with additional support provided by the Directorate's Rule of Life Venture Fund.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While much is known about the properties of invasive plants and animals, much less is known about the beneficial microbes (microscopic organisms) that accompany introduced species. Rhizobia are beneficial bacteria that inhabit leguminous plant root tissue where they convert nitrogen from the atmosphere to a plant-available form. Leguminous plants provide these microbes with sugars from photosynthesis. Legumes that disperse to habitats that lack these bacteria are typically unable to persist, however the bacteria can also spread through the soil or air. The aim of this research is to examine whether invasions change the nature of a mutualistic interaction. The investigators will study specialization and the evolution of cooperation in both natural and experimentally staged invasions for two plant species and their beneficial microbes. While this question has been addressed in aboveground systems, this is one of the first to utilize a belowground plant mutualism. This project will promote diversity in the sciences, provide research training and education in the biology of plant-microbe interactions, and inform efforts to control invasive plants. Diverse undergraduate students from Florida International University will participate in summer research at University of California at Riverside and Michigan State University. An educational module will also be developed on rhizobium-legume interactions in neighborhood soils, to be distributed to school children via MSU's Kellogg Biological Station Bioenergy Sustainability Program and the Fairchild Challenge, an environmental education program that reaches over 100,000 children a year in Miami.To understand whether mutualisms become less beneficial in the process of species invasions, this project will test the hypothesized trade-off between partner breadth and mutualism benefit across legume and rhizobium genotypes from the native and invasive range for two Medicago species. Medicago is the genus that includes alfalfa. Both species are native to Europe and invasive in the US. The researchers will 1) compare genetic diversity in native vs. invaded host range mutualists, using high marker density genotyping for hosts and whole-genome sequencing for symbionts, 2) assess divergence in mutualism properties between the native and invaded range to test hypotheses of reduced specialization, partner choice and mutualism dependence in invaded range mutualists using cross-inoculation trials, 3) test the impact of invasion on symbiont genome dynamics and mutualisms by simulated symbiont invasions in soil mesocosms under contrasting host density and diversity, and 4) identify the molecular underpinnings of mutualism specialization using a transcriptomic approach to nominate host-symbiont pathways. This research will shed light on the long-standing question of whether beneficial microbes face a trade-off between having a broad partner range and providing a high degree of benefit to a partner.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite much research, many determinants of host resistance and their roles in signaling remain unknown. Pseudomonas syringae, a plant pathogenic bacterium, causes disease in more than 150 plant species. ZAR1 is the R protein responsible for recognizing the acetyltransferase HopZ1a, a P. syringae type III secreted effector protein (T3SE). ZAR1 is found in many plant species, including the Solanaceae, castor bean, and rice. However ZAR1 defense signaling does not depend on any components previously implicated in plant resistance, including salicylic acid. Further investigation of ZAR1 signaling gives us a unique opportunity to identify novel genes involved in plant resistance and potential targets for improving plant immunity. This project plan will address three major questions:  1) What other genes are genetically implicated in resistance to HopZ1a? Preliminary data from a forward genetics screen has identified several mutants that lack HopZ1a-mediated defense responses (hopz-effector-triggered-immunity-deficient or zed). The proposed work will map these mutants and characterize their roles in resistance.   2) What is the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance? The proposed work will identify other proteins that contribute to ZAR1-mediated resistance.   3) Is ZAR1 resistance conserved in other plant species? The proposed work will examine ZAR1 resistance in wild and domesticated tomato. Using a multi-pronged approach, this work will identify and characterize new sources of resistance to protect plants from disease.  The specific objectives are: Objective 1:  Conduct genetic screens coupled with next-generation DNA sequencing to identify genes that contribute to pathogen resistance in plants.   Objective 2:  Characterize the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance using molecular, genetic, and proteomic approaches.

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B.

Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics."

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B. Identify pre-emergence herbicides and agronomic practices for the management of weeds in edible grain legume-cereal grain cropping systems characterized by different soil moisture environments. Sub-objective 1C. Examine the effects of host plant, rhizobacteria, soilborne pathogens, and their interactions on biological nitrogen fixation. Research will be conducted across laboratory, greenhouse and field facilities maintained by the research unit and collaborators.   Participating ARS personnel and collaborators have expertise in agronomy and weed science, plant pathology and microbiology, and plant breeding and genetics."

These crops form symbiotic associations with rhizobacteria that results in biological nitrogen fixation that contributes to productivity and profitability of cropping systems. Peas, lentils, and chickpeas are typically sown in the spring, and the development of autumn sown legumes may provide alternatives to winter wheat. Diseases cause considerable losses in these crops every year and are primarily managed by the use of resistant varieties. However, resistance is lacking to several important diseases, including root rots caused by Aphanomyces and Fusarium, Ascochyta blight, Pythium seed rot, and Sclerotinia white mold. Improved understanding of fungicide resistance and mechanisms of pathogenicity and virulence will accelerate the development of effective and efficient practices for managing diseases of these crops. Over the next five years this research project has the following objectives.  Objective 1: Develop and release improved germplasm and cultivars of peas, lentils, and chickpeas that have desirable agronomic traits coupled with enhancements in nutritional characteristics and the ability to form symbiotic effective relationships with nitrogen-fixing rhizobacteria.   Subobjective 1A: Develop improved germplasm and cultivars of peas, lentils, and chickpeas that have enhanced field performance and nutritional quality.  Subobjective 1B: Characterize factors that influence biological nitrogen fixation resulting from symbiosis between autumn sown pea and Rhizobium leguminosarum.

Given favorable outcomes, breeders will benefit from germplasm releases, growers from increased yield potential and nitrogen fixation, consumers from healthy low cost food with improved quality, and the environment from reduced pesticide use.   Germplasm lines which incorporate novel traits from exotic sources into near-commercial seed market types will provide public and private breeders with useful traits for cultivar development. Moving traits from exotic sources into adapted commercial cultivars is an otherwise arduous task for most breeding programs. Thus, these germplasm releases will facilitate adoption of new traits by breeders and increase genetic diversity in their programs which is crucial for advancing yield potential and for sustainability in the long term. It is expected that some breeding lines with exceptional performance generated by this project will be released as cultivars.    Another long-term goal is to better understand the genetics underpinning complex traits and leverage this knowledge to improve breeding strategies. High-throughput next generation sequencing combined with optical mapping and updated reference genomes will significantly facilitate genetic studies geared toward advancing our breeding efforts. We will seek better markers for indirect selection of economically important traits in pea and common bean and examine new marker-assisted breeding strategies. Populations generated for genetic analyses will be used for breeding and vice versa. Such dual purpose populations facilitate simultaneous advancement toward our long-term goals (germplasm development and genetic knowledge from genomic analyses). For the next five years this project will focus on the following objectives.   Objective 1: Develop genomic analysis populations, and use them to improve genetic understanding of complex traits as well as to accelerate breeding for improved agronomic traits, including biological nitrogen fixation, drought tolerance, tolerance to low soil fertility, and resistance to problematic bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases.

Recurringchromosomal abnormalities permit assignment of some AML patients to favorable vs unfavorable prognosticgroups. Adverse prognosis is also associated with increased expression of a set of homeodomain transcriptionfactors (HoxA7-11 and Meis1) and their target genes. This expression profile is found in AML with translocationor partial duplication of the MLL1 gene (i.e. 11q23-AML), translocations involving the MYST3 and CREBBPgenes, and a subset of cytogenetically normal (CN) AML. We previously identified a set of common HoxA9/10 target genes that was enriched for cytokine receptorsand their pathways, including Fgf2, Tgfβ2 and β3 integrin. HoxA9 and 10 cooperate to activate these genes inhematopoietic and leukemia stem cells (HSC and LSC). Consistent with this, we found that treatment with Fgf-R inhibitors (Fgf-R blocking antibody or the small molecule inhibitor, nintedanib) decreased proliferation andsurvival of CD34+ bone marrow cells from subjects with “Hox-profile” AML compared to samples from thosewithout. In preliminary studies, we found that adding nintedanib to standard induction chemotherapy significantlyprolonged remission and survival vs chemotherapy alone in a murine model of MLL1 rearranged leukemia. HoxA9 and A10 also regulate the innate immune response, but in this case their activities are antagonistic.During the innate immune response, activation of emergency granulopoiesis requires HoxA9, but HoxA10 isrequired to terminate the process. Termination required activation of the Triad1 gene by HoxA10; a process thatinvolved overcoming repression by HoxA9. Triad1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that degrades growth factor receptorsand Mdm2. We found Triad1 knockdown accelerated leukemogenesis in a murine model of 11q23-AML. In this murine model, we found the Lin-ckit+ LSC transcriptome was enriched for pathways involved incytokine production, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, regulation of protein kinase activity, and positiveregulation of the immune response vs control cells. We also found activation of pathways not previouslyassociated with 11q23-AML, including Rap1 signaling. We profiled gene expression in mice in chemotherapy-induced remission (destined to relapse) vs chemotherapy + nintedanib (with sustained remission). We founddifferences in cytokine receptor activity, Pi3k/Akt signaling, guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity,purine/pyrimidine metabolism, oxidative stress response, and glycosamino-glycan biosynthesis. We hypothesize that adverse prognosis in Hox-overexpressing AML is characterized by impaired regulationof cytokine stimulated pathways and an activated stress response. These pathways represent rationaletherapeutic targets to decrease chemotherapy resistance. This hypothesis will be pursued through three aims: Aim 1: Define the role of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways in drug resistance in Hox-overexpressingAML. We will study RTK/PI3K signaling pathways identified in our studies in bone marrow from murine AMLmodels, including activity of anti-apoptotic BH3 proteins and protein phosphatase 2a (PP2a). Aim 2: Determine the impact of Rap1 signaling on disease progression in Hox-overexpressing AML.We will determine the role of various guanine nucleotide exchange factors on Rap or Ras activity, diseaseprogression, and LSC persistence during chemotherapy. Aim 3: Investigate these pathways in AML patient samples. CD34+ bone marrow cells from AML patientsat presentation or with relapsed or refractory disease after standard chemotherapy +/- approved agents will beanalyzed. Hox-overexpressing AML will be compared to AML without increased Hox protein expression. The goal of these studies is to identify therapeutic targets to abolish or suppress LSCs during or afterchemotherapy in adverse prognosis AML. This will be especially relevant to design new approaches to patientswho are not candidates for aggressive treatment due to refractory disease or the presence of co-morbidities."

AMR in food-producing animals threatens the efficacy of therapeutics that ensure animal health and welfare as well asposes a threat to human health. FDA recently announced a plan to bring all medically important antimicrobialdrugs under veterinary oversight, which is currently changing the relationship veterinarians have with theirclients regarding antimicrobial use on farms. Veterinary organizations have defined antimicrobial stewardship,identified the core principles, and promote the development of antimicrobial stewardship plans. The CaliforniaDepartment of Food and Agriculture in collaboration with Washington State University and the University ofCalifornia, Davis, offer actionable recommendations that acknowledge the perception of barriers and recognizemotivators for the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship plans in agriculture. A one-day conference thatwill provide evidence-based, sustainable solutions for practicing veterinarians and livestock producers todevelop practical antimicrobial stewardship plans for their farms.While the principles of stewardship may apply across all sectors of agriculture, the practical application ofthese concepts will differ with each livestock commodity due to the huge variation in management practicesand infectious diseases between species and production types. The focus of this first conference will beantimicrobial stewardship in dairy production. “Partnering for Dairy Antimicrobial Stewardship: Aconference for producers and veterinarians in the West” will serve as a template for others to use acrossthe country and for different food animal species in the West."

As a result, the Consortium to AlleviatePTSD (CAP) was formed to a) significantly advance treatment strategies for PTSDincluding interventions for early, chronic, and latent onset cases, and b) to identify andconfirm clinically relevant biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of PTSDand co-occurring disorders. This project aims to fill gaps identified in the NRAP byexamining the validity of genetic-based biomarkers to identify PTSD, PTSD course, andresponse to PTSD treatment. We plan to leverage extensive existing resources in theSTRONG STAR Repository to examine a comprehensive set of genetic and epigeneticmarkers associated with PTSD. These resources include: (1) a collection of humanpostmortem tissue of PTSD (n=30) and matched control (n=60) brains; (2) a cohort ofservice members treated for PTSD with blood collected prior to treatment and at 6months post-treatment (n=600); and (3) an epidemiologic cohort of Soldiers assessedprior to and after deployment in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedomand New Dawn that included blood collection and PTSD assessment at eachassessment (n=4,112). Using a combination of whole-genome microarray andsequencing approaches, we will: (1) identify genetic (SNP, mRNA) or epigenetic (DNAmethylation, microRNA) alterations in PTSD; (2) characterize the neuronal morphologyof selected brain regions in PTSD and matched controls through Golgi impregnation; (3)identify top gene regulatory networks among the identified set of genes across thesamples to guide biomarker analyses; and (4) systematically identify, validate, and testbiomarkers based on the mRNA, SNPs, DNA methylation, and microRNA markers ofidentified genes. We have assembled a collaborative team of scientists consisting of agenetic epidemiologist (Dr. Williamson), a psychiatric geneticist (Dr. Gelernter), ageneticist (Dr. Carless), a neuroanatomist (Dr. Selemon), human postmortem experts(Drs. Young, Kleinman, Hyde, Thompson, & Cruz), biostatisticians (Drs. Mintz, Gelfond,Michelek, & Jaffe), and a clinical psychologist (Dr. Litz). In addition, we propose tocollaborate with the DoD Integrated Systems Biology group (Drs. Jett & Hammamieh) toleverage SysBioCube in order to gain a systems level perspective of our “-omics” datathat will in turn guide our biomarker discovery work. It is expected that this project will bean important first step in filling the genomic and biomarker gaps in PTSD identified bythe NRAP and facilitate the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarker panelsto aid in the detection, treatment, and prevention of PTSD."

The deposits disrupt tissue structure and eventually compromise organ function. Commonsites of deposition include kidney, spleen, liver, and intestine. In humans proteinuria due to glomerulardeposits is often the first clinical manifestation, and with increasing deposition, the nephrotic syndrome usuallyprogresses to end-stage renal disease. AA amyloidosis usually develops as a complication of chronicinflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, andthe hereditary auto-inflammatory syndromes (e.g., familial Mediterranean fever). It also occurs in associationwith long-standing infections (osteomyelitis, decubitus ulcers, bronchiectasis). Veterans with paraplegia are atrisk of developing AA amyloidosis due to chronic decubitus ulcers, urinary tract infections and osteomyelitis. Inaddition, ankylosing spondylitis is common in our male veterans which also increases risk for AA amyloidosis.At present, there is no specific therapy for AA amyloidosis. Only control of pro-inflammatory stimuli to reducehepatic SAA synthesis has shown an effect on AA amyloid progression. In a recent Phase III clinical trial, apotential new therapy [eprodisate (Kiacta)] failed to show significance in retarding AA progression. Promptedby the unmet needs of patients, our initial aim will be to initiate development of a therapy for AA amyloidosisusing as framework translational studies we have conducted on transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis. Thetherapeutic strategy will be administration of human SAA-specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) thatfacilitate degradation of SAA mRNA resulting in lower SAA levels in blood and less substrate available foramyloid formation. A transgenic mouse model carrying a human SAA1 genomic segment encompassing SAA1promoter and regulatory elements will be generated and employed for this study. Human SAA1-specific ASOswill be provided by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and screened for ability to downregulate SAA1 expression in humancell cultures. Promising compounds will be conjugated with N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc); this modificationconfers targeted delivery to the liver and increases potency 6-10-fold, allowing for lower dosing. After furtherscreening in normal mice to evaluate tolerability, ASOs will be given to human SAA1 transgenic mice todetermine the level of suppression achieved at various doses. The human SAA1 transgenic mice we generatewill be crossed with mice that do not express mouse SAA1 or SAA2; these mice will be provided by Drs.Frederick de Beer and Nancy Webb, University of Kentucky. The offspring of this cross-breeding, i.e., miceexpressing human SAA1 but not mouse SAA1 or SAA2, will be induced to develop AA amyloidosis usingstandard protocols and also treated with selected human SAA-specific ASOs and control random ASOs todetermine the extent to which ASO therapy reduces deposition of human AA amyloid. In a second aim we willexplore the role of post-translational modification of SAA in the genesis of amyloid fibril formation. Our in vitrostudies show that carbamylation of residues in the amino-terminal portion of mouse SAA1.1 has a potentiatingeffect on amyloid formation. This region of SAA is most crucial to the initiation and propagation of amyloidfibrils, suggesting that modifications in this region may have important consequences in vivo as well as in vitro.AA amyloid protein extracted from amyloid deposits of humans and mice, as well as SAA in serum, will beanalyzed by tandem mass spectrometry to identify modified residues. Mouse models will be used to testwhether conditions that promote in carbamylation in vivo also promote AA amyloidogenesis. Other studies willinvestigate the effects of carbamylation on SAA association with HDL. If modifications are found to impactamyloid formation in vivo as they do in vitro, targeting such modifications may offer new therapeutic options totreat this progressive, fatal disease."

PEComasarise most commonly at visceral (especially gastrointestinal and uterine), retroperitoneal, andabdominopelvic sites. Most PEComa lesions are benign and slow-progressing, however, a small subsetof them are malignant PEComas, with an aggressive clinical course including distant metastases andultimate death. Malignant PEComa is extremely rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.12-0.24/1,000,000 or approximately 42-84 new patients per year, and an estimated prevalence of 0.22-0.48/1,000,000 or approximately 77-168 patients in the United States.Currently, no effective medical treatment has been prospectively investigated or approved for advancedmalignant PEComa, including metastatic or locally advanced disease where surgery is not an option.The prognosis for these patients is poor, with an estimated median survival of 12-17 months.Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not demonstrated significant clinical benefit. Therefore, asignificant unmet need exists for effective therapies to treat this aggressive and life-threatening disease.The cytosolic kinase mTOR plays a major role in cell survival and proliferation. Limited case studiessuggest that the mTOR pathway is frequently deregulated in sporadic malignant PEComa (mostly withmutation or loss of TSC2), making mTOR inhibition a promising therapeutic strategy. Rapamycin blocksmTORC1 signaling, resulting in decreased protein translation and G1 cell cycle arrest. In some casestudies, patients with PEComa benefited from treatment with mTOR inhibitors, including oral rapamycin.Oral mTOR inhibitors have low and highly variable oral bioavailability, poor solubility, and dose-limitingGI toxicities and require therapeutic monitoring of blood levels to ensure adequate dosing. A novelalbumin-bound nanoparticle rapamycin (sirolimus) was developed (nab-rapamycin, ABI-009; originallyby Abraxis Bioscience/Celgene Corporation and licensed to AADi, LLC). In a phase 1 clinical study,ABI-009 administered intravenously showed a promising safety despite high dose with evidence ofresponses and stable disease in a variety of solid tumors. Albumin bound drugs have shown enhancedtumor penetration, and ABI-009 shows significantly improved activity in animal models at equal doseand superior pharmacological properties with significantly higher Cmax and AUC without compromisingsafety as compared to the available mTOR inhibitors.AADi, LLC, a small start-up company and applicant for this grant, has filed IND 125,669 (submitted Jul13, 2015 and approved Aug 13, 2015) to conduct a single arm phase 2 clinical study (NCT02494570) toassess the efficacy and safety of intravenous ABI-009 for advanced (locally advanced and metastatic)malignant PEComa. There are no other ongoing trials for this patient population. Thirty-five patients willbe enrolled and the primary endpoint will be ORR; the secondary endpoints will be duration of response(DOR), PFS rate at 6 months, PFS, OS, and safety/tolerability. PK/PD and tumor biomarkers will beanalyzed as correlative and translational components to determine mechanisms of tumor response andresistance. In agreement with the FDA (DOP2) in a pre-IND meeting, this single-arm study design andstatistical considerations may be sufficient to support a marketing application for ABI-009 in advancedPEComa [Appendix - Attachment 2: AADi-FDA Pre-IND Meeting Minutes 7/7/2015] if the primaryendpoint of ORR is of sufficient magnitude and duration. As of the date of this grant resubmission, all 9of the planned US clinical sites have been IRB approved and activated. From April 2016 to October2016 (date of the resubmission), 7 patients have been enrolled in the study.This program represents a unique opportunity to develop and get approval of a new drug withpotentially improved efficacy and safety over existing therapies, for an extremely rare disease andpatient population for which there are no approved therapies."

These pathogens are known for their extensive virulence diversity that may change from one year or location to another.  Thus, one very important target of this project is to identify broad-spectrum disease resistance genes from the Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools of the wild and cultivated common bean. This will be accomplished by inoculating common bean with selected races of the aforementioned pathogens.  Studies of the inheritance of disease resistance will be conducted to characterize and map the new disease resistance genes.  Simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers linked with the newly discovered disease resistance genes will be identified to expedite the incorporation of these genes into new bean cultivars using marker-assisted selection.  Conventional and molecular breeding approaches will be used to develop bean germplasm lines in various market classes that combine several genes with broad-spectrum resistance to the rust, anthracnose, and angular leaf spot pathogens with high yield and other valuable agronomic attributes.   The specific objectives of this project are: Objective 1: Evaluate available common bean accessions from various geographic regions to identify potential sources of resistance to various pathogens, characterize new resistance genes, and develop molecular markers for use in introgression.

It has yet not been established that WTC dusts can act as causative agents to alter CV health. Even if WTC dusts were not direct inducers of CV changes in the FR, it was possible they might have caused damage in situ that modulated the impact of another co-pollutant with a known ability to impact the CV system - and was also present at high levels in Ground Zero air - diesel exhaust particles (DEP; from trucks, generators, cranes). Our previous analyses showed that rats exposed to the alkaline WTC dusts [using exposures/levels mimicking FR mouth-breathing] led to persistent reductions in airway ciliated cell numbers and clearance of the WTC dust itself. Accordingly, we hypothesize that entrained WTC dusts may have acted as direct inducers of CV damage and/or caused enhanced DEP-induced CV injuries as a result of increased pulmonary retention of this co-pollutant. As FR models, rats will be exposed on 2 consecutive days (2 hr./d, by intratracheal inhalation) to WTC dust (collected on-site 9/12 & 9/13), DEP, or the two pollutants in combination, and examined for changes in their CV structures/functions (latter to include heart rate [and variability], left ventricular stroke volume, cardiac output, ejection fraction, and ex vivo measures of aorta/mesenteric artery vasoconstrictor responses) at multiple timepoints over 1 yr thereafter. Exposures will use dust/DEP levels extrapolated from those experienced over 4-hr periods by `reference FR'. Three inter-related Specific Aims are proposed to: (1) determine for first time if changes in CV structure/function occur as a result of exposure to WTC dusts: (2) ascertain if CV changes will be greater after WTC dust + DEP co-exposures relative to that due to DEP alone; and, (3) demonstrate that increases in CV changes associated with dust + DEP co-exposures will be related, in part, to increased lung retention of DEP. These innovative studies in rats, using relevant WTC dusts, DEP, and exposure scenarios, will allow us to: clarify what role these co-pollutants may have had in changes seen in the CV health of FR exposed in that initial 72 hr; obtain important biochemical/molecular clues to etiologies for the increasing CV problems seen in these FR; analyze the impact from exposure to WTC dusts on DEP retention and subsequent toxicities from the latter as they pertain to altered CV structures/functions; and, as a supplemental goal, potentially identify novelsero-markers of exposure-induced CV changes that could ultimately be used to identify sooner a presence of CV defects in still-outwardly healthy exposed FR. The studies address goals of the NIOSH: Cardiovascular Disease Cross-Sector Program, Public Safety Program (Priority 1: Reduce chronic illnesses among firefighters); and, FFFFIPP (Strategic Goal 1: Reduce CV deaths among firefighters), and will be in keeping with a major Research to Practice (r2p) initiative, i.e., to help reduce illness among FR/firefighters via NIOSH-generated knowledge, interventions, technologies."

These crops form symbiotic associations with rhizobacteria that results in biological nitrogen fixation that contributes to productivity and profitability of cropping systems. Peas, lentils, and chickpeas are typically sown in the spring, and the development of autumn sown legumes may provide alternatives to winter wheat. Diseases cause considerable losses in these crops every year and are primarily managed by the use of resistant varieties. However, resistance is lacking to several important diseases, including root rots caused by Aphanomyces and Fusarium, Ascochyta blight, Pythium seed rot, and Sclerotinia white mold. Improved understanding of fungicide resistance and mechanisms of pathogenicity and virulence will accelerate the development of effective and efficient practices for managing diseases of these crops.

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A.

Agricultural production systems characterized by the rotation of edible grain legumes with cereal grains have been crucial sources of nutrition to human diet for several millennia. Primary edible grain legumes grown in U.S. production systems include dry bean, dry pea, lentils, and chickpeas, which are cultivated in rotation with cereal grains including wheat and barley. These crops have complementary nutritional qualities, with grain legumes having relatively high seed concentrations of lysine and low concentrations of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, while cereal grains tend to have low concentrations of lysine but high concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Crop rotations also contribute to more sustainable control of plant diseases and weeds. Legume roots are routinely colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria, which chemically convert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenous fertilizer. This association between legume and rhizobacteria especially contributes to sustainable crop production, as the fertilizer is used by the legume crop and also remains in the field as residual fertilizer for small grain production.   Several sources of variance including genetics (G), environment(E) and management practices (M) contribute to yield loss and the differences, or gaps, observed bewteen actual yield and yield potential. The ability to develop climate resilient cropping systems that consistently produce stable and high yields requires understanding how these sources of variance and their interaction effects impact crop yield.   Objective 1. Develop strategies to exploit interactions of GxExM for climate-resilient crop systems that reduce the gap between potential yield and farmer yield.  Sub-objective 1A. Determine yield response and identify yield limiting factors of grain legume germplasm when grown under drought stress and managed using different tillage systems.  Sub-objective 1B.

Despite much research, many determinants of host resistance and their roles in signaling remain unknown. Pseudomonas syringae, a plant pathogenic bacterium, causes disease in more than 150 plant species. ZAR1 is the R protein responsible for recognizing the acetyltransferase HopZ1a, a P. syringae type III secreted effector protein (T3SE). ZAR1 is found in many plant species, including the Solanaceae, castor bean, and rice. However ZAR1 defense signaling does not depend on any components previously implicated in plant resistance, including salicylic acid. Further investigation of ZAR1 signaling gives us a unique opportunity to identify novel genes involved in plant resistance and potential targets for improving plant immunity. This project plan will address three major questions:  1) What other genes are genetically implicated in resistance to HopZ1a? Preliminary data from a forward genetics screen has identified several mutants that lack HopZ1a-mediated defense responses (hopz-effector-triggered-immunity-deficient or zed). The proposed work will map these mutants and characterize their roles in resistance.   2) What is the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance? The proposed work will identify other proteins that contribute to ZAR1-mediated resistance.   3) Is ZAR1 resistance conserved in other plant species? The proposed work will examine ZAR1 resistance in wild and domesticated tomato. Using a multi-pronged approach, this work will identify and characterize new sources of resistance to protect plants from disease.  The specific objectives are: Objective 1:  Conduct genetic screens coupled with next-generation DNA sequencing to identify genes that contribute to pathogen resistance in plants.   Objective 2:  Characterize the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance using molecular, genetic, and proteomic approaches.   Objective 3:  Evaluate susceptibility and resistance of plant species to bacterial pathogens to determine the conservation of resistance."

Given favorable outcomes, breeders will benefit from germplasm releases, growers from increased yield potential and nitrogen fixation, consumers from healthy low cost food with improved quality, and the environment from reduced pesticide use.   Germplasm lines which incorporate novel traits from exotic sources into near-commercial seed market types will provide public and private breeders with useful traits for cultivar development. Moving traits from exotic sources into adapted commercial cultivars is an otherwise arduous task for most breeding programs. Thus, these germplasm releases will facilitate adoption of new traits by breeders and increase genetic diversity in their programs which is crucial for advancing yield potential and for sustainability in the long term. It is expected that some breeding lines with exceptional performance generated by this project will be released as cultivars.    Another long-term goal is to better understand the genetics underpinning complex traits and leverage this knowledge to improve breeding strategies. High-throughput next generation sequencing combined with optical mapping and updated reference genomes will significantly facilitate genetic studies geared toward advancing our breeding efforts. We will seek better markers for indirect selection of economically important traits in pea and common bean and examine new marker-assisted breeding strategies. Populations generated for genetic analyses will be used for breeding and vice versa. Such dual purpose populations facilitate simultaneous advancement toward our long-term goals (germplasm development and genetic knowledge from genomic analyses). For the next five years this project will focus on the following objectives.   Objective 1: Develop genomic analysis populations, and use them to improve genetic understanding of complex traits as well as to accelerate breeding for improved agronomic traits, including biological nitrogen fixation, drought tolerance, tolerance to low soil fertility, and resistance to problematic bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases.    Objective 2: Develop, evaluate, and release fresh green pea and dry bean (kidney, pinto, black) germplasm with improved agronomic performance combined with durable disease resistance."
