0,"The objective of this research project is to synthesize a series of new heterometallic oxidation catalysts with a range of steric and electronic properties as a &ldquo;toolbox&rdquo; of catalysts. Ideally, each of these would be effective for the oxidation of only one functional group in a particular substrate. Chiral catalysts would be used for asymmetric oxidations. Molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide will be the only stoichiometric oxidants used. An additional objective is to find methods for the chemical transformation of agricultural products, such as fatty acids from soy, to fine chemicals. We also intend to prepare water-soluble catalysts for the oxidation of carbohydrates. To reduce the quantity of volatile organic solvents used in oxidation reactions, we will test water-soluble complexes for catalytic activity in water. Some complexes will be tested in alternative solvents, such as supercritical CO2. Supported metal complexes will be tested as heterogeneous catalysts.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

They also are highly integrated into the biofuels and biorefinerynational research programs. Professor Wool&#8217;s research focuses on (1) determinationof the optimal fatty acid distribution (FAD) function of chemically functionalizedplant oils (e.g., soy, corn, linseed, olive, sunflower) using simulation, vectorpercolation theory, and experiments to minimize the properties of crosslinkedtriglyceride networks in the matrix; (2) development of a natural and glass fibersizing or coupling agent using difunctionalized high oleic genetically engineeredoils, applied in situ in the liquid molding manufacturing step (resin transfermolding and vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding [VARTM]) to tailor the fiber-matrixinterface strength; (3) development of a rubber toughening particle (low glasstransition temperature [Tg]) using the new water-based pressure sensitive adhesive(PSA) micro-latex particle technology, applied during liquid molding to enhanceimpact strength and promote self-healing of damage, using high energy ion-clustersurfaces developed for sheet molding compound; (4) development of interfacialand matrix toughening (high Tg) agent using chemically modified lignin; (5) developmentof a natural fiber preform binder using a highly branched structure of the PSAlatex particles (linear chains); and (6) VARTM manufacture of the first largestructures using natural fiber preforms and the optimized bio-based resins insupport of the shaped engineered wood substitute materials proposed for new housingconstruction and civil infrastructure.

2,"A nanoparticle, according to the National Nanotechnology Initiative, has at least one dimension smaller than 100 nm. The nanocomposites that we have made are referred to as particulate nanocomposites since they consist of a uniform dispersion of rigid nanoscale particles in a matrix of a softer plastic. We used sub-microscopic cellulose and chitin nanofibers and nanocrystals derived from them by acid hydrolysis as the nanoparticles. The cellulose particles, which have transverse dimensions on the order of 10 nm, are derived from wood cells, seed hairs, grasses, certain bacterial capsules, recycled paper and board, or even from municipal solid waste They are produced by a combination of acid hydrolysis, cell disruption, and dispersion methods. Microfibril surface chemistry can be modified, where appropriate, to enhance compatibility of particles with the plastic matrix. In the present work, biodegradable polycaprolactone, cellulose esters, soybean oil polyesters, and polymethylmethacrylate were used as the matrix component of the composite. Our primary objective was to make wholly biobased and biodegradable nanocomposites using nanoparticles of cellulose as the reinforcing particle. These will be compared in terms of thermal and mechanical properties to existing glass filled composites made from petrochemicals. Because the reinforcing particles are microfibrils of cellulose or crystals derived from such microfibrils with transverse dimensions on the order of 10 nm, it is appropriate to classify these materials as nanocomposites. Subsidiary objectives included refining the methods for making the nanoparticles and working towards scale up of the production to small pilot plant levels, measuring the mechanical properties of the resulting composites. Finally, a study of biodegradability in aerobic, compost conditions was made.Sources of Nanoparticles:During the course of this work, nanoparticles were made from bacterial cellulose donated by C.P. Kelco, San Diego, CA; a tunicate, Ciona intestinalis, purchased from Woods Hole Biological Laboratories; cotton fiber, obtained from Whatman #1 filter paper; sugar beet, apple pomace, and orange pulp agricultural residues; commercial softwood pulp provided by Weyerhaeuser LLC; and maple wood and its kraft pulp product produced in the SUNY-ESF Bioprocess and Paper Engineering Department. In addition, we also made nanofibers and nanocrystals of chitin, a closely related polymer with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine as the monomer and the same &beta; (1-4) linkage as found in cellulose and obtained from arthropod exoskeletons. In our work, we used shrimp as our chitin source. Our rationale for adding chitin was twofold. First, the particles themselves have different solubility characteristics than cellulose, a fact that might prove useful in making composites with cellulose plastics. Second, the presence of an amine group might provide an easy route to surface modification with proteins.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

4,"Objective(s): Biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel derived from vegetable oils, animal fats or used oils.  While it is competitive with (in some aspects even technically superior to) conventional, petroleum derived diesel fuel, its use is still affected by several technical issues that hinder more widespread commercialization.  Therefore, this project proposes to improve the combustion characteristics and fuel properties of vegetable oils (emphasizing soybean oil) and their derivatives as alternative diesel fuels, extenders, and additives in the operation of compression ignition (diesel) engines for on road and off road applications.  Fatty derivatives will be utilized for performance enhancement and exhaust emission reduction (e.g. nitrogen oxides).  Specific objectives for this project include: 1) Improved cold weather start up and operability performance. 2) Novel fuel formulations that reduce regulated exhaust emissions such as nitrogen oxides.  3) Improvement of fuel quality through enhanced oxidative stability and development of new, rapid analytical methods for assessing biodiesel fuel quality.  4) Development of specialty chemicals from biodiesel co-products.Approach:Improve the fuel properties and combustion characteristics of vegetable oils (emphasizing soybean oil) and their derivatives as alternative fuels, extenders, and additives in the operation of compression ignition (diesel) engines for on road and off road applications.  Address technical problems identified by stakeholders and customers.  Specific objectives for this project include: develop new alternative fuel formulations with improved cold weather start up and operability performance without compromising fuel quality as defined by appropriate standard fuel specifications; develop alternative fuel formulations with improved combustion performance that reduces harmful, regulated exhaust emissions such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and particulate matter; develop new biodiesel formulations with improved storage stability with respect to oxidative degradation; develop rapid instrumental methods for monitoring effects of degradation on biodiesel fuel quality during storage, as defined by appropriate standard fuel specifications; identify and develop novel specialty chemicals that may be prepared from glycerol, mono, and diacylglycerols as marketable co products of biodiesel production.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
5,"Objective(s): 1) Develop and evaluate autonomous wind-powered water pumping systems for irrigation, livestock, and farmstead water by developing farm size inverter and rectifier based controllers to increase the amount of useable energy available to the pump and by developing control strategies that prioritize and distribute electrical power to multiple loads (for example - pumps, water heaters, batteries, balancer loads).  2) Optimize the volume of water delivered for irrigation, livestock, and farmstead uses from various types of pumps using electricity produced from photovoltaic (PV) solar panels.  Complete pumping systems will be evaluated including pumps, motors, controllers and solar panels.  3) Measure engine performance and exhaust emissions of stationary engines used for electric power generation and irrigation pumping when fueled by biodiesel.Approach:The wind-powered water pumping activity will focus on controlling pumps and wind turbines with permanent magnet alternators during high wind speed (> 12 m/s) operation.  At wind speeds greater than 12 m/s, present controllers often allow the wind turbine to run offline, which results in excessive noise, no water pumped, and possible catastrophic failure of the wind turbine.  This effort is to design a controller that uses a different type of control logic that will allow the turbine to remain loaded at these higher wind speeds (higher voltages and frequencies), continue to pump water, and be cost effective.  Constant voltage, constant frequency utility AC power will be used to verify the basic controller functions.  Variable voltage, constant frequency AC utility power will be used to verify pump control operations.  Variable voltage, variable frequency AC power (from a wind turbine) will be used for the final bench test and the field testing of each controller.  Cost-benefit analyses will be conducted to compare the cost of wind pumping to electric utility, natural gas, diesel, or gasoline powered pumping.  Four different types of pumps will be tested to determine optimum pumping depths and flow rates when powered by solar photovoltaic panels.  Both AC and DC electric motors will be used to determine the best motor/controller combination for each type of pump.  A diaphragm, piston, and helical pump will be used for small flow rates (livestock and domestic use) and a centrifugal pump will be used for higher flows needed for irrigation.  An appropriate controller which is designed for water pumping, as opposed to battery charging, will be used with each system.  The research focus will be to develop guidelines for selecting the appropriate pumping system for each pumping condition encountered, whether it be for livestock, domestic use, or irrigation.The emissions from vehicle engines operating on biodiesel derived from soybeans is well documented; however, actual measurements of emissions from irrigation engines or engines producing electric power are not easily obtained.  These studies are planned to field measure the typical exhaust emissions from stationary and off-road engines using commercially available testing equipment.  The main parameters to be measured are total unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and ozone.  At the same time we will record various engine performance parameters such as but not limited to: fuel efficiency, power output, throttle response, performance degradation in response to constant and varying loads.  Evaluation of the effects of the biodiesel formulations on engine oil, coolant, and the fuel system will also be noted.  Biodiesel derived from soybeans, rapeseed, and used cooking oil or fats are planned to be included in these experiments.  Other fuels, derived from additional feedstocks, will be considered after initial testing with these commercially available fuels.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Complete studies in 80 overweight and obese people given controlled feeding studies in which calories were restricted by one third to determine whether fat restriction (15% versus 30%) or glycemic index (high versus low) of the carbohydrate had impact on weight loss, body composition, and heart disease risk factors (blood pressure, glucose, lipid levels, C reactive protein) other than through caloric restriction.

Human studies will likewise be carried out to assess the effect of foods derived from soybeans but varying in processing technique on measures of cardiovascular health in middle-aged and older hypercholesterolemic female and male subjects.

Using samples previously collected from the Framingham Offspring Study, the cardiovascular nutrition lab will quantify plasma concentrations of indicators of cholesterol homeostasis in study participants diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and/or >50% carotid stenosis and matched control subjects and integrate these data with the pertinent dietary, biochemical and genetic data available.  Subsequent work will characterize the balance of plasma samples to established normal ranges for the indicators of cholesterol homeostasis.

16,"Objective(s): Certain common dietary factors appear to be capable of: 1) affecting growth and development; 2) transiently and permanently altering metabolism; 3) influencing body composition; and 4) preventing some diseases.  For example, fruits, vegetables, grains and milk contain natural compounds (phytochemicals, peptides and proteins) that can alter development, physiology and metabolism, which can ultimately lead to disease prevention and phenotypic changes.  We will: 1) document which foods and dietary factors can alter body composition either in children or in offspring born to mothers who consume those foods; 2) determine how much of and in what context, these foods are needed to affect body composition; 3) study dietary factors in foods commonly consumed by children, such as fruits, rice, milk, and soy to determine how they may affect calorie balance and diseases associated with energy utilization (such obesity-associated insulin resistance), cardiovascular disease, and breast cancer; 4) identify the biologically active dietary factors and determine their bioavailability, the doses required for specific effects and their mechanisms of action; 5) determine the direct and indirect effects of dietary factors and the interactions of these factors with endogenous signals in human subjects and animal models throughout early life stages and phenotypes. For example, the isoflavones (also called  phytoestrogens ) are particularly concentrated in soybeans and can have many of the same actions as the major female hormones in women, the estrogens. Countries with regular consumption of large amounts of soy foods report lower incidence of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and obesity; and factors in soy (isoflavones and peptides) are postulated as being partially responsible. The soy connection to long-term health is important, because one million U.S. infants are fed infant formula containing soy protein each year and the phytoestrogen content in their blood is extremely high. Virtually nothing is known about the actions of these substances in children, nor on the long-term health consequences of this early exposure. Since this affects nearly 25% of America's youngest people, it is essential to ascertain the long-term health consequences, both positive and negative, of early consumption of these phytochemicals.  This is just one example of several foods containing different phytochemicals that have potential health effects during development.Approach:Studies will focus on the various dietary factors found in foods commonly comsumed by children, such as fruits, rice, milk, and soy to determine their long-term health effects in infants and children. Phytochemicals (such as the isoflavones), proteins and peptides will be studied to determine the possible effects on risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and other chronic diseases.  For example, evidence suggests that exposure to soy foods early in life will reduce the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease later in life. Similarly, we suspect that there may be some as yet unrecognized effects related to hormonally sensitive systems that regulate energy metabolism and fat disposition that affect development of obesity, drug efficacy, bone development, and insulin sensitivity. We will conduct laboratory, animal, and clinical studies to test these hypotheses, determine the positive and negative health consequences of maternal body composition and of various foods and dietary factors in maternal diet, infant formula, and childrenÆs foods, especially as it relates to safety and disease prevention; understand which phytochemicals have health consequences, how much and how often they should be consumed, and at what age they should be eaten; and, whether it is possible to reduce the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular diseases, and under what circumstances.

Characterized phytochemicals, such as the saponins from soy and glucosinolates from crucifers, will be used to develop new agricultural pest control products, chemical feed stocks for industrial processes, and designer functional foods for humans and animals.  The isolation and evaluation methods developed here will be used with minimal modification for the evaluation of other phytochemicals in biologically-active plant extracts.

Optimize a pilot-scale system for non-aqueous enzymatic transformation of soybean oil to high value products with novel functional groups and properties, such as feruloylated monoacyl- and diacylglycerides, for food and non-food applications.  Create a flexible, durable and environmentally benign platform technology for the bioelectrocatalytic transformation of plant triglycerides and phospholipids to higher-value products.Approach:Processes for producing modified plant lipids with novel and valuable functional properties are essential for developing new markets for commodity vegetable oils.  Furthermore, these processes and products should have minimal adverse impact on the environment and pose no threat to plant operators and the surrounding community.  It is the premise of this proposal that using isolated enzymes in selected nonaqueous media can meet these design goals.  Two distinctly different approaches are considered.  One approach, for enzymes not having complex cofactor requirements, employs soybean oil as a solvent as well as a reactant, while the other approach, for enzymes having more substantial structural and cofactor needs, places the enzyme in a highly structured environ and specifically tailored media.  In the first approach, synthesis of a patented product is examined to optimize reaction variables for pre-commercial production.  The second approach addresses several fundamental issues regarding ex vivo use of membrane-associated enzymes for the bioelectrocatalytic transformation of phospholipids and triglycerides.

As a means of unifying observations, whole life cycles of weeds will be the unit of study whenever possible.  Important microbial seed bank relationships will be identified along with the underlying mechanisms of interactions between microbes and weed seeds.  Factors that control these interactions and natural plant defenses will be examined.

43,"Objective(s): Objective 1:  Discover and characterize plant and pathogen genes important for resistance or pathogenicity at the molecular level with special emphasis on, but not limited to soybean interactions with soybean rust and soybean cyst nematode. Hypothesis:  There are detectable gene and protein differences between uninfected and pathogen-infected plants and between susceptible and resistant plants, and there are pathogen virulence factors critical to pathogen infection, development and survival. 	Objective 2:  Determine modes of action for plant disease resistance genes, pathogen virulence factors and molecular signals responsible for host-parasite interactions through analysis and characterization of genetic, molecular, protein and metabolite networks.  Hypothesis:  Examination of the many genes involved in plant-pathogen interactions will reveal critical molecular networks with specific modes of action that are essential to resistance in soybean and to virulence in soybean pathogens.  These networks may share commonalities to networks in other plants and pathogens. 	Objective 3:  Engineer and evaluate new methods for obtaining resistance, such as gene silencing, over-expression and protein antagonism, and chemical inhibition of host and pathogen processes, with special emphasis on soybean rust and the soybean cyst nematode.  Hypothesis: Expression of gene silencing constructs or of proteins inhibitory to important aspects of pathogen infection, development or maintenance can result in increased tolerance or resistance to a particular pest or pathogen.Approach:We have soybean genotypes resistant to one or more rust isolates, but susceptible to all others.  These soybean genotypes will be challenged with specific pathogen isolates to study the resistance and susceptible response.  Gene and protein expression in both plants and pathogens will be monitored using microarrays, membrane arrays, expressed sequence tag analysis, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR.  Proteins will be detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  Cell fractionation, laser capture microdissection, and subtractive hybridization will be used to isolate specific tissues, organelles, or materials involved in disease processes or responses.  Other methods such as antibody localization, gene silencing, plant hairy root transformation (for SCN studies) and mutant analysis will be used to determine the function of genes and proteins and to evaluate their importance in resistance and susceptibility.  The disease and pest resistance responses to infection in soybeans will be elucidated systematically using microarrays, proteomics and metabolomics to resolve the biological network evoked. A comparison of differential gene expression and protein accumulation in the resistant and susceptible response of soybean to pathogens will identify components of the network.  These networks will be built, examined, and perturbed to confirm function of components using an array of tools, including bioinformatics, yeast two-hybrid screens, mutation analysis, immuno-localization, immuno-precipitation, affinity purification, protein tagging, gene over-expression, phage library display, and other methods that will resolve protein-protein interactions and interactions among molecules.  Based on these data, we can identify candidate members of pathways and networks involved in signaling and evoking the resistance response.  Other plant systems, including common bean and Medicago truncatula, will be used as needed in parallel investigations studying host-pathogen responses and interactions to take advantage of the knowledge and specific traits of the resistance response in these systems.   Approaches for achieving pathogen control include engineering transgenic plant tissue and organs to express genes that boost the natural defense system of the plant or to provide the plant with a new trait that confers resistance by blocking pathogen attack or survival.  Genes shown to have important roles in plant defense may be over-expressed in transgenic plants.  Likewise genes that are critical to survival of the SCN in the host or that make the plant susceptible to SCN may be silenced in transgenic roots using hairy root transformation techniques.

45,"Energy, water, agriculture and sanitation, are considered the most essential and vulnerable necessities of healthy lives and prosperous sustainable growth for our nation and the world. Global warming, increased energy consumption, increasing agricultural demand, and new air and water pollution regulations that have been adopted in agriculture have prompted the need for diverse and integrated waste to energy solutions to meet the needs of farmers, the surrounding community, and the environment. The objective of this P3 project is to develop a biological wastewater treatment system that utilizes algal growth to simultaneously create renewable energy in the form of biodiesel and digester biogas, remove polluting nutrients, and abate green house gases. For Phase I of this research, bench-scale experiments were conducted using dairy wastewater from an on-campus dairy. A 50-gallon anaerobic digester was operated, and the effluent from this digester was treated in six experimental algae bioreactors operated under different conditions. These bench-scale bioreactor experiments were used to determine the oil productivity of algae grown on dairy wastewater while simultaneously determining the wastewater treatment capabilities of algal bioreactors. Lipid percentages were determined experimentally throughout the growth phase of two separate batch cultures at set time intervals. Water quality parameter such as nutrient concentrations (N and P) and biological oxygen demand were monitored to characterize the wastewater treatment efficiency. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that has the potential to improve people&rsquo;s lives through energy independence and reduced environmental impacts. Biodiesel burns 50% cleaner than conventional petroleum-derived diesel (Haas, 2001) and can be used in any diesel engine with little to no modification. However, biodiesel is currently produced mainly from soy bean oil which requires high energy inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides that are polluting to the environment (Landis, 2007). The rapid growth of the biodiesel industry is also quickly absorbing the soy bean oil that was sold for export, and the relatively low oil production yields can not support the total U.S. demand for petroleum fuel (Duffield, 2007). Figure 1: Scenedesmus from Bench-Scale Bioreactors Biodiesel production from algae is promising because algae has the potential to solve this feedstock problem since algae biomass productivity is far greater per acre than terrestrial plants and their oil content would significantly exceed the oil productivity of soybeans (NREL, 1996). Previous research by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) demonstrated biodiesel production from algae, but their final conclusion was that it was uneconomical (at the time) to use selective strains and controlled environments to produce biodiesel from algae. NREL suggested a more economical approach would be to combine efforts of algal production with wastewater treatment. This P3 research project was conducted to test the practicality of combined biodiesel production and wastewater treatment using dairy wastewater as a substrate. The ultimate vision for this research is to combine the biodiesel production from native species of micro-algae grown in agricultural wastewater while simultaneously removing polluting nutrients and sequestering carbon dioxide-rich flue gas from a generator running on biogas from an anaerobic digester.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

The project includes an investigation of the effects of management practices on soil biological, physical, and chemical properties; this information will be integrated with an assessment of one approach to restore eroded soil resources to indicate land management practices that may enhance long-term soil productivity, farm profitability, and environmental benefits in the northern Corn Belt.  Specific objectives are to (a) determine the impact of management strategies on nutrient, soil carbon, and organic matter dynamics; and (b) to evaluate the impact of landscape restoration (soil movement from areas of soil deposition to areas of topsoil depletion) on soil properties, soil productivity, and environmental quality in severely eroded undulating landscapes.Approach:Field experiments will be conducted in several sets of long-term research plots established by the North Central Soil Conservation Research Laboratory staff, including field plots implementing organic and conventional management practices that were established in 2002.

The research tests the feasibility of this concept and provides an initial demonstration of this practice to selected growers.  If successful the research would form the foundation for field-scale testing and the development of guidelines for producers. Cover crops have been previously shown to be effective in preventing erosion and nitrate leaching, thus they have the potential to mitigate the off-site effects of manure application.  Cover crops in the Midwest are established following soybean harvest in October or early November.  Swine manure is also applied at this time either as a surface application or by injection.  Manure application causes considerable disturbance, thus cover crop survival and function will be assessed.  Furthermore, the effects of conventional and low disturbance manure injection equipment will be compared with respect N and P retention and cover crop survival.

60,"Objective(s): The overall goal of this bridging project is to investigate the potential pollutants and agricultural management practices that affect air quality within the Chesapeake Bay region.  Agricultural activities in this region have traditionally been production of corn, soybeans, and specialty crops and some confined animal operations; however, production of bioenergy crops including corn, hulless barley, and switch grass are expected to increase as energy costs rise.  Urban encroachment has also become a major concern in this region resulting in increased NOx production which can lead to ozone formation in the presence of VOCs.  Objective 1:  Identify the major emission sources of agricultural pollutants, such as particulate, pesticide active and inert ingredients and other VOCs, and greenhouse gases within the Chesapeake Bay airshed.  Objective 2:  Determine the predominant fate processes and atmospheric components that influence the fate of agricultural air-borne pollutants.  Objective 3:  Estimate the spatial and temporal variability of emissions using a combination of field measurements, remotely-sensed, and land use data.  Objective 4: Develop a framework to predict the influence of land use changes and agricultural production practices on air quality for use by policy makers, regulators, and natural resource managers.Approach:Rapid detection technologies, such as nano and molecular imprinting technologies, will be developed for measuring agricultural pollutants in air.  Using newly-developed and traditional techniques, the emission of air-borne pollutants will be measured in selected subwatersheds.  Measurements will be taken over several growing seasons in different land use areas and compared to a previously-identified non-urban area where no agricultural activities have occurred for over thirty years.  The fate of identified air borne pollutants will be examined in newly-developed chemical fate models.  In areas where urban land use is adjacent to agricultural lands, available NOx and meteorological data will be utilized to predict the potential of agricultural pollutants to form ozone.  Predictions will be compared to available ozone concentrations.  Measured pollutant concentration data will be combined with land use, physical chemical constants, and meteorological data to produce an estimate of total emissions and potential ozone emission as a function of land use.

Identify, map, and clone virus-resistance genes.	ò  Sub-objective 1.C.	Determine the effect of combining quantitative virus resistance with insect resistance on virus disease severity.	ò  Sub-objective 1.D.	Characterize insect vector/virus relationships.Objective 2:  Identify and characterize emerging virus diseases in corn and soybeans.			Objective 3:  Develop virus-based gene vectors in corn.Soybeans and corn are the two highest value crops grown in the U.S.  Although research from this laboratory and others has led to significant improvements in their management, virus diseases continue to be annual threats.  Furthermore, history has shown that unanticipated, and often unknown, new virus disease problems can rapidly emerge at any time.  In soybeans, the threat of virus diseases has increased even more following the introduction of the soybean aphid into the U.S. in 1999.  This is the first soybean-colonizing aphid in the U.S., and the consequences for future virus disease problems in soybeans are unknown.  A long-term objective of this program is to reduce corn and soybean losses attributable to virus diseases.  Our strategy to do so is to identify corn and soybean viruses when they arise and to characterize their biology and epidemiology (Objective 2), and to then use this information develop practical, effective methods and strategies for minimizing crop losses (Objective 1).  Our final objective (Objective 3) is to use our knowledge and expertise in maize virology to develop new tools for forward and reverse genetic analysis of maize gene function.  We will develop gene silencing and expression vectors based on selected maize viruses, and use these vectors immediately to characterize the functions of candidate maize genes thought to be important for virus infection and/or resistance.  Because reliable vectors are lacking for monocotyledenous plants such as corn, vectors developed under this objective would be of benefit both to corn geneticists and to those seeking to use corn for the production of non-endogenous materials. Approach:Our overall approach is to: 1) identify existing and emerging viruses; 2) understand their biology; and 3) develop effective disease control strategies.  Known viruses will be identified using existing diagnostics.  For previously uncharacterized viruses, we will culture them in healthy plants using mechanical or arthropod transmission, determine their characteristics, and develop diagnostic assays.  This knowledge will be used to formulate disease control strategies, although, usually, the most effective and economic control strategy is to use virus-resistant crop varieties and cultivars.  Therefore, a primary focus of this project is to identify, characterize, and map virus resistance in maize and soybean germplasm.  To develop an understanding of how resistance genes work, they will be isolated and characterized, and their role in the molecular and biochemical changes associated with virus resistance will be examined.  Also, factors affecting virus transmission by arthropod vectors will be characterized so that alternative disease control methods can be developed.  Maize virus-based gene expression and silencing vectors will be developed to facilitate functional analysis of plant resistance genes using forward and reverse genetics.  Such vectors should have broad impact as few are available for cereals. The impact of this research will be to advance our knowledge of virus diseases of corn and soybeans and provide vital information for the development of control strategies to reduce disease losses.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Zhang, Univ. of Missouri, ColumbiaThe soybean crop is a major source of vegetable protein and edible oil.  A thorough understanding of soybean genetics is essential for the development of new soybean varieties that will meet the nutritional, environmental, and industrial requirements that soybean will fulfill over the next decades.  Soybean has many research tools available that facilitate its genetic study.  However, there has been one genetic tool notably absent for soybean, namely the availability of reverse genetic tools; that is, a way to identify and determine the function of soybean genes that hold academic, biological or agricultural importance.  Therefore, the long-term goal of this project is to develop and distribute the resources to needed to investigate the function of soybean genes, especially those involved in soybean quality and yield.  This goal will be accomplished by building and cataloging a collection of soybean deletion, insertional, and gene activation mutants derived by engineering soybeans with genes from rice, tobacco or maize that naturally move around the genome and insert themselves into other genes.  Such mutants alter the appearance of the plant, or can be detected in the laboratory.  Moreover, the team will investigate the use of fast neutrons to enhance their ability to find the desired mutations.

The main goal of this research is to identify both the genes and the genetic and biochemcial networks that underlie ecological differences between saline-adapted and non-adapted populations. By measuring the effects of these genes and networks under the natural conditions that plants experience, this research has the unique potential to bridge genetics, ecology, and evolution. Statement broader impacts Soil salinisation is a growing problem with the potential to impact up to one third of agricultural land world-wide. Thus, understanding how abiotic factors, including salinity, impact symbiotic efficiency represents an important challenge for agriculture both in the developed and developing world.  Since Medicago truncatula is a model species, the genes and pathways identified in this research will be directly applicable to breeding efforts to improve many agriculturally important legumes and more broadly to plant biology as a whole. The interdisciplinary and inter-continental nature of this project further provides an exceptional training opportunity. This project will integrate Tunisian and American teams-facilitated by generous matching funds from public (UC Davis) and private (USC) institutions-by cooperatively performing field experiments in Tunisia and through the exchange of personnel. Tunisian students and scholars will be hosted at the US institutions where they will engage in research, undertake individually-tailored coursework, and make contacts that will spur their professional growth. American undergraduate and graduate students will benefit via hands-on research experience, individual mentored projects, and the opportunity to participate in workshops and conferences in North Africa. All data generated by this research will be made publicly available at http://nlab.usc.edu. The project website will be publicly accessible with released data and project updates. The genotyping array, and the genotype and phenotype data collected will serve as a community resource enabling future work on Medicago. The results of this research will be published in peer-reviewed open-access journals, made accessible to the American and African media, and presented by junior members of the team at international meetings across the globe.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Mitchum (University of Missouri)Soybean is the second most economically important row crop species in the United States, but very little information is available on the specific genes that regulate soybean defenses. The soybean crop is perennially subjected to attack by a variety of pathogens. Studies involving model plants, such as Arabidopsis, have yielded much information on plant defense genes and have shown that there is general conservation of defense related pathways across species. Knowledge of defense-related genes in model plants combined with the extensive sequence information available to soybean provides the opportunity to transfer research from model systems to soybean. The overall goal of this project is to interrogate the functions of soybean genes in disease resistance pathways. This will be accomplished by incorporating information from soybean gene expression, resistance gene mapping studies, and soybean homologs of key genes that regulate defense responses in Arabidopsis. In each of the three specific objectives of this project, high throughput virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assays will be used to investigate the roles of the candidate genes in resistance to the important soybean pathogens Soybean mosaic virus (SMV), Asian soybean rust (ASR), and soybean cyst nematode (SCN). This research will provide key knowledge needed to unravel defense signaling networks of soybean, which is a requirement for modulating plant resistance in the future. In soybean, there is a critical need to develop methods for analyzing the functions of genes on a scale that allows researchers to exploit the available soybean sequence information and knowledge gained from model systems. The implementation of the VIGS assays will demonstrate proof of concept that high-throughput gene function studies are feasible in soybean and can be applied to other important traits. The broader impacts of this project address both scientific and societal needs. It is expected that this research will be exploited to improve soybean cultivars for disease resistance by accelerating breeding programs and by enabling the engineering of novel resistance traits. The investigators will make the vectors, VIGS constructs, and methods developed in this project available to the soybean research community. The soybean sequences inserted into the VIGS constructs will be made available through the Soybase database (http://soybase.agron.iastate.edu/). The participation of 7th-12th grade teachers and undergraduate students in this project is expected to further broaden the impact by encouraging young people with aptitude and interest to pursue careers in the biological sciences. The teachers will participate in the NSF Research Experience for Teachers program that is held each summer for seven weeks at Iowa State University. The teachers receive training in molecular biology techniques, curriculum development, and engage in independent research projects in the investigators? laboratories. The undergraduates will participate directly in the research project throughout the year under the mentorship of graduate students or postdoctoral scientists.

74,"PI: Sally Mackenzie (University of Nebraska) CoPIs:  Alan Christensen (University of Nebraska), Tom Elthon (University of Nebraska), Dong Wang (University of Nebraska) Collaborator: Andrew Benson (University of Nebraska)Plant mitochondrial genomes have undergone a number of changes in their structure and maintenance properties that distinguish them from their mammalian counterparts.  Most plant genomes characterized to date are a complex collection of linear and circular interconverting molecules that display evidence of recombination, foreign DNA integration and changes in relative copy number.  These genomic activities are controlled by nuclear genes that can be manipulated in their expression to cause mitochondrial genome instability.  Using this approach in tomato, tobacco, millet, sorghum, soybean and Arabidopsis allows for cross-species comparison of mitochondrial genome disruption.  This project exploits this system to identify cellular and developmental pathways that are directly influenced by mitochondrial genome status, conserved across plant species, and evidenced by changes in plant phenotypes.  The central hypothesis of the project states that mitochondrial status in plants is integrated into discrete pathways for plastid development, pollen development, cell cycle control and particular plant stress responses.  The project provides unique entry to these pathway integration points by combining Arabidopsis mutant analysis and cross-species comparisons with mitochondrial and gene expression analysis.  While it has long been known that plant mitochondria play distinct roles in metabolism, growth and development, direct mitochondrial manipulations prior to this study were largely restricted to inhibitor studies with limited opportunity for extrapolation to whole plant phenotype.  Broader impacts of the study.  Plant mitochondrial genome rearrangement can lead to altered plant phenotypes of agricultural importance.  For example, these studies have already produced evidence of cytoplasmic male sterility, a trait useful in hybrid seed production and transgene containment, and of enhanced crop thermotolerance.  Both valuable traits are difficult to attain using conventional crop breeding approaches. With regard to training opportunities, the Center for Plant Science Innovation (PSI) at University of Nebraska sponsors an undergraduate summer internship program that integrates to the proposed project; through this program, four minority students have already been recruited into graduate programs in the past two years.  The PSI also directs the Nebraska Molecular Plant Breeding Graduate Program; this project sponsors at least two plant breeding students on the proposed project.  Currently, the US faces a critical shortage of plant breeders with cross-cutting expertise in field management of transgenic crops, DNA marker-based selection, statistics, and comparative genomics.  This project provides fertile ground for such training, in cooperation with plant breeders on campus and in industry.Project data will be accessible via http://psiweb.unl.edu/mackenzie/ and gene expression data released to ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/ae/).",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

79,"For millennia, plant species containing chemicals that alter the vertebrate endocrine system have been consumed by humans for nutritional or medicinal purposes.  However, the importance of these plant chemicals, such as phytoestrogens, to human and non-human primate ecology and evolution remains unclear and largely unstudied.  Phytoestrogens, defined as naturally occurring plant compounds similar in function and/or structure to endogenous vertebrate estrogens, are present in the domesticated crop foods of many cultures and have been shown to impact both reproductive and stress physiology in captive rodents and primates.  Yet, little information exists on the prevalence of phytoestrogens in wild plant species and their potential impact on free-ranging, non-human primates.  Because more than 99% of human history has relied on a hunter-gatherer subsistence strategy mainly dependent on wild plant-based foods, investigating the prevalence of phytoestrogens in wild plants is necessary to improve our understanding of human origins.  Furthermore, the nutritional environment in which human ancestors evolved can be best reconstructed by studying living non-human primates in a natural setting, especially East African primates with a plant-based diet.  Since phytoestrogens likely had a significant influence on the evolution of both human and non-human primate physiology and behavior, this project will take a deeper look at the relationship between these plant compounds and the primates ingesting them by examining their role in the physiological ecology of the Uganda red colobus monkey (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles).  This will be accomplished by answering three main questions: 1) How prevalent are phytoestrogens in the tropical forest tree community?  2) Does the presence of phytoestrogens influence diet choice in red colobus monkeys?  3) Does the ingestion of phytoestrogens impact stress or sex steroid levels in red colobus individuals?  These questions will be addressed by collecting feeding behavior data and fecal samples from one group of red colobus during a 12-month study in Kibale National Park, Uganda.  Food and non-food plant species will be screened for estrogenic activity via bioassays and HPLC analysis, and steroid hormone content (estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol) of fecal samples from 28 individually known adults will be quantified via immunoassays.  Using this data, the relationship between phytoestrogen content of plant items, primate feeding behavior, and steroid hormone levels will be examined.  By combining methodology from the fields of primatology, ecology, endocrinology, and nutritional chemistry, this project will provide information that contributes to a deeper understanding of human and non-human primate biology.  Additional benefits for society include improved knowledge relevant to the public health issue of the effects of phytoestrogen consumption on human welfare.  Discussions of the costs and benefits of phytoestrogen consumption in human diet are currently very popular in the medical literature. Herbal treatments found in drugstores, along with soy and soy-based products, can contain high levels of these compounds.  An accurate understanding of the potential impacts of phytoestrogen consumption on public health will be greatly aided by a Darwinian medical approach.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
80,"This project encompasses the determination of the three-dimensional molecular structures of a number of flexible filamentous plant viruses. It is part of a comprehensive, integrated structural analysis of the filamentous plant viruses, aimed at explaining the processes of viral infection, dissemination, and host interactions, and understanding the relationships among these important viruses. The viruses to be studied include members of the potexvirus, potyvirus, and closterovirus groups. The potexviruses are of great significance as models for fundamental virology and cell biology; they have enormous potential in biotechnology, and they are of considerable importance for the damage they cause in agriculture. The potyviruses are responsible for half the viral crop damage in the world, and are of interest because of their close relationship to the animal rhinoviruses (responsible for such diverse conditions as the common cold, polio, and foot-and-mouth disease). The closteroviruses are also of major agricultural significance. To utilize the full potential of the flexible filamentous viruses as models and in biotechnology, and to combat their effects in agriculture, knowledge of three-dimensional structures in atomic detail is required. Apart from this group's preliminary results, there are no three-dimensional structures known for any flexible filamentous virus. Virus structures to be determined will include the most important of the potexviruses, potato virus X, as well as the potyviruses soybean mosaic virus and wheat streak mosaic virus and the closterovirus beet yellows virus. Structures will be determined by cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray fiber diffraction; models derived from cryo-electron microscopy will be used as starting points for more detailed analysis using fiber diffraction data. Fiber diffraction specimen preparation methods developed in this laboratory have greatly improved the quality of data from potexviruses and potyviruses; before this project began, no useful diffraction data had been obtained from potyviruses. Broader impacts will be through the integration of research and education, and through the application of this research to new developments in crop protection and plant biotechnology, particularly in the production of pharmacologically useful products.

82,"High-throughput sequencing technology will be used to identify mutations that influence the fitness of rhizobia that are symbiotic partners of legumes, providing a window into the ways that rhizobia adapt to the symbiotic lifestyle. Use of experimentally evolved populations of rhizobia derived from the model rhizobium 'Sinorhizobium meliloti' will enable direct measurement of the extent of host-symbiont conflict by asking whether mutations that confer higher rhizobia fitness have positive or negative effects on host performance. Identification of mutants will lead to development of testable mechanistic hypotheses and macro-evolutionary predictions, connecting laboratory results to natural populations.The symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia, bacteria that form root nodules and fix atmospheric nitrogen, is among the best model systems for understanding coevolution. While the interaction is widely assumed to be mutually beneficial, there is ongoing debate over the extent to which rhizobia can cheat their host plants by receiving plant resources without providing fixed nitrogen in return. The rhizobia-legume symbiosis is a key component of sustainable agriculture, as legumes can grow without oil-derived fertilizers and enrich soil fertility over the long-term when used in crop rotations. Legumes include the economically important crop species soy, alfalfa, pea, bean, chickpea, and peanut that provide plant-based protein for human and animal nutrition.

84,"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop natural fiber-reinforced bio-based resin composites that are appropriate for use in exterior applications on vehicles (automobiles, over-the-road trucks, and recreational vehicles). These bio-based engineering materials are interesting to automotive and truck manufactures because of their light weight, potential low cost, and low environmental impact. However, these composites tend to be highly sensitive to moisture. That sensitivity is one of the main barriers to commercialization for bio-based composites. Currently, no natural fiber-reinforced composites are used as structural components in transportation applications because of the moisture sensitivity issue. The approach is to investigate combinations of fiber type, fiber processing, and resin chemistry to produce composites with strong interfacial bonding and properties that are the least sensitive to moisture. It will be determined how the type of fiber (kenaf vs. flax), the processing of the fiber (degree of fibrillation, and surface modification), and the type of resin (soybean oil-derived resins vs. modified phenolics) affect the mechanical properties of the composites and their moisture sensitivity. It is anticipated that within this experimental space will be combinations that produce good interfacial bonding between resin and fiber which will lead to reduced moisture sensitivity.Natural fibers and bio-based resins have the potential to replace fiberglass and synthetic resins derived from petroleum in a variety of composite applications. The most likely opportunities will be in the transportation sector (automotive, truck, RV); additional opportunities may develop in building materials (subfloor, roof, decking, posts and beams). Replacing fiberglass-reinforced synthetic resin composites with natural fiber-reinforced biobased thermoset resin composites will have the many advantages over traditional composites. The bio-based composites will have lower density, acceptable specific strength, equal or higher specific modulus, and fibers that are non-abrasive and have low wear rates for tooling. Their environmental impact will be less as the are renewable resources and use less non-renewable energy in making the fibers. There will be a weight reduction which can increase fuel economy and reduce emissions as well as reduce the life-cycle environmental impact by sequestering carbon during the growth of the plant material. This product will have a lower cost due to the fact that these are renewable resources and have a lower cost of raw materials at industrial production levels. Natural fibers and bio-based resins can be combined with synthetic fibers and resins to provide design flexibility, e.g., if the stiffness of a natural fiber-reinforced composite is insufficient for an application, fiberglass (10-30 wt%) can be added to raise the modulus to an acceptable level. One still realizes much of the value of the natural reinforcement.

85,"Oomycete plant pathogens cause extremely destructive diseases on crops and in natural ecosystems.  Little is known about the molecular weapons that enable oomycetes to be such successful pathogens.  Analyses of four recently completed oomycete genomes suggest that oomycetes export dozens or hundreds of their own 'effector' proteins to the interior of plant cells.  These pathogen effectors are expected to sabotage plant immune responses and trigger other effects that benefit the pathogen.  However, almost nothing is known about the molecular functions of oomycete effectors.  This project will investigate the functions of six pairs of effectors that are conserved between two distantly related oomycetes: the Arabidopsis downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica and the soybean root rot pathogen Phytophthora sojae.  It is expected that a focus on conserved effectors will reveal insights that are applicable to the majority of oomycete pathogens.  The investigators will perform a series of molecular genetic experiments to determine whether these effectors are capable of suppressing plant immunity or altering plant cell structure or physiology, and whether the pathogen's ability to cause disease is affected when these genes are silenced or overexpressed.  Finally, one pair of conserved proteins will be selected for experiments to identify their exact targets inside plant cells.  These experiments are expected to reveal important, broadly conserved molecular strategies that underpin oomycetes' ability to cause disease, which will in turn open new avenues toward more sophisticated disease control strategies.

The active forcing mechanism is scaleable and adaptable to any multiphase reacting system. They will explore underlying mass transfer/fluid flow/ kinetics behavior of the reactors through studies of model gas/liquid reactions, with flow visualization and CFD modeling of the microchannels. The industrial partner, Mezzo Technologies, will provide the micro-heat exchangers and assist in system evolutionary design and fabrication.Intellectual Merit:The PIs plan to study the effects of active forcing via pulsed flow, varying both amplitude and frequency independently in a catalyst monolith reaction system. Based on preliminary work on the systems airwater (mass transfer, flow visualization) and á-methylstyrene hydrogenation (reactor studies), they expect enhanced gas-liquid mass transfer, more precise temperature control (due to the micro-heat exchangers), more uniform flow distribution of both gas and liquid, and faster liquid surface renewal than existing heterogeneous catalytic gas/liquid reactor systems, whether based on structured catalyst packing or not. These fundamental issues will be addressed for both a complex hydrogenation (soybean oil) with multiple reaction paths and one of high molecular weight and viscosity (polystyrene hydrogenation). In both cases, gas-liquid distribution and surface wetting strongly affect observed reaction rates. The combination of improvements made possible by active forcing and better distributor design can result in higher observed rates, less catalyst deactivation, and improved selectivities in these serial reactions, where intermediate products are desired. Possible outcomes will be examined through a combination of kinetics, mass transfer, flow visualization, and catalyst characterization experiments. Moreover, the simplified geometry (relative to chaotic systems such as packed beds or bubble columns) allows a more straightforward modeling for the smooth channels.Broader Merit:C&E News recently reported that the microreactor market is growing to $100 MM. Monolith microreactors are easily scaleable from gram to tonnage production. Ongoing efforts to use microchannel reactors for both rapid catalyst screening and chemicals production have largely ignored catalyzed gas/liquid reactions. This project contributes to microreactor infrastructure by exploring how structured microchannel reactors can best be applied to such processes. Catalyzed gas/liquid (and sometimes solid) reactions of edible oils and macromolecules figure prominently in future biofuels and biorefining processes, and this project addresses such reacting systems in structured microreactors.The project will educate graduate and undergraduate students in microreactor and micro heat exchanger design, and heterogeneous catalysis. Students will work several weeks each year at Mezzo Technologies gaining first-hand experience in microfabrication.

88,"Proposal: 0722780PI:  Anthony MarcheseInstitution: Rowan UniversityTitle: MRI: Acquisition of a Rapid Compression Machine for Chemical Kinetic Studies on BiofuelsBiodiesel has been shown to be highly effective in reducing CO, HC, PM and greenhouse gas emissions from diesel engines, decreasing dependence on petroleum imports and developing new markets for domestic agricultural products such as soybeans. Unfortunately, many research studies have also shown that biodiesel results in an increase in NOx emissions. The perceived NOx penalty associated with biodiesel threatens to limit its widespread acceptance since engine manufacturers and regulatory agencies continue to struggle with NOx emissions from mobile diesel sources. The vast majority of the literature has focused on differences in physical properties (bulk modulus, boiling point, viscosity, etc.) between biodiesel and petroleum diesel as the mechanism for increased biodiesel NOx. However, there is increasing evidence that biodiesel NOx increases are related to fundamentaldifferences in the chemical oxidation mechanism of biodiesel (i.e. methyl esters) in comparison to petroleum diesel. Unfortunately, very little work has been done to develop detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms for long chain methyl esters and to evaluate why these molecules result in increased NOxand decreased PM. A better understanding of biodiesel NOx and soot processes, will lead to the development of even cleaner burning renewable fuels.Intellectual MeritThis Major Research Instrumentation Grant is for the purchase of a rapid compression machine (RCM) that will be used for fundamental chemical kinetic studies on biofuels. An RCM is an instrument designed to simulate the compression stroke of a single engine cycle allowing auto-ignition phenomena to be studied in a much more controllable environment than that which is possible in an actual engine. The RCM will be integrated with a novel fast response NO/NO2 analyzer that will allow time-resolved NOx measurements and a rapid quenching system that will enable sophisticated gas analysis of combustion products and intermediates. By performingexperiments on biofuels (and surrogate fuels) in an RCM it will be possible to isolate the chemical kinetic effects on NOx and soot production from the variety of other processes that are present in an actual diesel engine. Moreover, data acquired using this system will be integral to developing a data base necessary for adopting a universally accepted reference fuel for biodiesel, such as methyl oleate. Development of an RCM capability dedicated to alternative fuels research will effectively bridge the gap between the handful of fundamental combustion studies on smaller biodiesel surrogates and the multitude of engine studies in which the underlying mechanisms responsible for pollutant emissions are difficult to isolate.Broader ImpactsEnvironmental essayist Bill McKibben rightfully suggests that global warming is the first civilization-scale challenge ever faced by the human race. While there is no single technological panacea for this omnipresent challenge, renewable fuels such as biodiesel have the potential to play a significant role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions since they are nearly CO2 neutral. A solution to the perceived biodiesel NOx problem will result in further widespread acceptance of biodiesel by engine manufacturers and government agencies, thereby resulting in decreased greenhouse gas emissions. Decreasing PM emissions from diesel engines is an equally important issue that can be addressed through the use of biodiesel. Diesel PM has been classified as a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization and the USEPA, and recent studies have linked diesel PM to heart disease.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
89,"The plant mitochondrial genome has acquired, during its evolution, several distinguishing features that are not well understood mechanistically or in evolutionary context.  One of these is a process of asymmetric (non-reciprocal) recombination that appears to directly influence plant reproduction.  Until now, our understanding of these processes has been hindered, in part, by the unavailability of effective model systems for investigating nuclear gene influence on the process.  The effects of three nuclear genes, MSH1, OSB1 and RECA3, have recently been analyzed on mitochondrial genome stability. RECA3 and MSH1 function in distinct but overlapping pathways, while OSB1 cooperates with MSH1, to regulate the appearance of specific recombination products in Arabidopsis mitochondria.  The principal investigators have recently shown that MSH1 functions similarly in tobacco, tomato, soybean and millet, but MSH1 RNAi knockdowns in these species also condition cytoplasmic male sterility. The principal investigators are now in a position to analyze the mitochondrial genome changes that occur when mutations in these nuclear genes permit normally rare recombination activity to occur at high frequency, and to compare the consequences of this recombination in multiple plant species. The central hypothesis is that MSH1, OSB1, and RECA3, together with specific breakage sites in the genome, represent components of an interacting network that operates in plant mitochondrial recombination-dependent replication initiation. The principal investigators propose that double-strand DNA breaks occur at specific locations within the mitochondrial genome to initiate recombination and replication, and that MSH1, OSB1 and RECA3 are involved in preventing recombination between repeats that are shorter than a few hundred bases. The principal investigators test these hypotheses by identifying double-strand breaks in repeated sequences, and in the Atp9, Atp6, CoxII and Rpl16 genes, in which there is evidence of recombination activity. This analysis is complemented by studies of inducible changes in tobacco, tomato, soybean and millet mitochondrial genomes that occur with MSH1 suppression and male sterility induction. This project will develop a unifying model for recombination-dependent replication of plant mitochondrial genomes, and provide insights into the mechanisms for the induction and suppression of cytoplasmic male sterility, a phenomenon of agricultural importance that leads, in nature, to the gynodioecious reproductive strategies of approximately 5% of world plant species. The minority student training opportunities associated with this proposal will involve alignment with the Young Nebraska Scientist (YNS) Program, in which an undergraduate YNS student will participate in this research each summer.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
90,"The Carnegie Institute of Washington is awarded a grant to create a network of plant metabolism databases. At the center of the network will be PlantCyc containing pathways from many plants, supported by experimental evidence for pathways, reactions or enzymes. PlantCyc will be initialized from currently available plant metabolism databases such as AraCyc, TomatoCyc, RiceCyc, MedicagoCyc and Soybase. It will be used as a reference database (in conjunction with MetaCyc) to create multiple plant pathway genome databases (PGDBs) with substantial sequence data. To build a PGDB, putative enzyme sequences will be identified for each organism using several sequence analysis methods and Pathway Tools software will be used to generate the initial PGDBs from the annotated sequences. As each PGDB is built, all of the pathways and enzymes in the new PGDB will be validated and added to PlantCyc, and subsequently curated. Therefore, with each round of PGDB prediction, the quantity and quality of PlantCyc will be increased. The project will leverage the curation teams at other databases interested in different species as well as biochemistry experts who are interested in specific domains of metabolism in improving the content of PlantCyc and the PGDBs. All of the data will be made freely available and updates will be released on a regular basis. As the worldwide demand for production of biofuels, food, animal feed and new medicines continues to grow, there is an increasingly urgent need to develop new technologies using plants. The long-term goal of developing these technologies has prompted the sequencing of plant genomes and gene complements. There is a growing need to place the sequenced and annotated genomes in a biochemical context in order to facilitate discovery of enzymes and engineering of metabolism. This proposal will generate an infrastructure for comprehensive plant metabolism information that addresses the need to store, analyze and display the growing body of data that is emerging from both conventional biochemistry and high-throughput/large-scale data experiments.

91,"Polyploidy is the multiplication of the entire genome beyond the diploid level. It is a particularly important genetic process in flowering plants, and many cultivated plants (e.g., wheat, maize, cotton, soybean) are polyploid. Polyploidy can lead to profound genomic changes, even beyond duplicating all of the genes in the genome. Polyploidy has long been known to affect physiology, anatomy, and biochemistry, but few studies have sought to connect phenotype with changes at the molecular level to understand how plants achieve an integrated response to polyploidy in natural populations. Such investigations hold the key to understanding why polyploids are so prevalent among plants, and why polyploids often have been considered more adaptable or more successful than their diploid progenitors.This project will study photoprotection - an important physiological process by which plants avoid damage from excess light energy - in several recently formed polyploid species of Glycine, the genus that includes the cultivated soybean. These species formed by hybridization and genome doubling (allopolyploidy) within the last 50,000 years. The diploid species that gave rise to them have been identified. Chlorophyll fluorescence assays will be used to compare photoprotection in the polyploid species with their diploid progenitors. At the molecular level, it will be determined how the gene copies contributed by the two diploid progenitors have changed in sequence and expression in the polyploidy species since their formation, and whether changes in DNA sequence, dosage, and/or expression patterns correlate with photoprotection phenotype.Broader Impacts. This project is of broad significance and impact because it will elucidate the effects of a ubiquitous genetic phenomenon, polyploidy, on a physiological process essential to plant fitness, and will connect this to changes in the genes underlying photoprotection.

This project will demonstrate the feasibility of using the soybean indirect defense strategy to produce the plant defensive compound (methyl salicylate) via the timely-expressed methyltransferase system that not only attracts aphid natural enemies, but also acts as an aphid repellent to reduce their colonization. The Broader Impacts of the proposed activity are to provide novel plant defense strategies for repelling aphids and recruiting the aphids' natural enemies to suppress aphid population under the economical threshold; to improve crop quality and to increase yields at a minimal cost for aphid management, and thus will increase growers competitiveness in the world market; and to provide vital information for both fundamental and applied research at the molecular levels to address the problem of managing the aphid pests on the nation's food crops.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
93,"Unstable oil prices , depleting reserves (Koppelaar, 2005), and the threat of global warming (Solomon et al., 2007) have made the development of renewable domestic transportation fuels a high priority in the U.S . However, the conventional biofuel crops used in the U.S. such as soybeans and corn are limited by their yielding potential. Even if the U.S. switched to growing canola oil seed for biodiesel (the highest oil yielding crop producible in the U.S.) some estimate it would require 122% of the current U.S. crop area to meet 50% of the total U.S. fuel consumption needs (Chisti, 2007, p. 296).Microalgae is a next generation feedstock that has the potential to significantly offset fossil fuel usage. Studies show that microalgae strains can range between 1-40% triglyceride content by dry weight, and can more than double its biomass each day (Sheehan, Dunahay, Benemann, &amp; Roessler, 1998). The oil can be extracted and chemically converted into biodiesel, which can be used in diesel vehicles with few modifications. Projections show that an area equivalent to 1-3% of the total U.S. cropping area would be sufficient to supply all the U.S transportation fuel needs (Chisti, 2007, p. 296).In order to achieve the significant algae production rates required, large sources of concentrated carbon dioxide must be supplied to the algae . Almost all algae-to-biofuels propose utilizing the fossil fuel emissions from central power stations and industrial plants for C02. However, upon combustion of the algae-based biodiesel, the carbon dioxide is released, ultimately resulting in a net gain of C02 in the atmosphere. This design does not close the carbon loop and the health and environmental impacts of fossil fuel mining and extraction persist.The algal culture system proposed in this P3 project utilizes sustainable sources of C02 from the abundant and untapped resource of biowaste. Through the anaerobic digestion of community food waste, agricultural waste, animal waste, and municipal solid waste, biogas may be produced, which can be combusted for energy production, and the emissions can then be utilized for algae production. This results in net zero gain of C02 in the atmosphere.This model more completely closes the carbon loop for transportation fuels, and at the same time makes possible a highly distributed fuel production model that empowers local communities and their economies. This model also presents the concept that a community&rsquo;s organic waste may be able to sustain its transportation needs, and algae can be grown at any organic waste source (farms, livestock operations, landfills, hotels, schools). According to a study funded by the ASP, the amount of available C02 from anaerobic digestion of biomass waste (type of biomass was not specified) in the U.S. was 230 X 106 kg/year in the year in which the study was conducted (Sheehan et al., 1998). This quantity was comparable to the total C02 resource from fossil steam plants, a promising indication that anaerobic digestion of biomass is itself an abundant source of C02 for microalgae culturing.The purpose of Phase I of this project is to design, build, and implement a scalable model of an algal culture system that utilizes sustainable C02 sources, rather than C02 emissions from fossil fuels, which is the more widely proposed model. The system was designed to provide real data for insight into the true feasibility of this closed loop concept. In addition, by building a small research system in Phase I, a more effective design may be implemented in Phase II.The research focus of Phase I was three-fold: (1) explore anaerobic digestion of bio-waste as a renewable C02 source for algae growth, (2) collect",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
94,"The Environmental Protection Agency and the American Chemical Society share a common vision of promoting and implementing chemical and engineering practices that are safe for the environment. The concept of green chemistry began in the early 1990s with the passing of the Pollution Prevention Act as an attempt to reduce hazardous chemical processes. The green chemistry movement was made famous in 1998 when Paul Anastas and John Warner published Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice outlining 12 principles every chemist, engineer, and company should consider whether at the lab bench or on the industry floor. The general them of these principles, though detailed and unique, is that prevention is better than treatment. Specifically relevant to our P3 project is the fifth principle which encourages the use chemical catalysts that minimize waste by their use in small amounts and their ability to carry out a single reaction many times2.Concurrent with the green chemistry movement is the growing concern for America&rsquo;s ability to meet its energy needs. This has prompted scientists to research and develop alternative fuels, and biodiesel, a non-toxic and carbon neutral fuel, represents one of these alternative fuels. Biodiesel is produced by transesterification, a reaction in which triglycerides (animal fat or vegetable oil) are combined with alcohols in the presence of a catalyst. Commonly, biodiesel is made from new vegetable oil typically from soybean or rapeseed sources, but the use of virgin quality oils presents a challenge to sustainability as we divert these food resources for energy use. This ethical dilemma can be avoided by the more efficient use of waste oil as a feedstock and can provide one component in the varied alternative fuel portfolio needed to address our future energy needs.One hurdle of using waste oil for biodiesel production is the high free fatty acid (FFA) content often found in waste oil. This can lead to the formation of soap during the typical base-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, FFA&rsquo;s must be removed from waste oil before processing, leading to a number of additional processing step to efficiently use this waste material. The most commonly used removal method utilizes sulfuric acid as a catalyst to remove these acids by esterification, but this corrosive homogeneous (non-solid) catalyst must then be removed by neutralization generating a number of processing steps and waste streams. A better method would be to develop a heterogeneous, or solid, catalyst for biodiesel production that could be removed from the reaction mixture and re-used.The importance of the development of new heterogeneous catalysts was emphasized in a recent workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation3. Experts in the field of catalysis were brought together to discuss the state of catalysis technology related to bio-renewable use. To meet the desired goal of using bio-based feedstock as raw materials for chemical production, one clear challenge is the need for an increased research effort in the area of solid catalyst development. For biodiesel, the development of heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production was specifically singled out to ensure the economic viability for production of this fuel.As outlined in the P3 Phase I proposal, our objective was to develop a solid acid catalyst to improve the utilization of waste oil as a feedstock for biodiesel production through the removal of free fatty acids by esterification. While several commercially produced solid acid catalysts are readily available for use in esterification reactions (i.e. Amberlyst and Nafion), they are very expensive synthetic petroleum based products. Our catalyst is developed from a renewable sugar source, is inexpensive, simple to produce, and is expected to find u",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
95,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although essential, the use of parenteral nutrition (PN) in pediatric populations with surgical gastrointestinal diseases, especially premature infants, is frequently associated with hepatic dysfunction that may ultimately result in transplantation and/or death. Studies suggest that soybean oil containing intravenous fat emulsions (IFE) may be a major contributing factor.  Pilot data suggests that discontinuing soy based IFE and switching to a product comprised of omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) derived from fish oils may be effective in reversing preexisting PN associated liver disease through a combination of factors, including improved triglyceride clearance coupled with anti-inflammatory properties.  The applicant believes that fish oil based emulsions, besides treating this fatal condition, could prevent it.  This project plans to randomize in a double blind study 30 infants (< 3 months) with gastrointestinal disease at the start of their PN course to receive PN with a fish oil based emulsion (15 patients) or a the standard of care soybean based emulsion (15 patients).  Patients expected to be on PN at least 3 months will be enrolled over three years.  To evaluate effectiveness of this alternative IFE, conventional biochemical tests of hepatic function will be assessed and compared between the two study populations.  The primary outcome will be the proportion of children developing cholestasis over a three month period.  In addition to preventing the development of liver disease, it is hoped that the children will continue to grow at the same rate or better than if they were receiving the standard fat emulsion.  Other long term outcomes that will be evaluated include the frequency of inflammatory diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) that often occur in these critically ill infants.  The ultimate goal of this project is to demonstrate that fish oil based emulsions can be approved by the FDA for use in children dependent on PN to while recovering from surgical gastrointestinal diseases.

However, the use of PN in pediatric populations, especially premature infants, is frequently associated with liver injury that may ultimately result in liver failure that can lead to transplantation and/or death.  Studies suggest that soybean oil containing intravenous fat emulsions (IFE) may be a major contributing factor.  Recent experience suggests that discontinuing soybean based IFE and switching to a product comprised of omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oils (Omegaven) may be effective in reversing preexisting PN associated liver disease through a combination of factors, including improved triglyceride clearance coupled with anti-inflammatory properties.  In 2002, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) stated that 20,000 individuals in the US were supported by PN for intestinal failure and of these, approximately 30-60% of children develop hepatic dysfunction after receiving prolonged courses of PN.  This project plans to study 30 such pediatric patients over a 3 year period with preexisting liver disease due to PN use.  The primary aim is to assess the efficacy of the fish oil fat emulsion in reversing cholestasis due to PN use.  Using an open label study design, patients with PN cholestasis will have the conventional soybean oil lipid emulsion stopped and be treated with the fish oil based IFE.  Time to reversal of cholestasis of subjects treated with the fish oil will be compared to 60 similar subjects (contemporary historical controls) who continued to receive soybean based IFE after developing cholestasis.  Other hepatic, growth, and safety outcomes will be also assessed.  Based on preliminary results, it would be difficult to perform a prospective randomized trial with these patients.

97,"Western corn rootworms (WCR) are devastating insect pests of U.S. maize. WCR were once managed with just an annual maize-soybean crop rotation. Unfortunately, near-universal adoption of rotation selected for variant (`v') WCR with behavioral resistance. Unlike rotation-susceptible (`wt') WCR, v-WCR leave cornfields to also feed and lay eggs in soybean fields. The following year, feeding by v-WCR larvae seriously injures rotated maize in those fields. v-WCR continue to spread from Illinois into nearby states and Canada. Identifying genetic differences between WCR populations and elucidating mechanisms that allow some v-WCR adults to survive on an unsuitable host are priorities for understanding and managing rotation resistance. Soybean defenses against herbivory include protease inhibitors (PIs), which inhibit the activity of coleopteran digestive proteases, decreasing amino acid assimilation and insect survival. We observed that v-WCR gut protease activity was less inhibited by soybean PIs than that in wt-WCR. Loss of inhibition may facilitate soybean herbivory and rotation resistance expression. Insect gut protease activity may also arise exogenously; midgut microbial symbionts can contribute enhanced digestive capacities. Preliminary data suggest the midgut bacterial communities of wt-WCR and v-WCR adults differ. Evidence of protease involvement in WCR adaptation explored using new genomic approaches holds promise for revealing a novel and exploitable mechanism for rotation resistance. The appearance of rotation-resistant rootworms in Illinois corn presents a tremendous challenge to producers in that few alternative effective pest-management strategies exist. Past efforts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying rotation resistance have been largely unsuccessful and it is of utmost urgency to understand those mechanisms in order to reduce the risk of losing crop rotation as a cost-efficient management strategy within the state. Revealing evidence of potential protease- or microbially-mediated rotation resistance via investigation of protease gene expression and midgut microbiota in WCR populations is our goal.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

99,"While soybean ranked 2nd among U.S. crops in farm value in 2005 with over 67 million acres planted in 2007, U.S. dominance of global soybean markets has eroded, in part because of increased production in Brazil. Farmers in Brazil protect soybean using a variety of low cost pest control strategies, which include the baculovirus AgMNPV. AgMNPV as a biological control agent is inexpensive to produce, effective in limiting foliar damage to soybean by the velvetbean caterpillar (Anticarsia gemmatalis) and is safe to other organisms. Indeed, reduced pest management costs provide Brazilian soybean a competitive advantage on the world soybean market, which depreciated the value of this commodity. While the reduced value of soybean prompted U.S. farmers to limit soybean plantings, use of genetically modified (GM) soybean threatens to reduce demand further. In the U.S., 90% of soybean is GM, and the European Union (EU) is the world's largest soybean importer. However, the EU legislates restrictions on GM organisms and with increased consumer awareness of food production practices, this trend may spread to the U.S. Recently, German universities halted field trials of GM crops because of public hostility toward genetic engineering, demonstrating that acceptance of GM foods is deteriorating. Increased consumer demand for USDA certified organic foods, restrictions on GM crops and consumer willingness to pay a premium for perceived food safety are compelling reasons to promote organic cropping practices. Because natural baculoviruses are available to organic farmers in the U.S. for controlling crop pests, they constitute an underutilized strategy for reducing economic damage to soybean by lepidopteran larvae. Additionally, increased diversification of biological control strategies will help preserve the efficacy of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin for intensive organic agriculture. Reduced dependence on GM soybean by U.S farmers will increase the appeal of this commodity to EU consumers and buffer the industry to further market restrictions in the U.S. and abroad. AgMNPV and AcMNPV are the most widely used baculoviruses, but little is known regarding the pathogenesis of these biological control agents in the lepidopteran pests of soybean. The goal of our research is to elucidate the pathogenesis of these two baculoviruses in the two most significant lepidopteran pests of soybean: the velvetbean caterpillar and the soybean looper (Pseudoplusia includens). For the purpose of researching AgMNPV pathogenesis, we will genetically modify AgMNPV the genome so that we may easily track the cell-to-cell movement of the virus as it infects the insect. Additionally, we will develop research methods that permit the study of baculovirus infection within individual cells with the intent to better understand the insect's antiviral response to infection. The overall goal of the proposed research is to provide the research community with effective tools for studying baculoviruses and to increase our understanding of baculovirus infection so that more organic farmers include baculoviruses into their integrated pest management program.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

101,"Sufficient supply of clean water is essential to public health, ecosystem protection, as well as economic development. Improving water management to conserve water resources and protecting watershed from hazardous runoff and discharges was one of USDA?s primary agricultural policies in the 1990s because the large consumptive use of fresh water in agricultural sector and also significant fertilizer and other chemical runoffs to national water ways. Water conservation has become a challenging task with the presence of diminishing water supplies due to population growth and climate change, expansion of energy feedstock production due to a strong national interest in ethanol from corn and cellulose, and growing competition for limited resource along with initiatives of rural development that has put an emphasis on ethanol refinery industries. A plant that produces 25 million gallons of ethanol per year can provide 23 direct jobs and 73 additional indirect jobs. Ethanol refinery plants require large amount of water for processing and operation. Producing 25 billion gallons of ethanol would require approximately 75 billion gallons of water annually (using the ratio of 3 gallons of water to 1 gallon of ethanol commonly featured in ethanol plant proposals), just to convert feedstock to ethanol. A biorefinery that produces 100 million gallons of ethanol per year would use the equivalent of the water supply for a town of about 5000 people. Not only do conversion facilities require water, but also the plants providing the grain and cellulose require water. It is, however, quite uncertain whether or not producing corn as ethanol feedstock will require more or less water, which will depend on where the crop is grown. Switching from soybean production to corn production does not mean less water consumptive use, although corn generally uses less water than soybeans in the Pacific and Mountain regions. However, the reverse is also true in the Northern and Southern Plains. Impact on water quality may be even more difficult to monitor because the fertilizer or other chemical runoffs are related to both the application rate and the time and amount of water applied to field production. Ethanol feedstock production might drive the expansion of agricultural lands, especially in dry western areas, which has the potential to dramatically affect water demand. De La Torre Ugarte pointed out that the important determinant of agricultural land use and associated water use and quality changes will be the commercial introduction of cellulose-to-ethanol technology and the tillage production methods used in producing ethanol feedstocks. The commercialization of this technology will depend on several significant problems to be overcome including lower the cost of enzymes and improvement of the pretreatment. Development of ethanol industry is a national energy strategy, but its impacts on water demand and quality are local or regional in nature and hard to monitor. The United States is relatively well endowed with water; however, abundant supplies in one area are of no help to water scarce areas unless there are facilities to transport supplies among regions.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
102,"Canola is a crop with the potential to greatly increase acreage in the Southeast in the next few years. Canola fits into southern cropping systems as a winter crop and can be double-cropped with soybeans or cotton. Equipment used for soybeans, corn, and small grains can be used for canola and equipment used for pressing soybeans can be adapted for canola. Currently there is limited germplasm available and limited information about its adaptation. Years of breeding and crop research are necessary to develop high yielding germplasm adapted to a specific region. This project is designed to make canola production feasible in the Southeast by developing high-yielding, well adapted varieties and developing mangement systems to grow them.

Not only using petroleum resources, these materials cause pertinent environmental pollution, especially air pollution due to hazardous chemicals emission from the adhesives and coatings. The goal of this Critical Agriculture Materials program is to support the development and demonstration of novel, environmentally friendly technologies for use in paints and coatings, and adhesives for composites. The long term goal is to develop biobased adhesives and coatings using the residues from biofuel production. For this proposed research, we will use soybean flour from biodiesel production as main starting raw materials to accomplish the proposed objectives.

107,"This section includes discussions of the rationale for this program from two different perspectives. First, there is an examination of the justifications for the respective CIFT program components. The second discussion focuses on why the CIFT organization is appropriate for performing this work. Agriculture is a very significant part of total revenues in States like Ohio. Individual farm and total sector income is stagnant or even declining, causing decreases in the number of independent operations. In 1910, for example, 44% of total food expenditures were returned to the farm, but by 1990, that number was less than 10%. This is a clear indication that efforts are needed to try to enhance income by developing new methods of generating revenue. Short term prices for grain crops have increased due to increased demand for them as feedstocks for biofuels, but many continue to believe that value added crops remain viable long term solution. Economists point to the fact that other similar events in the past have led to short term price increases, but market mechanisms have led to increased supplies and lower prices. Additionally, many feel strongly that alternatives to corn and soybeans, such as palm oil, canola oil, switchgrass, and perhaps even algal-based oils will take over as primary feedstocks for ethanol and biodiesel The rationale and justifications for the involvement of CIFT in this program fall into four major classifications. First is its location. CIFT is located and has operated in Ohio for more than fifteen years. Ohio is unusual, even unique in the Nation in the composition of its business structure. Agriculture, food, and the  green sector  represent a $77.5 billion dollar industry in the State. More than 50% of Ohio's 41,000 square miles of land can be classified as prime farmland. Ohio is home to more than 2,500 agbioresource processors, and currently has more than 15 million acres of agricultural land. These demographics, particularly when combined with Ohio's agricultural and entrepreneurial heritages, make the State a fertile location for the generation of new and novel approaches to agricultural income enhancement. The CIFT staff is comprised of professionals with backgrounds and credentials in several different disciplines, each of which is supportive of value added economic development activity. CIFT employs professionals in Industrial Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Marketing, Agricultural Economics, and Energy Engineering, and can thus create multidisciplinary teams that can evaluate multiple facets of various agricultural and agribusiness environments. Additionally, the CIFT model for operations is one that relies heavily on networking. CIFT has long standing working relationships with scientists at academic institutions (The Ohio State University, The Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, The University of Toledo, Bowling Green State University.), and many private sector companies. These relationships expand CIFT core competencies, and create a much more robust organization. In creating this network model, CIFT has also formed strategic partnerships with many other agricultural stakeholders",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

110,"This project???Ts intent is to develop beneficial new non-smoking uses for tobacco including exploitation of its phenomenal biomass, potentially useful leaf proteins and other compounds. We plan to establish a ???obiorefinery??? capable of using tobacco as a feedstock to produce a combination of food, feed, industrial raw materials and energy products. We envision a process which recovers leaf proteins from tobacco, and then utilizes the residual biomass for a combination of food, fuel and industrial products. Our goal is to establish a commercial production facility capable of producing leaf proteins and co-products from tobacco in Southern Maryland in approximately three years. Our project is multidisciplinary: Agronomy: Cultivation of tobacco for proteins and biomass is very different from traditional tobacco production. The process is largely mechanized, involves very high plant densities, and multiple harvests in a single growing season. We propose several studies to examine seeding techniques, weed control and cultivation practices associated with this new non-traditional tobacco production. Harvesting and Post-Harvest Handling: Tobacco must be harvested and handled in a manner which minimizes protein degradation and other product loss, as well as transportation costs. We have proposed several studies which examine whether techniques used to harvest and handle perishable agricultural products are suitable for handling tobacco biomass. Proteins and Other New Products: Tobacco naturally produces large volumes of leaf proteins which have nutritional value comparable to milk protein and are considered non-allergenic. These proteins also have excellent binding and emulsifying characteristics. Tobacco also produces other potentially useful materials including solanesol, which is used in the manufacture of nutraceuticals and dietary supplements. We will assess the feasibility of recovering solanesol as a co-product in a biorefinery along with leaf proteins. Other potentially useful compounds in tobacco will be sought. Industrial Scale-Up. We have already developed techniques for recovering tobacco leaf proteins on a pilot scale. Several studies regarding the scale-up of our pilot technology to an industrial level in preparation for commercial production are proposed. Success of this project could help maintain a viable agricultural base in the historically tobacco-producing region of Southern Maryland based on the production of tobacco for safe and beneficial purposes. It could also provide a model for revitalizing tobacco-producing regions across the southeastern United States. The commercial establishment of tobacco biorefineries would lead to new jobs, markets and industries in tobacco-growing regions. Success of this project could also result in the commercial production of a new source of protein - leaf proteins - which may ultimately rival milk, soy or egg protein in importance.

116,"As a nation, we are faced with multiple challenges from global climate warming, rapid depletion of fossil oil, a strong desire to become independent from foreign oils, and a moral obligation to preserve our environment for future generations. In response to these challenges, many consumers have changed their purchasing behavior, preferring bio-based products over fossil-based products with a willingness to pay a premium. This green socioeconomic movement is now prevalent in many commercial markets. Many companies which manufacture and market finished consumer products are actively seeking new bio-based raw materials to develop their green products for this growing segment of consumers. As a result, the market opportunity for bio-based raw materials is growing very rapidly. Our patent-pending vegetable oil gel technology is geared towards taking advantage of this growing market opportunity. This technology blends an advanced polymer into liquid vegetable oil, forming a microscopic three-dimensional network of polymer springs within the oil matrix, conceptually similar to the spring structure of a mattress except at a nano-molecular level. Depending on the density and strength of these oil matrix embedded molecular polymer springs, the resulting gelled material can exhibit a wide range of unique properties, from a strong and tough material, to a jell-O like soft gel, to a pudding-like soft solid, and to even a thickened but flowable liquid. Additionally, this gelled material can be produced with a clear or opaque color. The versatility of this material allows us to consider many different applications in a wide variety of industries. As a result of our work in the Phase I project, we have already developed two commercial prototypes as value-added ingredients for the Cosmetic and Toiletry Industry (CTI) and candle industry, and have verified some of their unique benefits when incorporated in the end formulations of CTI products. The brand names we've chosen for these two commercial prototypes are NatureVgelTM Soya - 100 and NatureVgelTM Soya Butter-100. The unique benefits we have verified for the CTI include: a) imparting a very silky and cushiony skin sensory in the finished cosmetic and skin care products; b) increasing product stability; c) controlled delivery of essential oils and fragrance, and d) longer wear.

117,"According to the National Petrochemical Refiners' Association, the US uses well over 4 billion gallons of lubricant products; much of this volume ends up in the environment as  lost-in-use  products. At the same time, the United States is the world's leading producer of soybeans, generating over 12 billion pounds annually, and accounting for half of world soybean production. Soybeans alone can replace a large portion of these lubricants, creating market opportunities for farmers and reducing our dependence on oil imports. Additional oilseeds can be grown throughout the US, to provide renewable oil supplies with desirable properties for lubricant applications, as well. Some of the benefits derived from soybean-based lubricants are summarized below: Biolubricants possess inherent performance features that add value to the lubricants industry, such as substantially higher viscosity index, better lubricity, and better adherence to metals than conventional alternatives. Bioblubricants offer environmental, health and safety value, including low toxicity and higher flash and fire points. ABIL's soy products are formulated to be  readily  biodegradable (biodegrading by a minimum of 60% within a 28-day period) and lower in toxicity to the extent possible. Value-added opportunities for farmers and agri-business are realized, providing potential for rural development and enhanced commodity prices. A GMO soybean variety cultivated exclusively for lubricant use provides a $1/bu premium to growers, with minimal yield drag. Biolubricants, derived from renewable resources, lessen our dependence on imports, and offer to lessen upstream pollution associated with petroleum extraction and refining. Cooperative field testing has verified operational benefits to industry such as increased productivity and efficiency gains, and energy savings (decreased water usage, etc.). To date, the Program's primary focus has been on development and commercialization of lubricants and greases. It is anticipated that market growth will continue for biobased lubricants, amplifying the demand for quality assurance support to ensure that biobased products meet industry performance standards.

119,"Soybeans are the second largest food crop in the U.S.A., with about 87 million metric tons produced in 2006. Soybeans provide high-quality protein, and in 1999 the Food and Drug Administration gave food manufacturers permission to put labels on products high in soy protein indicating that these foods may help lower the risk of heart disease. Generally, high-fat foods that have been exposed to excessive levels of free radical activity smell rancid, and are not considered acceptable for human consumption. However, purified proteins are capable of acting as free-radical traps and thus can lead to the unintentional ingestion of high levels of free-radicals, as well as poor shelf-life and loss of nutritional qualities. Using solid-state electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of commercial samples of isolated soy proteins (ISP) we found a symmetrical free-radicals signal typical of carbon-centered radicals (g=2.005) ranging from 296 trillion to 642 trillion spins per gram (Boatright and others, 2008). The level of free-radicals in ISP was 14 times greater than similar radicals in sodium caseinate, 29 times greater than egg albumin and about 100 times greater levels than casein. Nine soy protein powdered drink mixes contained similar types of free-radicals, but at levels up to 4,100 trillion spins per gram of drink mix, or up to 6.4 times greater than the highest free radical content found in commercial ISP. Laboratory prepared ISP samples contained trapped radicals similar to the levels in commercial ISP samples. Preliminary stability studies of the ISP stored in the dark at 23°C in sealed containers found that the level of free-radicals increase by as much as 35 fold during the first 9 weeks of storage. This indicates a mechanism for the formation of these radicals in ISP that differs from previously proposed mechanisms. The high levels of free radicals in the commercial soy protein products examined can contribute to numerous degradation reactions once the protein is hydrated, and consuming such high levels of free radicals may have harmful consequences in humans. This is the first time the levels of free radicals in commercial ISP, and food products high in ISP, has been reported. It is also the first time the large increase in free radicals during ISP storage (which appears to account for the majority of free radicals) has been reported. The goal of this project is to investigate the mechanism that free-radicals in ISP are formed and stabilized within the  dry  protein, and to investigate the reactions catalyzed by carbon-centered radicals in ISP once the protein is hydrated. Results from these findings should allow us to minimize the occurrence of the free-radicals in commercial soy protein products, and to begin to determine how harmful these free-radicals can be when consumed.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
120,"While soybean ranked 2nd among U.S. crops in farm value in 2005 with over 67 million acres planted in 2007, U.S. dominance of global soybean markets has eroded, in part because of increased production in Brazil. Farmers in Brazil protect soybean using low cost pest control strategies, which include the baculovirus AgMNPV. Because natural baculoviruses are available to organic farmers in the U.S. for controlling crop pests and inexpensive to produce, they constitute an underutilized strategy for reducing economic damage to soybean by lepidopteran larvae. AgMNPV and AcMNPV are the most widely used baculoviruses, but little is known regarding the pathogenesis of these biological control agents in the lepidopteran pests of soybean. The goal of the proposed research is to research baculovirus pathogenesis in the two most significant lepidopteran pests of soybean: the velvetbean caterpillar (Anticarsia gemmatalis) and the soybean looper (Pseudoplusia includens). For the purpose of researching AgMNPV pathogenesis, we will genetically modify AgMNPV the genome so that we may easily track the cell-to-cell movement of the virus as it infects the insect. Additionally, we will develop research methods that permit the study of baculovirus infection within individual cells with the intent to better understand the insectÂ¿s antiviral response to infection.

Most dairy rations use imported corn and soy to satisfy energy and protein needs for the lactating dairy cow. This represents the largest portion of feed expenditures for most dairymen, roughly 50 to 60 percent of total milk production costs. The goal of this sub grant is to establish the economic and production efficiency of alternative feeds common to the western region of the United States as replacements for costly imported grains currently used in the dairy industry. 3. Microalgae will be one of the most desired feedstock for biofuels production in the future. Theoretically, biodiesel produced from algae appears to be the only feasible solution today for replacing petrodiesel completely by a renewable source. The long-term objective of this sub grant is to help convert energy consuming farms to energy generating, locally sustainable rural communities through the use of microalgae in the production of biofuel. 4. The increased utilization of cereal grains, particularly corn, for ethanol production in the U.S. has resulted in a major increase in the cost of livestock production. The objective of this sub grant is to obtain matching funds for the acquisition of a microcapillary flow cytometer for animal health monitoring to determine the effect of various feed additives on animal performance, animal health and feed cost reductions. 5.

122,"Arkansas is fourth in the nation in softwood lumber production and first among southern states. The acreage of forested land in Arkansas is increasing as more agricultural lands are converted to trees. Growing some of these trees for energy purposes could become a viable alternative to growing trees for traditional products such as lumber and paper. Issues surrounding cellulosic-based biomass feedstock production are complex and require sound science-based information from which to base decisions. In the United States, economic, national security, and environmental issues have raised interest in fossil fuel substitutes that can be produced from renewable materials. Biomass-derived fuel substitutes such as ethanol (which serves as a gasoline substitute) and biodiesel (which substitutes for petroleum-based diesel) can be produced domestically with a variety of crops. Currently, corn and soybeans are the primary feedstocks for ethanol and biodiesel, respectively. However, it is unlikely that these crops will be sufficient to meet biofuel demands, particularly since these crops are also important food sources for humans and livestock. To continue providing the burgeoning biofuel industry with adequate feedstock supplies without seriously compromising food production, it will be necessary to rely increasingly on non-food cellulosic and lignocellulosic feedstocks. Additionally, increases in production and development related to forest-based systems have implications for water quality. In Arkansas, more demand, increasing competition, spreading development, and intensifying management practices all focus attention on water issues. These issues are complex and require sound science-based information to aid land managers and policy makers in the decision-making process. A thorough understanding of the alternatives and flexibility in management practices that may influence water quality is critical when deciding what activities are appropriate when concerned with site-specific control of potential nonpoint source pollution. Need exists to design and implement economically and environmentally viable best management practices that can mitigate against water quality problems that may arise in a variety of situations, including activities related to livestock, crop, pasture, or forest management. The Arkansas Forest Resources Center will focus on supporting research programs that address (a) cellulosic-based biofuel production and (b) best management practices related to water quality. Specific objectives are to: (1) assess biomass yields of cellulosic and lignocellulosic feedstocks;(2) determine the investment potential of cellulosic biomass production systems;(3) evaluate impacts of cellulosic biomass production on select ecosystem services; and (4) evaluate best management practices for protection of water quality.

Specifically, the USDA is interested in monitoring the variation and trend of ultraviolet light at the Earth's surface to evaluate these damaging effects on crops, trees, and livestock. This UVB Network is the only remaining US national monitoring effort for these wavelengths. This program provides high quality UVB data, dating back to 1995, which is publically available through the Internet. Our dataset is being used for agricultural research at the Agricultural Research Station at Beltsville, University of Maryland, Colorado State University, Utah State University, Mississippi State University, Purdue University, Cornell University, and the University of Nebraska; for health research at the University of California at Davis, University of Colorado Health Center and the U.S. Naval Warfare Center, Philadelphia; for education (including at several high schools); for research on the influence of UVB on the viability and spread of powdery mildew on wine grapes; for aerosol, air quality, and climate change studies in Houston and Mexico City, and at other universities and government agencies for a variety of projects. Experiments have revealed that enhanced UVB light has adverse impacts on growth, yield, and quality of crops such as soybean, wheat, rice, sorghum, cotton, and corn. On-going experiments in growth chambers at Mississippi State University study the effects of enhanced UVB radiation and high temperature on cowpeas. The effects of UVB radiation and soil moisture on leaf litter decomposition were investigated through experiments in a greenhouse at CSU, and the results are currently being analyzed. Experiments were carried out to evaluate and quantify the effects of UV radiation on the early development of soybean. Two cotton growth simulation models were incorporated into a regional climate model in order to quantify the impact on cotton yields of enhanced UVB radiation combined with drought stress. These effects are being specified and quantified by our research group and incorporated into crop models.

124,"Agricultural commodity crops are critically important for Mississippi's economy but these crops face climatic and disease threats. In addition, because of recent economic factors (especially in energy prices) corn and soybeans, which historically have been of lower importance to the MS economy, have become more major economic contributors. The value of forestry is potentially increasing and yet, because the price of corn is increasing, the cost of feed for poultry and catfish is increasing. It is critical to help the MS economy and workforce that we focus on identifying genetic mechanisms of stress and disease resistance in these commodity crops that can be used increase production efficiency by decreasing the economic effects of climatic and disease stressors. Our objective is to provide innovative genomics and systems biology-based research solutions to address disease and climatic stressors in Mississippi's most valuable commodity crops. We will provide these solutions done by leveraging the investments made in genomic information and state-of-the-art bio-technologies. In this proposal a multidisciplinary team, based in the MSU Life Sciences and Biotechnology Institute, a unit within the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, is expected to: 1. combine functional genomics, experimental genome-annotation and bio-computation to identify how the genomes of Mississippi's most important crops function to accommodate to climate and disease stressors; 2. provide fundamental experimentally-derived structural- and functional-annotations of the genomes for Mississippi's most important crops; and 3. provide a systems biology pipeline enabling researchers to most rapidly derive value from functional genomics experiments and experimental genome annotation.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
125,"The overall goal of the National Center for Soybean Biotechnology (NCSB) is to integrate genomics and breeding research leading to the development of superior soybean germplasm and cultivars that will help U.S. farmers maintain their global competitiveness and expand utilization of the soybean crop. Soybean is the number-one oil seed crop in the U.S. with annual production exceeding 30 billion dollars and has inherent benefits for agricultural production (e.g., biological nitrogen fixation) and documented health benefits (e.g., the anticancer benefits of isoflavones). However, soybean farmers in the U.S. are under sever threat due to cheaper, increasing production in South America and negative impacts on export markets due to the politics of genetically modified plants. It is important to develop a new interdisciplinary paradigm to capture the value of U.S. soybeans and build a competitive advantage for U.S. soybean farmers in the global market. Traditional breeding practices cannot achieve these goals without the application of modern biotechnology. Biotechnology will improve profit opportunities and competitiveness by reducing production costs and increasing yield potential and quality while also providing environmental and health benefits. Fundamental research in soybean genomics and biotechnology is the key to the development of superior soybeans to enhance U.S. farmer competitiveness and economic development in rural communities. The objectives of this project are to develop genomic and genetic resources for soybean improvement and to develop soybean germplasm with improved resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses and value-added seed composition traits. NCSB will contribute to the development of an integrated genetic and physical map linking to the whole soybean genome sequence. Gene transcript profiling methods will be used to dissect the biotic and abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms that help identify and discover novel molecular switches and genetic markers for crop improvement. NCSB will develop a deletion mutant resource for analysis of gene functions. Soybean genetics and breeding research at the NCSB will focus on mapping genes associated with economically important traits, development of marker-assisted selection strategies, and the release of improved soybean germplasm.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
126,"30% of all known plant viruses, including many major pathogens important to US agriculture, are in the Potyviridae family. Potyviruses regularly attack potato, wheat, and many fruit and vegetable crops. The most efficient way to control potyviruses is by genetic resistance. A more expensive and less environmentally sustainable way is to spray pesticides to control the aphids that transmit potyviruses. But viruses often evolve to overcome the resistance. A better understanding of how viruses work is necessary to identify resistance targets in the viral genome. Using bioinformatics methods we discovered a tiny new gene (called pipo) that is present in all sequenced potyvirus genomes. Pipo overlaps with the large polyprotein gene that was thought to be the only gene in the potyvirus genome. We also showed that the pipo gene is essential for the virus to infect plants. Discovery of pipo is revolutionary because it reveals new coding capacity and potential gene function that has been ignored in all previous research on viruses of the Potyviridae. In soybean mosaic virus, pipo is located in a portion of the genome known to determine whether the virus is susceptible to a host resistance gene. Thus, it is possible that pipo determines whether viruses like soybean mosaic can infect normally resistant soybean plants. Our research will determine this possibility. Also, because pipo overlaps with another gene, the mechanism by which the protein encoded by pipo is expressed (made by the host protein synthesis machinery) must be novel. We will investigate this mechanism of gene expression and it should shed fundamental new light on possibilities for protein synthesis control in plants. Finally, we will determine the role that pipo has in the virus replication process, be it multiplication of the viral genome, moving the virus from cell to cell, or overcoming the RNA-mediated innate immune response known in all plants. The OUTCOME/IMPACT of this research will be new knowledge that may guide (1) virologists in engineering improved virus vectors for expressing foreign genes or knocking out host genes, (2) plant breeders in screening for durable resistance to potyviruses, and (3) molecular biologists in understanding the mechanisms of protein synthesis in plants.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The objectives of the project are the development of new monomers and polymers and the study of effects of structure on the properties of novel polymers. The structure will be adjusted by varying the type of monomers and their concentration. Processing methods to convert all polymers to different products, such as fibers, films or injection molded or extruded parts will be examined as well. The outcomes/benefits from this project include: (1) reduction in U.S. dependence upon foreign petroleum by replacing petroleum-based feedstocks for plastics with biobased feedstocks and (2) creation of new uses for U.S. agricultural commodities such as soybeans. Potential consumption of these oleochemicals is estimated to be several hundred thousand tons per year. The technology for converting vegetable oils will be ozonolysis followed by a hydrogenation, or oxidation, reductive amination, and hydrolysis (transesterification) to obtain a family of monomers such as hydroxy acids, diacids, and amino acids. New monomers will be polymerized using chemical or biological means to a family of polymers such as polyesters and polyamides.

131,"Because of escalating petroleum and food prices, new processes are needed to convert soybeans into fuel and biobased products as well as food and feed through advanced soybean biorefineries. Extracting flaked soybeans with the organic solvent hexane is the most cost-effective oil-recovery method, the first step in biorefining; but, hexane is flammable and a neurotoxic and hazardous air pollutant. The EPA is enforcing new regulations to reduce hexane emissions. A promising alternative is Enzyme-assisted Aqueous Extraction Processing (EAEP) in which water is used as a separation medium and extrusion and enzymes are used to free the oil. EAEP has low capital costs and less safety and environmental issues compared to hexane-extraction and thereby enhances rural economic growth and the potential for soybean biorefineries to produce biobased products and biofuels. We envision replacing hexane-extraction with enzyme-assisted water-based  green and clean  technologies. These advanced processing methods should enable second-generation soybean biorefineries to more efficiently produce food, feed, biofuels and biobased products. The new soybean processing technologies should also integrate into today's dry-grind ethanol production facilities to reduce costs and produce more valuable co-products. More efficient utilization of corn as well as soybeans should result including less water use, improved feed and biobased products, more fuel and less stress on food supply when producing bioethanol.

Additionally, lands currently considered too marginal for intensive food production may be considered suitable for biofuel production bringing highly erodible, nutrient poor soils currently in conservation reserve programs back into intensive agriculture. In the Midwest, cropping systems may shift from the predominant corn - soybean base to a more varied array of species including novel perennial grasses for which little agronomic and environmental data exist. Optimizing nutrient use efficiency will be essential to mitigating the environmental damage associated with fertilizer production and application where improper management can result in nutrient runoff into lakes, river systems and oceans and production of greenhouse gases. Likewise, understanding crop water balance and optimizing water use efficiency will be essential to bioenergy crop success as water resources are expected to be the single, most-limiting factor in the multiple regions of the U.S. where biofuel production will be pursued. Sustainable biofuels production with the concomitant protection and improvement of air, soil and water resources requires a concerted effort by the scientific community to gain knowledge regarding the comparative energy production potentials and environmental impacts of candidate biofuel systems.

We have identified this as a major gap in our knowledge of drought responses and an opportunity to increase drought tolerance. Our hypothesis is that WRKYs are regulators of water stress responses and that similar genes regulate these responses in different plant species.

136,"This project has two major aspects related to food allergy. The first objective is to develop detection methods for residues of two commonly allergenic foods - buckwheat and pistachio. This group has previously develop detection methods for peanut, milk, egg, other tree nuts, soybeans, shrimp, clam, mustard, and lupine so these two additional methods help to complete the set needed by the food industry. The industry can uses to determine if its cleaning practices are sufficient or whether the use of shared equipment presents potential hazards to allergic consumers. The new buckwheat and pistachio assays will give food processors sensitive and specific techniques to detect inadvertent contamination of their raw materials and finished products with residues of either of these allergenic foods. Ultimately, the antibodies used in the pistachio detection method may be useful in the development of a multi-plex tree nut ELISA as we already have antibodies for walnut, almond, hazelnut, pecan, and cashew (but Brazil nut, macadamia nut, and pine nut are also missing). The second objective relates to the refinement of methods for the assessment of the potential allergenicity of genetically modified or other novel foods. These methods are needed to assess the potential risk and prevent the unintended introduction of a major allergen or protein that would likely cause allergic cross-reactions in some consumers. Bioinformatics approaches (computer assisted sequence comparison analysis) have been developed as one of the most important tools to identify potentially allergenic proteins. AllergenOnline is a public database created through the efforts of the Food Allergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP) at the University of Nebraska. The database provides a publicly available, searchable list of protein sequences of known allergens and bioinformatics strategies useful in comparing these sequences to those of novel proteins. FARRP will continue to screen the literature to identify new allergens so that the list can be annually updated. This database is used by academic and government scientists developing genetically engineered and other novel foods, by regulatory officials in many countries, and by the agricultural biotechnology industry in a key step in the overall allergenicity assessment process. As part of this project, we will assess the validity of the search criteria of 35% identity over any 80 amino acid segment as a predictor of allergenicity through serum testing of legume allergic subjects, using allergic sera.

The symbiosis occurs in ecosystems throughout the world and has a profound effect on plant life and ecosystem function, largely through impacts on plant phosphorus nutrition. The AM symbiosis is a highly co-evolved partnership, in which the coordinate differentiation of both symbionts results in development of a specialized symbiotic interface, over which nutrients are exchanged. In order to develop crop plants that are optimized to obtain maximal benefit from the AM symbiosis, it is necessary first to understand which genes control the AM symbiosis and the molecular basis of their function. We have identified two genes, from Medicago truncatula, STR and MtPT4 that are essential for development of the AM symbiosis and for symbiotic Pi transport. The goals of this project are to characterize the molecular and biochemical functions of STR in M. truncatula and to determine the potential relationship of STR and MtPT4.

138,"This proposal seeks to continue some projects already begun and to initiate several others in The Pennsylvania State Universitys On-Farm Research (OFR) program. The proposed and recently initiated research will explore areas to improve sustainability of various production systems. Some will be organic, others will be conventional production. Several cover crop studies presently underway will be continued. Trials are already underway on two farms. They will be continued through the end of 2008, the termination date for a NE SARE Partnership project that was secured to provide additional support for this work. The focus of cover crop studies will be to reduce weed pressure on cash crops in the rotation and improve soil fertility. Increasing nitrogen production from legumes in an age of increasing energy costs will be a necessity. The OFR coordinator will continue to provide guidance to a county extension educator for a dairy feeding study begun in 2007. The focus of this effort is to demonstrate that through reducing the amount of protein fed lactating dairy cows, animal performance can be maintained and possibly improved while reducing the feeding cost of milking cows. The project is being conducted on ten farms. A Pennsylvania Soybean Promotion board funded project will be continued during 2008 to evaluate when soy stand loss occurs and to learn of the benefits for using soy seed treatments. Stands in marked plots will be sequentially counted to document when loss is occurring. Should results indicate that most loss occurs prior to emergence or early establishment, most likely because of disease, this may indicate a need for increased use of seed treatments or other means to limit the impact of these pests. Supported with a NE SARE Research and Education grant, researchers from Penn State and Rodale Institute will continue a project that seeks more consistent performance for farmers who want to grow heavy cover crops and use the relatively new concept of crop rolling to control them. The OFR program is supporting this project through three on-farm sites in PA, NY, and MD. Proven and experimental practices/treatments will be utilized on these private farms to demonstrate the potential for this technology to reduce or eliminate the use of herbicide in a subsequent corn or soybean crop. The recent large increase in fertilizer prices, especially nitrogen, has prompted strong promotion of several products that are added to N fertilizer to reduce losses to volatilization and leaching.

139,"Tobacco has played a major role in Kentucky's economy, and many of Kentucky's family farms have been highly dependent upon tobacco as a primary source of income. But in 2007, Kentucky tobacco cash receipts totaled approximately $300 million, down from $674 million in 2000. Many of Kentucky's farms are small, averaging 163 acres, well below the U.S. average of 449 acres. Of the 84,000 farms in Kentucky in 2006, 63 percent had sales of less than $10,000 per year. As income from tobacco has declined, interest in alternative crops, including horticultural enterprises, has risen dramatically. This interest continues to increase because of the tobacco quota buyout. Horticultural crops offer Kentucky growers potential alternatives, as the state trails neighboring states Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia in produce and nursery crop acreage. A number of farms have successfully initiated commercial vegetable enterprises. Other farms are seeing the potential success of horticultural crops, but most lack the technical knowledge and management skills for immediate success with the required production/marketing systems. Kentucky's grain crop producers are actively searching for ways to improve the market value of the crops they grow. An emphasis on bioenergy has increased the value of corn, and research is needed to determine which hybrids are best for ethanol production. Research is also needed to look at potential energy production utilizing other crops, including switchgrass. Other potential specialty grain types include green vegetable soybean and organic corn, wheat, and soybeans. Twelve horticulture and specialty grains projects will be conducted by researchers at the University of Kentucky as part of this overall New Crop Opportunities, KY, project.

Center staff will answer questions from Extension agents and farmers, and will distribute new crop information at field days and conferences. The Center will facilitate the packaging of information from its field research and other sources for dissemination. The expected outcomes/impacts of this project will be an increase in knowledge among Kentucky farmers and county extension agents about production and marketing systems for a variety of new crops. This increase in knowledge should allow farmers to make informed decisions about which new crops to try, and how to market those crops, based on information available on the Center's specific research projects, as well as through its Crop and Marketing Profiles.

140,"Soybean is second only to maize in importance in commodity crop production in the North Central regional states. Diseases and pests pose a threat to soybean production. One of the most important insect pests of soybean is the soybean aphid. Since arriving in the region from Asia around 2000, it has become firmly established. Severe outbreaks have occurred somewhere in the North Central region about every other year. In 2003, several million acres of soybean in the region were invaded, suffering estimated production losses in the millions of dollars. In addition, producers spent several millions of dollars spraying their fields to control the aphids. Host plant resistance is a major component of an integrated pest management program for a crop such as soybean that includes chemical control, biological control, and plant culture management practices. Resistance can significantly reduce the need to apply insecticides, reducing the cost of production for the soybean producers and the impact of soybean production on the environment. Our research group identified the first useful sources of resistance to the soybean aphid. We released resistant soybean germplasm to public and private soybean breeders for development of new soybean cultivars with resistance to the soybean aphid and anticipate that some of the first soybean aphid resistant cultivars will become commercially available in 2008. Recently, we discovered that a soybean aphid variant occurred in the region that could overcome some of the resistance we have found. Most insect pests have the capacity to develop variants that have the ability to overcome resistance or insecticides. Strategic deployment of resistance genes can help limit the adaptation of pest variants. We can use intelligence in deploying genes that are effective to the most prominent pest variants in an area and change gene deployment as needed based on the current pest variability and what might be expected in future years. This can be done by collecting pest samples and testing their ability to attack currently available resistant cultivars. However, this work is time and space inefficient and very costly depending on the number of samples to be tested. A more efficient method with potential high throughput and low cost would be to screen pest samples for DNA markers that are linked with known virulence genes. This technology could significantly improve the monitoring of soybean aphid virulence variability to help predict the vulnerability of deployed resistance genes and develop an advanced resistance gene deployment strategy in the soybean crop. For the first step toward the development of a high throughput virulence monitoring technology, we will determine the inheritance of aphid virulence on a specific soybean resistance gene, Rag1. Subsequent work to identify markers linked to virulence will require the use of the segregating soybean aphid clones that will be produced in this project.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

142,"Fusarium root rot has long been known as a common soybean disease, but its significance has not been recognized. It is widespread in the U.S., affecting soybeans across a geographic area. However, its yield impact has been difficult to quantify, for a variety of reasons: it often occurs in combination with other pathogens or plant health problems, above-ground symptoms may not be evident, and below-ground symptoms may be indistinguishable from other root rots. Average soybean yield losses to Fusarium root rot in the U.S. from 1996-2005 were estimated as approximately 5.9 million bu/yr, not including the role of Fusarium species in seedling diseases, which were estimated to cause average losses of 27.9 million bu/yr over the same time period. If one-half of the seedling losses can be attributed to the Fusarium spp. complex, the impact of Fusarium root rot on soybeans would be approximately 20 million bu/yr. These estimates do not account for interactions between Fusarium species and other pathogens, such as soybean cyst nematode (SCN). In summary, research-based evaluations of yield impact by Fusarium root rot are very limited, and the role of Fusarium species in seedling diseases has not been adequately quantified. Soybean growers in Iowa and other North Central states have indicated an increasing concern about the role of Fusarium root rot as a potential contributor to disappointing soybean yields and poor root health, usually in combination with other plant health issues. It seems clear that interactions with other diseases are important considerations regarding the economic impact and management of Fusarium root rot. SCN interacts with edaphic factors and these relationships may influence Fusarium root rot. High pH soils are more prone to problems with SCN. Our observations in Iowa fields support a similar relationship between Fusarium root rot and soil pH. Fungicidal seed treatment is a recognized management tool for Fusarium infection of seeds and seedlings, but it is not used routinely in soybeans. Further work is needed to clarify the value of seed treatments in soybeans. SCN begins to feed during the soybean seedling stage, when seed treatment fungicides are active. If SCN feeding exerts a significant influence on Fusarium infection of seedling roots, then the benefit of seed treatment may also be influenced by the presence of SCN. Two obstacles to recognition and characterization of Fusarium root rot have been the lack of effective methods for identifying multiple pathogens in plant samples and accurately quantifying infection by individual pathogen species. These problems have essentially been solved through advances in molecular biology, and we will apply real-time PCR and DNA microarray methods for Fusarium detecting species infecting soybeans. With this research we propose to bring the understanding of Fusarium root rot to a new level. An enhanced understanding of Fusarium root rot yield impact, the Fusarium species involved, and their interactions with SCN will lead to more focused management strategies and subsequent research to identify additional tools that can be incorporated into those strategies.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Although they are not economic pests in all areas of their expanded range, there is increasing interest in information about monitoring procedures, and economic injury levels for this insect. Previous research on other ear feeding insects indicates that insect injury is a contributing factor to fungal growth and mycotoxin development on the grain, however this relationship has not been examined for the western bean cutworm.

In the absence of research-based recommendations for western bean cutworms, there is a potential for growers to react to an emerging pest with inappropriate use of insecticides, not based on local conditions as assessed by scouting and use of valid economic thresholds. The research outlined in this proposal is designed to provide that needed information. Results from this project will be published in referee articles, presented at professional society meetings, incorporated into our extension programs, and shared with colleagues through regional technical committees such as NCC 205 and NCERA 201 (of which Hunt and Wright, respectively, are active participants). We will consider conducting a regional teleconference workshop, similar to past workshops on soybean aphid and corn rootworms sponsored by the North Central IPM Center, if there is interest, as another way to transfer from research results from this project to end users across the region. Western bean cutworms were identified by the North Central IPM Center in their August 2006 newsletter as an `IPM issue  which has arisen since the Field Corn Pest Management Strategic Plan (Pike 2002) was published. The Regional USDA Technical committee, NCC 205: Ecology and Management of European Corn Borer and Other Lepidopteran Pests of Corn, identified in its project proposal that western bean cutworm is an increasingly important pest, and is among a group of insects not affected by many Bt corn hybrids which may be favored by the reduction in broad-spectrum insecticide usage. They identify research on insects such as these, as a priority to evaluate if `pest replacement' may occur with widespread use of Bt corn hybrids. This research project addresses all three goals of the NC IPM Competitive Grant program: improve the economic benefits related to the adoption of IPM practices; reduce potential human health risks from pests and the use of pest management practices, and reduce unreasonable adverse environmental effects from pests and use of pest management practices. It is also addresses the Research Needs identified in the National Road Map for IPM; develop economical high-resolution environmental and biological monitoring systems to enhance our capabilities to predict pest incidence, estimate damage, and identify valid action thresholds.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
144,Commercial soybeans require heat processing to deactivate anti-nutrition factors/enzymes. Schillinger Seed has developed a new soybean free of the key anti-nutrition Kunitz Tyrpsin Inhibitor (SKTI-Null). This new SKTI-Null) soybean presents the opportunity for ambient or cold processing of soybeans for use in food and feed. The elimination of heat processing eliminates the need of a signifcant amount of processing energy and greatly reduces the compexity of processing. The project will produce samples of cold/ambient processed soybean meal for testing in feeding trials with swine and poultry. A control lot of SKTI-Active soybeans will also be produced and fed as a reference. The feeding trials will also benchmark against conventional commercial soybean meal. Lab analysis will validate the profile of all the raw soybeans and the meals fed in the feeding trials. The results of the feeding trails will be analysed for impact on feed conversion and weight gain. Assuming success with SKTI-Null cold processed meal we plan to advance to pre-commercial trials the following year in a Phase II project. Anticipated benefits include lower cost protein feed and food production and new opportunity for decentralized processing of soybeans in local facilities near sources or markets. Further benefits could be improved amino acid quality as a result of the elimination of heat exposure.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
145,"Non Technical Summary: The goal of this research is to generate transgenic crops with broad-spectrum, season-long resistance to root knot nematode (RKN, Meloidogyne sp.). Plant parasitic nematodes, of which RKN is the most significant, annually cause damage of $8 billion in the U.S. and $78 billion worldwide. This project proposes to use RNA interference (RNAi) to control RKN by silencing nematode genes in planta. We will generate and test the efficacy of specific double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) which can be delivered to RKN to inhibit essential target genes and block parasite development in the host. Divergence has already established an efficient transgenic hairy root in planta expression system and used it to screen numerous candidate dsRNAs for soybean cyst nematode (SCN) genes. Promising results in SCN control have been achieved, and the same system has been utilized successfully for RKN in pilot experiments. We will select, clone, and sequence RKN gene targets likely to be both conserved and essential in all RKN species. The RNAi potency of RKN target genes will be assayed in the transgenic hairy roots. At the conclusion of Phase I, we anticipate that several target genes demonstrating substantial reduction in RKN reproduction in hairy root will be selected for whole plant transformation during Phase II. Transgenic crops have a significant opportunity to replace toxic nematicidal pesticides being withdrawn from the market. Benefits of a successful transgenic approach would include higher grower yields, lower input costs, greater worker safety, and less environmental impact.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
146,"Biofuels have a strategic value in reducing our dependence on foreign oil and the ability to increase our energy security. Growing and processing oil-rich biomass into biofuel in the U.S. would contribute to reduce this dependence. The objective of this project is to evaluate the conversion of oilseeds that could be grown in the U.S. and U.S. territories into a substitute of hydrocarbon fuel. One particular crop is Jatropha curcas, a bush belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. A feasibility study shows that the crop will be economical if plantation by-products can be of commercial value, which would decrease the energy crop costs, hence make it competitive. As a parallel, oil-rich feedstock like soybean is grown in the U.S. not just for its oil, but for the value of its protein-rich meal. As for Hevea, Jatropha curcas stem and other plant parts contain a sap-like extract known as latex that is the primary source of natural rubber. It also contains substances that are toxic and that renders any by-product unsafe for human or animal consumption. Jatropha curcas oil press cake cannot be sold or easily disposed of, making the seeds less attractive economically. Some of these substances may be used as a natural pesticide or could find direct medical applications, e.g. in fighting lice and scabies (Mange). Another notable physiological property of phorbol esters is their capacity to act as tumor promoters in cancer research. The husks of J. curcas fruits can be directly used as a fuel in the oil seed processing facility, which lowers the power consumption. Also, plant mass built under- and above ground could be traded on the growing carbon markets. These studies will be conducted as an integrated part of a larger project focusing on the development of Jatropha curcas as a viable biofuel crop on sub-prime lands.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
147,"In the United States, the vast majority of biodiesel consumed is made from soybean oil by a homogeneous alkali-catalyzed process known as transesterification. This process is very inefficient and could be improved substantially; however, it has not changed much in the last two decades. In addition to the high separation and purification costs that result from the use of a homogeneous catalyst, the feedstock cost of soybean oil accounts for a significant portion of the biodiesel production cost. Yellow grease is available at substantially lower cost than soybean oil, and the US produces enough yellow grease annually to make 500 million gallons of biodiesel. However, the problem with yellow grease is that it contains high concentrations of free fatty acids that pose significant processing problems in alkali-catalyzed processes. The current two-step commercial processes used to convert yellow grease to biodiesel incur added costs for pretreatment of the yellow grease before transesterification to remove the free fatty acids by the addition of extra alkaline catalyst or esterification of the free fatty acids using a homogeneous acid catalyst, eliminating the advantage of the cheaper raw material. This proposed project aims at developing an innovative technology to convert yellow grease to low cost biodiesel in a ONE-STEP process using our patent pending heterogeneous catalyst and a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor. During Phase I, research will focus on investigating the optimal operating conditions for the fixed-bed reactor, evaluating the heterogeneous catalyst lifetime, quantifying the economic viability, and determining its technical feasibility. The success of this project will provide a highly energy efficient, cost-effective, and simplified process for one-step biodiesel production from yellow grease. It will create a value-added and more profitable market for yellow grease, reduce the biodiesel production and capital costs, eliminate waste streams produced from toxic acid or caustic solution, reduce air pollution, benefit consumers economically by reducing their vulnerability to petroleum price fluctuations, and reduce the US dependence on foreign energy sources.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
148,"Biodiesel is a renewable petroleum diesel substitute whose use can improve air quality and help combat global warming. We propose to test the feasibility of using a novel and innovative process to synthesize biodiesel that could change the economics and commercial practices of the biodiesel industry. Our research will evaluate the feasibility of using a novel, highly efficient heterogeneous zirconia-based catalyst in a continuous flow packed-bed reactor for synthesizing biodiesel from a variety of feedstocks. The surface chemistry of zirconia is dominated by Lewis acid-base chemistry, which will allow for the controlled adsorption of acid or base moieties that can be used for catalysis of both esterification and transesterification reactions. In this research, both base, acid and unmodified forms of zirconium dioxide will be evaluated at elevated temperature and pressure for efficient, continuous transesterification of triglycerides (TGs) and esterification of free fatty acids. Phase I research will test the capability of this catalyst to produce biodiesel using a variety of feedstocks (i.e. soybean oil, algae oil, yellow grease, beef tallow and acidulated soapstock) without significant catalyst deterioration over extended periods of use. Furthermore, we will purposefully foul the catalyst with dirty feedstocks and evaluate if the catalyst can be regenerated by pyrolysis of adsorbed organic matter in order to restore its original catalytic activity. If successful, we believe this research will overcome the most significant limitations currently experienced by the biodiesel industry, namely the difficulty in using inexpensive feedstocks that contain high levels of free fatty acids, the necessity to continuously add catalyst to the reaction (in either batch or semi-continuous production modes), resulting in the need to dispose of waste products harmful to the environment and eliminating the need for extensive washing of the biodiesel with water. If successful the proposed fixed bed catalysts should stimulate use of inexpensive feedstocks, thereby lowering the cost of biodiesel production significantly. In summary, a successful phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of using zirconia at elevated temperature and pressure to change the economics of biodiesel production and expand its role as a renewable, environmentally friendly energy source.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
149,"A new variant of stem rust of wheat (Ug99 or TTKS) may enter the U.S. at anytime in the next few years. The pathogen has recently spread from central Africa into Yemen. Infected wheat plants release 100s of trillions of rust spores per acre each day that can be blown long distances and spread the disease. The U.S. grows approximately 60 million acres of wheat, yielding 2 billion bushels valued at $7.5 billion in 2006. Most commercial cultivars are highly susceptible to this new pathogen. If this new variant of stem rust causes a 5% loss in our major wheat production areas as other variants of the pathogen have done many times during the 20th century, this would have an important impact on U.S. agriculture. Rust pathogens have been transport to North America by airflows multiple times in the past. Our team has experience studying rusts and other aerobiology systems. In 2003, we conducted the aerobiolgical analysis of the risk of a U.S. invasion by soybean rust that was the basis for an USDA Economic Research Service report on the potential cost of a U.S. soybean rust incursion. We have also deployed aerobiological models as part of the ipmPIPE over the past three years to forecast the seasonal movements of the soybean rust within North America. Our goal is to integrate the extensive knowledge-base on wheat stem rust aerobiology and our state-of-the-art aerobiology model within a modern cyberinfrastructure. We will construct a risk analysis of aerial pathways and timing of TTKS incursions from potential off-shore source regions into U.S. wheat production areas.

Although Neonotonia, Pueraria, Teramnus and Calopogonium species are used as forage, pasture and/or for soil conservation purposes in tropical and subtropical zones, the overwhelming reason for the economic importance of the subtribe Glycininae is due to the cultivated soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr. Species in the various genera are used by pathologists to study a range of host pathogens. In addition, Pueraria montana var lobata commonly known as kudzu. These days it thrives as a weed throughout the southeastern part of the U.S. Kudzu also acts as an alternate host for the economically important pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi. The fungal pathogen over winters on kudzu in frost free environments along the Gulf Coast. Soybean rust was first identified in the continental U.S. in 2004. Soybeans are very susceptible to soybean rust and if infected and left untreated the plants quickly will defoliate and die. How much damage to the soybean crop in the future by the pathogen is uncertain. However, studies on the susceptibility of Teramnus and Amphicarpea to rust are warranted since these two genera are closely related to Glycine. Lastly, the germplasm of the above genera may contain diverse economic traits that possibly can be transferred to the soybean by classical or genetic engineering approaches.

170,"Peanut and soybeans have traditionally been a cash crop in much of the south and coastal areas of Texas for several decades. Peanut has several unique features that contribute to challenging weed management. Most peanut cultivars grown in the United States require a long growing season. Secondly, peanut has a prostrate growth habit, a relatively shallow canopy, and is slow to shade inter-rows which allow weeds to be more competitive with the peanut plant. Additionally, peanut fruit develops underground on pegs originating from branches that grow along the soil surface. Weeds compete with the peanut plant for sunlight, moisture, and nutrients throughout the growing season. However, weeds can also reduce harvesting efficiency and are particularly troublesome during digging and inverting procedures. The fibrous root system of annual grasses is extremely difficult to separate from the peanut. During digging and combining operations, under weedy conditions, the peanut pods can become detached from the peanut vines and are left on the soil surface. Fungicide and application costs for peanut production have escalated rapidly in the last decade. Therefore, a need exists for peanut cultivars with multiple pest resistance to reduce the need for pesticides. The use of advisory spray programs to reduce fungicide usage have been successfully used in the southeastern US and have shown promise in south Texas. Fixed interval or calendar-based spray applications may schedule fungicide applications during periods when environmental conditions are unfavorable for infection by pathogens. Conversely, during periods favorable for pathogen development, fixed schedules may recommend fungicide use by applying fungicides too infrequently. Forecasting systems have been developed that reduce fungicide use by applying fungicides only during periods favorable for pathogen development. Soybean production components such as planting date, cultivar, and seeding rate can be manipulated to counter the effects of various environmental factors on soybean development and yield. Also, planting early in the season may help to avoid soil moisture deficits that may arise later in the growing season during the critical stages of plant growth. Although early maturing cultivars usually produce lower yields when compared to full-season cultivars at normal planting dates, early planted, early maturing cultivars may produce superior yields by avoiding July and August summer heat and drought conditions. Texas has a long history of producing high oil-yielding crops such as castorbean, flax, and sunflower, but low oil prices in the 1970's and competitive income advantages from other crops essentially removed these crops from production in the state. The expected impacts and benefits of this research project include a reduction in grower outputs which should lead to a net increase in income. By implementing results of this research, growers should be able to reduce pesticide inputs by 10 to 15 percent. Additionally, increased yields should result in added income. The reduction of herbicide use rates and fewer fungicide applications will help to reduce pesticide input into the environment.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
171,"Nitrogen availability is critical for crop production yet excess nitrogen poses a significant environmental threat. The threat to groundwater and surface waters is well recognized and understood; the threat to air quality is more poorly recognized but no less real. Nitrogen trace gases can significantly affect regional / global climate over long time scales, as can other trace gases such as methane. Agricultural landscapes may play a critical role in global balances, and the inclusion of perennial biofuel crops in these landscapes represent a mitigation option. Our research is showing that crop management can significantly affect nitrous oxide production and methane consumption in Michigan corn-soybean-wheat rotations. Importantly, low-input management strategies do not necessarily affect gas fluxes less than high-input management ? in fact systems in which leguminous cover crops substitute for inorganic fertilizers can have higher nitrous oxide fluxes, and similar methane fluxes. Specific modern management practices in general may, however, have less of a long-term impact than the simple historical effect of original land-use conversion. This means that the transient seasonal fluxes of gases from row-crops may occur on top of a baseline flux that is already significantly elevated following original forest clearing, with elevated levels maintained by high rates of nitrogen cycling in highly productive cropping systems ? regardless of the source of this nitrogen. Because of the importance of these gas fluxes to global climate change, and the potential for changes in environmental policy that could affect future crop management options it seems important to better understand the nature of elevated fluxes in row-crops ? from the standpoints of both long-term legacies related to land use change as well as contemporary management impacts.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Understanding the regulation of crucial metabolic pathways will provide a framework for increasing biomass production and improving renewable energy resources. We and our collaborators have shown a positive correlation between the presence of misfolded proteins and cellular responses to increase the folding capacity of the cell and accelerate protein degradation. These responses are spatially segregated as though the stress response in the endoplasmic reticulum does not always alter functions in the entire organelle but is instead specific to the site of the processing and deposition of the altered protein. This information has increased our knowledge of the regulation of crucial metabolic pathways of seeds and should provide a framework for increasing and improving renewable energy resources. In addition, our identification of components of the protein degradation machinery may enable the improvement of expression of genetically-engineered proteins and the amelioration of grain quality problems such as endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation of foreign proteins.

The development of weed populations with resistance to glyphosate, and multiple-resistance, to glyphosate and other herbicide sites of action, poses a substantial problem for grain crop producers. Initial research with glyphosate-resistant populations of horseweed and giant ragweed in soybeans resulted in identification of other herbicides that could be combined with glyphosate to obtain effective control. Herbicides that inhibit acetolactate synthase (ALS) were among the more effective for control of glyphosate-resistant populations. However, we have discovered populations of horseweed and giant and common ragweed that appear to have resistance to multiple sites of action, glyphosate and ALS inhibitors. Populations with multiple resistance will be much more problematic to control than those with a single type of resistance, especially in soybeans, since the remaining available herbicides are less effective than glyphosate and ALS inhibitors on horseweed and ragweeds. The goal of the proposed research is to continue to discover weed populations with multiple resistance and characterize the nature of the resistance as early as possible.

The latest figures indicate the heart disease death rate in Nebraska is 213.9 deaths per 100,000 population, or about one-fourth of all deaths. The majority of heart disease cases are categorized as Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and are identified by the presence of atherosclerotic lesions within the coronary arteries of the heart. The fundamental cause of lesion development is not fully understood, although several factors are known to contribute to its progression. Elevated plasma cholesterol concentration is perhaps the most important factor that contributes to CHD development. Consequently, most drug and dietary strategies are aimed at reducing plasma cholesterol concentration. In our previous Hatch project, we reported that dietary stearic acid--a fatty acid found in beef--and soybean phytosterols significantly reduced plasma cholesterol concentration in laboratory animals by reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption efficiency. However, the mechanisms whereby stearic acid and phytosterols regulate cholesterol absorption are largely unknown. Greater understanding of these mechanisms is necessary to develop better dietary strategies to reduce the risk of CHD. We will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to determine the mechanism(s) in which phytosterols and/or their fatty acid esters regulation cholesterol transport and absorption, thus impacting plasma cholesterol concentration. Information resulting from the research could be used to modify current dietary recommendations for the purpose of improving human nutrition. This work could also impact agricultural industries by encouraging the development of more nutritious and healthful food products, thus enhancing the economic viability of foods.

Additionally, in 2006, soybean rust was detected for the first time in Illinois, and thus elevates the risk of this devastating disease not only to Illinois soybeans, but also to soybean growing regions in north central U.S. The Soybean Disease Biotechnology Center remains a primary line of defense against major soybean diseases, and research on soybean rust is a high priority for the Center. The Center brings the power of new scientific advances in structural, comparative, and functional genomics, nanotechnology, and genetic transformation to bear on soybean disease threats. Soybean germplasm sources from around the world are collected and maintained within the USDA National Soybean Germplasm Collection, located at the University of Illinois, and this collection provides a vast, easily available, and unique source of diverse soybean genetics for the Center's researchers to mine and mobilize for the U.S. agricultural community. These valuable resources enable Center researchers to create novel sources of disease resistance to protect the soybean crop and increase profitability throughout the industry.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
195,"Dramatic atmospheric alterations have occurred during the past several decades that may have serious impact on agriculture. Elevated ozone has been estimated to amount to a loss of agricultural productivity of as much as three billion dollars yearly in the U.S. and Canada. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O3) are increasing steadily in the atmosphere and are expected to double from its pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century. Elevations of CO2 and O3 have been associated with multiple negative impacts on plants. Ozone is considered one of the most toxic pollutants in the troposphere and soybeans are one of the most sensitive plants to O3 damage. Responses of soybean plants to elevated CO2 and O3 include increased photosynthesis (as a result of elevated CO2) and thus enhanced yield, balanced by decreased yield caused by elevated O3. The University of Illinois has the perfect opportunity to investigate the impact of elevated CO2 and O3 on soybeans, the largest single source of protein meal and vegetable oil in the human diet. We have the only free air gas concentration environment (FACE) facility in the world that has been established to study the impact of altered CO2 and O3 on the soybean crop (SOYFACE). Soybeans serve as a significant source of biologically important compounds, the alteration of which could have significant impacts on product quality and human health.

202,"Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) was identified in South Dakota during 2006. SMV is seed transmitted, and its impact is increased by interaction with its vector, the soybean aphid. Movement of SMV within and between soybean production fields was considered to be the result of noncolonizing aphids temporarily settling in soybean fields prior to the introduction of the soybean aphid. However, introduction of the soybean aphid provided an aphid that could colonize soybean. Thus, these models done prior to soybean aphid establishment do not reflect the current field situation. Also, control methods for the soybean aphid may influence this rate of spread.

The net impacts of this project will include improved soil productivity on thousands of ha of mined land in our region and associated improvement in agricultural profitability for landowners.

The proposed research project will investigate the use of environmental-friendly microwave technology to extract oils and convert them into biodiesel through a transesterification reaction in which the oil is mixed with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting products are biodiesel and glycerol, an important chemical with multiple industrial and agricultural uses. Biodiesel can be used in most modern Diesel engines without any modifications and loss of performance. The main objectives are to extract, separate and characterize the lipid source in three oil feedstocks (rice bran, soybeans, and Chinese tallow trees seeds), to convert these oils into biodiesel, and to optimize the process such that it can be scaled to pilot and industrial level. The microwave extraction and transesterifications will be achieved in both batch and continuous mode.

207,"Depleting petroleum reserves and environmental concerns with the greenhouse gases are putting biogenic (plant-derived) oil esters at the forefront as the zero net carbon dioxide contributing alternative for use as fuels (e.g., biodiesel), technical fluids (e.g., lubricating and insulating bio-oils), and resins (e.g., bio-epoxy resin) for plastics. A recent article titled The end of cheap oil in National Geographic magazine highlights a well-known fact that the world is in the twilight of plentiful petroleum oil and alternative sources of energy and raw material must be developed. Biofuel in the form of biodiesel offers one of the most attractive direct replacement of fossil fuel. Significant efforts in this area are already underway as evident from the increasing number of newly installed biodiesel plants in Missouri and around the world. The most common process for producing biodiesel is through the transesterification reaction of vegetable oil or animal fat with an alcohol and a catalyst. Soybeans make up over half of all oilseeds produced worldwide and are currently the main source of biodiesel production. Due to a wide array of applications including nutritional food, animal feed, cooking oil, and recent usage as biodiesel fuel, it is anticipated that the soybean supply will not satisfy the growing demand in the future. There is a great need for the discovery of more productive renewable sources of plant-derived oils. The increasing demand for biodiesel also requires development of more economical and efficient processes for oil extraction and transesterification reaction. The Lincoln University Cooperative Research team in collaboration with the Center for Environmental science and Technology of the University of Missouri Rolla (CEST-UMR) proposes to undertake a comprehensive research and development program aimed at developing an integrated technology for economical production of algae, efficient extraction of oil and conversion to biodiesel. Micro-algae are the fastest growing photosynthesizing unicellular organisms and can complete an entire growing cycle every few days. Some algae species have high oil content (up to 60% oil by weight) and can produce up to 15,000 gallons of oil per acre per year under optimum conditions. The need for an efficient process for the extraction of oil from cultivated algae will be met by developing an economical, safe, and environment-friendly solvent system that can selectively recover triglycerides and efficiently convert them to fatty acid methyl esters for use as the biodiesel fuel and the source of bio-plastic resins. The proposed research and educational program will promote a close collaboration between multi-disciplines (chemistry, biology and mechanical engineering) and multi-institutions (University of Missouri-Rolla, Lincoln University and University of Alabama). By offering exciting research opportunities, and exposing the students to experiential learning curricula, we also seek to recruit, train, and mentor students from underrepresented groups and encourage them to pursue post-baccalaureate degrees in science and engineering disciplines.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
208,"Cotton and other producers may be able to improve farm profitability by taking advantage of an alternative bioenergy cropping system that includes alternating soybeans and cotton for seed oil during the summer, with canola as a complementary new energy crop during the cool season. Canola, Brassicaceae family, is a cool season annual crop grown mainly in Europe and Canada (Younts, 1990). In 1985, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration changed its regulations to allow the use of low erucic acid rapeseed oil (canola oil) for human consumption in the United States. The U.S. food industry quickly recognized the nutritional benefits of canola oil and began to market canola oil as a cooking oil and to utilize it in a growing number of processed foods. Rapid and widespread acceptance of canola oil by health-conscious American consumers has dramatically increased the demand for domestically grown canola. To-date, domestic production of canola has not been able to keep pace with this escalating consumer-driven demand. Southeastern farmers are in an excellent position to profit by supplying expanding canola markets in rotation with currently grown crops. Mild winters, adequate winter rainfall, the potential to double-crop and the availability of local oilseed processing facilities make the southeastern US a promising site for canola as a cool season component to a rotation focusing on seed oil production. Research conducted in the southeast indicates that canola can be grown successfully in this region as a fall-planted winter annual. Machinery required and production costs for canola are similar to those for wheat, with profit potential equal or better than that of wheat. In order to develop a sustainable rotational cropping system that targets maximum seed oil production research is required. Cotton and soybeans are not new to Alabama producers. But canola is a new crop in this region. Consequently, research field trials related to appropriate seeding rates, planting dates, and water and nutrient requirements are needed. One of the investigators in the current project has been intimately involved in testing canola varieties in Alabama, and is providing a viable seed variety for this research study. This is fortunate, because at present only a few of the canola varieties tested are available to producers in the southeastern United States. In addition, crop rotations are commonly used to stabilize yield, reduce nematode populations, break life cycles of insects, and reduce pathogen inoculum. Conservation tillage is a best management practice that not only stabilizes yield, but reduces nonpoint source pollution from runoff, maintains organic matter, and conserves energy. Combining irrigation with those practices should increase yield, particularly in years of inadequate rainfall. This proposed study also allows economic comparison of a traditional cotton-cotton rotation to a bioenergy rotation. Agronomic data will be collected in order for producers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management and the potential of alternative crop rotation.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
209,"Future corn and soybean production in Wisconsin will be greatly affected by the demands for biofuel production. This is already evident in Wisconsin as 2007 corn planting is 11% higher than in 2006, while for soybean, there has been an 18% reduction in planting. Furthermore, although there is strong interest in the application of foliar fungicides for both corn and soybean, we currently lack significant information regarding the cost-effectiveness of these methods. Compounding this change is the fact that there is a general lack of information regarding how corn pathogens affect corn production, especially under continuous or multi-year corn. This information is important in order to uncover potential yield losses due to corn pathogens, as well as providing us with the baseline information we need in order to more adequately compare the cost-benefit of fungicides in the future. Also, federal programs continue to emphasize reduced or no-tillage systems, while no-tillage has been shown to relate to numerous corn pathogens; this interaction may further reduce the yield potential for corn. Therefore, this proposal directly relates to the first two areas of identified needes for Wisconsin: mechanisms of pathogen resistance and control; and effects of change in global climate (and the need to address these changes) and their impact on agricultural production. This project also provides the basis for the development of a multi-state research and extension program in the North-Central region. Overall, this research will significantly increase our knowledge of relevant corn pathogens in Wisconsin, as affected by different tillage and corn-soybean cropping systems. The benefits to Wisconsin and regional producers will be of direct interest in formulating standardized recommendations in managing corn diseases in the future. We will use the field research to develop hands-on training sessions for producers to learn about corn diseases and how we can manage those diseases. Furthermore, results from this research will be presented in multiple formats, including, scientific journals, trade and extension publications, and web-based delivery methods.

210,"My approach to elucidate precise, selective chemical methods of pest control is to focus as guides to discovery on insects that feed on specialized plant organs. Here pollen-, seed- and nectar-feeding beneficial and pest insects will be studied. Seeds are rapidly becoming the delivery system for many materials including crop protecting fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, and nutrient supplements in addition to genetics. Most high-valued seeds, notably transgenic corn, soybeans and cotton, are now treated with systemic neonicotinoid insecticides plus multiple fungicides to assure excellent crop establishment where pests and diseases exist. The US is the top importer and exporter of seed. Seed treatment is an excellent strategy to minimize above-ground exposures and environmental loadings of toxic pesticides, yet achieve adequate pest control. However, there is a critical need to carefully define and optimize the use of seed treatments, particularly insecticides, for pest management and for minimizing non-target effects. Post-harvest losses in grains and other food seeds, due primarily to insect pests and fungal diseases, represent the major economic constraint to worldwide food security. The increasing pervasiveness of treated seeds indicates that considerable impact to the environment, unaware seed handlers, grain consumers and bees may occur. Bee disappearances threaten the production of nuts, berries, fruits, and vegetables.

Our hypothesis is that glycerol can be included in finishing lamb diets without sacrificing animal health or performance or carcass characteristics. If our hypothesis is correct, excess glycerol produced during the production of biodiesel can be fed to finishing lambs providing both an outlet for a by-product and a means of reducing feed cost for lamb feeders.

Production of ethanol from corn and grain are well developed technologies. However, corn ethanol can meet only a limited amount of liquid fuel demands due to competing markets for food and feed. As petroleum costs rise, alternative transportation fuels will become increasingly cost competitive with gasoline and essential to the survival of modern society. By-products of grain and corn production, namely straw and corn stover, can also provide feedstocks for fuel ethanol production and for direct combustion or gasification to provide heat and or power. In addition, diverse agricultural crops and industries can provide other lignocellulosic feedstocks for energy production. These include: hardwood sawdust, food production byproducts, paper waste, root crops, corn cobs, sorghum waste, sunflower residues, soybean residues and switchgrass.

217,"Rust is considered to be a major threat to soybean production in the United States. Serious yield losses can occur if P. pachyrhizi, the causal agent of Asian Soybean Rust (ARS) becomes well established in the Continental United States, which is likely since there are no soybean cultivars with broad spectrum durable resistance. The major objective of most breeding programs is to identify genetic resistance to plant diseases. This is especially true of soybean. Significant efforts are being made to determine the location of the gene, or genes, controlling resistance that can assist in the rapid and efficient development of new resistant varieties. The durability and stability of plant disease resistance is also a fundamental issue, as it is an important asset in new cultivars. Considering that durable resistance is a reasonable goal, the specific strategies used to achieve this goal may be improved by a thorough characterization and analysis of the inheritance of resistance. To characterize the inheritance pattern of soybean resistance to P. pachyrhizi, this project proposes to identify genes involved in defense, determine their potential function and better understand the molecular and genetic processes of soybean and P. pachyrhizi interactions that lead to disease resistance (specific and slow-rusting) or susceptibility, with the intent of rationally developing durable broad spectrum disease resistance strategies. To our knowledge, the proposed project will provide the first look at the relationship of the molecular, genetic and morphological events involved in soybean race specific and slow-rusting resistance to P. pachyrhizi. An important part of this work is the elucidation of the genetic regulation involved in specific and slow-rusting resistance to ASR. This lends the opportunity to manipulate the resistance response by possibly up-regulating identified genes that are necessary for resistance in response to rust infection and down-regulating genes that are unnecessary or possibly have negative effects. Probably the most intriguing aspect of this work will be the comparison of inheritance patterns of soybean slow-rusting resistance with those of wheat and maize, where partial resistance has been successful in controlling rust fungal diseases. Questions regarding plant disease resistance that have left breeders, farmers and scientists perplexed include; Why has slow-rusting resistance proven to be more durable than specific resistance and how can this type of resistance be used to develop new durable resistant varieties? To address these questions, it will be necessary to gain a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of resistance that is unstable (specific) and one that remains effective (slow-rusting), providing incite as to the requirements for durable resistance and the mechanism controlling this resistance, whether it be gene-for-gene or other mechanisms. The work outlined below will contribute to a framework for understand the molecular and genetic basis of slow-rusting resistance and designing novel strategies to develop soybean cultivars whose resistance to ASR lasts over time.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
218,"WCR behavioral resistance to crop rotation changed corn insect management because it allowed WCR to circumvent our most reliable method of managing WCR injury: the corn-soybean rotation. Today, growers across Illinois, Indiana, and portions of at least four other states must weigh the price of protecting rotated corn against the potential cost of lost yield if unprotected corn suffers severe WCR larval injury. Unfortunately, few growers in at-risk areas use the soybean field monitoring protocol (even when presented with evidence that economic injury due to WCR activity is variable). Because they lack information to the contrary, growers assume their fields are at risk and forego WCR monitoring in soybean to blindly apply controls. The method to monitor soybean-to-cornfield movement uses evidence of soybean herbivory which affects key activities at the root of rotation resistance (female activity and egg-laying). The association between soybean herbivory and activities diagnostic of rotation resistance makes the method useful to directly measure rotation-resistant activity levels in specific fields. Available information about local rootworm activity may prompt producers to monitor WCR. This work develops RR soybean detection into a tool useful for rapid assessment of local rotation-resistant WCR activity and improve knowledge about the true WCR threat.

With the increasing demand for crop-based biofuel, corn, soybean, wheat and sugarcane acreage are expected to rise. Louisiana's agriculture is diverse, consisting of a wide array of crops growing on different soils. The reduction in productive lands, increased public concern for environmental quality, and economic constraints brought about by expensive and limited nutrient inputs emphasize the need for more effective soil fertility and nutrient management practices. The validity of fertilizer guidelines from multi-year and multi-site response trials can be altered in response to current changes in crop varieties, cultural management practices, and soil testing methodologies. Therefore, the value of soil testing as a tool to understand and manage fertilizer nutrients relies on frequent verification of fertilization guidelines which can be accomplished through field calibration studies. Also, remote sensor-based precise management schemes for N, the most important and the most limiting nutrient in crop production, needs to be developed.

Producers are encountering insect problems that they have never seen or managed like the newly discovered brown marmorated stink bug. From a research standpoint, changes in pest distribution and status require greater understanding of pest biology and movement, as well as the development or modification of scouting and control methods. New insecticide technologies are providing possible alternatives to more traditional insecticides. The recent registration of seed-applied insecticides offers new control options, but also encourages growers to use products as insurance treatments rather than basing applications on scouting in an integrated pest management context. Besides violating the principles of IPM, prophylactic use of insecticide adds to the cost of production and increases the potential for insecticide resistance. From a research perspective, the efficacy and economic viability of insurance treatments need to be addressed in a concerted way. As a part of this large multi-state and multi-region project, this program will contribute to the overall objectives to increase the understanding of insect population dynamics with relation to soybean development, and to develop new economic thresholds and sampling procedures. The recommendations that will result from better understanding of insect-soybean interactions and impacts on crop growth will significantly add to producer profitability by providing more precise decision-making tools and reducing unnecessary treatments. Refinement of economic thresholds for insect pests to account for newer varieties and natural enemies can minimize both crop loss and unneeded input costs. Improved understanding of corn earworm movement will help predict the spread of insecticide resistance and better maintain susceptible alleles in the population. Identifying new insecticides, and efficient use of current products will increase or refine control options for growers. Specific outputs will include species lists, identification guides, sampling methods, thresholds and control practices for stink bug species; recommendations for use and fit for new insecticides and seed treatments; and continued advisories relating to efficient management of corn earworm and other emerging important insect pests.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

223,"Soybean is a key crop in the U.S., which supplies 35% of the world's production. ISoybeans are produced in 31 states and 3 provinces in the eastern, central, and southern U.S and Canada, from Quebec to Florida, and Delaware to Nebraska. Given this large acreage and wide distribution, it is not surprising that soybean continues to suffer from insect pests that impact plant growth, grain quality, and yield. The overarching goal of the project is to protect soybean from pest insects, using environmentally and economically viable methods. One way this is accomplished is by conducting research on new insecticide control methods, and improving current uses of insecticides by developing and promoting thresholds for growers to better time sprays applications. Refining thresholds for insect pests can minimize crop loss and input costs to growers. Another way to better use insecticides is to predict aphid outbreaks, which we accomplish using a Northcentral suction trap network. The ability to predict aphid outbreaks reduces risk to growers, allowing decisions to be made in advance of the field season to better allocate resources. Beyond insecticides, another goal of this project is to find alternatives to chemical control, including both biological control and host plant resistance. Even a partial success in either control method could save producers tens of millions of dollars in control costs alone, with the benefits of reduced human exposure, less non-target impacts, and slowing formation of insecticide resistance. Further, biocontrol and host plant resistance are often compatible with biological, cultural and sometimes chemical control of pests, and as such is a key component of soybean IPM programs.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
224,"The research is needed because we are beginning to reach the gene pool limits of what can be accomplished through traditional breeding approaches in crop plants in regards to factors limiting yield; such as abiotic environmental stresses (eg drought, heat, high saline). In addition, global warming issues will only make the environment for crop growth even more limiting through climactic associated changes. Therefore, it is imperative that we find new genetic sources of novel abiotic stress tolerance that can be transgenically integrated into the genomes of the various crop species we have come to rely on. This research will reveal new biological systems and underlying molecular mechanisms that enable land plant adaptation in extreme environments. Mimulus and Aquilegia comprise the primary two ecological plant models as evidenced by DOE acceptance for genome sequencing and NSF funding for genomics-based ecology research. Any research that exploits the new genomic resources being developed for these plant systems will make an important contribution to exploratory biology in general and especially in the environmental and ecological research communities. The research will provide important new sources of transgenic material to aid in germplasm improvement for tolerance to abiotic stresses associated with growing crops in South Carolina. A majority of the crop production in South Carolina occurs in the Coastal Plains area, which is an environment that is highly drought and temperature stressed on a regular basis and will likely not improve based on global climate trends. The sandy soil conditions add to the severity of abiotic stress associated with climactic challenges. Transgenically introgressed genes that induce greater levels of abiotic stress tolerance would greatly aid crop improvement for a number of agronomic species of importance to South Carolina. In addition, most of these South Carolina crops already have established transformation systems in place (soybean, cotton, tobacco, and corn).

225,"The soybean aphid is a significant pest of soybeans thrhoughout the midwest. In terms of damage potential, if left untreated this insect can reduce yields in the range of 25-40%. In terms of soybean production within Iowa (average production of 55 bushels per acre), at current commodity prices ($14 bu) and production levels (7-8 million acres), if left untreated the soybean aphids impact can be measured in the billions of dollars. Although the cost of control is much lower than the potential damage ($16 per acre for insecticide applicaiton) the appropriate use of these products is necessary to preserve their usefulness in light of insecticide resistance and the environmental harm they can cause. Insecticides are the first tool that growers currently employ to manage this pest. All the insecticides currently labelled for use agianst the soybean aphid are of a broad-spectrum that can produce mortality in benefiecial insects as well as produce negative impacts to wildlife further up the food chain. Thus this research ultimately seeks to develop pest management guidelines for the soybean aphid in light of these environmental and economic realities. With a premium from $0.65/bu to $1.10/bu for 3% or 1% linolenic soybean respectively, low-linolenic soybeans are an attractive opportunity for growers to improve upon the profitability of soybean production. Without an understanding of how these common soybean pests act alone and in concert on these varieties, growers may be at risk of losing these premiums. Upon completion we will validate pest management recommendations based on commodity soybeans for production of low-linolenic soybeans or determined where modifications are needed for successful production. The current recommendation and threshold for soybean aphids was designed and appropriate only for 30 inch row spacing and for soybeans up to the R5 stage. As of 2004 soybean row spacings used in Iowa vary, with approximately 50% of growers using a sub 30 inch row spacing. Soybean spacing has been shown to influence soybean aphid densities in Korea, however soybean aphid is not considered as significant a pest of soybean production in Asia as it has been within the US. To what extant the soybean aphid populationsAE respond to variations in row spacing populations and how their management should be adjusted to this response in Iowa is not known. A goal for this proposal is to understand the impact of row-spacing on soybean aphid biology and expanding the current threshold to reflect the variability in soybean row spacing used in Iowa.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
226,"Soybean is a major U.S crop and export commodity. In 2006 the U.S. soybean crop value was 20 billion dollars and about 1 billion bushels were exported. New and versatile uses of soybean as soy foods, animal feeds, and industrial and pharmaceutical products create demand for soybeans, soybean meal, and soybean oil domestically and worldwide. Soybeans are grown on half a million acres in Virginia, and annually are worth around 100 million dollars in the state. Soybeans are planted on more acres in Virginia than any other field crop, and the value of production is similar to corn. Because of its importance to national and commonwealth agricultural security, continual research efforts must be directed at improving the efficiency and sustainability of soybean production. A soybean breeding program is an integral part of improving the efficiency and sustainability of soybean production, due to the need for cultivars that (a) have superior yield potential (i.e., enhance yield response in favorable production environments or mitigate yield depression arising from unfavorable abiotic factors) (b) are resistant or tolerant to recurrent and newly emerging soybean diseases (i.e., viral, bacterial, and fungal) and pests (i.e., nematodes and insects), and (c) have altered soybean seed composition in ways that add value and competitiveness to the crop. In addition to cultivar development, there is a need to learn more about the basic biology of the crop, to invest in long-term breeding objectives, and to characterize the inheritance of various traits. This information is useful to soybean breeders and others who are interested in improving the crop and understanding its basic biology, and germplasm resulting from such efforts is freely available. Breeding programs can incorporate or enhance economically valuable output traits into soybean, especially seed composition traits, which raise the value of whole soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal. This helps U.S. soybean producers maintain profit margin and demand for U.S. soybeans in the export market, despite increased competition due to expanded soybean production in Brazil and other parts of South America.

When a new disease is encountered, the first necessary step to start effective treatment is to identify what is causing the disease. Yet, for more than 100 years, scientists have had difficulty in identifying and classifying rust fungi. This research will use DNA sequencing of specific genes to do two things. First, by looking at the genetic relatedness of different species of rust fungi, a classification for these fungi will be developed that can also be used to help researchers predict the behavior and identity of unknown disease agents. Secondly, specific genes will be sought and developed as molecular markers that will allow disease-causing fungi to be rapidly identified even in new environments.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Transgenic varieties with resistance to insects and herbicides, and new production practices have created new avenues for managing pests. As a result of these new technologies, inputs have shifted to where the majority of input costs are applied at the beginning of the season rather than during the season in response to changing crop conditions. These new technologies have also created a shift in the pest spectrum of both crops. For instance, caterpillar insects historically have been the primary pests of both cotton and soybeans. However, true bugs such as tarnished plant bugs in cotton and three cornered alfalfa hoppers in soybeans have replaced the caterpillars in terms of economic importance. These experiments will address several insect problems facing cotton and soybean producers throughout Mississippi. The objectives of these experiments will be to evaluate the impact ofplanting date and maturity on tarnished plant bugs in cotton, novel use strategies for insecticides in cotton, and quantify temporal and spatial host use patterns of tarnished plant bugs.

234,"In 2006, more acres of soybean were harvested in the U.S. than acres of any other crop, including corn. It is not surprising that soybean continues to suffer from insect pests that impact plant growth, grain quality, and yield. Whether it is a result of accumulated years in soybean production, changes in cropping practices, or global climate change, the distribution and impact of native and established pests is increasing in soybean. Producers are encountering insect problems that they have never seen or managed. From a research standpoint, changes in pest distribution and status require greater understanding of pest biology and movement, as well as the development or modification of scouting and control methods. Although pesticides are often the easy first tools used to deal with new or growing insect problems, long-term sustainable solutions must include host plant resistance and biological control. As in many other production systems, invasive species in particular are also an increasing issue in soybean production. The discovery of the soybean aphid (SBA) in 2000 fundamentally changed soybean insect management. SBA feeding impacts all components of yield; under heavy aphid pressure, yield differences between treated and untreated research plots may reach 50%. From an economic standpoint, SBA infestation increases the cost of soybean production. Although scouting methods and an economic threshold (ET) for aphid control were developed under the previous multi-state project, these management practices are only applicable to soybeans in the R1 to R5 growth stages planted in 30-inch rows. The thresholds must be modified to account for plant maturity group and age, differences in planting systems, and populations of biological control agents. Specialty soybean production is a growing, profitable market for producers, including production of USDA-certified organic soybeans. Production practices and quality requirements of organic soybeans differ from those of conventionally-produced roundup-ready beans, thus insect management practices (scouting, thresholds, and control measurements) are also likely to differ. Chemical use has also changed dramatically in soybean production since the inception of the last project. In most soybean production areas, the introduction of soybean rust will change soybean disease management; this will influence the entire production system, including insect management. Preventive applications of fungicide made prior to infection may encourage growers to make unnecessary tank-mixes with insecticides. The recent registration of seed-applied insecticides also encourages growers to use products as insurance treatments rather than basing applications on scouting in an integrated pest management context. From a research perspective, the efficacy and economic viability of insurance treatments need to be addressed in a concerted way.

235,"Crop production is an important component of Nebraska agriculture. In 2007, 9.2 million acres of corn and 3.77 million acres of soybeans worth $16 billion were produced in Nebraska. Historically a great deal of research has been conducted on managing the major economic insect pests of these crops in Nebraska and surrounding states (corn rootworms, European corn borer, bean leaf beetle). Several regional USDA committees are responsible for coordinating this research (e.g., NCC205, NCERA 46, and S1010). However, pest complexes change over time. For example in 2000, an introduced species, the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, was first found damaging soybeans in the north central U. S. Its' distribution expanded over time and A. glycines was first found in Nebraska in 2003. A great deal of research is being conducted on this species in Nebraska and other states since its introduction. In other cases, the geographic range of a native pest species may expand. The western bean cutworm, Richia albicosta, has been a pest of corn and dry beans in Nebraska for many years, but since 2000 has been expanding its' range eastward, and now is a regionally important pest species. There is increased demand for information on its' biology and management due to its greater geographic range. The soybean stem borer, Dectes texanus, is native to states throughout the central U. S., but has historically been a pest primarily in the southeastern U. S. Its' distribution on soybean has been expanding into Nebraska, with the first documented damage in southern Thayer county in 2000. D. texanus has been expanding its range in south central Nebraska since then, with reports of damage in Fillmore and Thayer counties in 2007. More recently, several species of plant feeding stink bugs have been observed more frequently in Nebraska corn and soybeans. Other pest species may vary in density over time. A normally rare native species, the corn blotch leafminer, Agromyza parvicornis, was observed causing high levels of defoliation in corn fields in Phelps county Nebraska in 1995. After a few years, numbers dropped off. However, since 2004, this insect has become more common again, but with a wider distribution throughout south central Nebraska. Other states have also reported higher populations of corn blotch leafminers during this time period. Unfortunately, very little biological research has been conducted on this insect since the work of Phillips in 1914. In the absence of research-based recommendations, there is a potential for growers to react to an emerging pest with inappropriate insecticide use, not based on local conditions as assessed by scouting and use of valid economic thresholds. This reaction is more likely now with higher commodity values for many Nebraska crops, including corn and soybeans.

236,"Water is the most limiting factor for crop production in Nebraska. Water availability for agriculture will become a more critical issue as additional restrictions are placed on irrigation development and use, particularly if climatic patterns become relatively drier. Adoption of no-till has reduced the amount of water lost to evaporation from tillage operations. However, the lack of tillage has created an environment favorable for the growth of winter annual weeds. Many Nebraska farmers do not control these weeds until the time of planting or later. Anecdotal evidence has shown that not controlling these weeds, particularly when they are allowed to grow until planting or beyond, can reduce crop emergence and restrict early-season crop growth in rainfed cropping systems. It is also known that winter annual weeds can harbor disease pathogens and insects pests. Weed scientists recommend that farmers plant into weed-free fields, but the impact of winter annual weed growth on the subsequent crop yield has not been reported in peer-review literature. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is based on economic thresholds. Economic thresholds help the farmer determine if pest pressure will cause yield reductions that exceed the cost of control. Applying economic thresholds to pest management decisions will reduce production costs for the farmer and protect the environment by eliminating unnecessary pesticide applications. Quantifying the potential yield impact of uncontrolled winter annual weeds will define the economic value of controlling these weeds, and will enable farmers to make informed decisions about when it is economical to control those weeds. Uncontrolled winter annual weed growth may reduce the amount of soil moisture available to the crop. Water use by weeds is often attributed as one of the reasons why weeds reduce crop yields. The negative impact of water use by summer annual weeds has been demonstrated by measuring differences in soil moisture between crops grown in weed free and weedy treatments. However, the amount of water used by winter annual weeds and its impact on crop growth and yield has not been reported in peer-review literature. Technologies such as the neutron probe, watermark sensors, TDR, and other capacitance devices allow rapid, repeatable measurements of soil moisture. Greenhouse and field experiments can measure water use relative to plant growth to develop water use efficiency values for winter annual weeds. Quantifying how much water is used by winter annual weeds can be used to develop economic thresholds for winter annual weed control. When farmers are informed regarding the potential water use of winter annual weed growth, they can make informed decisions that may reduce groundwater extraction for irrigation and increase crop yields and farm profitability.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

238,"Humans have significantly altered the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial ecosystems via greenhouse gas emissions and changes in land cover and management. To help guide important societal choices, we must better understand how ecosystems have been perturbed, and how they may change in the future. We need basic understanding of exchanges of heat, moisture, and trace gases within the planetary boundary layer, and how land management modifies these accordingly. These fluxes are dynamic and responsive to each other, and they combine with land and ocean surface characteristics to influence atmospheric circulation, and large-scale climate patterns. In turn, the Earth's climate system affects vegetation structure, function, and global distribution. To improve understanding of these climate-biosphere feedbacks, the study of environmental change has gradually adopted an integrated approach, in which global systems are often studied in unison using numerical models. This integrated study approach is best exemplified by Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), a new class of ecosystem models. These models combine biogeography, soil biogeochemistry, and soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer components, allowing for vegetation characteristics, the soil environment, and nutrient availability to respond to atmospheric forcing and land management change. DGVMs are currently indispensable for the study of plant distribution, ecosystem structure and function, and climate feedbacks in the context of both global climate change and land use change. To respond to the need for a modeling approach that accounts for both managed and natural ecosystems within a single framework, we have implemented process-based models of agricultural row crops and management choices into an already well-tested DGVM, the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS). A new regional U.S. version of IBIS (Agro-IBIS) simulates corn, soybean, and wheat cropping system dynamics, including complete terrestrial nitrogen cycling. Agro-IBIS accounts for human management (e.g., irrigation, fertilizer application, planting and harvest date, hybrid selection) and the effects of environmental stressors (e.g., water and soil nitrogen limitations) and atmospheric CO2 on crop development and regional carbon, water, and energy exchange with the atmosphere. In this project, we propose an interdisciplinary modeling effort that will analyze the response of carbon, water, and energy cycling to multiple, interacting global change drivers within the Midwestern U.S. Specifically, we will determine the general location, timing, and magnitude of changes in water availability, vegetation distribution, and crop yields brought about by changes in: (1) atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), (2) regional climate (precipitation and temperature), and (3) agricultural land management. We will study the effect that these perturbations have on ecological, biophysical, and biogeochemical processes and the associated changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, both from a historical and prognostic perspective (covering the 1948 to 2100 time period across the Upper Mississippi, Missouri, and Great Lakes basins).",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

241,"After many months of debate, the U.S. Congress reached final agreement on a new 2007 Farm Bill. The Bill will continue the generous support afforded to U.S. producers under previous farm bills. While the provisions for support may not be likely to change significantly, it is certainly the case that current conditions represent an agricultural market environment that has not been experienced before. In particular, record high prices prevail in most program commodity crops. Further, current levels of market volatility represent a sustained period of very high variance in commodity prices. These conditions have largely been demand-driven and largely reflect recent energy policies of the U.S. Row crop nearby futures prices (corn, soybeans, and wheat) are experiencing record high prices levels that are more than double their 25 year history. it is clear that the significant shocks to markets realized over the last couple of years have important implications for U.S. farm policies. In particular, many of the policies and provisions in place currently (e.g. LDP and CCP payments) have trigger levels (e.g., loan rates) well below current (and expected future) price levels, making these policies of limited relevance to producer decisions. Further, existing farm policy models are not calibrated to price levels or the significant price volatility currently being witnessed in the market place. A growing concern of U.S. agricultural policy makers in this new environment is how to cope with the substantial increase in price volatility that is occurring. For example corn and soybean price volatilities were 19.6% and 19.4% in 2002. By 2008, these volatility levels had increased to 30.3% and 31.3%, respectively.

An important step in the development of a profitable soybean production system is the selection of a variety that has the potential for maximizing yield in the producer's environment. As the number of varieties available to Kentucky farmers increases, the producer needs unbiased information comparing the yield potential of these varieties at multiple locations in Kentucky.

246,"The goal of this project is to investigate the physiological mechanisms by which elevated temperature limits reproductive fertility, seed growth, and yield. Models of global climate change reveal that many farmers will be growing crops under warmer environmental conditions (+1 to 6 C). In seed-producing crops, this will result in fewer, smaller seeds and reduced harvests. Temperature stress induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in developing ovules and seeds. In soybeans and Arabidopsis, the fraction of ovules that accumulate high levels of ROS equals the fraction of ovules that abort, leading to the hypothesis that this causes ovule and seed abortion. Experiments will be done to determine if an increase in ROS scavenging activity in developing soybean seeds increases soybean yield and seed vigor. These seeds will also be evaluated to see if they have reduced levels of lipid peroxides, which give oils a rancid flavor. An alternative explanation for this ROS accumulation is that reduced O2 availability in seeds could result in alternative electron acceptors being used. Research shows that the soybean seed coat limits O2 diffusion, reducing seed growth, development, and yields. Temperature and O2 treatments will be imposed during floral bud and seed development to determine if reproductive failures (pollination and seed growth) under elevated temperature are mediated by limiting O2 levels. Different temperature treatments will cause differential pO2 inside seed, which can be correlated with energy status, ROS level, metabolite levels, and success in seed growth. Many important seed-producing species show similar patterns of reproductive growth in response to supra-optimal temperatures so findings from this research will be applicable to other species.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
247,"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is designed to prepare and evaluate novel biobased corrosion protection coatings derived from modified soy oil that quickly cures upon exposure to atmospheric moisture yielding smooth protective films. This cure mechanism is based on the well known room temperature vulcanization of the reactive silicone and is applied here by grafting reactive silane onto the unsaturated fatty acid residues of the oil triglycerides. This approach provides a convenient one-component package and does not require reactive diluents, UV or oxygen for cure initiation. It does not incorporate alkyds or require epoxidized soy oil. Preliminary results show that crosslinking occurs relatively fast without requiring any volatile coalescing agents and the films are completely cured. Good adhesion to stainless-steel was observed and physical properties (hardness, tensile strength, elongation, etc.) of the coatings are expected to be easily controlled by the concentration of the grafted silicone component. The presence of reactive silane is particularly suitable for corrosion protection since it acts as a moisture scavenger as well as improving the adhesion with the metal surface. It is anticipated that successful completion of this work will replace petroleum-based materials with biobased materials in corrosion protection technology.The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide permanent, organic coatings derived from renewable resources to offer clean technologies to the public. These biobased coatings are targeted for corrosion-prevention applications such as gas and liquid transmission pipelines, construction rebar for bridges and buildings, industrial equipment, etc. Corrosion of metallic structures has a significant impact on the US economy. Results of a NACE study (2002) shows that the total annual estimated direct cost of corrosion in the U.S. is a staggering $276 billion - approximately 3.1% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product. Successful implementation of Phase I & II of this project will have the following technical, commercial, environmental and economical impacts: improved corrosion protection and ease of application, low capital investment, reduction in VOC/HAP and carbon footprint, preservation of fossil fuel resources, reduction in corrosion related costs to the industry, and creation of up to an additional five jobs for sales, manufacturing, and technical support of this newly developed product.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

The objective of these planning visits is to identify priorities for the utilization and development of genomic tools for the major New World orphaned crops species [e.g., quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus and A. cadatus), tarwi (Lupinus mutabilis), yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus), cañahua (Chenopodium pallidacule), oca (Oxalis tuberosa), and mashwa (Tropaeolum tuberosum)].  Genetic resources, such as DNA sequence-based genetic markers, genetic linkage maps, and gene libraries are essential tools for understanding and improving the genetic basis of agriculturally important traits in crop plants.  The use of DNA markers and gene manipulation (including genetic modification and transgenics) are now commonly used in combination with traditional breeding methods to accelerate and enhance varietal development of the major food staples.  Unfortunately, many regionally important crop species (commonly referred to as orphan crops) lag far behind the major commodity crops (maize, soybean, wheat, rice, etc.) in terms of the development of these advanced genetic tools due to their status as minor crops in the U.S and Europe.  In addition to their regional importance as food and feed crops, these species are also of interest to the broader community of plant scientists due to their remarkable adaptation to severe environments and exceptional nutritional qualities.  The work will be done in collaboration with Jorge Rojas-Beltran of the Fundación PROINPA, Cochabamba, Bolivia; Ivan Maureira Butler of the National Agriculture Research Institute, Carillanca, Chile; Luz Gomez Pando of the National Agricultural University La Molina, Lima, Peru; and Eduardo Peralta of the Instituto Nacional Autónomo de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, Quito, Ecuador.

250,"Intellectual Merit      Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is an omnivorous fungal plant pathogen with an extremely broad host range capable of producing devastating losses in economically important food crops, including soybeans, dry beans, canola and potato among many others.  Over 400 species of plants are susceptible to this pathogen.  Currently, there are no adequate resistance strategies against Sclerotinia diseases (culturally or chemically) and breeding for resistance to this fungus has not been successful.  Annual losses of crops from diseases caused by S. sclerotiorum in the U.S. are in the multimillion dollar range.  The fact that Sclerotinia is aggressive, broad in its host range, poorly controlled and causes significant economical damage, coupled with the lack of resistant cultivars necessitates the development of alternative control strategies.  A molecular based mechanistic approach will be used in this project to understand why the fungus is so successful; in particular the project will examine the roles that reactive oxygen species and oxalic acid play as key modulators of fungal disease.  The project is supported by recent observations that demonstrated that fungal secreted oxalate induces a programmed cell death in the plant host and recapitulates S. sclerotiorum disease symptoms.  Similarly oxalic acid induces increased reactive oxygen species levels in the plant which correlate with, and are necessary for, programmed cell death and disease.   Results from these studies will provide information for alternative disease control strategies based on interference with these key fungal pathogenicity determinants.Broader Impact     The experiments described in this project offer broad and comprehensive training for students encompassing a number of fields. Current approaches include microbiology, plant pathology, plant biology, high throughput gene silencing screens, molecular biology and genetics. The mechanisms underlying fungal induced plant disease are both fundamental and of practical importance. This is particularly noteworthy since food safety, food contamination and food security are critically important issues nationally and internationally. This is compounded by  Sclerotinia diseases since control measures (genetic and chemical) are largely ineffective. This research program will provide a unique and interdisciplinary training opportunity for a graduate student, postdoctoral fellows, and undergraduate students to participate in a critical area of stress signalling and cell death regulation, while conceptually addressing broader conceptual ideas as to how this particular group of important plant pathogens achieves pathogenic success.

251,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).Polyploidy (whole genome duplication) is one of the most important genetic phenomena in plants. Immediately after its formation, a polyploid plant can be identified simply by counting its chromosomes, because it has twice as many as a diploid. However, after millions of years a polyploid may have as low a chromosome number as a diploid through a process called  diploidization.  Genomic studies can detect such cryptic polyploids, and the advent of high-throughput sequencing has made this approach increasingly feasible. Using this new technology, this project will estimate the frequency of polyploidy in the phaseoloid legumes, a group that includes soybean, common bean, cowpea, pigeonpea, and other less familiar crops, by sequencing thousands of transcribed genes from approximately 25 phylogenetically diverse species. Polyploid events will be identified by their characteristic signature, an excess of genes with two copies duplicated at the same time. The project has broad significance for genetics and systematics, given the importance of polyploidy as a genetic phenomenon, and also for agriculture, because polyploidy is so common among crop plants (e.g., soybean, wheat, maize, cotton). The large numbers of genes will be a resource for subsequent studies in this large and important lineage.

253,"0933249LandisBiofuels are currently derived from corn and soybeans in the US to make ethanol and biodiesel, respectively. While energy and greenhouse gas savings are realized, several significant tradeoffs have arisen including a) increase in food prices and b) a shift in environmental burden to impacts manifesting as eutrophication and hypoxia (i.e. the Dead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico). Cultivating biofuels on marginal lands may alleviate these problems and may serve to contribute additional environmental benefits in the form of soil remediation.The goal of the proposed research is to quantify the benefits of growing bioenergy crops on marginal lands. Throughout this project they will: (i) quantify on-site phytoremediation of biofuel crops, (ii) evaluate runoff related to biofuel crops, and (iii) compare the life cycle environmental impacts of biofuels grown on marginal lands to petroleum fuels and traditional biofuels (i.e. soy biodiesel, corn ethanol).The PIs at the University of Pittsburgh will partner with Alcoa Corp and a local nonprofit, GTECH Strategies, to form a unique collaboration. Alcoa Corp is involved in a mine reclamation demonstration at the Mather Mine site in PA. Alcoa is aiding in the evaluation of the use of alkaline clay to assist in reclamation. GTECH Strategies cultivates biofuel crops on vacant urban lands; their mission is to foster community growth in underserved communities through the creation of  egreen collar  jobs.This project is unique not only for Pennsylvania, but for the water resources, water quality, and biofuels research community at large. The findings of the proposed research will inform the research community about the life cycle environmental benefits of alternative uses for marginal and vacant lands, and will also contribute to the literature and understanding of phytoremediation. The findings of the life cycle assessment will also contribute to the ever growing and highly debated body of LCA research on biofuels.The proposed activities will have broad reaching impacts that serve the purpose of energy production, storm water management, nutrient management, water conservation, reclamation, and job creation in underserved communities.  The impacts of the proposed research extend from contribution to the scientific study of biofuel crops to community engagement and empowerment through the collaboration with GTECH Strategies. The proposed project will directly aid in the increase of job opportunities in environmental justice communities through GTECHs green job corps program and will foster the growth of GTECH as a sustainable nonprofit.

254,"PI: Min NiProposal number:  IOS-0919886Proposal Title:  SHB1 regulates seed development in Arabidopsis Double fertilization in angiosperms leads to the formation of a diploid embryo and a triploid endosperm. In Arabidopsis, seed development undergoes an initial phase of active endosperm proliferation followed by a second phase in which embryo grows rapidly at the expense of the endosperm. Since mature seed size is largely attained during the initial phase, seed size is coordinately regulated by the growth of the maternal ovule, the endosperm, and the embryo. The mechanisms underlying seed size control are still not well understood, yet seeds form the bulk of the diet of human population. The gene SHB1 is a positive regulator of Arabidopsis seed development that operates through regulation of both cell size and cell number. shb1-D, a gain-of-function allele, increases seed size and shb1, a loss-of-function allele, reduces seed size. The increase in seed size of shb1-D is associated with the timing of endosperm cellularization, enlargement of chalazal endosperm, and subsequent embryo development. SHB1 regulates the expression of the genes MINI3 and IKU2, which encode a WRKY transcription factor and an LRR receptor kinase respectively.  SHB1 associates with MINI3 and IKU2 promoters in vivo, and directly interacts with MINI3. The goal of this project is to test if SHB1 is recruited as a co-activator by a WRKY transcription factor to control gene expression required for endosperm development. Various cellular, biochemical, and molecular approaches will be used to investigate the interaction of SHB1 with MINI3 and the biological consequence of SHB1-MINI3 interaction. Understanding the mechanisms of seed size regulation has the potential to generate a potential increase in seed yield and a concomitant increase in the amount of protein and oil produced per seed.This project will provide excellent opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to gain significant research experiences, and most importantly, to develop their ability to critically analyze and solve scientific problems. Seed size is a yield trait that traditional plant breeding has limited success in improving. Seed development in major seed crops such as soybean and canola follows a very similar path to Arabidopsis. Enhancing the potential for large seed size represents one of the most promising and least explored avenues for generating a significant increase in agricultural yield.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
255,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).Rhizobia are bacteria that can live in soil, but also symbiotically, inside root nodules on plants like soybean or alfalfa.  Although many rhizobia provide their host plants with nitrogen, saving farmers billions in fertilizer costs, less beneficial strains cause problems in some areas.  Some hosts, including alfalfa and pea, make rhizobia swell up as they start to provide nitrogen.  Unlike the nonswollen rhizobia from soybean or cowpea nodules, swollen rhizobia apparently lose the ability to reproduce, but does rhizobial swelling somehow benefit the plant?  To find out, the investigators will map this trait on the family tree for crops and wild plants that host rhizobia, to see if causing swelling evolved more than once, suggesting a positive benefit to the plants.  Three dual-host rhizobia (plus mutants that differ in their ability to hoard resources) will be used to measure effects of rhizobial swelling on costs and benefits to the plants.  Plant defenses against rhizobia that provide little or no nitrogen, already demonstrated in soybean, will be tested in species that impose bacterial swelling.  This research will increase understanding of a symbiosis that supplies nitrogen to agricultural and natural ecosystems, with implications for other important symbioses.  Results could guide the development of crops that selectively enrich soils with the best rhizobia, decreasing future fertilizer requirements.

256,"The Brazilian government plans to pave the Santarem-Cuiaba highway (BR 163), the only road that traverses the Brazilian Amazon from south to north.  This decision has reignited competition for property rights in a region known for its ambiguous land-tenure system and long history of violent conflict over land and resources.  The impetus to pave the road is to facilitate the transport of soy harvests from the south of Brazil to the Amazon River for export.  In response to the promised paving initiatives, industrial soy farmers have moved into this region and are now competing with smallholders, commercial loggers, and ranchers for the best land near the road.  The Brazilian government has attempted to quell land conflict and facilitate sustainable development along the road in this  frontier  region by redrawing property lines through land reform, creating a new mosaic of conservation and resource extraction areas, and surveying rural property boundaries.  Conflict over property rights along the road persists, however.  This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate the ways that these efforts to impose a formal land-tenure system interact with practices of claiming land and defining property on the ground.  Through policy analysis, archival research, participatory mapping and ethnography, the doctoral candidate will examine the perspectives of actors from multiple interest groups involved in land conflict in order to understand how these different actors understand property rights and attempt to mobilize for and legitimize their claims to land.Debates about road building in the Amazon have tended to focus on the relationship between roads and deforestation, calling for improved governance in order to ameliorate the environmental effects of road building.  This research endeavors to broaden this discussion to address the complex social and political issues that can be obscured by a narrow focus on road building's environmental effects.  By exploring the complex system of governance that emerges through the intersection of formal law and actions of multiple actors with different interests, power relationships and regional imaginaries, the findings of this research are expected to demonstrate that the Amazon frontier is not simply a lawless place whose issues can be resolved through better legislation and monitoring. By exploring complex systems of governance in place and how they work, this study will contribute to debates about the relationship between formal state structures and informal economic, social, and political practices.  The project's results also will help to explain why efforts to address land-tenure issues in the region repeatedly fail, and they will shed light on the types of measures that might begin to alleviate the uneven effects of land conflict.

257,"Allopolyploidy (whole genome duplication following hybridization) is an important speciation mechanism in flowering plants; many crop species, including soybean (Glycine max), are polyploids. Allopolyploidy is known to lead to structural and regulatory changes that can result in morphological, physiological, and ecological novelty. There is considerable interest in ascertaining whether there are emergent properties ('rules') that could be responsible for the apparent success of so many allopolyploids. Glycine is an excellent model for addressing this question; among its approximately 30 species is a group of eight recently formed allotetraploid species uniting genomes from eight diploid progenitors in various combinations. Unlike any of the diploids, which are all confined to Australia, five of the eight allopolyploids have colonized islands of the Pacific Ocean, suggesting that they have a greater ecological breadth than their progenitors. Photoprotection - a set of mechanisms for dissipating potentially damaging excess light energy - is an adaptively important physiological process that could contribute to the success of Glycine allopolyploids. We are using a  next generation,  high-throughput sequencing method (Illumina) to obtain a deep and detailed profile of gene expression in three Glycine allopolyploid species and their diploid progenitors under normal light and high light stress conditions to assess which genes are involved in photoprotection, how they are regulated in diploids and polyploids, what the contribution of the two diploid progenitor genomes is at each of thousands of expressed genes in each polyploid, and whether there are shared patterns of gene expression in independently formed allopolyploids that could constitute predictable 'rules' governing photoprotection in polyploid species of Glycine and other flowering plants.

The specific objectives are to: 1) overlay diversity maps onto the soybean genome sequence using genomic clones from a set of phylogenetically informative Glycine species; 2) explore genome evolution in the genus Glycine at the chromosomal/sequence level to understand the polyploidy/diploidization cycle; 3) sequence targeted orthologous regions across the Glycine species in order to understand levels of linkage disequilibrium and genetic diversity that can be exploited for genetics and breeding; and 4) integrate data with other legumes which is necessary to extend its usefulness to other so-called  orphan  legumes such as common bean. The broader impacts of this project will be the development of an infrastructure that will be generally accessible by the broader legume community to exploit diversity and understand genome evolution in this economically important genus. The project will continue and expand a successful outreach program targeted toward Native American and Hispanic undergraduate institutions in the Southwest (primarily New Mexico and Arizona) to provide summer research training opportunities and further develop interactions with these faculty and students.  All project data and tools will be accessible though SoyBase at http://soybase.org/.  Sequence data will be deposited and accessible through GenBank and BAC clone resources will be maintained and distributed on a cost-recovery basis by the Arizona Genome Institute.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

263,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions are life saving in patients with surgical gastrointestinal diseases.  However, the use of PN in pediatric populations, especially premature infants, is frequently associated with liver injury that may ultimately result in liver failure that can lead to transplantation and/or death.  Studies suggest that soybean oil containing intravenous fat emulsions (IFE) may be a major contributing factor.  Recent experience suggests that discontinuing soybean based IFE and switching to a product comprised of omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oils (Omegaven) may be effective in reversing preexisting PN associated liver disease through a combination of factors, including improved triglyceride clearance coupled with anti-inflammatory properties.  In 2002, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) stated that 20,000 individuals in the US were supported by PN for intestinal failure and of these, approximately 30-60% of children develop hepatic dysfunction after receiving prolonged courses of PN.  This project plans to study 30 such pediatric patients over a 3 year period with preexisting liver disease due to PN use.  The primary aim is to assess the efficacy of the fish oil fat emulsion in reversing cholestasis due to PN use.  Using an open label study design, patients with PN cholestasis will have the conventional soybean oil lipid emulsion stopped and be treated with the fish oil based IFE.  Time to reversal of cholestasis of subjects treated with the fish oil will be compared to 60 similar subjects (contemporary historical controls) who continued to receive soybean based IFE after developing cholestasis.  Other hepatic, growth, and safety outcomes will be also assessed.  Based on preliminary results, it would be difficult to perform a prospective randomized trial with these patients.  Although the proposed study is not a randomized trial, it is thought that sufficient evidence could be generated that would result in FDA approval of an lFE such as Omegaven.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
264,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although essential, the use of parenteral nutrition (PN) in pediatric populations with surgical gastrointestinal diseases, especially premature infants, is frequently associated with hepatic dysfunction that may ultimately result in transplantation and/or death. Studies suggest that soybean oil containing intravenous fat emulsions (IFE) may be a major contributing factor.  Pilot data suggests that discontinuing soy based IFE and switching to a product comprised of omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) derived from fish oils may be effective in reversing preexisting PN associated liver disease through a combination of factors, including improved triglyceride clearance coupled with anti-inflammatory properties.  The applicant believes that fish oil based emulsions, besides treating this fatal condition, could prevent it.  This project plans to randomize in a double blind study 30 infants (< 3 months) with gastrointestinal disease at the start of their PN course to receive PN with a fish oil based emulsion (15 patients) or a the standard of care soybean based emulsion (15 patients).  Patients expected to be on PN at least 3 months will be enrolled over three years.  To evaluate effectiveness of this alternative IFE, conventional biochemical tests of hepatic function will be assessed and compared between the two study populations.  The primary outcome will be the proportion of children developing cholestasis over a three month period.  In addition to preventing the development of liver disease, it is hoped that the children will continue to grow at the same rate or better than if they were receiving the standard fat emulsion.  Other long term outcomes that will be evaluated include the frequency of inflammatory diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) that often occur in these critically ill infants.  The ultimate goal of this project is to demonstrate that fish oil based emulsions can be approved by the FDA for use in children dependent on PN to while recovering from surgical gastrointestinal diseases.

265,"Training Plan:  As a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), I am under the supervision of Dr. Rosalia C.M. Simmen, Ph.D., Senior Investigator at the Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center (ACNC) and Professor of Physiology and Biophysics at UAMS.  As a member of Dr. Simmen's research team, I am provided research training in molecular endocrinology and tumor biology to evaluate key regulators in the development and function of female reproductive tissues, particularly mammary gland.  Her laboratory's overall goal is to further understand the signal transduction pathways that affect these tissues' response to steroid hormones and growth factors during normal development and which may be compromised leading to abnormal development and carcinoma.  At the ACNC, I am training at one of only six centers in the USDA's National Human Nutrition Research Centers Program.  My proposed project provides the opportunity to support my training concerning important questions about the link between early effects of diet/nutrition on mammary gland development and breast cancer prevention.  My training plan integrates four aspects of my development as a breast cancer scientist/researcher: (1) The use of state-of-the-art research techniques (molecular, cellular, and genomics) and transgenic-mouse models of mammary tumorigenesis in an applied research setting; (2) Formal training in scientific writing and editing skills to aid in preparation and submission of my dissertation proposal, grant applications, manuscripts, and manuscript reviews; (3) Attendance and participation at annual meetings on breast cancer to present my research findings to the scientific community and breast cancer advocates; (4) Continuation and pursuit of collaborative interactions and feedback from my Graduate Supervisory Committee through the UAMS Breast Cancer Focus Group and attendance in cancer-related seminars at the UAMS Winthrop Rockefeller Cancer Institute.  Dr. Simmen and UAMS are committed to my training program.  This support has included receipt of a Graduate School Travel Award to present my findings at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (December 2008) and two grant awards through competitive intramural research programs to fund my studies on the tumor suppressors PTEN and p53 (November 2008 and December 2008).  After receiving my Ph.D., I will be highly qualified to obtain a postdoctoral position in breast cancer research to further prepare myself for an independent career in an academic environment where I will build on my research pertaining to breast cancer.  Research Plan:  Prevailing evidence supports a role of diet in decreasing the incidence of breast cancer.  Epidemiological studies show decreased incidence of the disease in Asian women whose intake of soy products is 10-20X higher than their American counterparts.  Among the soy products, the isoflavone genistein (GEN) is considered an important component for conferring tumor protection.  Although several human and animal studies demonstrated an association between early exposure (pre-pubertal) to soy/GEN and reduced risk of adult breast cancer, this association is tenuous in cases of limited exposure as adults.  Our group has demonstrated that dietary intake of soy protein isolate (SPI), the major protein form present in soy infant formula, decreased mammary tumor incidence and/or increased latency in SPI-fed rats relative to those fed the control diet casein (CAS), when exposed to chemical carcinogens that elicit tumors morphologically and molecularly similar to those of women with breast cancer.  Mechanistically, we showed that upregulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN and downregulation of the oncogenic Wnt-signaling in the mammary gland by SPI and GEN relative to CAS was coincident with enhanced mammary epithelial cell (MEC) differentiation.  These data suggest that increased MEC differentiation is a hallmark of mammary tumor protection by diet.  However, little is known about the mammary epithelial subpopulations that are targeted by dietary factors in MEC in vivo.  We suggest that tumor-initiating cells are targets of dietary factors, through their effects on PTEN signaling.  I hypothesize that early consumption of soy foods induces the PTEN network that targets the elimination of a subpopulation of mammary tumor-initiating cells to enhance epithelial differentiation and attenuate breast cancer risk.  Specific Aims and Study Design:  Aim 1 identifies GEN-induced, PTEN-dependent genes and signaling pathways that underlie mammary tumor protection.  I will conduct genome-wide expression profiling of control and GEN-treated human non-tumorigenic MEC grown in 3D cultures in the presence or absence of PTEN short hairpin (sh)-RNA.  I will then validate candidate genes by QPCR and use them to identify PTEN-mediated signaling pathways dysregulated in mammary tumorigenesis.  Aim 2 evaluates dietary effects on the population and self-renewal potential of mammary cancer stem cells from Wnt-1 transgenic (Tg) mice, which develop spontaneous tumors relevant to human disease.  Females will be fed CAS (control), SPI, and GEN starting at weaning (post-natal day 21) until study completion.  I will analyze the self-renewal potential of Thy1+CD24+- positive cells (by mammosphere assay) and their expression of PTEN-regulated genes (by QPCR) as a function of dietary exposure.  Findings will provide novel dietary strategies and tools to prevent breast cancer.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
266,"Background:  The ingestion of food antigens plays an essential role in the development of eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) as total removal of dietary antigens by using an amino acid-based oral formula improves clinical symptoms and esophageal histology in 98% of patients with EE within a month.  EE is thought to be mediated by both IgE and non-IgE mediated food allergy.  The majority of patients with EE (50-80%) are atopic based on the co-existence of EE with atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and/or asthma.  In addition, the vast majority of EE patients have food allergen specific IgE based on immediate hypersensitivity skin tests or measurement of allergen specific IgE in blood.  Approximately 75% of EE subjects had increased total IgE levels.  Approximately two thirds of children with EE have positive immediate hypersensitivity skin tests to at least one food allergen.  The mean number of positive food immediate hypersensitivity skin tests ranges from 3-6 positive tests per subject with EE.  The most common foods reported to be positive in EE by skin immediate hypersensitivity skin test included common food allergens (i.e. peanut, egg, milk, soy, wheat) as well as beans, rye, and beef.  Dietary therapy is considered an effective therapy in children diagnosed with EE.Objective/Hypothesis:  Although studies of the genetics of EE are in their infancy, the importance of genes to the development of EE has been demonstrated in studies showing an important association of EE with a SNP in the eotaxin-3 gene, a chemokine gene important to eosinophil chemotaxis into tissues such as the esophagus.  In this study, we are particularly interested in identifying genes in EE linked to a significant complication of EE namely esophageal stricture formation.  Esophageal stricture formation is a significant complication of EE resulting in food impactions and emergency room visits.  Thus, identifying genes which contribute to esophageal remodeling and esophageal stricture formation may lead to biomarkers to detect patients at risk of this complication, as well as potential novel therapies.Specific Aims:  The focus of the genetic studies in EE, we have proposed has two specific aims: 1)  Does expression of TGF-b and the TGF-b TT genotype promote the development of remodeling in EE? 2)  Does inhibition of AMCase reduce the development of eosinophilic inflammation, OVA food allergen specific IgE, and esophageal remodeling in egg induced EE ?Study Design:  We will characterize SNPs in two candidate genes of esophageal remodeling (TGF-b, acidic chitinase) in patients with EE (n= 200), as well as in controls (n= 200) matched for age, gender, and ethnic background.  Levels of esophageal remodeling and expression of TGF-b and acidic chitinase will be quantitated in esophageal biopsies.  The importance of TGF-b and acidic chitinase to the development of egg-induced remodeling of the esophagus will be studied in a mouse model in which either TGF-b signaling is inhibited or acidic chitinase activity is neutralized.Impact:  This study focuses on increasing our understanding of two genes associated with remodeling and stricture formation in the esophagus in EE.  If these genes contribute to esophageal remodeling and esophageal stricture formation, their identification may lead to biomarkers to detect patients at risk of this complication, as well as potential novel therapies.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
267,"Oomycete pathogens cause major crop diseases including potato late blight, sudden oak death, and soybean root and stem rot. These oomycete pathogens secrete effector proteins into plant cells, where they interfere with plants ability to activate defense to help establish disease.

The goal of this project is to use protein microarray-based technology to determine the function of 1440 oomycete effectors in a high throughput manner. The knowledge gained from the project will help to determine how these pathogens cause devastating diseases in plants.

Between control costs and crops losses, ECB has caused nearly $2 billion in losses each year. It is well known that the ECB consists of multiple population types that vary in a suite of fitness-related characters that determine patterns of gene exchange and outbreak dynamics in field populations. The work that we propose builds on our previous efforts to define the genetic structure of the ECB, and to map the genes that encode these ecologically-relevant phenotypes. Our immediate goal is to characterize the transcriptome of the ECB and to quantify gene transcript abundance. To accomplish this goal, we will use next-generation technology to sequence ECB transcriptomes derived from multiple tissues, developmental stages, and individuals differing in trait values.

269,"As the United States transitions from a petroleum- to a bio-based economy, the need for renewable and environmentally-friendly sources of industrial materials becomes imperative. This need can be met, in part, by oilseed crops, which offer sustainable platforms for the production of numerous industrial hydrocarbons. The potential of oilseeds for generating improved bio-based lubricants will be probed in this collaborative project. Metabolic engineering studies will be conducted to enhance the oxidative stability, lubricity, and high temperature durability of vegetable oils derived from oilseeds. This will be accomplished by altering the unsaturation and carbon chain-lengths of the component fatty acids and by producing different forms of wax ester-type lubricants. Additional studies will be conducted to evaluate the impact of these traits on the physiology, and agronomic properties of seeds. A key component of this research will be the use of Camelina sativa (camelina), an emerging oilseed crop in the Great Plains, as a production platform. Unlike other current US oilseeds (e.g., soybean), camelina has strong potential to serve as a dedicated industrial oil crop because it is not widely used for foods, which mitigates the risks of mixing food and non-food traits. Camelina is also adapted to lands and geographical regions that are marginal for corn and soybeans, the major US commodity crops. Moreover, from a metabolic engineering standpoint, camelina can be genetically transformed easily and rapidly, and tools exist for gene stacking and multi-gene co-expression. These numerous attributes of camelina will be tapped in the proposed studies to produce a range of eco-friendly lubricant functionalities in a sustainable, safe, and expedient manner. It is anticipated that the improved vegetable oils resulting from this work will be useful for manufacturers of bio-based lubricants. The genetically enhanced camelina resulting from these studies will also have potential for generating new sources of rural agricultural income for farmers and grain processors of the Great Plains states.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

In order for plant breeding to continue to make positive impacts, we need to adopt advanced technologies for cultivar improvement and ensure that sufficient numbers of students enter the field to meet the demand. Our project addresses both issues in a coordinated manner. The centerpiece of our project is the development of a freely available on-line plant breeding textbook that will be used directly in the beginning and advanced plant breeding courses at the University of Georgia.

271,"Nitrogen is an important nutrient for plant growth and is essential for the biosynthesis of proteins in both plants and animals. Use of nitrogenous fertilizers has both economic and environmental costs. A mutually beneficial association between leguminous (bean-family) plants and a group of nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria collectively called ?rhizobia? enables the use of atmospheric nitrogen by plants. This association results in root nodules where rhizobia bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen for use by the plants and obtain carbon in return. Biological nitrogen fixation in root nodules of agriculturally significant legumes such as soybean can alleviate the use of chemical fertilizers and therefore is of high significance to US agriculture. Understanding the process of root nodule development might enable us to enhance biological nitrogen fixation and/or utilization. The first step is to identify and characterize novel cellular components involved in nodule development. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of recently discovered regulatory RNAs whose role in nodule development is largely unknown. This project aims to identify and characterize the role of selected miRNAs in nodule development by examining when and where they are expressed, what happens if they are mis-expressed, which targets do these miRNAs regulate and what roles those specific targets play during nodule development.

273,"Heterotrimeric G-proteins consisting of alpha, beta and gamma &#61472;subunits are signal transducers in all eukaryotes. The repertoire of G-protein components in plants is relatively simple, with the presence of only two possible heterotrimers in Arabidopsis and rice, versus hundreds of possible trimeric combinations in animal systems. However the plant G-protein components are involved in diverse pathways including phytohormone signaling, cell division, ion channel regulation, environment sensing and biotic and abiotic stress responses of plants. These data have led to the hypothesis that the plant G-proteins integrate multiple signals to optimize overall growth and development under any given condition. Most of our knowledge of plant G-proteins comes from studies of gene knock-out mutants in Arabidopsis and a mutation in rice G alpha gene. Pharmacological evidence support the roles of G-proteins in soybean growth and development, defense response, nodulation and nitrogen fixation, however no biochemical or molecular-genetic data exist to date to validate these observations. Our analysis of soybean sequences has identified four G alpha, four G beta&#61472; and six putative G gamma subunits in its genome, predicting ninety-six possible heterotrimeric combinations and making it the most diverse G-protein network known to date in plants.

274,"Symbiotic bacteria (rhizobia) residing in the roots of legumes (alfalfa, peas, beans, lentils, soy, peanuts, etc.) are essential for these plants to grow and produce high yield crops. The bacteria role is to fix the nitrogen necessary for the legume host growth. To establish the symbiosis, the rhizobium must counter the plant defenses including toxic reactive oxygen species. The same molecules involved in plant defense also control the number of bacterial nodules and the extend of their productive useful life. The bacterial machinery that helps coping with the plant defenses is constituted mainly by secreted metallo-enzymes. Rhizobium species have an unusually large number of genes that code for metal transporting ATPases. These transport ions and heavy metals out of the bacteria. We hypothesize that these metal transporters are required to synthesize metal containing proteins essential for the interaction between rhizobia and plants. Consequently, these metal transporters would have a central role in the process of symbiosis likely affecting crop yields. This is relevant since pollutants such us cadmium, mercury, or nickel can easily inhibit these transporters. To study the roles of these enzymes we will use Sinorhizobium meliloti and alfalfa plants as experimental systems. The role of these proteins in nodulation and nitrogen fixation in alfalfa plants will accessed by measuring the plant growth and mass and the presence of these proteins in the bacteria during the plant growth. The metal transported by each particular protein will be determined using biochemical approaches. Finally, their role in metal loading of the secreted proteins and/or maintaining normal metal levels in the rhizobia will be established.

Common buckthorn invades natural areas where it directly reduces native biodiversity. In addition, it serves as the primary overwintering host of the exotic soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, allowing it to successfully overwinter in the north central U.S. Soybean aphid negatively impacts the production of soybean and vegetable crops by direct feeding and vectoring plant viruses. Moreover, the presence of soybean aphid has facilitated an increase in the exotic multi-colored Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis, leading to the decline of several native lady beetle species. Harmonia adults also invade homes where they cause human allergies. Our goal in this integrated project is to develop a fundamental quantitative understanding of the cascading impacts of this keystone invader on ecosystem function and services, and to develop economically and ecologically rational strategies for its management at landscape-scales. To accomplish this, we will investigate how the level of buckthorn infestation in the landscape influences soybean aphid immigration into soybean fields, secondary dispersal of soybean aphid between soybean fields, soybean aphid-vectored virus infection in vegetable crops and H. axyridis reproductive success.

The plant in turn sustains the bacteria by providing them carbon compounds. To enter into a symbiotic relationship, the soybean plant and bacteria participate in a series of complex signaling and developmental events between the two partners. This project is to purify and characterize a newly discovered chemical signal that Bradyrhizobium uses to communicate with itself and possibly with its plant host.

277,"Nitrogen (N) is a significant determinant of growth and development of plants. This project focuses on the importance of N partitioning and interacting metabolic processes for biomass and seed production in soybean (Glycine max). In contrast to most plant species that acquire N from the soil, soybean and other legumes are able to directly utilize N2 from the atmosphere and fix it in special organs (nodules) in the root. Thus, they can grow even in absence of N fertilization. Following fixation in soybean nodules, the N is reduced to allantoin that is translocated to leaves and then to seeds for embryo development and synthesis of storage compounds. Ultimately, biomass and seed production are dependent on these N transport processes. Using molecular, biochemical, cell-biological and physiological approaches we will examine proteins that are involved in transport of allantoin throughout the plant and determine their importance for plant productivity, seed yield and seed quality. We have isolated two allantoin transporters from soybean that will be studied with respect to their cellular function. We will further analyze plants repressing and overexpressing the transporters in soybean to elucidate their role in N partitioning and their significance for biomass production. We aim to dissect the consequences of manipulation of N transport on biochemical processes and pathways, especially carbon and N fixation, assimilation and metabolism.

278,"Non-food utilization of processing products of soybeans is an important problem facing the soybean processing industries in the United States. The price of a bushel of soybeans will be increased if microbial bioconversion processes can be developed for the production of industrially valuable chemicals from processing coproducts of this agricultural crop. During the production of soy biodiesel, a major product of the process is the generation of glycerol. Although the glycerol is of low value as a product, certain microorganisms can utilize the glycerol so that it can undergo bioconversion into specialty chemicals. In this project, the microbial bioconversion of glycerol into the specialty chemicals citric acid or 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde is being examined. Citric acid has a number of commercial applications and is used in foods, detergents and pharmaceuticals. Citric acid is most widely used in foods since it is generally regarded as a safe additive. The other specialty chemical being studied in this project is 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde. This aldehyde can be used in the synthesis of chemicals important to the production of plastics or as a food preservative. It has been shown that some species of yeast are capable of producing citric acid from glycerol. In this work, a strain of a citric acid-producing yeast species will be used. Although this strain is capable of citric acid production, one of the objectives of this work is to isolate mutants of this strain that produce more citric acid than normal. Similarly, it has previously been demonstrated that some bacterial species are able to produce 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde from glycerol. This project will utilize such a bacterial species. The second objective of this project is to isolate mutants of this bacterial species in an effort to elevate its capability in producing the aldehyde from glycerol. Once the yeast and bacterial mutants have been selected, an effort will be made to optimize the conditions that promote the formation of each specialty chemical from glycerol. By identifying the best conditions, it will be possible to develop a bioconversion process where high levels of each specialty chemical can be produced from the soy biodiesel-based glycerol. The isolation of microbial mutants that specifically overproduce the specialty chemicals on glycerol could make the bioconversion process more economically viable and this could lead to their large-scale production. A significant advantage of microbial bioconversion of specialty chemicals is that petroleum-based processes for specialty chemical production often use reagents harmful to the environment. The conversion of a soy biodiesel-based product to specialty chemicals by microorganisms is considered environmentally safe since the conversion does not generate toxic byproducts. This project proposes to develop microbial bioconversion processes that could represent new  green  chemistry methodologies.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

281,"The overall goal of the National Center for Soybean Biotechnology (NCSB) is to integrate genomics and breeding research to develop superior soybeans to benefit U.S. farmers in maintaining global competitiveness and expand utilization of the soybean crop. Soybean is the number-one oil seed crop in the U.S. with a value exceeding 30 billion dollars and has inherent benefits for agricultural production (e.g., biological nitrogen fixation) and documented health benefits (e.g., the anticancer benefits). Fundamental research in soybean genomics and biotechnology is the key to the development of superior soybeans to enhance U.S. farmer competitiveness in the global market and economic development in rural communities. Specific objectives of this project are: to investigate the genetic and molecular basis of drought tolerance in soybean and develop improved germplasm; to understand the molecular and genetic basis of plant resistance to SCN and develop improved germplasm; and to develop genomic resources and tools for gene discovery and improvement of soybean with stress tolerance, disease resistance and value-added seed traits. Basic understanding of the molecular and biochemical basis of regulation leads to improved opportunities for QTL analysis and transgenic screening, which opens up numerous vistas to develop assays and markers for drought tolerance and SCN resistance in soybean. NCSB will continue developing a deletion mutant resource for the analysis of gene functions. Utilizing deep sequencing technologies and identification of regulatory factors and molecular dissection of the biochemical networks will help NCSB scientists contribute to the production of soybeans with enhanced stress tolerance and value-added traits.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

In addition, because of recent economic factors (especially in energy prices) corn and soybeans, which historically have been of lower importance to the MS economy, have become more major economic contributors. The value of forestry is potentially increasing and yet, because the price of corn is historically high, the cost of feed for poultry and catfish is also. It is critical to help the MS economy and workforce that we focus on identifying genetic mechanisms of stress and disease resistance in these commodity crops that can be used increase production efficiency by decreasing the economic effects of climatic and disease stressors. Our objective is to provide innovative genomics and systems biology-based research solutions to address disease and climatic stressors in Mississippi's most valuable commodity crops. We will provide these solutions done by leveraging the investments made in genomic information, state-of-the-art bio-technologies and bio-computing.

284,"This project explores eco-physiological mechanisms affecting the abundance of pest species. It is based on the fact that all insects require sterols, and that plant-feeding insects typically obtain sterols from their food plants. Exploiting this need offers a novel, target-specific and environmentally friendly approach for controlling insect pests of agricultural crops. Currently there are few, specific strategies for controlling sap-feeding hemipteran pests. This proposal explores the potential of using plants with modified sterols. These sterols are not harmful to vertebrates (including humans), or parasitoids, but preliminary data indicate they are deleterious to sap-feeding hemipterans, particularly aphids. We have three objectives. The first is to identify sterols that negatively affect aphids. Here performance of green peach aphids reared on tobacco plants with modified sterols, and on artificial diets supplemented with various sterols, will be correlated with the profile of sterols consumed. Supplementary experiments will be conducted using soybean aphids and pea aphids. The second objective is to establish whether the modified sterols are deleterious for two major non-aphid hemipteran pests, whiteflies and tarnished plantbugs, by analysis of performance on modified tobacco plants. The final objective is to assess the range of hemipteran pests suitable for control by sterols by determining the sterol profile of some 20 additional hemipteran pest species, including glassy-winged sharpshooters and cotton fleahoppers. Our results will likely lead to the development of transgenic crops, containing modified sterols, needed to manage hemipteran crop pests.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
285,"Drought stress is the most important factor causing yield losses to farmers. In the next fifty years, this problem will get worse due to altered rainfall patterns and higher temperatures associated with global climate change. At the same time as drought stress will be becoming worse, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide [CO2] will rise. While drought reduces crop yields, elevated [CO2] increases yield by stimulating photosynthesis and reducing crop water use. Despite many studies on this topic over the last 20 years, the combined effects of drought and elevated [CO2] on soybean production are not well understood. In particular, more information is needed on which traits will maximize crop yields under future growing conditions. The objective of this project is to identify genes and processes which could be targets for biotech methods of crop improvement to maximize production under future conditions. This three-year project focuses on two processes. First, changes in root distribution at elevated [CO2] and the impact on the ability of crops to sense and respond to drying soil. Second, changes in leaf sugar content at elevated [CO2] and the impact on the ability of crops to tolerate becoming dehydrated. To accomplish this, soybeans will be grown under normal field conditions at the University of Illinois' SOYFACE facility. This 80-acre experimental field allows soybeans to be grown under normal production conditions, but at the elevated [CO2] and water availability predicted for 2050. We will study changes in soybean gene expression, biochemistry, physiology, and yield.

The significant losses of crop production to ozone have been recognized for 20 to 30 years, yet there has been little effort to improve crop responses to ozone through breeding or biotechnology. This is due to the difficulty in establishing reliable conditions to screen for ozone tolerance, given its spatial and temporal variability. This project will develop and characterize recombinant inbred lines of soybean, then expose them to elevated ozone at the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment facility, which allows crops to be grown at elevated ozone under field conditions. We previously studied the response of ~20 soybean genotypes to elevated ozone, and identified two cultivars with significant differences in seed yield response to ozone. These lines will be crossed and a population of recombinant inbred lines developed from them. We will genetically characterize each RIL with single nucleotide polymorphism markers and map loci within the soybean genome related to ozone response.

Maintaining the ability to produce goods and ecological services, under intensified practices with limited rainfall, will become more difficult. To better manage South Dakota's seed resources and associated productivity a better understanding of how climate and cultural practices interact to influence productivity and sustainability is essential. The hypothesis for this project is that novel genes and signaling pathways are activated in response to stress, manipulation of these genes and pathways will increase crop yields. The objectives are to: 1) identify naturally occurring genes and signaling and acclimation pathways activated in wheat and soybean seed development in response to a combination of drought, heat and water stress; 2) determine the whole plant adaptability and physiological responses to stress using genomic and basic research techniques; and 3) develop mechanistic-based mathematical equations that predict the impacts of water and temperature stress on soybean and wheat growth and development. Field, growth chamber, and greenhouse studies will be conducted. Genetic control and signaling pathways will be assessed using traditional phenotypic measurements as well as using molecular and genomic techniques for transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome responses.

288,"The detection of economically important plant pathogens is of paramount importance in Florida and the Caribbean region. Invasive pathogens are particularly grave threats, as exemplified by the recent establishment of the citrus canker, soybean rust, citrus greening, texas phoenix palm decline, and laurel wilt diseases in Florida. Accurate and rapid identification of such threats is fundamental to protecting agriculture in Florida, the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico. To meet this goal, diagnosticians will rely on the best tools and resources available. Among the most powerful tools are nucleic acid (NA)-based techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is rapid, specific and highly sensitive, and is frequently used to diagnose plant pathogens. PCR is limited, however, in that DNA from associated, non-target organisms, can confuse results, and host constituents can inhibit amplification of target (pathogen) DNA. PCR can also miss (not amplify) low concentrations of target DNA, especially if low titers of the pathogen are present. Dramatic improvements in the sensitive and reliable detection of microorganisms have been obtained recently with High-Fidelity PCR. High-Fidelity PCR was more sensitive than standard PCR in detecting the bacterium Wolbachia in its arthropod host, and in detecting the citrus greening bacterium in citrus leaves and the bodies of the psyllid vector. We improved the detection of an orchid leaf spot pathogen, Pseudocercospora odontoglossi, from 200 million copies of a gene with standard PCR to 207 copies of a gene with High-Fidelity PCR. The significance of these findings indicate that High-Fidelity PCR could detect as few as 207 individual cells of a pathogen, whereas standard PCR requires a minimum of 200 million individual cells for detection. The present study will 1) compare the sensitivity of High-Fidelity and the Standard PCR procedures by inoculating a range of ornamental plants with several fungal and bacterial pathogens and amplifying the target organism's DNA directly from plant tissue; 2) determine if the High-Fidelity PCR is more sensitive than the Standard PCR in detecting fungi, bacteria, phytoplasmas and viruses from naturally infected ornamental plant species; 3) determine if the High-Fidelity PCR is more efficient than the Standard PCR in detecting latent pathogens and determine if the Standard PCR produces false negatives, when the High-Fidelity PCR produces positives; 4) produce a molecular diagnostic training manual including protocols for diagnosticians at the University of Florida and the University of Puerto Rico. We present a novel PCR technique that can be used to detect and amplify plant pathogenic DNA directly from host tissue that is several orders of magnitude more sensitive than the Standard PCR.

289,"The recent commercialization of numerous transgenic versions of crop species has provided many opportunities for U.S. agriculture that benefit both the grower and consumer. Herbicide-tolerant and insect- and virus-resistant crops provide farmers with a wide range of managerial and financial opportunities. While the benefits to agriculture of transgenic crops are clear (e.g., reduced need for pesticides, greater profit margins, and reduced pest loads on other crop species), continued assessment of the potential ecological risks posed by the introduction of transgenes and strategies for the mitigation of these risks are needed to assure that genetic technologies provide safe and sustainable benefits for the U.S. consumer and protection of our natural habitats and biodiversity. Gene flow from cultivated to free-living taxa of Cucurbita (squash) is common and well-documented. In 1996, a transgenic cultivar was deregulated with resistance to three viral diseases. By 1999, several cultivars with the transgene were developed, marketed, and grown commercially throughout the US where it greatly reduced pesticide use and increased yield. It is likely that the transgene has been introduced to natural populations repeatedly. Non-transgenic free-living Cucurbita have long been recognized as an important weed in soybean and cotton fields in some locations. Further, free-living squash can serve as sources of herbivores and pathogens even when they are not in direct competition with crops. Whether introgression of the transgene into wild populations of Cucurbita will result in a more problematic weed for farmers or if it poses a threat to natural biodiversity depends upon the fitness of the introgressives bearing the transgene. We intend to develop a fully stochastic, individual based simulation model to predict changes in the frequency of the transgene from one generation to the next across a range of conditions. We then design key experiments to parameterize and refine the model. Specifically, we will perform a series of large scale, replicated, field experiments with the entire Cucurbita pathosystem that are designed to quantify the costs associated with the cultivar traits during introgression; quantify the direct costs of the transgene in the absence of the virus; estimate the indirect ecological costs of the transgene across a range of relevant environmental conditions; and quantify the transmission rate for both the virus and the bacterial pathogens across a range of environmental conditions. These studies will result in a fully parameterized and validated model that predicts the fate of an escaped transgene into free-living populations of Cucurbita. We will explore via simulations: A) the breadth of conditions that would favor the increase of the transgene in wild populations (useful for both monitoring and management); B) the rate of transgene introgression under repeated escape from cultivated varieties, and C) various management options for controlling transgenic plants should they become problematic.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Trans fats are linked to many health problems such as elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-Chol). Enzymatic interesterification of fats and oils can be used to produce suitable fats for margarine, spreads, and for frying without the use of hydrogenated fats that contain trans fats. Trans fatty acids are formed during the hydrogenation process (conversion of liquid oil to solid or semi-solid fat). Also, the American diet and breast milk of mothers contain very low levels of omega-3 fatty acids generally found in fish oil. Many individuals do not like the consumption of fatty fish such as salmon and tuna. Soybean oil has been genetically engineered to provide a sustainable plant source of omega-3 fatty acids (stearidonic acid, SDA) that are readily converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) found in fatty fish. Therefore, a plant based sustainable source of SDA that can easily convert to EPA will be cheaper than purified SDA and fish oil capsules for human consumption and further modification to add value as SL for mainstream and infant formula applications.

294,"With more than 629 million tons produced annually worldwide, wheat is one of the most important agricultural commodities (http://www.fao.org/corp/statistics/en/). In the U.S. over last half a century wheat yield has been constantly increasing due to improved agricultural practices and development of new genetically improved cultivars. However, genetic improvement of wheat still falls behind the other crops, such as soybean and corn, mostly because of the lack of support from industry. Public sector researchers are largely responsible for providing new varieties to U.S. farmers. To maintain the steady progress in developing new improved varieties wheat breeding programs need a broad array of genomic tools and resources. A dense set of molecular markers covering the entire wheat genome is a pre-requisite for the high-resolution genetic analysis of agronomically important traits and deployment of efficient breeding strategies in crops. This research grant is aimed at the development of a new generation of molecular markers based on single nucleotide mutations (also called single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) differentiating one wheat variety from another. These markers are extremely effective for low-cost high-throughput analysis of genetic variation in wheat germplasm. Abundance in the genome and the availability of cost- and labor-effective genotyping platforms made SNPs the marker of choice for many crops. However, due to complexity and the size of the wheat genome and the low level of genetic variation in cultivated germplasm, wheat has fallen behind in the availability of SNP marker resources. In this proposal, the new sequencing instruments will be used for SNP discovery in a panel of diverse US wheat cultivars; a set of SNP markers covering the entire wheat genome will be genetically mapped and used for studying the diversity of US cultivars. The long term project goal is to advance wheat research and breeding by developing genetic and genomic tools for efficient analysis of agronomic traits using high-resolution linkage and association mapping and deploying SNP markers in breeding applications. The project will collaborate with the national and international research and breeding programs to minimize the redundancy and maximize the utilization of existing and newly developed SNPs.

296,"Legumes represent the second most important family of crop plants. One of the defining features of legumes is their ability to form a root symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia. A significant property of the symbiosis is its host specificity, which is controlled at multiple levels involving both rhizobial and host genes. Understanding of the host genetic control mechanisms involved in determination of host specificity will enable breeding for enhanced nitrogen fixation in crop legumes and facilitate the study of the molecular ecology of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. A number of single dominant genes (e.g, Rj2, Rj4 and Rfg1) that restrict nodulation with specific rhizobial strains have been identified in soybean since 1960s. These dominant genes restrict nodulation through recognition of incompatible rhizobial strains, resembling those `gene-for-gene' interactions between plants and pathogens. The observation that the Rj2 allele is located within a disease resistance (R) gene cluster on the soybean linkage group J has led to the speculation that the dominant nodulation restriction genes may encode plant R proteins that play an important role in limiting the host range of rhizobia. The goal of this project is to map and clone the soybean genes Rj2 and Rfg1, taking advantage of the availability of genetic and genomic tools in soybean.

We will explore the potential to create effective mulches from pure preparations and mixes of shredded recycled newspaper and dried cover crop residues that can be grown on site. Our objective is to develop mulches using readily available materials and tools, that can be easily spread on the soil surface (i.e., around growing vegetables), and, which, after wetting, bond to themselves to create an impenetrable barrier against weeds. Shredded newspaper, when wetted, has been shown in previous research to have this tendency, but it is not known how to prepare a mulch to ensure that the mulch fragments will bond to each other, creating a solid barrier. We will determine the influence of different preparation methods on mulch cohesion including the width and length of mulch fragments and the amount and force of watering the mulch after it is spread on the soil. We will also determine if mixing shredded newspaper with plant residues that naturally suppress weeds through the release of chemicals that are toxic to germinating weeds (i.e., allelochemicals) increases weed control compared to newspaper alone. In addition, we will determine to what depth mulches need to be applied to control annual and perennial weeds that emerge from organs of different types and sizes (i.e., seeds, tubers, bulbs, etc.) so that appropriate mulch rates can be selected according to the types of weeds present. Mulches of different composition and with different physical characteristics can influence permeability to water and thus soil moisture, the spread of fungal spores to crop leaves through rain splash from the soil surface, and the availability of soil nutrients for crop growth as mulches are decomposed by soil microorganisms, which consumes nutrients. We will test the effect of mulches prepared from different materials on their overall effects on the growth of vegetables, including heirloom tomato, Edamame soybean, and sweet potato. These species have different growth habits (upright, trellised, or spreading), nutrient needs, and susceptibility to disease. Finally, we will do a budget analysis to determine the most cost-effective mulches, considering the costs of preparing, applying, and weeding (if needed) the mulches, and the expected return from crop sales. Our expected outcomes are 1) development of new sustainable, cost-effective, and user-friendly weed control strategies; 2) an improved scientific understanding of the physical characteristics required for a mulch to prevent weed emergence; and 3) the development of guidelines for the small farmer on how to prepare and apply mulches at a minimum cost to achieve good weed suppression and also build soil quality.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
298,"Soft red winter wheat is a critical component of a corn-soybean-wheat rotational system that is important for sustainable agriculture in the North Central region. However, the maintenance of wheat in the rotation is very cost-dependent. Hence, cost-effective pest management through IPM will be critical for sustainable wheat production in the North Central region. Foliar fungicides have been critical components of integrated disease management in wheat for many years and are usually recommended in integrated disease management programs to complement other strategies when conditions are favorable for disease development. Over the past few years, however, producers have increasingly resorted to prophylactic use of fungicides, an approach that is contrary to sound IPM principles. Foliar fungicides are increasingly being applied earlier than recommended, and at lower-than-recommended rates and application volumes. These practices, in addition to being harmful to humans and the environment, could lead to the development of fungicide resistance in pathogen populations, reducing the useful life of this valuable component of IPM. Many justifications have been given for resorting to non IPM-based approaches to foliar fungicide use in wheat, including the prospect of substantial yield increases due to enhanced plant performance and plant health, and the control of secondary diseases. However, none of these claims have been substantiated by replicated trials. In addition, Stakeholders and extension educators revealed that producers still struggle with correct wheat growth stage identification, disease diagnosis and quantification, and are uncertain as to value and relevance of existing foliar fungicide application thresholds. These are at the very core of IPM-based fungicide recommendations. Misdiagnosis and inaccurate disease quantification may lead to untimely and unnecessary use of fungicides. Current fungicide timing and thresholds are based on results from past studies conducted with older cultivars with lower yield potential and fungicides with modes of action and pre-harvest intervals that are different from those of currently recommended fungicides. We will conduct field experiments and extension programs to develop and disseminate new and updated wheat disease management guidelines. Emphasis will be placed on identification of foliar diseases and wheat growth stages and determination of economic fungicide decision thresholds. Genetic resistance with be used in combination with fungicides in inoculated (with Stagonospora leaf blight) and non-inoculated plots to generate disease epidemics of different intensities and corresponding grain yield responses. Models will be developed to estimate disease-related yield loss and to predict in-season yields. Parameters from yield loss and yield prediction models will be used in combination with fungicide efficacy data, application cost, and grain price to develop fungicide decision thresholds.

299,"Scientists at the Kansas Polymer Research Center (KPRC) at Pittsburg State University will create a novel range of chemicals from corn oil suitable for application in polymers in a new project for the Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Corn oil recovered from corn syrup (a by-product of ethanol production) is a lower grade vegetable oil unsuitable for food but is an extremely valuable source for a number of oleochemicals. The advantages of this oil are: (1) An abundant supply estimated to be several hundred thousand tons per year in the U.S. alone, (2) An extremely attractive price of about 1/4th the price of soybean oil, and (3) A favorable fatty acid composition that is rich in oleic acid. The objective of the project is to convert the corn oil to valuable chemicals and different polymeric products such as coatings, adhesives, elastomers, foams, plasticizers, and epoxy resins. The technology applied will involve the functionalization of corn oil by epoxidation and ozonolysis, followed by different chemical processes to obtain starting materials for a wide range of industrial and household products. Producing these products from renewable resources will help reduce the U.S. dependence on imported petroleum and create new markets for the nation's agricultural sector. The new chemicals could eventually replace more than 10 million barrels of petroleum per year. The industrial partner for the project is MGP Ingredients, Inc. of Atchison, Kansas, a long-time producer of ethanol for both food and fuel use, as well as a wide range of foods and food-additives.

300,"Agriculture is a very significant part of total revenues in states like Ohio. For a variety of industry and societal reasons, the number of independent operations is declining in states like Ohio. This is a clear indication that efforts are needed to try to enhance income by developing new methods of generating revenue. Short term prices for grain crops have increased due to increased demand for them as feedstocks for biofuels, but many continue to believe that value added crops remain viable long term solutions. Economists point to the fact that other similar events in the past have led to short term price increases, but market mechanisms have led to increased supplies and lower prices. Additionally, many feel strongly that alternatives to corn and soybeans, such as palm oil, canola oil, switchgrass, and perhaps even algal-based oils will take over as primary feedstocks for ethanol and biodiesel. A program such as this assists in eliminating some of the unknown components and risk involved with a new business start up or expansion effort into a newly developed technology. By experiencing some of the shortcomings through the research and demonstration phases, entrepreneurs are equipped to enter the market at an accelerated rate. Diminishing resources and limited financial support, as realized in recent months, impacts the small and medium sized businesses and further accentuates the benefits of such a program. Each of the major focus areas which will be pursued represents an opportunity to develop viable, economically significant value added programs in the Midwestern region of the nation.

301,"Agricultural production is an important part of Kentucky's economy, and tobacco has played a major role. Many of Kentucky's family farms have been highly dependent upon tobacco as a primary source of income. But the number of farms growing tobacco in Kentucky declined 72% from nearly 30,000 in 2002 to 8,112 in 2007. The market value of tobacco sold in Kentucky in 2008 was $382 million, down from $674 million in 2000. Many of Kentucky's farms are small, averaging 164 acres, compared to the U.S. average of 418 acres. There were 85,300 farms in the state in 2008. According to the 2007 census, 67 percent of all Kentucky farms sold less than $10,000 worth of agricultural products. Interest in alternative crops, including horticultural enterprises, has risen dramatically. This interest continues to increase because of the tobacco quota buyout. Horticultural crops offer Kentucky growers potential alternatives. A number of farms have successfully initiated commercial vegetable enterprises. Other farms are seeing the potential success of horticultural crops, but many lack the technical knowledge and management skills for immediate success with these production/marketing systems. Kentucky's grain producers are searching for ways to improve the market value of the crops they grow. Examples of potential specialty grain types include edamame (green vegetable soybean) and soft white winter wheat. An emphasis on bioenergy has increased the need for research on a variety of crops that have potential for energy production, including hulless barley, sweet sorghum, and biomass crops such as switchgrass. Growth in the organic food industry has led to a need for research on organic production of both horticultural and grains crops. This project is designed to develop and deliver Kentucky farmers the knowledge they need to assess new crop opportunities. Eleven horticulture and specialty grains projects will be conducted by researchers at the University of Kentucky as part of this overall New Crop Opportunities, KY, project. The New Crop Opportunities Center will feature a Web site for 24-hour access to information on new crops for Kentucky, including the horticultural and specialty grains crops that are the focus of the Center's research. Center staff will answer questions from Extension agents and farmers, and will distribute new crop information at field days and conferences. The Center will facilitate the packaging of information from its research and other sources for dissemination. The expected outcomes/impacts of this project will be an increase in knowledge among Kentucky farmers and county extension agents about production and marketing systems for a variety of new crops. This increase in knowledge should allow farmers to make informed decisions about which new crops to try, and how to market those crops, based on information available on the Center's research projects, as well as through its crop and marketing profiles. Anticipated benefits include greater profitability for Kentucky's farmers as they successfully transition to a variety of crops that are new to them.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
302,"This proposal seeks to continue some projects already begun and to initiate several others in The Pennsylvania State University's On-Farm Research (OFR) program. The proposed and recently initiated research will explore areas to improve sustainability of various production systems. Some will be organic, others will be conventional production. Several cover crop studies presently underway will be continued on several farms. They will be continued through the end of 2008, the termination date for a NE SARE Partnership project that was secured to provide additional support for this work. The focus of cover crop studies will be to reduce weed pressure on cash crops in the rotation and improve soil fertility. Increasing nitrogen production from legumes in an age of increasing energy costs will be a necessity. The OFR coordinator will continue to provide guidance to a county extension educator for a dairy feeding study begun in 2007. The focus of this effort is to demonstrate that through reducing the amount of protein fed lactating dairy cows, animal performance can be maintained and possibly improved while reducing the feeding cost of milking cows. The project is being conducted on ten farms. A Pennsylvania Soybean Promotion board funded project will be initiated during 2009 to develop a soybean network in PA of growers who seek to conduct their own on-farm evaluations. They employ some of the latest computerized planting and harvesting mapping capabilities. Coupled with aerial photography, these tools will aid in the identification of yield and profit-limiting factors in soybean production. Researchers from Penn State and Rodale Institute will continue a project that seeks more consistent performance for farmers who want to grow heavy cover crops and use the relatively new concept of crop rolling to control them. The OFR program is supporting this project through three on-farm sites in PA, NY, and MD. Proven and experimental practices/treatments will be utilized on these private farms to demonstrate the potential for this technology to reduce or eliminate the use of herbicide in a subsequent corn or soybean crop. The recent large increase in fertilizer prices, especially nitrogen, has prompted strong promotion of several products that are added to N fertilizer to reduce losses to volatilization and leaching. Two on-farm studies will be conducted during 2009 to complement one being conducted at the experiment station to quantify relative efficiencies of N utilization when urea is treated with commercially available products. A dairy cropping systems trial, supported by NE SARE, will commence during 2009 at the Agricultural Experiment Station at Penn State. Components of this study, overseen by the OFR program, will be tested on several smaller dairy farms. The OFR coordinator will assist project leaders in recruiting farmers to serve on a project advisory panel. Other areas of research are identified as the on-farm research coordinator continues to discuss production problems and possibilities for collaborative research with producers, county and state Cooperative Extension personnel, PASA organizers, and representatives of other agencies.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
303,"The management of stink bugs on all field crops currently relies on scouting and the use of insecticides. Frequency of insecticide applications to manage sucking bugs (stink bugs and plant bugs) in cotton has increased from 1/ha in 1992 to 3/ha in 2005. To reverse this trend in cotton and other crops, improved control strategies of stink bugs are needed, which require a better understanding of the ecology of the main stink bug species. This work will (1) provide key information on the ecology of the main stink bug pests and their natural enemies in the Southeast, and (2) evaluate a method for substantially reducing insecticide use to manage stink bugs in cotton, a major susceptible crop in the Southeast United States. To determine the qualitative and quantitative changes in populations at the spatial scale of the farmscape, both stink bugs and their natural enemies will be sampled on their main crop hosts (cotton, soybeans, corn, peanuts and wheat) and alternate host plants. A holistic approach to stink bug management is needed, as these insects develop on a sequence of hosts and crops throughout the season. The spatial and temporal dynamics of stink bugs and their natural enemies across the farmscape in both South Carolina and Georgia will be studied (objective 1), which will lead to improved sampling as a function of within field location and surrounding vegetation. GPS coordinates of fields and sampling locations will allow the use of geostatistical methods. A major concept of studying stink bugs at the farmscape scale is to consider simultaneously the source and sink effects of a variety of habitats and crops. The second objective will evaluate in-field border applications of insecticide in cotton to manage stink bugs. We know that stink bugs infest cotton fields from the edge first, and then move towards the interior of the field. Rather than applying insecticides over the entire field, applications will be made only for border populations upon first signs of damage, which may prevent the need to treat the entire field. Stink bug densities and associated injury to cotton bolls will be recorded throughout the season. The pesticide savings would be important from the perspective of reducing active ingredient applications, reduced time to make applications, and finally conserving natural enemies by not treating the entire field. The cost effectiveness of this management strategy will be assessed. This project will address two priority areas defined by the Southern Region Information Exchange Group for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (SERA003-IPM) in 2007: (1) Managing sucking bugs using ecological approaches, (2) Development of decision aids for management of pests for all crops. The objectives of this multistate proposal with an integrated approach fit well with the goal of the National IPM Program as presented in the IPM Road Map:  to improve the economic benefits of adopting IPM practices and to reduce potential risks to human health and the environment caused by the pests themselves or by the use of pest management practices.

304,"Soft red winter wheat is a critical component of a corn-soybean-wheat rotational system that is important for sustainable agriculture in the North Central region. However, the maintenance of wheat in the rotation is very cost-dependent. Hence, cost-effective pest management through IPM will be critical for sustainable wheat production in the North Central region. Foliar fungicides have been critical components of integrated disease management in wheat for many years and are usually recommended in integrated disease management programs to complement other strategies when conditions are favorable for disease development. Over the past few years, however, producers have increasingly resorted to prophylactic use of fungicides, an approach that is contrary to sound IPM principles. Foliar fungicides are increasingly being applied earlier than recommended, and at lower-than-recommended rates and application volumes. These practices, in addition to being harmful to humans and the environment, could lead to the development of fungicide resistance in pathogen populations, reducing the useful life of this valuable component of IPM. Many justifications have been given for resorting to non IPM-based approaches to foliar fungicide use in wheat, including the prospect of substantial yield increases due to enhanced plant performance and plant health, and the control of secondary diseases. However, none of these claims have been substantiated by replicated trials. In addition, Stakeholders and extension educators revealed that producers still struggle with correct wheat growth stage identification, disease diagnosis and quantification, and are uncertain as to value and relevance of existing foliar fungicide application thresholds. These are at the very core of IPM-based fungicide recommendations. Misdiagnosis and inaccurate disease quantification may lead to untimely and unnecessary use of fungicides. Current fungicide timing and thresholds are based on results from past studies conducted with older cultivars with lower yield potential and fungicides with modes of action and pre-harvest intervals that are different from those of currently recommended fungicides. We will conduct field experiments and extension programs to develop and disseminate new and updated wheat disease management guidelines. Emphasis will be placed on identification of foliar diseases and wheat growth stages and determination of economic fungicide decision thresholds. Genetic resistance with be used in combination with fungicides in inoculated (with Stagonospora leaf blight) and non-inoculated plots to generate disease epidemics of different intensities and corresponding grain yield responses. Models will be developed to estimate disease-related yield loss and to predict in-season yields. Parameters from yield loss and yield prediction models will be used in combination with fungicide efficacy data, application cost, and grain price to develop fungicide decision thresholds. Decision charts and an interacted web-based interface will be developed to enhance implementation of these thresholds.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Both issues concern agricultural producers and processors locally. Finally, the African and US field experiences are integrated with training in the new Community, Environment and Development major in the College of Agricultural Sciences at Penn State.

307,"Because of escalating petroleum and food prices, new processes are needed to convert soybeans into fuel and biobased products as well as food and feed through advanced soybean biorefineries. Extracting flaked soybeans with the organic solvent hexane is the most cost-effective oil-recovery method, the first step in biorefining; but, hexane is flammable and a neurotoxic and hazardous air pollutant. The EPA is enforcing new regulations to reduce hexane emissions. A promising alternative is Enzyme-assisted Aqueous Extraction Processing (EAEP) in which water is used as a separation medium and extrusion and/or enzymes are used to free the oil. EAEP has low capital costs and less safety and environmental issues compared to hexane-extraction and thereby enhances rural economic growth and the potential for soybean biorefineries to produce biobased products and biofuels. We envision replacing hexane-extraction with enzyme-assisted water-based  green and clean  technologies. These advanced processing methods should enable second-generation soybean biorefineries to more efficiently produce food, feed, biofuels and biobased products. The new soybean processing technologies should also integrate into today's dry-grind ethanol production facilities or soy protein production companies to reduce costs and produce more valuable co-products. More efficient utilization of corn as well as soybeans should result including less water use, improved feed and biobased products, more fuel and less stress on food supply when producing bioethanol.

ND is number one in US production of 10 crops - durum wheat and hard red spring wheat, barley, oats, flax, all dry edible beans, dry edible peas, lentils, sunflower, and canola - is third in sugar beet, fourth in potato, and ninth in soybean (ND Ag. Statistics No. 77, 2008). The value of all crops ranges from $ 4 to $ 6.5 billion/year (ND Ag. Statistics No. 77, 2008). Pest problems may severely impact yield and quality any given year, threatening the economy of the state and region, and export capacity. Examples: Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley resulted in several billion dollars loss to the state's economy from 1993-2005 (Nganje et. al., 2004; McMullen, 2005); other pests impact crops each year (Sugarbeet Research and Extension Report, http://www.sbreb.org; ND Crop and Pest Report (http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/aginfo/entomology/ndsucpr/index.htm). ND producers use pesticides as one management tool to combat pest outbreaks. For example, in 2004, 45.4% of cropland was sprayed with herbicides, 2.3% with insecticides, and 5.4% with fungicides (Pesticide Use and Pest Management Practices Survey in ND, 2004). This survey also showed that ND producers increased their use of IPM practices, such as use of field scouting and forecasting models, between 2000 and 2004 surveys.

311,"There is currently significant pressure on producers (through early decision programs that provide economic incentives for purchase of pesticides or technologies in advance of the growing season), to implement new pesticide-based technologies, such as pesticide seed treatments,  Plant Health  calendar sprays,and genetically modified crops, beyond their apparent need based on documented pest levels. This is not a question of pesticide efficacy but rather a true IPM question as to whether or not these treatments are needed. The same can be said for the use of fertilizers. We know from very recent data that our program can have an impact on these decisions. For example in our recent Corn/Soybean  Early Bird  meetings producers indicated on both corn and soybean, that they intended to decrease calendar fungicide application and increase scouting for fungicide applications, next season compared to this past season (Lee, unpublished data Nov. 2008). This type of change based primarily on increasing profitability is very important to all of Kentucky. We provide a single simple example as follows. Kentucky tourism generates about $10B/year. Much of this is based on/around our abundant lakes, rivers and streams. Kentucky has over 89,431 miles of rivers and streams and over 637,000 acres of wetlands; and anecdotally, Kentucky has more miles of free flowing stream bank than any other state in the US excepting Alaska. These tourism assets occupy the same rural/natural areas as our production agriculture. Contrastingly, ca. 76 % or our cropland is characterized by erosion concerns. As a single example, in 2005 Kentucky corn producers applied 210 M lbs of nitrogen, 75 M lbs. phosphate, 88 M lbs. potash, 3,187 K lbs. herbicides, and 26 K lbs. of insecticides on a 1,250,000 acre field corn crop. While these numbers alone do not prove a problem they certainly illustrate the potential for conflict to exist. UK-IPM strives to provide decision-making tools to help producers to determine IF inputs are needed and if so, WHAT, WHEN, and HOW to apply and retain them on the crop, and avoid their movement to untended areas.

317,"New options for both biofuel feedstocks and dairy feeds are needed. Recent instability and high petroleum prices have made this apparent in energy markets. This has also affected livestock feed markets as the price of food for the consumer as the shock waves created by the corn ethanol boom move through the economy. This project addresses both issues by adding value to an underutilized byproduct of a Pima cotton, a fiber crop. The majority of cottonseed produced in the US is used a dairy feed. Pima seed trades for $40-60 less a ton than upland cottonseed. Pima seed is undervalued because of lower feed quality and high gossypol levels. Pima cottonseed contains 14 million gallons of potential biofuel. Current oil production from cottonseed focuses on solvent-extracted food-grade oil from upland cottonseed. If oil extraction technology can be improved, Pima cottonseed can be used to produce an economically viable biofuel and a byproduct with improved feed value. Phase I funds will be used to prove the technical feasibility of using a novel process to produce an improved feed product and biofuel feedstock from Pima cottonseed. Small scale production runs will be used to optimize parameters to produce both a high quality dairy feed and a high quality biofuel feedstock.with gossypol reduction and high bypass protein levels. Several tons of feed will be produced in order to to conduct a lactating dairy cow feeding trial. A 3x3 Latin square feeding trial will be conducted using 24 high producing dairy cows fed either a soybean meal, whole upland cottonseed meal, high heat cottonseed meal to determine effect on milk yield and protein digestibility. Work will be performed under a CRADA (No.58-3k95-7-1192) between Eco-Sol and the USDA-ARS Southwestern Cotton Ginning Research Laboratory in New Mexico. This technology would improve the value of Pima cottonseed, provide the dairy industry with a moderately priced bypass protein from cottonseed with a reduced risk of gossypol toxicity, and develop a method to produce a low-cost biofuel from a crop which uses 50% of the water of corn.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
318,"This EIPM-CS COORDINATION proposal is in place to support the Virginia State IPM Program. Program staff includes an IPM Coordinator (Program Director), one Collaborator (Virginia State University), two departmental faculty (Co-PDs), and three Key Personnel. In Virginia, emerging and invasive infestations of insects, diseases, weeds, and nematodes result in significant crop losses every year. Some pests also pose health risks to humans, pets and livestock. The State IPM Program at Virginia Tech addresses this wide array of pest problems by developing practices that reduce commodity losses, the risk to human and animal health, and the reliance on chemical pest controls. The program currently saves Virginia homeowners, public school officials, growers, and nursery, landscape, and golf course managers millions of dollars annually. Continued success of the program is dependent on the capacity provided through federal funding. We will collaborate with VSU to assess pest management issues within public housing communities and develop a case for moving from the traditional scheduled pesticide applications to an IPM approach. We will address multiple objectives in six Emphasis Areas including IPM in Agronomic Crops (soybean, corn and orchardgrass), IPM in High Value/High Input or Intensively Managed Crops (apples, grapes, caneberries, tomato), IPM Support for Pest Diagnostic Facilities (the VT Plant Disease Clinic, Weed and Insect ID Labs), IPM on Recreational Lands (turfgrass, golf courses), Consumer/Urban IPM (red imported fire ant), and IPM Partnerships in Wide-Area Pest Monitoring and Reporting Systems (soybean rust, aphids, ipmPIPE interface).

319,"The crude oil will be depleted within 40 years, alternative fuels have to be developed to drive our transportation systems, and biodiesel appears to be the most promising fuel of the future. Biodiesel is renewable, non-toxic, and biodegradable, it can be used in existing diesel engines without modifying the engin, and can be blended in at any ratio with petroleum diesel. However, the development of biodiesel industry is severely limited by the supply of feedstock, namely soybean oil and canola oil. Due to limitation of available agriculture land and irrigation water supply, the production of these oil crops can not sustain the biodiesel production, other sources of plant oil have to be developed as feedstock for biodiesel. Microalgae are known to exhibit 10- to 20-fold higher growth rates than agricultural crop plants, and certain microalgal species can accumulate large amounts of lipids or oil (30-60% of dry weight). As a result, the concept of using microalgae as an alternative source of feedstock for biodiesel production was intensively studied in the past 40 years. However, the past research & development efforts have led to a conclusion that microalgae-based biodiesel was not economically viable because of high production cost. Such failure to develop a commercially viable microalgae-based biodiesel production system was largely due to the lack of cost-effective photobioreactors and efficient method for oil extraction from algae. In this SBIR project, we will demonstrate the feasibility of reducing the cost of using oil-rich green algae as feedstock for biodiesel production. We intend to optimize culture conditions for microalgal oil production in our proprietary photobioreactors. The feasibility of using innovative nano-materials for algal oil extraction will be demonstrated. The combined advantages from both improvements will enable use to reduce the overall cost in microalgal oil production. The results obtained from this Phase I project will provide a solid base for us to pursue a Phase II project, in which cost-effective production of microalgae-based oil will be demonstrated in pilot scale. The long-term goal of this project is to establish an environmentally sound, commercially feasible and economically profitable engineered process for commercial production of microalgae-based biodiesel. The successful completion of this project will lead to establishment of microalgae-based biodiesel production facilities, absorpton of atmospheric carbon dioxide by microalgae, and job creation/economical development in clean energy sector.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

However, the scientific foundation necessary to translate these epidemiological findings into dietary recommendations is weak. Research is needed to clarify specific health benefits of phytonutrients, to determine their bioavailability, to delineate rates of metabolism and elimination from the body, and to identify genetic differences among individuals that impact phytonutrient action in the body. This plan describes a five-year research project to investigate content, bioavailability, metabolism, and health benefits of selected phytonutrients. Studies will be conducted to determine the effect of postharvest processing on phytonutrient content. The initial focus of the postharvest studies will be leaf lettuce and tomatoes, and these studies will be expanded to include kale, spinach, swiss chard, and strawberries as funding is available. Several studies will be conducted to improve understanding of phytonutrient bioavailability and metabolism. The proposed focus of these studies is anthocyanins, building on previous work in our lab. Methods will be developed to isotopically label quercetin in lettuce and isoflavones in soy. These studies will expand our isotopic labeling program from carotenoids and anthocyanins to other phytonutrients.

The specific sub-objectives are to improve simulation of the above- and below-ground potato and corn processes in the areas of: (1) water and nutrient stress effects on growth, development, morphology, and yield, and (2) response of root growth and activity (water and nutrient uptake) to soil nutrients (N, P and K), and water.  The model and new components will be evaluated using experimental data.  The potato and corn models, along with a rye cover crop model and existing models for soybean and corn, will then be used for assessment of the environmental consequences of agricultural management practices on carbon sequestration and nutrient balances.  These practices include fertilizer applications, rotations, and cover crops.Approach:Mechanistic models for soybean (GLYCIM), cotton (GOSSYM), corn (MAIZSIM) and potato (SPUDSIM) have been developed in previous projects by this group. The proposed research will broaden the capabilities of the corn and potato models by utilizing data from experiments carried out in unique, state-of-the-art sun-lit growth chambers and field plots.

326,"Objective(s): Dietary factors may significantly impact long-term human health during adult life as a result of the influences on early developmental events.  Certain common dietary factors appear to be capable of affecting growth and development; transiently and permanently altering metabolism; influencing body composition; and preventing some diseases.  For example, fruits, vegetables, grains, and milk contain natural compounds (phytochemicals, peptides, and proteins) that can alter development, physiology, and metabolism, which can ultimately lead to disease prevention and phenotypic changes.  Additionally isoflavones are particularly concentrated in soybeans and can have many of the same actions as the major female hormones in women, the estrogens. Countries with regular consumption of large amounts of soy foods report lower incidence of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and obesity; and factors in soy (isoflavones and peptides) are postulated as being partially responsible. The objectives of our research include: 1) determine the effects of diet and physical activity in humans and animal models on development and organ function; 2) determine how early exposure to soy proteins and fruits confers resistance to chronic diseases such as mammary cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes in later adult life; 3) evaluate multiple molecular mechanisms and identify bioactive components for chronic disease prevention by diets using appropriate models as measured by tumor suppressors and oncogenes; oxidative modification; inflammation; immunomodulation; and insulin sensitivity; 4) examine consequences of early intake of combinations of foods (soy, fruits) on chronic disease prevention, organ development and signaling pathways, relative to dietary intake of a single food; 5) investigate the mechanisms of maternal obesity-induced fetal programming; 6) examine the impact of type and amount of dietary macronutrient components on development of obesity and associated metabolic sequence in an animal model of pediatric total enteral nutrition and in clinical studies; 7) identify the potential of dietary factors for mitigating risk of obesity via nutritional programming; and 8) determine the effects of genetic and epigenetic interactions with diet, nutritional status, weight gain, and behavior during gestation on placental and offspring development, health and susceptibility to chronic diseases, including obesity.  It is essential to ascertain the long-term health consequences, both positive and negative, of early consumption of these phytochemicals since it may impact a major segment of our American population.Approach:Studies will focus on the various dietary factors found in foods commonly consumed by children, such as infant formula, fruits, rice, milk, and soy, to determine their long-term health effects in infants and children.  We will analyze how the early exposure to protein sources and fruits normally consumed by infants and children prevents the initiation of and protects against chronic diseases by altering tissue differentiation, inflammation, and/or oxidative status. We will use animal models to mechanistically address the molecular and cellular pathways regulated by intake of various dietary factors (such as in soy foods, berries, grains and milk) in mammary tissue, aorta, liver, adipose tissue, pancreas, and skeletal muscle; identify tissue and serum biomarkers of healthy status associated with these diets; and provide new molecular targets and processes underlying chronic diseases that may be influenced by proper nutrition.  Additional work will be undertaken in an observational study of infants from birth to age 6 years, The Beginnings Study. Breast-fed, milk formula-fed, and soy formula-fed children are studied for growth, development, body composition, and metabolism.  In addition, bone development, and immune system development and function will be studied in children, and animal models will be utilized to explore molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of early dietary exposures.  The rat model will be used to understand the parental genetic transmission of the susceptibility to high fat feeding to future generations and underlying molecular, biochemical, and endocrine mechanisms, in the offspring.

The overlapping complex spectra will be interpreted using pattern recognition programs.  The patterns will be used to determine the sensitivity of the different detection systems for discriminating between plant materials based on genera, species, variety, growing year, growing site, and processing conditions.  These methods will be developed using 3 food materials and 3 botanical supplement materials.  Repeat samples will be examined over a period of years to determine the stability of the spectra and the ability to compare spectra of new materials to archived spectra.  The phenolic and vitamin content of the plant materials will also be determined using chromatographic profiling using LC-DAD-ESI/MS.  This will make it possible to determine which compounds are contributing most to differences arising from the various growing factors.Objective 3: The spectral fingerprints can be used with nested analysis of variance to determine the relative variance contributed by each growing factor: species, variety, site, year, plant-to-plant variation, and analytical uncertainty.  Samples will be obtained from collaborators across the country and representing a variety of foods and botanical supplements.  UV/Vis, IR, and NIR spectra will provide variance data for the integrated chemical composition of the plant materials and MS will provide variance data for specific masses and, with the assistance of chromatographic profiling, specific compounds of health interest.Temporary Approaches:Approach 1:  Submit names of individuals to the BHNRC with expertise to evaluate existing and future needs for evaluating food composition data arising from analysis in the laboratory.

333,"Objective(s): Objectives are: 1) Control off-target drift and enhance penetration of active ingredients, such as fungicides and biological control agents, into crop canopies; and 2) Develop remote sensing methods, utilize and evaluate Global Positioning Systems (GPS), develop methods amenable to rapid image processing, and evaluate flow control systems to support variable rate aerial application.  Approach:This project seeks to advance application technology through improvements in 1) drift management technology, 2) technologies for improved within-canopy deposition, 3) use of low-altitude remote sensing to identify stressed plants, and 4) performance of variable rate aerial application systems. While drift management is a concern for all pesticide applications, it is of particular concern for aerial applications.  The potential for drift is greater for aerial application due to higher altitudes of spray release and greater air turbulence in the wake of the aircraft.  Determination of optimal spray release height will be a goal, as the effect of this variable on within-canopy deposition and off-target drift has not been considered adequately.  Experiments for both drift and deposition will attempt to reduce confounding of treatment data with environmental effects, preserving statistical precision of the experiments. Penetration of sprayed material to the lower portions of the canopy is critical for control of fungal spore diseases like Asian Soybean Rust (ASR). Studies will compare nozzle types paired with carefully selected formulations and tank mixes for spray penetration.

336,"1. Giant ragweed is a summer annual weed which, left untreated, can grow to 15 feet tall. Giant ragweed becomes easily established and persists in some agricultural ecosystems, despite its relatively low seed production and short seed longevity. Giant ragweed is one of the most competitive annual weeds and can cause yield reductions up to 35% in corn and 50% in soybeans. It also can harbor insect pests such as common stalk borers and corn borers. Infested plants can be harder to control with herbicides like glyphosate than non-infested plants. This weed has not always been a problem for corn and soybean producers. In the 1960s and 1970s, giant ragweed was mostly found along drainage ditches, roadsides, and occasionally in fields along floodplains. It has since adapted to survive current farming practices of early planting and less tillage to become a major weed in corn and soybean production. Giant ragweed was rated in a 2004 Weed Survey as Indiana's most common weed, Indiana's most difficult to control weed and the most rapidly increasing weed in Indiana. 2. Corn and soybeans need to be kept free from weeds for a critical period of time to achieve maximum yield potential. Weeds that emerge before or after this critical period may not pose a threat to crop yield. The weed free period depends on the weeds present and may be as long as ten weeks for a hard to control weed like giant ragweed. Weeds that emerge with the crop compete with the young plants for nutrients, water, sunlight, and space. It is therefore critical that weeds that emerge with the crop be controlled for crop establishment and preservation of yield potential. 3. In 2007, Hoosier farmers planted 69,000 acres of popcorn and harvested 290 million pounds of popcorn. Popcorn is less adaptable to environmental extremes than is dent corn.

337,"Soybean aphid is a recently introduced insect from Asia that has forever changed how soybean is produced in North America. Prior to soybean aphid introduction in 2000, soybean was a crop that was rarely treated with insecticide, effectively making this crop a key untreated ecosystem in the landscape. This has now changed and it is not uncommon to have more than 50% of the soybean crop treated with one or more insecticide applications to control soybean aphid and to prevent devastating losses. Aphids in general and specifically soybean aphid are vectors of plant viruses. Virus can reduce yield, affect quality of the harvested fruit or tubers, and there is little that can be done to prevent viral epidemics. We have specifically focused on transmission of Potato Virus Y, a viral pathogen of potato and other crops that is readily transmitted by soybean aphid. One non-chemical approach to soybean aphid control is to allow natural enemies to control aphid outbreaks. We are focusing our efforts on understanding what situations favors control by natural enemies and what situations will natural enemies be overwhelmed. The best way to preserve natural enemies is to provide producers with reliable data on yield loss attributed to aphids and provide answers to questions like:  How many aphids are too many aphids? ,  Can predators, parasites and pathogens of aphids reliably control an aphid outbreak? ,  Are there safer alternatives when choosing an insecticide to use to control soybean aphid? ,  Will there be resistant soybean varieties that I can use available in the future? , and  If I plant a resistant soybean variety will aphids that can use this resistant variety develop?

338,"Crop legumes play a critical role in agriculture as important sources of nutritional protein and oil, forage for livestock animals, raw materials for biofuels, and beneficial compounds in human health. Legumes are also unique in their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, a property that is important both in plant nutrition and environmental quality. Nitrogen fixation results from a novel symbiotic relationship between legume roots and soil bacteria known as rhizobia. My lab is interested in the genes that control how legumes interact with other living organisms, both beneficial ones like symbiotic rhizobia as well as disease causing pathogens. Previously, we developed genetic mapping resources for locating and characterizing disease resistance genes, primarily in soybean. These resources have proven especially useful as tools for marker-assisted breeding. More recently, research in the lab has shifted to genome sequencing as a framework for gene discovery and the development of tools for genetic analysis and breeding. As part of this shift, we have focused on a model legume, Medicago truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa. Medicago exhibits typical legume biology but also has several characteristics that make it favorable for genetic analysis. This research has led to the nearly complete genome sequence for Medicago and the characterization of numerous symbiotic and disease resistance gene families. In the next few years, we will exploit genome sequence data in soybean and Medicago to discover new genes of agriculture importance and develop improved tools for legume improvement. Specifically, we will focus on sequence-based markers known as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that provide exceedingly powerful capacity to identify and isolate genes of interest. We will begin by discovering many thousands of SNP markers in M. truncatula and then translate this technology to alfalfa. In M. truncatula, we will use SNPs primarily to map and clone genes that control the capacity of legumes to form symbiotic relationships with rhizobial bacterial. In alfalfa, we will use SNP markers to develop enhanced disease and stress tolerance along with increased biomass. In soybean, large numbers of SNP have already been described. We will use these SNPs to create a large relational database that integrates the genetic marker data for Minnesota adapted germplasm together with results of field and greenhouse experiments. In the process, we will develop the capacity to identify pairs of soybean lines that are most favorable as parents for new breeding populations, as well as faster and more efficient markers for selecting disease resistant cultivars during the course of the breeding program.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
339,"Genome research has been demonstrated to provide new and powerful tools for accelerated plant genetic improvement and for enhanced productivity and effectiveness of crop production, and simultaneously address ecological concerns in agricultural production and utilization. The goals of this project are [1] to develop advanced genomic resources, infrastructure, technologies and tools for discovery, tagging and cloning of agronomic genes in crop plants, and [2] to use the tools and systems developed to identify and characterize the genes of agricultural importance and to advance the body of knowledge in crop genomics. In the previous period of this project, we have developed advanced genomic resources, infrastructure, technologies and tools essential for large-scale and high-throughput discovery, tagging and cloning of agronomic genes in most of major crops, including cotton, maize, soybean, rice and wheat. In this period of the project, we will focus our research on its second goal: Use the tools and systems that we developed to identify and characterize the genes of agricultural importance and to advance the body of knowledge in crop genomics. Particularly, we will develop integrated physical/genetic maps of turkey, chickpea, cotton and melon; develop tools and strategies to associate gene activities or expression with trait performance, thus crop yield and quality, in cotton and maize; further develop the DNA  Jigsaw Puzzle  structure model that we discovered previously, with which we expect to provide a deeper understanding of the abundance, diversity and complexity of living organisms using Arabidopsis, rice, yeast, and human as experimental models; and on the basis of the DNA  Jigsaw Puzzle  structure model, study the underlying molecular mechanisms of genome evolution using Gossypium, Oryza, Glycine, and birds (chicken and turkey) as experimental models. These experiments, once accomplished successfully, will not only provide powerful platform and  freeways  essential for advanced research of genomics, genetics and breeding in turkey, chickpea, cotton and melon, and allow identification of numerous genes that are involved in high-yield and high-quality maize grain and cotton fiber production, but importantly, will also provide novel molecular basis of the abundance, diversity and complexity of living organisms observed on earth, thus revolutionizing our current knowledge, concepts and strategies of genetics, genomics, breeding and medicine research.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
340,"The project will advance sustainability of agriculture through improving nutrient management in the production of crops. Predicting optimum nutrient requirements is crucial to accomplishing this goal. Economic constraints necessitate that both the luxury of over-application and the risk of under-application of nutrients be avoided. Societal concerns for water quality and other environmental issues highlight the importance of achieving maximum nutrient efficiency since unused nutrients are available for off-site contamination. This project will provide information needed to develop recommendation procedures that will help producers adjust their production practices for the situations on their farms. A number of nutrient and soils related concerns need to be addressed in order to keep recommendations up to date with current growing conditions. This project will address four of these. The first issue is the management of nitrogen to minimize nitrate leaching to ground water. Delivery of exact doses of N throughout the season still has technological and economic barriers. The second issue is the need to identify areas of low pH and increase soil pH to levels so that nutrients present will be available for effective use by crops. The third issue is the need to determine if phosphorus recommendation strategies used for 50 years are still relevant to yield levels and technology used today in corn production. The fourth issue is to address the need by organic farmers to have a cropping system that includes more crops than corn and soybeans and how to fertilize them without using commercial fertilizers. A series of experiments will be conducted to answer the specific objectives listed above. The intended impact of the research outlined in this project is to provide the information that allows producers to adopt management practices that more precisely determine the quantity of nutrients needed, minimize the potential for nitrogen to reach groundwater, improve the decision making process for when and where to apply phosphorus and lime, and facilitate the utilization of winter wheat in organic cropping systems.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
341,"From 2001-2003, an average of 7% to 15% of the major world crops (wheat, rice potatoes, maize and soybean) were lost due to diseases caused by fungi and bacteria. Monetary losses due to soilborne diseases in the U.S. are estimated to exceed $4 billion per year, and losses due to parasitic nematodes exceed $100 billion per year world wide. The cost of soilborne plant pathogens to society and the environment far exceeds the direct costs to growers and consumers. The use of chemical pesticides to control soilborne pathogens has caused significant changes in air and water quality, altered natural ecosystems resulting in direct and indirect affects on wildlife, and caused human health problems. For example, methyl bromide, a fumigant used to control soilborne diseases, has become notorious in recent years for contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer. Consumers are demanding plentiful low cost but safe food while simultaneously requiring the use of fewer chemical controls. From 2000 to 2005, the number of organic acres in the U.S. increased 128%, to around 4 million acres. Organically-grown crops require non-synthetic methods for management of diseases, and organic growers are seeking scientifically-based disease management methods. The recent spike in food prices due to increased demand and decreased supply further necessitate the development of sustainable methods of disease management.

343,"Seed oils provide food for human and animal consumption but also feedstocks for high energy transportation biofuels such as biodiesel or even jet fuels. However, the oil yield of currently grown seed oil crops such as canola, soybean, corn or sunflower is limited. Therefore, biofuels derived from temperate seed oil crops can only replace a small fraction of current transportation fuel needs without competing with the production of feed and food. Engineered plants that produce oils in tissues other than developing embryos have the potential to increase the oil yield per available land. Moreover engineering oil in vegetative tissues such as leaves, stems or roots enhances the energy density of potential fuel crops. The nature of the portfolio of biofuel crops or photosynthetic organisms that could be utilized for biofuel production is not yet defined. However, it is clear that potentially viable options aside from dedicated biofuel crops with novel properties include microalgal biomass enriched in oils (triacylglycerols). Unicellular microalgae species are known that have the propensity to produce and accumulate oil up to 60% of their cell mass. Knowledge and understanding of biological model systems coupled with recent advances in genetic and genomic technologies have opened a wealth of new possibilities. These new advances promise rapid progress towards the development of algal systems that could potentially produce oil on a scale that might soon supplement and possibly one day replace fossil high energy density liquid fuels. Algae have the potential advantage over conventional crops that they can be grown on marginal land not suitable for conventional agriculture. Thus, microalgal production systems do not compete with the production of food and feed using conventional crops. Moreover, algal culture systems are explored that can take advantage of flue gases emitted by coal-firing plants and waste streams of sewage treatment facilities. Because of the currently uncertain nature of biofuel feedstocks, it seems prudent to explore the potential of land based biofuel crops and microalgae in parallel. Both have the potential to transform agriculture as we currently know it and it seems likely that local solutions will require different feedstocks. The longterm goal of the proposed research is to gain a fundamental understanding of the regulation of oil biosynthesis in plants and algae. It is expected that this basic knowledge can be explored to engineer new biofuel crops and enhanced microalgal production strains in support of building a sustainable biofuel economy.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
344,"Research initiatives under this project contribute to enhancing profitability of agricultural firms, rural economies, abundance of food and fiber, and environmental quality by identifying profitable applications of emerging agricultural production technologies and regulatory policies that promote sustainable adoption. Technological innovation over the last century is responsible for a rapid increase in agricultural productivity and has resulted in abundant and affordable food and fiber. However, this innovation is also at least partially responsible for environmental degradation due to the increased farming intensity. New technologies based on recent advances in genetic and computer engineering promise to reduce the impact of production agriculture on the environment, while continuing to promote gains in agricultural productivity, but a variety of challenges threaten this promise. Genetically engineered crops have been widely adopted and resulted in significant benefits to farmers and the environment. However, insect and weed resistance threaten to erode these benefits. In some cases (e.g. Bt corn), regulatory agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency have successfully acted to promote the sustainable use of these crops. In other cases (e.g. herbicide tolerant soybean), little action has been taken to promote sustainability with adverse consequences now emerging. Advances in computer engineering have made it possible for farmers to use production inputs like fertilizer more efficiently and with fewer negative environmental impacts. However, farmers have been slow to take advantage of these technical improvements because of a lack of knowledge on how to use these technologies profitably. To ensure that these technical advances fulfill their promise, research is needed to help identify sustainable as well as profitable applications. Research is also needed to better understand when government action may be necessary to ensure sustainable adoption practices. The objectives of this project are to (i) evaluate the benefits and costs of current policies designed to promote the sustainable use of Bt corn and to explore possible improvements to these policies; (ii) identify and evaluate the benefits and costs of alternative strategies for promoting the sustainable use of herbicide tolerant crops; and (iii) determine the extent to which farmers can benefit from using soil test and topographical information to guide variable rate fertilizer applications in corn.

Field and greenhouse trials are used each year to evaluate the response of all soybean cultivars in the official University of Arkansas Soybean Variety Test. Since only one cultivar can be grown in any given field, this program has been particularly helpful to producers in selecting the most appropriate cultivars for their fields from the several hundred cultivars that are offered by industry each year. The impact of this program in providing science-based, independent evaluation of cultivar susceptibility to pathogens has significant potential to positively impact the profitability of individual soybean producers in Arkansas. Selection of a resistant cultivar costs no more than choosing a susceptible one, and the use of resistant cultivars appropriately could significantly decrease the approximate $100 million losses that our farmers experience each year.

346,"Arkansas has the largest share of the U.S. rice market, accounting for nearly one-half of total U.S. rice production. Many factors impact rice profitability. Domestic farm prices for rice are strongly related to world prices and reflect strong competition in a global market. Government payments play a major role in farm revenues and strongly impact the way rice producers manage their farm operations. Rice production costs are also large relative to other field crops like soybeans or corn and are greatly impacted by prices paid for fuel and fertilizer. The high costs of production for rice reduce producer profit margins and make rice producers largely dependent on government payments to achieve profitability. Rice has the largest water requirement of any row crop in eastern Arkansas. Most irrigation water is supplied by wells tapping into the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer, which underlies nearly all of eastern Arkansas. Large water withdrawals are placing strong downward pressure on this groundwater source. Water quality is also likely to impact Arkansas rice production decisions in the near future. Surface soils contain little organic matter and are comprised of silt and clay particles that are readily transported by runoff from tilled fields during heavy rainfall events. Sediment is the primary pollutant identified for most eastern Arkansas waterways, and practices like no-till are commonly recommended as remedial mechanisms. Producers have a wide range of management options to choose from, including using new rice varieties that are higher yielding or earlier maturing; using conservation tillage practices in place of conventional tillage; changing the rotation cropping sequence to include alternative crops like corn, wheat, or sorghum; improving irrigation efficiency with new irrigation technologies or land forming techniques; or investing in tail-water recovery pits and on-farm reservoirs to supplement groundwater with surface water. Arkansas rice producers have little information about the long-term profitability of management practices that preserve critical resources like land and water. The objective of this research project is to evaluate the long-term economic feasibility of alternative management practices to provide producers with viable options and insure the sustainability of rice and other agronomic crops grown in Arkansas. The results of the project should provide Arkansas farmers and farmland owners with relevant economic information for making better farm management decisions when important production resources like land and water are limiting. The results should also help guide research and extension professionals in the development of better crop management recommendations and should help policy makers better understand the impacts that alternative or competing government policies have on farm economic survival.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
347,"Over the last five years, both advances in biotechnology and the development of the Biofuels market have opened up new opportunities for farmers to plant crops that customers view as either higher value (for example, low linolenic soybeans, nutriceuticals and potentially corn traits designed for ethanol production) or lower value (examples include genetically modified organisms, dry distillers grain and soluble). In addition, farmers are being asked to provide more information about their products for a range of reasons: food safety as highlighted by recent food scares and the spinach case in particular, consumer preferences related to organic foods and non-GMO foods in the United States and in export markets, to name a few. Farmers and agribusinesses may benefit from the opportunities provided by changing customer demand, the new biofuels market and biotechnological advances, but this benefit depends on whether the buyer's valuation of the quality enhancements is larger than the cost to supply them. The proposed research projects on stored product protection, and organic dairy are designed to meet information and marketing needs of farmers and agribusiness managers. In a value-added supply chain, the additional returns accrue to the owner of the least elastically-supplied input, which is typically the processor. Thus, the farmer benefits minimally from producing inputs to value-added products. By understanding the process and product attributes that the processor values, this research will contribute to understanding the farmers opportunity to add value to the supply chain that cannot be extracted by the processor. Furthermore, the current relationship between processors and farmers is dominated by contracts. This relationship favors the processor since the processor writes the contract and offers it to the farmer on a take it or leave it basis. The farmers ability to benefit depends on their ability to evaluate whether the contract offers benefits to them relative to their other alternatives.

349,"Soil borne plant pathogens result in severe yield and economic losses for growers. Economic losses due to pathogens are estimated at 10-20% of the attainable yield for many crops. Yield failures resulting from acute diseases such as vascular wilts, take-all of cereals, Phymatotrichum root rot, Verticillium and Phytophthora may be even more severe. The soybean cyst nematode and Phytophthora stem and root rot are the most severe diseases of soybeans, and reduced yields by 7 million tons in the northern states during 1997 alone. For root diseases of mature crops, there are few effective and economical post-plant strategies for control. About 90% of the 2000 major diseases of the principal crops in the US were caused by soil borne plant pathogens. Monetary losses to soil borne diseases in the U.S. are estimated at >$4 billion/year, and losses due to parasitic nematodes at >$8 billion/year. Several of the top 15 restricted, invasive quarantine pathogens listed by APHIS are soil borne, and could represent a biosecurity risk. The cost of soil borne plant pathogens to society and the environment far exceeds the direct costs to growers and consumers. The use of chemical pesticides to control soil borne pathogens has caused significant changes in air and water quality, altered natural ecosystems resulting in direct and indirect effects on wildlife, and caused human health problems. For example, methyl bromide, a fumigant used to control soil borne diseases, has become notorious in recent years for depleting the ozone layer and changing the climate of our planet. The production and importation of this product is being banned, and is the subject of an intensive search for alternative methods. Many other chemicals are being removed from the market due to regulatory and public concerns. Additionally, plants evolved in the presence of microorganisms and are dependent on them in order to carry out many activities necessary for growth and reproduction. Thus, long-term chemical applications may permanently alter the microbial community structure sufficiently such that sustainable agriculture may be impossible. Methods to be used to address the issues at stake are described above, and continue from the diversity of research progress accomplished in 2008. Anticipated benefits of activities by WA State members include: multiple species of Pythium and Rhizoctonia can be quantified in soil using PCR technology, which will lead to better diagnostics; improving our understanding of the manner in which cropping systems affect species of Pythium, Rhizoctonia, and other fungi (abundance, population density, competition, etc.), will enable growers to implement more effective cropping systems for reducing losses to these pathogens; carryover inoculum from volunteer and weeds can be reduced by more appropriate herbicide sprayout timing before planting, reducing losses to specific soilborne pathogens; limestone amendments will be used in a more optimum strategy to reduce losses to Fusarium wilt in spinach seed production, which may enable spinach seed crop rotations to be reduced from 8-15 years to 5-8 years, potentially doubling spinach seed acreage in the US.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

352,"KS is the fifth largest producing state of all agricultural commodities in the nation. Crop production represents 28% of KS's agricultural product revenue, and the other 72% is derived primarily from livestock sales. KS produces the most wheat and grain sorghum of all other states, is the fifth leading state for forage production, is tenth for corn production, and eleventh for soybean production (USDA, 2007a). Crop production plays a significant role in KSAEs economy and our national food security. Crop production must remain economically and environmentally sustainable to maintain this important industry. Cropping systems research is required for meeting the increasing demand for agricultural commodities, increasing input costs coupled with historically stagnant commodity prices, and declining rural populations. It is inevitable that large regions of KS and the US will have to transition from full irrigation to limited irrigation or dryland production in the future, yet maintain or increase crop production to meet the ever increasing food, fiber, and bio-fuel demand (KS v. CO, 2001; Schneekloth et al. 1995). In order to maintain the viability of agriculture production, sustainable limited irrigation and dryland cropping systems must be developed. Dryland cropping systems in the semi-arid Great Plains rely on fallow for storing soil moisture for following crop (Anderson et al. 1999). Fallow efficiency has increased from about 19% in 1916 to 33% in 1975 to 40% currently (Greb 1979; Peterson et al. 1996). Fallow efficiency was increased by many factors including improved pest management, particularly effective and timely weed control; increased chemical fallow and no-till production; increasing stubble amount and height; and reduced fallow period length (Peterson et al. 1996; Tanaka and Aase, 1987). Of these factors, reducing the fallow period duration has had the greatest impact on increasing fallow efficiency (Peterson et al. 1996). Fallow efficiency is currently limited in the Great Plains by the amount of residue remaining on the soil after harvest, which averages approximately 3 ton/A for the region (Peterson et al. 1996). Since 2006 the price of many commodities including corn, wheat, and barley increased almost 100% due to a current short world supply and increased bio-fuel production. This has increased the demand for corn and at least in the short term has resulted in a large increase in price. There is a concern that the increase in corn price will result in feed costs that are too high for livestock producers and feedlots to remain economically profitable (Swanson, 2007).

This is particularly important since 72% of KSAEs agricultural economy is derived from livestock sales (USDA, 2007a).

353,"Current U.S. plans for energy security rely on the conversion of large acreages from food crop production to the production of cellulosic biomass in order to produce 86 billion gallons of biofuels thereby reducing our dependence on imported oil by 25% by 2025. Additionally, lands currently considered too marginal for intensive food production may be considered suitable for biofuel production bringing highly erodible, nutrient poor soils currently in conservation reserve programs back into intensive agriculture. In the Midwest, cropping systems may shift from the predominant corn - soybean base to a more varied array of species including novel perennial grasses for which little agronomic and environmental data exist. Optimizing nutrient use efficiency will be essential to mitigating the environmental damage associated with fertilizer production and application where improper management can result in nutrient runoff into lakes, river systems and oceans and production of greenhouse gases. Likewise, understanding crop water balance and optimizing water use efficiency will be essential to bioenergy crop success as water resources are expected to be the single, most-limiting factor in the multiple regions of the U.S. where biofuel production will be pursued. Sustainable biofuels production with the concomitant protection and improvement of air, soil and water resources requires a concerted effort by the scientific community to gain knowledge regarding the comparative energy production potentials and environmental impacts of candidate biofuel systems. We propose to conduct comparative analyses of the productivity potential and the environmental impacts of the most promising bioenergy crops and management systems at Purdue University's Water Quality Field Station (WQFS). Project team expertise combined with the unique WQFS capabilities for quantifying agriculture's environmental footprint will permit a quantitative assessment of candidate system net energy balance. The primary outcome of this research will be the establishment of a new, interdisciplinary research effort at Purdue University focused on the environmental consequences of the explosive growth in bioenergy crops.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
354,"Despite the fact that the by-product feed Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS) has been widely accepted in both ruminant and non-ruminant diets (namely swine and poultry), there is very little information available concerning its use in equine diets. The use of by-product feedstuffs in the equine has been primarily in an effort to reduce starch intake; therefore, preventing the problems associated with carbohydrate overload and hindgut acidosis. Horses evolved as hindgut fermenters and consequently are not physiologically designed to consume large amounts of carbohydrates. Likewise, modern feeding practices have forced horses to be meal feeders which are largely dependent upon cereal grains as a source of energy. In particular, in an effort to supply the equine athlete with its energy needs while at the same time limiting the incidences of carbohydrate overload, fibrous energy sources such as soybean hulls and sugar beet pulp have been added to the diet with much success. Furthermore, adding fat to the diet, often in the form of vegetable oil, has been shown to be beneficial as a highly digestible energy source. Opportunities exist to explore the possibilities for use of DDGS not only as a low starch energy source, but also as a high quality protein substitute for soybean meal.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
355,"Oats (Avena, sativa L.) are a vital grain and forage crop for South Dakota. According to the USDA's 2007 South Dakota Agricultural Statistics Service report, South Dakotans planted an average of 153,036 hectares between 2003 and 2007. Sixty-four thousand seven hundred and seventy seven hectares were harvested for grain and 88,259 hectares were harvested for forage. In South Dakota, oats are used mainly for feed, forage, companion crop, and/or straw. There are also several markets that lie beyond the borders of South Dakota, though. The racehorse feed industry is an integral out-of-state market. Specialty markets also exist in the form of bird feed, cover crops, forage oats, cosmetics, and antioxidants. In the past, millers considered South Dakota a viable source of oats when environmental conditions prevented optimal yield and quality from being achieved by Canadian growers. The devaluation of the dollar and rising transportation costs increases the potential for milling oats to be purchased from South Dakota. Beyond this, a number of factors indicate that oat production may increase significantly in the foreseeable future: Oats have exceeded $5.00 per bushel for March 2009 delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade. The current local price in the Brookings area is approximately $540 per metric ton. High corn and soybean prices have reduced oat hectares in the corn belt. A significant area of South Dakota is suited for small grain production. Oats are a multi-purpose, low input crop. Yield reductions caused by herbicide carryover have decreased through the increased use of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms). Minimum and no-till farming practices increases the need for a small grain crop to be included in the rotation scheme in order to help break disease and insect pest cycles. The livestock industry has expressed the need for a low-input grain and forage crop. South Dakota's location is in close proximity to the millers and racehorse markets. Cultural research with fungicides and fertility will promote an increase in production. Fungicide options allow the release of high performance lines previously rejected. Markets may evolve with diverse germplasm development. The SDSU oat program's primary strategy is to utilize resources efficiently while creating improved varieties. This will be accomplished by using conventional breeding methods, including modified bulk, mass selection, and single seed descent methods at different generation levels. Because plant breeding is based on probability, program success is increased by evaluating large numbers of diverse crosses, early generation populations, and derived lines. Early generation seed quality selection, disease screening, and generation advancement in the greenhouse cycles rapidly skew populations for desired grain quality and crown rust resistance. Subsequent yield trials of derived lines and seed increases result in varietal release. The value in dollars of a new variety is difficult to estimate. The value isn't limited to the producer, there is an additive effect from producer to ultimately the consumer. New varieties not only benefit South Dakota, surrounding states benefit as well.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
356,"Whether it is a result of accumulated years in soybean production, changes in cropping practices, or global climate change, the distribution and impact of native and established pests is increasing in soybean. The populations of soil pests and foliar and pod feeders are increasing in many regions. The distribution of other insects appears to be growing. Producers are encountering insect problems that they have never seen or managed. Changes in pest distribution and status require greater understanding of pest biology and movement, as well as the development or modification of scouting and control methods. Although pesticides are often the easy first tools used to deal with new or growing insect problems, long-term sustainable solutions must include host plant resistance and biological control. Outcomes/Impacts: Understanding insect population dynamics with relation to soybean development will increase precision in sampling and increase treatment effectiveness. The recommendations that result from better understanding of insect-soybean interactions and impacts on crop growth will significantly add to producer profitability by providing more precise decision-making tools and reducing unnecessary treatments. Refinement of economic thresholds for insect pests to account for resistant varieties and natural enemies can minimize both crop loss and unneeded input costs. An improved scientific understanding of effects of organic management tactics on soybean insect pest and natural enemy dynamics will allow producers to better chose and integrate control tactics. This will lead to a reduction in pest damage and yield loss, and thus more profitable production. The ability to predict pest outbreaks reduces risk to growers, allowing decisions to be made in advance of the field season. Such decisions include variety, insecticide and equipment purchases, and crop insurance protection. Risk reduction allows growers to better allocate resources and save money. Identifying new insecticides and efficient use of current products will save growers production costs. Judicious use of insecticides, based on sampling and thresholds, will avoid unnecessary applications, saving $10-$15 per acre depending on the product type, rate, and application cost. Early identification of insecticide resistance will allow for changes in management guidelines to slow resistance development. The introduction of resistant varieties will reduce grower inputs by protecting yield and reducing outputs for insecticides. As a further result of reducing insecticide use, resistant varieties will lessen human exposure and non-target impacts, and eliminate or slow the formation of insecticide resistance. Management of insects through the use of insect-resistant varieties may also manage plant viruses. Further, host plant resistance is highly compatible with biological, cultural and chemical control of pests, and as such is a key component of soybean IPM programs.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Production and use of biodiesel can significantly reduce net CO2 emissions compared to petroleum diesel. However, biodiesel produced from different oilseed crops (soybean or canola, for example) may vary significantly in the net effect on CO2 emissions because of large variation in their potential to sequester carbon in the soil. No other studies have accounted for soil carbon sequestration in assessing life cycle CO2 emission reductions with biodiesel, and a direct comparison of competing biodiesel feedstock crops has not been made with respect to net carbon emissions.

359,"Economic analysis is needed to understand current change in agriculture and to inform future policy-making. Factors buffeting U.S. agriculture include: rapid economic growth in populous countries; rapid rise in crude oil price; policy in large countries imposing rapid growth of biofuels; growing political support for reduced greenhouse gas emissions; rapid rise of grain and oilseed prics; rising food prices, and the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar. U.S. agriculture is experiencing major shocks in prices for grain and oilseeds and for feed, fuel and fertilizer. U.S. and international biofuels policy has sharply increased demand for corn, soybean oil, and other feedstocks for biofuels manufacture. Higher corn prices greatly increased feed cost for livestock and poultry producers. U.S. swine producers lost billions of dollars over the past year due to increased pork production and much higher feed costs. Reduced meat production will eventually increase prices of meat enough to cover higher costs. U.S. crop farmers enjoyed record net income in 2007 and farm land prices rose sharply in anticipation of higher rents. Rural developers aggressively promoted biofuels processing facilities. Almost all U.S. biofuels production is corn ethanol. Expansion of U.S. biofuels production after 2015 is mandated to be mostly ethanol from cellulose in biomass such as corn stover, grain straw, hay, and trees. North Carolina produces a small fraction of U.S. grains and oilseeds and is a net importer of corn and soybean meal to feed to feed poultry, pigs, cattle, and other livestock. North Carolina has a large forestry industry and large capacity to produce biomass. Research and development is underway in North Carolina to develop biomass, biofuels, and other renewable energy production. A vigorous and often heated debate is underway in the U.S. and internationally regarding the future of biofuels policy, the relationship between biofuels and food prices, and between biofuels and environmental effects including greenhouse gas emissions. Remarkably little economic analysis was published prior to the passage of U.S. laws in 2005 and 2007 that imposed rapidly increasing mandatory minimum levels of renewable fuels production and use in the United States (called the Renewable Fuels Standard or RFS) and that maintained tax credits for renewable fuels and import tariffs on ethanol. Recent economic analysis has produced preliminary estimates of the effects of the U.S. RFS, tax credits, and import tariffs on domestic food prices, domestic feed prices, and losses by livestock producers. The problem addressed by this project is the lack of comprehensive economic information regarding sustainable production of pigs, other biomass, and energy. This project will assemble data, synthesize previous literature, and assemble models of the costs and returns of producing biomass and biofuels, and models of the economic relationships among biomass, biofuels, livestock, feed, food, and policy.

360,"Two families of dsRNA viruses, Partitiviridae and Totiviridae, and the genus Endornavirus contain members that infect plants and fungi. In plant pathogenic fungi, these viruses can increase or decrease the virulence of the fungus but in plants they do not appear to cause disease. Whether plant partitiviruses, endornaviruses, or totiviruses can provide beneficial adaptative traits to plants such as pathogen tolerance or tolerance to extreme environmental conditions remains to be investigated. We have found a partitivirus and a totivirus infecting Jalape?o M pepper, and tomato respectively. Virus-free lines of the same cultivars were obtained after screening many Jalapeno pepper and tomato seedlings. In Louisiana two endornaviruses have been reported infecting Yolo Wonder pepper and two rice cultivars (M201 and Saturn). Although, there is no evidence that suggests that these endornaviruses of pepper and rice are pathogenic to these crops; because of the lack of virus-free lines, their host effect of these viruses is not known. Studies related to the effect of these dsRNA viruses on pathogen susceptibility and/or tolerance to extreme environmental conditions of their hosts needs to be investigated as well as their potential use as gene vector. Moreover, the presence of dsRNA viruses in  healthy  crop germplasm could affect international exchanges and sales of rice, tomato or pepper seed. Some fungi contain RNA viruses that have been shown to have potential as biocontrol agents.The best example of this is the hypovirulence caused by dsRNA viruses of Cryphonectria parasitica, the causal agent of chestnut blight. This raises the prospect of using viruses to treat or prevent fungal infections. Research on dsRNA viruses that infect plant pathogenic fungi is essential to determine the mechanisms involved in hypovirulence and therefore facilitate the development of biocontrol strategies. In Louisiana, a putative endornavirus has been found in the plant pathogenic fungus R. solani infecting soybean. Preliminary data suggest that this virus may be involved in the reduced virulence of some isolates of the fungus. The plants hosts for this fungus are economically important and the fungus causes important diseases of rice, cotton, and soybeans. Research on the effect of the putative endornavirus on R. solani should provide some insight into the biocontrol potential of this virus. The overall goal of this proposal is to isolate dsRNA viruses from plants and fungi, obtain the nucleotide sequence of selected isolates, perform phylogenetic studies, and conduct preliminary evaluations on their effect on the hosts. In the case of the research on dsRNA viruses of fungi, the long term goal is to develop biocontrol strategies for fungi infecting economically important crops in Louisiana. The long term goals for the investigations on plant dsRNA viruses are to utilize their potential beneficial effects to their plant hosts and/or use them as gene vectors.

361,"Econometric models are developed to determine the extent to which the trade between Latin American countries with trade agreements with U.S. and those without impact any gains from trade by U.S. Examples of the former are Central American Free Trade Agreement-Dominican Republic countries and the latter are countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and so on. These latter countries are major importing exporting countries in Latin America and they are economically and politically powerful. So the CAFTA-DR countries still find it important to trade with them despite their trade agreement with U.S. Due to this, trade economists contend that U.S. is not realizing the potential benefit from trade and these econometric models will help explain. There has been controversy among economists on whether the high level of exchange rate uncertainties are being observed in the world economy since the breakdown of the fixed exchange rates system and these have had a negative effect on international trade. The most common of these is reduced exports. When the domestic currency depreciates, the prices of goods imported into that country are expected to rise but prices of goods exported out of the country go down.

363,"Louisiana is a haven for diseases of soybean. Diseases that are considered to be minor in other states may be yield-limiting in Louisiana and other Mid Gulf states. Therefore, we must develop disease management and control strategies and tactics that may not be practiced elsewhere. This requires that we discover the basic knowledge regarding disease cycles and attempt to identify those aspects of the various disease cycles that are subject to manipulation. This may include altered fertility practices, fungicide applications at specific growth stages, selection for disease resistant varieties, use of certain maturity groups to escape diseases, and other practices. For example, we found that the addition of chloride in form of muriate of potash greatly reduces severity of Asian soybean rust and Cercospora leaf blight. Another example is our finding that spore production by the rust pathogen is virtually arrested at temperatures above 92 degrees F. Thus, we can alter our planting schedule and maturity groups so that plants are at their most susceptible stage during the warmest months. In addition, we must learn about the pathogens. What is their propensity for genetic shifts leading to more virulent strains, under what conditions do they reproduce, how far do spores spread, and other topics that may lead to new disease management tactics. Such studies may be conducted in growth chambers using detached leaves where environmental conditions can be precisely controlled, and the findings would then be verified with field experimentation. Genetic assessments of populations of pathogens would use molecular techniques such as DNA fingerprints to assess large collections of pathogens over several years from diverse locations. This would enable us to identify newly emerging strains that may supersede current strains and render current soybean varieties more susceptible. All of these studies are overlaid with economic considerations. For example, if a certain fungicide is identified as effective in disease control, but its application would cost more than the economic returns to be gained by the producer, then this disease control tactic would not be recommended. Addressing these very complex issues requires several years of field experimentation and validation. Outcomes and Impacts Change in knowledge: New knowledge will be discovered during the course of these investigations with regard to soybean diseases and the development of disease management and control practices for these diseases. Change in actions: It is anticipated that new disease control and management technologies will be discovered, tested and documented during the course of these investigations.

364,"Weed management has evolved considerably over the past decade with the advent of genetically modified herbicide tolerant crops. Upon introduction of glyphosate tolerant soybean in 1996, many predicted herbicide use would decrease significantly. Surprisingly that hasn't been the case rather herbicide use has remained constant at 72 million pounds active ingredient applied. Insecticide use in GM Bt crops in contrast decreased by 25-35% over the same period. I argue that the continued high level of herbicide reliance (in some crops ie. cotton, herbicide use continues to increase) has come as North American agriculture has leaned heavily on herbicide solutions to weed management problems rather than other more integrated approaches. As a result, the number of weeds evolving resistance to commonly used herbicides has increased sharply from 2 species prior to the advent of GM herbicide tolerant crops to 12 species with new species being listed annually. Clearly, the underlying ecology of how such practices select for adapted weedy populations deserves more attention than it currently receives. Research I've conducted over the past six years demonstrates that a landscape approach is required to provide an underlying ecological understanding and it almost certainly is needed to implement effective integrated weed management strategies. Once resistant populations have become established, how do they move from field to field, how will they best be managed, can area-wide weed management be effective at maintaining resistant weeds at relatively low abundances and at limiting their spread These are some of the questions my lab is poised to address. Interestingly, similar questions are being studied in my lab regarding the surprising success of a number of invasive plants in the region. Here again, a spatially explicit approach is needed to elucidate the factors regulating weed populations in less intensively managed ecosystems. In fact, the problem can be couched as one in which invasive genotypes or species are invading as a result of ecosystems that are made more invasible by agronomic practices on the one hand and by forest management practices that enhance dispersal on the other. In this Hatch project we will develop areas of common ground and study factors underlying the invasion success of glyphosate resistant weeds and of successful forest invaders. Fieldwork will be complemented with spatially explicit models written and adapted for each study system. Our goal is to use the results of ecological studies of invasive plant success to identify chokepoints in the population dynamics of these invasives to enlighten management of such problem species.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

366,"Environmental and societal impacts of fossil fuels and diminishing oil reserves around the world have highlighted the need for utilization of renewable energy from sources such as biomass, sun, and wind. Biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel made from biomass clean our air, support rural economies, and improve energy independence and balance of trade. In the US, corn is the primary feedstock for bioethanol production. Though the corn to ethanol process is well defined, utilization of corn for fuel results in increased corn prices for food and feed. Besides, converting all the corn produced would meet less than 10% of the fuel requirements of the nation. Alternative feedstocks such as lignocellulose including agricultural and forestry residues therefore need to be exploited. However, this requires development of more efficient technologies for enhancing pretreatment to reduce lignin and cellulose crystallinity, hydrolysis of carbohydrate components to sugar and fermentation of the sugars to ethanol. Like ethanol, biodiesel is better for the environment because it is made from renewable resources and has lower emissions compared to petroleum diesel. It is less toxic than table salt and biodegrades as fast as sugar. Although soybean oil is commonly used for biodiesel production other oils such as canola, cottonseed, and jatropha have shown potential. A typical biodiesel production reaction involves the use of toxic chemicals which lead to the production of hazardous waste. Using an enzyme (lipase) as the catalyst minimizes the need for hazardous chemicals but increases process cost and reaction time. However, immobilization of enzymes or utilization of whole lipase producing microbial cells as catalysts can make the process cost effective (Fukuda et al., 2001).Hence, this project will investigate conversion of lignocellulosic and fatty biomass to biofuels by studying the parameters that impact conversion.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Brownfield site is defined as a real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. New York State continually contends with off-site movement of brownfield soils. After cleanup, these sites can again become the powerful engines for economic vitality, jobs and community pride that they once were. There is heightened awareness that erosion from small individual sites within a watershed significantly contributes to pollution and sedimentation. A multitude of methods for erosion control are currently being used. These include natural recruitment of vegetation, seeding of native and introduced species, transplanting vegetation, mulching, fertilizer application, soil scarification, synthetic soil-enhancing amendments, application of mats or mulches, and the use of natural and synthetic geotextiles. Mulch technology is currently the most popular method, but suffers from several significant shortcomings including susceptibility to mechanical damage and loss of functionality when applied to an incline. Some soil stabilization and remediation and erosion control methods rely heavily on non-renewable, non-degradable (synthetic) fibers/fabrics/mats (geotextiles). They are mostly derived from petroleum, are expensive and rarely benefit agricultural producers' bottom lines. The potential for plant-based fibers/resins is myriad, e.g. fibers/resins for soil and seedbed stabilization; carriers of fertilizers, seeds, bioremediation organisms or chemicals, to name a very few. Plant-based fibers and resins offer several other benefits such as being environmentally benign, sustainable, yearly renewable, biodegradable, can be processed easily and hence offer economically viable and truly `green' solution. Thus the soil stabilization fibers/resins offer broad potential as a remediation and erosion control technology. We have sought out a novel and 'green' method of in situ spraying or extruding of soy protein fiber mats which will expedite bioremediation by reducing erosion, improving seedling stand establishment, enhancing soil properties, and protecting emerging vegetation from pests. The fibrous mats also allow for the controlled release of active ingredients. The technique also has broad potential for tailoring resin composition to function. For instance, soy resins are essentially biodegradable protein fertilizers that would be capable of carrying constituents such as bioremediation bacteria, selective herbicides, adsorbents, etc., all of which could facilitate stand establishment and thereby reduce off-site movement of contaminated soils into public waters.

368,"The development and spread of herbicide-resistant weeds, especially those resistant to glyphosate, is an acute concern in agronomic crops in Arkansas. Over the past 5 years, the existence of glyphosate-resistant horseweed (marestail), common and giant ragweed, johnsongrass, and Palmer amaranth have been confirmed. In rice, clomazone-resistant barnyardgrass was confirmed, and although glyphosate is not used in rice, even rice is subject to glyphosate- resistant weeds because of rotation with other crops. Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth is especially alarming because of its potential devastating impact on U.S. row-crop production. It has been estimated that if even 50% of the 169.4 million acres of the cotton, soybean, and corn crops in the U.S. become infested with glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth or hybrids, and assuming the additional management costs to cotton, soybean, and corn producers are the same as the $25.44/acre reported by cotton consultants in Arkansas, the annual cost to producers would be $2.15 billion. However, without the glyphosate technology, the environmental and economic benefits of conservation tillage systems will be in jeopardy. Therefore, Arkansas weed scientists are initiating field, greenhouse, and laboratory experiments to develop an understanding of how resistance evolves, how resistant weeds spread, and what recommendations for control of resistant species can be made that can be quickly implemented by producers. We need to determine what mechanisms in a plant allow it to have resistance to a herbicide and how long it takes that resistance to develop and how those weeds spread (e.g., by seed or pollen and by wind, water, equipment, animals, or distribution of crop products) and how quickly. It will also be important to determine the competitive ability, growth rates, emergence timing, and reproductive ability of the resistant weeds of a species (biotypes) compared with the susceptible biotype in order to recommend the most effective weed management plan. The resistance testing program in Arkansas is a valuable resource for producers to get confirmation of suspected resistant plants, level of resistance, and resistance to other herbicides. Its continuation is invaluable for answering questions about distribution and control of resistant weeds.

Oil from crops such as soybeans is the main substrate for biodiesel and can be an important source of renewable chemicals for the future. The basis of selective accumulation of specific fatty acids and the final synthesis of TAG in seed oil are not fully understood. Current evidence indicates that Acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the synthesis of most oilseed TAG. There are two classes of DGATs with no homology, DGAT1 and DGAT2. The goal of this research is a much improved understanding of seed oil biosynthesis in soybeans that should be applicable to other oilseeds. The objectives are 1.) A detailed analysis of the expression of DGATs during soybean and Arabidopsis seed development and in other tissues in relation to seed oil synthesis. 2.) The effects of inhibiting expression of DGATs in developing seeds on oil accumulation. 3.) Subcellular localization of DGATs in relation to TAG biosynthesis in developing seed cotyledons. To accomplish these, soybean DGAT2 gene(s) will be cloned and expression of DGAT transcripts will be determined by northern blotting and Real-time PCR will be performed.

373,"Biodiesel production is a fast-growing industry in the United States but is limited by the feedstock supply. The feedstock for commercial biodiesel production in the United States is predominately from pure vegetable oils such as soybean or canola oil. Currently, the biodiesel manufacturers are facing changelings of high prices of these feedstock. It is well-known that microalgae accumulate oils that are suitable for producing biodiesel. However, current algal biofuel production is facing several major limitations; i.e., the high cost of harvesting algal biomass from diluted culture solution, the contamination of undesired species, and the low oil yield from the algal cells. As a result, the technology is still not commercially viable. The algal culture process developed here is particularly designed to reduce the algal harvesting cost. This sytem allows for easy, high-density collection of algae, and thus reduces incurring the usual costs associated with traditional growth methods. The culture system can be run on a continuous basis, with biomass harvested periodically. After each time of harvest, the system does not need an extra step for algae inoculation again. It can be potentially used to produce large quantities of algal biomass for use as a feedstock, such as in the production of biodiesel.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

375,"International trade and competitive impacts stemming from changes in domestic agricultural and economic policies, combined with continued reforms in trade treaties and agreements, will be major factors influencing the continued competitiveness of the Southern agricultural sector. The Southern region is an important contributor to U.S. agricultural production, processing and exports. The region is the major supplier of cotton, peanuts, poultry, pecans, tobacco, cane sugar, rice, winter vegetables and citrus fruits and an important contributor to the production of grains, soybeans, feeder cattle, poultry, pork and dairy products. Addressing these issues is important for agricultural producers, policy makers, farm organization leaders, agribusiness firms, rural communities, and related constituencies in order for them to have the information necessary for informed decision making and policy design. To accomplish these goals, the supply response model for peanuts will be estimated to evaluate the impacts of the agricultural policies on U.S. peanuts and their competitiveness in global markets. In addition, a simulation model will be utilized to assess changes in U.S. domestic policies including macroeconomic factors on the economic viability and competitiveness on 19 U.S. representative peanut farms. Econometric, simulation and spatial equilibrium models will be used to address potential impacts from trade agreements. In addition, export demand models will be developed and estimated to analyze import behavior of peanuts in major importing countries. Important provisions from the DOHA round of WTO will be incorporated into the models to analyze potential impacts. Similar methods will be used to analyze the effects of regional and bilateral trade agreements on U.S. peanuts. The outcome of this research project is expected to have positive consequences for several groups associated with Southern agriculture. First, through the work of this project; producers and agribusinesses would have timely, reliable information on which to base crucial economic decisions.

Heterodera glycines, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), is the most important pest of soybean in the U.S. and a major constraint to production in Wisconsin. The SCN is not native to the U.S. Much is known about how SCN is spread, but little is known about the conditions, beyond the presence of a suitable host, that favor the introduction of SCN into a given habitat or the increase of population densities to damaging levels. This project will determine if the presence of root lesion nematodes, even more common in Wisconsin soybean fields than SCN, influences the establishment of colonist SCN and the population dynamics of established populations.

377,"The cost and demand for crude oil have greatly escalated within the last few years, once again requiring the need to exploit plants to find other alternatives to petroleum as the primary feedstock for the chemicals and fuels industry. In the US, ethanol is produced from corn grain. However, there is an urgent need to find an inexpensive and widely available source of biomass to avoid feedstock conflict with the prevalent food industry. In Louisiana, a person consumes on average 0.25 gallons of gasoline and 0.75 gallons of diesel fuel to support their daily activities. The challenge is how to support this large demand for fuel from a non-oil source. Lignocellulosic is a renewable source of biomass that is less costly than other feedstocks such as crude oil, corn kernels, soybean oil and natural gas based on energy content that can be used for sustainable production of the large volumes of liquid fuels historically favored by the transportation sector. In addition, lignocellulosic biomass does not compete with the food and animal feed industries. Progress has been made in overcoming many of the technical barriers for fuel production from lignocellulosic material, but process integration still remains to be done. By the end of 2008, corn-ethanol production in the United States will reach an estimated 11.4 billion gallons per year. President George W. Bush signed into law the  Energy Independence and Security Act  setting a national goal of replacing 30% of petroleum gasoline with liquid fuels (i.e. ethanol, butanol, biodiesel) derived from lignocellulosic materials by 2030. According to a report released by the USDA and DOE, the United States has the potential to produce more than 1.3 billion dry tons of lignocelluloses per year, including agricultural (933 million tons/year) and forest resources (368 million tons/year). Achieving this goal will depend on the ability to develop plants and production systems to generate sufficient biomass and to develop the necessary biorefining capabilities to make biomass conversion efficient and economically viable. This program will focus on improving, integrating and optimizing technologies in lignocellulosic pretreatment, hydrolysis and biological and chemical conversion. The expected benefits from the project will be (1) creation of significant new value added opportunities for Louisiana (2) generation of products for fuel replacement and specialty chemicals that reduce National dependence on foreign oil and the need for petrochemical feedstocks from a diminishing natural resource (3) an opportunity to showcase the impact of science and technology in expanding Louisiana economic base and (4) environmental benefits arising from the use of renewable resources as feedstocks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

383,"In the panhandle of Florida and in north Florida, peanut is a major crop. An average of 142,000 acres is planted and about 131,000 acres are harvested each year (USDA NASS, 2008). The farm gate value of peanuts in Florida averages about $60 million annually. In the southeastern states of Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi, where about 70% of US peanuts are grown, the farm gate value is about $480 million annually. Unlike many traditional crops such as soybean, corn, or cotton, for which private companies develop and deploy the majority of cultivars grown by farmers, the majority of peanut cultivars are bred and developed by public sector universities and the USDA. Improved cultivars are essential to the future competitiveness of the peanut industry. New cultivars with improved disease resistance can help to reduce the nearly $70 per acre spent to control fungal diseases in addition to increasing pod yield. For 88 years, the peanut breeding program of the University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences has served the southeastern peanut industry by providing improved cultivars, germplasm and knowledge. University of Florida-IFAS cultivars with improved disease resistance are used throughout the southeastern US and have contributed to the development of cultivars by other Universities and the USDA.

384,"Nematodes are very important pathogens of most agronomic and horticultural crops produced in Florida. The state has both an ideal environment and suitable hosts for most of the major plant-pathogenic nematodes. Nematode life cycles are short thereby enabling them to generate multiple generations within a cropping season resulting in large population densities in a short period of time. Without doubt, some of the most severe crop damage that occurs in Florida is a result of plant-pathogenic nematodes. Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are among the most important soilborne pathogens in Florida. There are currently 14 species of Meloidogyne known to be present in the state. Many crops are subjected to parasitism by more than one species including most , e.g. solanaceous, cucurbits, and crucifer vegetable crops, as well as cotton, peanut, soybean, tobacco, field corn, and many leguminous forages and cover crops. The sting nematode (Belonolaimus longicaudatus)is a very damaging pathogen of cole crops, strawberry, soybean, cotton, field corn, sorghum, sesbania, turf grasses, and many other grasses including digitgrass, Bermudagrass, and limpograss. Other important nematodes with wide host ranges include stubby root (Paratrichodorus and Trichodorus spp.), lesion (Pratylenchus spp.), lance (Hoplolaimus spp.), awl (Dolichodorus spp.), and ring (Criconemella spp.). In cotton, the reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis) has become a widespread problem in Florida. Estimated statewide losses from nematodes include: vegetables (strawberry, snap bean, sweet corn) 10%; soybean 9%; sugarcane 4%; potato 10%; field corn 15%; peanut 15%; tobacco 4%; and cotton 7%. In local situations, nematode damage can be completely devastating in individual grower plantings of many crops, e. g., squash, cucumber, eggplant, pepper, strawberry, okra, and peanut. Crop losses from nematodes are further compounded by nematode and soilborne disease complexes such as Verticillium wilt, Fusarium wilt, and bacterial wilt. It must be emphasized that losses on most agricultural crops would be many-fold higher if it were not for nematode management programs already in existence. For example, nearly 100% of tomato, pepper, eggplant, melon and strawberry plantings are treated annually with multipurpose-soil fumigants. Almost all soybean cultivars grown in Florida are root-knot and cyst nematode resistant. Production costs for most agricultural crops are rapidly rising. This has become particularly important recently since many agricultural inputs are petroleum-based. Hence, there is a continuing need to maximize crop production by reducing the influence of factors that limit yields. Also, greater emphasis is being placed on environmental issues regarding agricultural production. This has encouraged widespread support for developing agricultural practices designed to preserve and enhance environmentally-sound and sustainable methods for managing plant-pathogenic nematodes.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

386,"Plant biotechnology has had a tremendous impact on crop production in the US, as well as world-wide (Brookes and Barfoot, 2006). The percent of transgenic acreage of major crops in the US is very high, with transgenics contributing 52% of maize, 79% of cotton, 82% of canola and 93% of soybeans. This shows remarkable acceptance of this technology, considering the first introduction of transgenics occurred in 1994. As presented above, transgenic plants can have economic utility themselves but they can also be used to study the basic mechanisms and factors which control plant growth and development. In order to use biotechnology for either basic or applied research, the behavior of the introduced gene must be understood and controllable. Although introduced DNA sequences can be very complex and involve multiple elements, the three main components of most genes are the promoter, coding region and terminator. The coding region encodes for the actual gene product while the promoter directs the induction of gene expression and the terminator signals its cessation. Promoters control the temporal, spatial, and environmental expression of a gene, or any combination thereof. Only a few promoters have been fully characterized to the extent that predicable, reliable and consistent expression would merit their use for plant genetic engineering. Unfortunately, promoters are the least characterized component of genes. For every coding region and therefore for every gene, there is a promoter. So, there is no shortage of promoters for study. Although the complete sequence information is available for many plants, promoters regions remain difficult to identify, based on lack of identified consensus sequences. Transcriptional and translational start sequences can be more easily identified using a variety of scanning programs and promoter regions are clearly located upstream of these sites. But, identification of the specific sequence that can be identified as a promoter, relies on trial and error. Basically, different sized DNA fragments, taken from areas directly upstream of the transcriptional start site of the gene, are isolated, fused to reporter genes, and then reintroduced into tissues, where expression can be observed. Often, partial sequences of the promoters show some activity, while longer sequences can show more tissue-specificity and either more or less activity. In simple terms, the components of the promoter that contribute to the ability of promoters to tightly regulate gene expression are the regulatory  promoter elements . Elements are typically short sequences of DNA that can positively or negatively regulate gene expression. They are interspersed throughout the promoter region and act as attractant signals for specific factors that bind to the DNA to regulate gene expression. Unique combinations of these elements lead to the tight regulation of gene expression observed in most living organisms.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
387,"Wheat is an important component of California agriculture. Wheat is an exceedingly important crop nationally, ranking the third after maize and soybean in economical importance. On the global scale, wheat is one of two crops that feed the largest number of people. Wheat also provides 20% of the total protein in the human diet. In light of the significance of wheat for the economy of California and this country, it is important that US wheat breeders continue improving wheat yield potential and its stability and the nutritional and technological quality of wheat flour. Wheat wild relatives possess resistance to every wheat disease and exceptional levels of tolerance of frost, heat, drought, and mineral deficiencies and excesses. It is highly desirable to exploit this potential of wild relatives of wheat for the improvement of wheat cultivars. There are two problems that currently limit the practical utilization of this genetic resource. Genetic bases of most of the economically important traits are poorly understood or entirely unknown and the foreign genes cannot be easily incorporated into wheat by the traditional breeding methods. Both these limitations are addressed in this project. Domesticated wheat was crossed with wild wheat and the genetic foundations of differences between domesticated and wild wheat will be determined. A gene was discovered in a wild relative of wheat that holds promise to facilitate the incorporation of foreign genes into wheat by otherwise traditional breeding methods.

388,"Declining supplies of fossil energy resources and adverse impacts of fossil energy uses on the global environment have prompted strong interests in renewable energy. A wide array of renewable energy technologies is being researched. Among them are biomass-based energy technologies such as processes converting corn to ethanol, soybean to biodiesel, lignocellulosics to bioethanol or biooils, etc. Rising food price has caused serious concerns over corn to bioethanol and soybean to biodiesel approaches. Increasing attentions are drawn to conversion of lignocellulosics to biofuels such as ethanol, bio-oils, and syngas. Thermochemical conversion processes are an attractive way to produce liquid fuels from solid biomass feedstock. Like all other renewable technologies, thermochemical conversion of biomass is facing many technical challenges. For example, the liquid fuels produced from pyrolysis of biomass are complex in chemical composition and highly unstable in terms of physical consistency, chemical properties, and combustion characteristics, seriously limiting the practical use of these liquid fuels. Research is needed to provide solutions to these problems. This project is intended to develop novel thermochemical conversion processes to convert lignocellulosic and other biomass to intermediates, and to develop additional processes to refine and upgrade the resultant intermediates to high quality fuels, chemicals, and materials. It is our objective to develop distributed biomass conversion and biorefining systems based on the new thermochemical conversion and refining processes. With increasing interests in algae as an alternative feedstock, a set of technologies for growing, harvesting, and utilizing microalgae for production of renewable energy and chemicals will be developed in our research. Thermochemical conversion of biomass to energy has a great potential as a valid alternative and even replacement of the cellulosic ethanol approach considering the fact that the high capital costs coupled with high costs of enzymes and feedstock present very high risks to investors. Thermochemical processing facilities are less expensive and consume much less water than biochemical processing facilities. For the reasons discussed above, thermochemical conversion has its own problems, making it unpractical in terms of conversions efficiency, product quality, and economics. Tremendous efforts are needed to find solutions to these problems. The proposed research is intended to take new approaches and address the major scientific and technical challenges hindering the practical application of thermochemical conversion technology. The success of the proposed research will lead to the development of conversion processes for making clean and high performance bio-oils and a low temperature and low pressure  Fischer Trophs  like process for production hydrocarbons from syngas, making thermochemical conversion and its products technically feasible, economically viable, and socially responsible.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
389,"The soybean price per unit has fluctuated in the range of $4.38/bushel to $7.83/bushel over the past two decades, which does not reflect the economic inflation of 3% on annual basis. In 2005, it was between $5.32/bushel and $6.84/bushel, which was reported to be lower than 2004 (USDA: National Agricultural Statistics Service). The price increased to higher than $10/bushel for a few months in 2008 but settled down to $8.95/bushel at the end of 2008 (USDA: National Agricultural Statistics Service). The depreciation in soybean value is mainly due to increase in production which is not met at the same level by the utilization, hence, creating a need for studies that could potentially lead to the increase in soybean utilization, especially in human foods. Recent market trends indicate an increasing awareness by the consumers to eat well for better health. Four of the top seven causes of death in the U.S. are reported to be related to diet (Mintel Reports 2002). Consumption of soy and soy-related food products have been related to many health benefits such as lowering serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, reducing the risk of breast cancer, reducing menopausal symptoms, and preventing osteoporosis by maintaining calcium levels in the bone. Moreover, in 1999, the Food and Drug Administration?'s approval of a health claim on cardiovascular benefits of soy protein consumption opened the door for a vast market in the soy foods area in the U.S. Additional benefits also drew attention of consumers, especially for weight management and control. Clinical research trials demonstrate relationships between the levels of dietary protein and carbohydrates and how the body regulates glycemic control and protein metabolism in skeletal muscle. Most Americans consume more than 350 g of carbohydrates each day with less than 85 g of protein which showed the ratio of carbohydrate to protein of more than 3.5. Lowering the ratio to less than 1.5 can be effective in reducing body weight, reducing body fat, sparing of muscle protein, reversing the abnormal blood lipids of dyslipidemia, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and stabilizing postprandial blood glucose. As sensory and rheological properties of foods are notably affected by small variations in the macronutrients, such as protein, carbohydrate, and fat ratios, it is important to identify and model the changes in the sensory and rheological profiles of the foods when significant modifications are made to the macronutrient ratios to achieve certain nutritional goals, such as in high protein foods, and acceptable sensory characteristics. This study to model the variations of macronutrients, processing parameters, and sensory/rheological properties of products will lead to the better understanding of material-process interaction, which will contribute new high protein food developments.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

391,"Nitrate is the most commonly found pollutant in Wisconsin's ground water and may be a problem in surface waters. When present in high concentrations, nitrate in drinking water can be toxic to infants under 6 months and may contribute to human and livestock health problems. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has estimated that the water from 10% of Wisconsin wells exceeds the state public health standard for drinking water. Legumes are distinguished by their unique property of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in association with bacteria called Rhizobia. This symbiosis provides one of the major sources of available nitrogen in the biosphere and produces, every year, a quantity of available nitrogen that is equivalent to the amount synthesized by the fertilizer industry throughout the entire world. In the US alone, legumes are grown on over 80 million acres, where they fix approximately 6 million metric tons of nitrogen worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The aim of this project on DRPs in Medicago truncatula is to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to the establishment of this nitrogen-fixing symbiosis in order to avoid, in the long term, drawbacks associated with the intensive use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers, such as the greenhouse effect and water pollution by nitrates. Legumes are one of the most important families of plants worldwide. Together with cereals, legume species have been fundamental to the development of modern agricultural systems, with soybean and rice in Asia and maize and beans in the Americas. Legumes are also the third largest family of flowering plants. On a worldwide basis, this plant family contributes 33% of humankind's protein intake, while also serving as an important source of fodder and forage for animals, and of edible and industrial oils. In response to the need for a tractable genetic system in legumes, scientists have developed M. truncatula as a model species. Of particular significance, M. truncatula is amenable to efficient molecular, genetic and reverse-genetic analyses, unlike the major crop legumes. Recently, the Nitraginc Company has commercialized a mix of Nod factors and Rhizobia under the name of OptimizeTM LCO Promoter TechnologyTM for soybean, peanut and alfalfa. The effect of this product on the yield can be correlated with the stimulation of root development. We intend to develop the use of Medicago truncatula as a model plant to study biological and agronomic issues important to legumes such as biomass yield and, in the long term, to develop improved legume crops for sustainable food, feed and Biofuel production. Therefore, this proposal is relevant to meeting the national strategic Goal 4 (Improve the Nation's Nutrition and Health) and Goal 5 (Protect and Enhance the Nation's Natural Resource Base and Environment) established by the REE Mission Area and the USDA CSREES.

Increasing resistance to SCN is a primary effort of soybean breeding programs. Our long term goal is to design resistance to SCN based on an efficient adaptive mechanism present in the ancestral germplasm PI 437654. We have been using genetic and functional methods to isolate components of natural resistance in the soybean-nematode pathosystem. This project evaluates isolation and application of native to soybean complete gene sequences associated with responses to soybean cyst nematode from PI 437654. The proposed use of native genes is bolstered by isolation of cis-sequences adjacent to genes. These sequences contain promoters and potentially other regulatory sequences important for gene expression that were not affected by breeder selection as in advanced cultivars. The chromosomal molecular approach will be integrated with organismal gene expression for two reasons: to better understand the role of chromosomal regions involved in regulation and expression of stress responsive genes, and to understand the establishment of agriculturally-important stress responses on the cellular level and during plant development. The comparative approach utilizing the recently sequenced soybean genome of susceptible Williams 82 as a reference genome further increases the power of identification of native genes for soybean improvement. Effects of PI 437654 sequences in susceptible cultivars using root transformation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens could result in a robust transformation methodology useful for testing functionality of genes in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, nutritional efficiency, and other root functions. Also, it could effectively hasten selection of genes for whole plant transformation. For the outcome of using duplications and sequence divergence, we will generate genetic and biological information as to the regulation of these genes within specific tissues and plant organs in responses to stress. The restriction to specific tissues of gene function in response to pathogen will ensue as a result of stringent selection of genes. Tissue-specific molecular dynamics might suggest more subtle strategies for the engineering of stress responses that can focus upon specific tissues at the defined developmental stage without confounding phenotypic effects on plant physiology and yield. Based on the cytological and molecular approach proposed here, novel strategies for environmentally-sound genetic control over soybean pathogen might be established that benefit soybean producers and customers. Taking into consideration that US Soybean Germplasm Collections from all over the world offers enormous genetic resources and wealth of native soybean sequences, the approach proposed here could be extended for improvement of other soybean traits.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
393,"Soil-test summaries and water quality surveys show that many Corn Belt producers are applying excessive amounts of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) for crops and that some are using inefficient methods of application. These practices may result in reduced profits and increased water quality impairment. Conservation tillage systems that are being adopted slowly but at a steady pace and increased biofuel production necessitates research of impacts of cropping and biomass harvest systems on crop nutrient needs and impacts on soil and water quality. Research is needed to study impacts of alternative management systems on nutrient cycling, nutrient distribution in the soil, nutrient application rates, best fertilizer and manure placement methods, and nutrient loss from fields. The objectives of this project are to (1) improve assessments of P and K fertility by soil and plant tissue testing, (2) develop improved fertilizer and manure nutrient application methods for conservation tillage systems, (3) understand better nutrient cycling with grain or crop biomass harvest, and (4) study processes underlining current or new management practices to minimize impacts of fertilization and manure P application on P loss to water resources. Six sub-projects will use specific trials and measurements to achieve the objectives. Two sub-projects will use long-term conventions plot trials to evaluate P and K fertilizer placement methods for corn-soybean rotations managed no-till or chisel-plow/disk tillage and to evaluate P and K recycling when continuous corn is harvested for grain or biomass with treatments such as corn hybrids, tillage, and fertilizer rates. Samples of grain, plant at maturity, crop residue, and soil will be used to measure N, P, and K concentrations and cycling. One sub-project will use replicated on-farm strip trials to study within-field variation of soil-test values (mainly pH, P, and K) and crop response to fertilizer or lime using a simple design while demonstrating use of precision agriculture technologies (such as GPS, yield monitors, and GIS) to improve the calibration of soil tests and for fertility research. Three sub-projects will use long-term, conventional plot trials with natural rainfall or field rainfall simulations to understand processes and assess impacts of tillage systems, fertilizer or liquid swine manure N-P management, and grain or biomass harvest systems in continuous corn or corn-soybean rotations on soil P pools and P loss with surface runoff and tile drainage. Results for crop yield responses, nutrient removal with harvest, and soil-test values will provide information about the efficacy of the nutrient management practices under study. Estimates of sediment and P loss with runoff or tile drainage from three sub-projects will allow for study impacts on water quality. The project will improve knowledge of P and K cycling and will identify cost-effective management practices with a potential for increasing the profitability and efficiency of nutrient management while minimizing nutrient loss and water quality impairment.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

In addition, producers are asking when cover crops may be sown into the cash crop so that yields are not impacted. This study will provide these needed data.

395,"Soybean is a legume that requires more than 300 lbs of nitrogen to produce a 60 bu/a crop. Some of this nitrogen comes from soil organic matter, but the majority of the nitrogen is produced by a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria living on the plants roots. (Lindemann and Glover, 2003; Tien et al., 2002). This bacterium, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, fixes nitrogen from the air to produce ammonium which can be used by the plant (Balatti and Pueppke, 1992). Inoculating soybean seed with B. japonicum is widely used to ensure that adequate levels of healthy bacteria are present near the seed to facilitate N fixation. In fields where native rhizobia levels are low due to lack of soybean in the rotation or environmental stress, inoculation can increase yields by 50% or more. (Duong et al., 1984; Seneviratne et al., 2000). After an initial inoculation of a field, B. japonicum will survive for many years and future inoculation will not increase yields as much as the initial one. There is a mixture of results on the efficacy of successive inoculations after initial use of B. japonicum products. Some evidence that successive inoculation can increase yields is presented by Beuerlein, 2005 and Conley and Christmas, 2006. However a number of trials did not see yield increases (Abendroth and Elmore, 2006; Pedersen, 2003; Vitosh, 1997). In another study, use of soybean inoculant raised soybean yield in 6 of 14 site-years in fields that had been in soybean rotation in a Michigan study (Schulz and Thelen, 2008). Soybean inoculants are inexpensive and fairly convenient to use. The commercial inoculant industry in Wisconsin and the Midwest is vibrant and very competitive. Newer inoculants from several of these companies contain multiple improved strains of B. japonicum and claim better nitrogen fixation efficiency leading to higher yields. Recently, inoculant manufacturers have added lipochitooligosaccharide nod factors to their inoculant products. These products are meant to elicit responses which increase infection and nodule formation (Smith et al., 2004). Inoculation of soybean, while relatively inexpensive, can be very important to the profitability of a soybean crop. Understanding the environmental conditions when inoculation should be used would greatly benefit WI soybean growers and make crop input decisions easier. Previous research has not looked at a matrix of environmental factors that might affect the performance of inoculants.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
396,"Growth Analysis for Yield Improvement in New vs. Old Soybean Cultivars (objective 1). Across a 60-year period, cultivar development efforts by soybean breeders have resulted in a 21-31 kg/ha.yr increase in soybean yield. Because selection for yield during this period has been done empirically, the factors responsible for this yield improvement have not been clearly identified. To identify indirect yield criteria for streamlining cultivar development, scientists have endeavored to determine the pertinent factors related to genetically-induced yield enhancement in the soybean cultivar development process. Although recent studies comparing new vs. old soybean cultivars have indicated that dry matter levels and seed number per area help explain yield improvement, no studies have clearly identified the growth parameters responsible for this greater seed and yield production. Thus, our objective is to identify growth dynamic parameters responsible for greater yield in new vs. old cultivars. Elucidation of this issue will provide soybean breeders with potential indirect selection criteria for soybean cultivar development. Determination of Minimal Optimal Plant Population and Genetic Selection for Yield Compensation at Low Plant Population (objectives 2, 3, 4, and 5). Reduced plant population decreases seed costs, reduces lodging, and ameliorates some disease problems. Seed cost has increased because of the fees associated with Roundup Ready soybeans. Although once a minor expense, seed costs have greatly increased, now accounting for almost half of operating expenditures. Because yield per plant increases as population declines, previous plant population studies have shown wide differences in the minimal optimal plant population (minimal plant population necessary to achieve optimal yield). Seeding rates can be reduced by testing current cultivars across a range of plant populations to determine if lower populations are possible without yield loss. Therefore, one of the objectives of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that soybean can achieve optimal yield by planting at lower populations than those currently recommended. Another way to reduce minimal optimal plant population is to grow cultivars having greater yield compensation at low plant population relative to other cultivars. However, little information is available on this issue. Thus, another objective of this research is to screen southern public cultivars for their yield compensation ability based on dry matter per plant at sparse populations; and to enter selected cultivars into genetic studies aimed at identifying the mode of inheritance. Public cultivars are being used in these proposed studies because of legal prohibitions precluding the use of commercial cultivars for such research.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
397,"Crop diseases in general are among the most important production constraints for all crops, including corn soybean and wheat produced in South Dakota, the North Central region, and nationwide. This research generally applies to crops produced on around 17 million acres in South Dakota alone, with a value of production around $5 Billion in 2008. In addition, the livestock feeders and biofuels industries in SD depend heavily on the production of healthy and abundant grains, oilseeds and forages to serve as the feed-stocks for meat and bio-energy production. These increased demands on production agriculture to supply multiple industries have led to greater attention to production constraints such as disease and other pest management concerns. The research proposed will address integrated disease management for several important cropping systems in the state. Diseases of interest are primarily those with high levels of potential economic impact, such as head scab of wheat, soybean cyst nematode, rusts of cereals and others. Additionally, the research will address the potential threat of emerging and invasive disease agents such as Asian soybean rust, High Plains Virus of wheat, and the corn cyst nematode. The purposes of this research are: to discover mitigation methods for major crop disease threats; to integrate useful and effective methods for disease management; and to develop tools for use in achieving a greater level of sustainable agricultural management in South Dakota. Without this research, it is likely that production limitations imposed by crop diseases will lead to lower production, lower quality and value of production, greater pressure on limited resources for both the animal and biofuels industries, and a reduction of environmental quality due to non-sustainable disease management practices. Field, greenhouse and laboratory experimentation will be directed at developing and refining component methods for disease management in relevant host/pathogen systems. Research will also be conducted to discover effective integrated strategies for South Dakota. It is expected that the research will result in several outcomes/impacts including: research publications and non-technical publications summarizing research results; web-delivered forecast or risk assessment tools for head scab of wheat and soybean rust; web-delivered management information for major crop diseases, with recommendations based on project research; increase in adoption of integrated disease management; reduction in prescriptive uses of fungicides with a trend toward risk-based management/usage; and increased awareness among the state's producers of invasive and emergent pathogens/diseases through the monitoring components of the proposed research.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

This project will use comparative and experimental studies, in both field and laboratory, to build on our existing base of coccinellid research and explore various aspects of the life history and ecology of these species that relate directly to their efficacy in biological control of cereal aphids. 2) Mitigation of Yield Losses to Dectes texanus in Cultivated Sunflowers. Among the management tactics to be explored in field experiments are: (1) reduced plant spacing to increase stalk girth and 'standability' while delaying stalk desiccation (and hence onset of girdling), (2) use of a late-season irrigation pulse to delay stalk desiccation relative to seed desiccation, (3) use of 'soft' desiccants such as glyphosate to accelerate seed desiccation relative to stalk desiccation, (4) use of the 'stay-green' stalk trait to delay stalk desiccation relative to seed desiccation, and (5) characterization of resistance factors in wild sunflower. 3) Integrated Management of Multiple Insects Attacking Late Season Soybeans in Kansas. A series of on-farm yield-response experiments will address a complex of key insect pests impacting late-season soybeans. We will monitor densities of key insect pests (e.g., bean leaf beetle, corn earworm, stink bugs, soybean looper, soybean aphid, etc.) and generate a range of insect infestation levels using insecticides and exclusion cages. We will then measure yield responses and calculate damage thresholds for these pests alone and in combination. 4) Adapting a Mechanistic Growth Model to Generate Field-Specific Economic Thresholds for Soybean Aphid. We will adapt a mechanistic growth model to describe soybean aphid population dynamics, improve our ability to forecast population growth rates, and increase the effectiveness of econmic thresholds. 5) Evaluating Biocontrol and Host Plant Resistance Strategies for Managing Soybean Aphid in the North Central U.S. Using field experiments, we will assess chemical control/resistant variety interactions in the context of controlling soybean aphid and evaluate resistant soybean varieties and their interactions with biological control agents. 6) Integrated Pest Management of Multiple Insects Attacking Sorghum in Kansas. We will re-evaluate long-standing treatment recommendations for key sorghum pests with a focus on caterpillars attacking whorls and seed heads. We will delineate yield-loss relationships for economically relevant sorghum pests using exclusion cages in commercial production fields and small-plot experiments, and also identify key parasitoids of economically important species. 7) Evaluation of Pesticides for Managing Arthropod Pests in Kansas Field Crops. Field spray trials will be used to test efficacy of existing and novel materials against three major arthropod pest groups that threaten corn production in this Southwest Kansas, corn borers, rootworms and spider mites.

These crop species require fewer inputs, produce more energy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to annual cropping systems such as corn and soybean. However, an important component of any bioenergy cropping system is the required fertilizer input per biomass in these systems because the utilization of fertilizers contributes significantly to the cost of production and has potential ecological ?costs? as a contributor to air and stream pollution. Endophytes, such as diazotrophic bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi could act as ?biofertilizers? and as ?bioprotectors? with their ability to supplement and mobilize soil nutrients and to increase resistance to pathogens of their host plants. The limited knowledge, however, about endophytes in bioenergy crops still hinders a potential application in sustainable agriculture.

Furthermore, use of biological control agents may help forestall the advent of the development of resistance in soybean aphids to Rag-1 soybean lines, a problem that has developed in other parts of the Midwest. Most soybean fields in the eastern part of the state are sprayed for soybean aphid at costs of at least $10/acre.

402,"Irrigated agriculture is a significant and growing part of the economy of South Carolina, and its success or failure is far-reaching. Irrigation accounts for nearly a quarter of South Carolina's water usage during the summer, and as water resources available to agriculture become limiting due to population growth, competition, drought, and quality degradation, efficient and wise use of irrigation water increase in importance. There are four major issues that limit wise use of irrigation water in South Carolina. First, there are extensive knowledge gaps, and thus the need for research, in understanding the variations in crop water use and irrigation needs among the major crops in dominant soils and climate zones. The second issue deals with the limited number of past studies in South Carolina on the effectiveness and suitability of various water management strategies and scheduling tools and techniques in different crops and soils. The third issue is more philosophical on the surface, but has profound on-farm implications. It suggests a serious lag in awareness and adoption of the best irrigation water and system management practices in South Carolina because of the lack of an irrigation history in the State. Besides the above, there is also need for a more critical assessment of the economics of irrigation in the humid South Carolina because rainfall can help in meeting most of crop water needs in many years. This research project addresses key knowledge gaps identified in the first two issues mentioned above, making available a comprehensive set of baseline data and information, including daily and seasonal crop water use, crop coefficient, yield production functions (i.e., yield versus irrigation), and the water stress threshold levels for major row crops in South Carolina. A major impact of this project will be the availability of research-based irrigation information resources and tools for researchers, action agency personnel, and irrigators. This should lead to a higher level of awareness and managerial capabilities of South Carolina irrigators and extension agents and consequently wiser use of water resources. The irrigated acreage in South Carolina is currently at 11% (170,000 acreas) of all cultivated land (1.6 million acreas). Use of the knowledge generated in this project is expected to help reduce irrigation by about 25% or more, which translates to a $50/ac savings in pumping costs per season (currently at $8-12/inch/acre), or an equivalent saving of about $5 million for the 100,000 acres of irrigated corn, cotton, and soybean in South Carolina. This conservation allows additional water availability for irrigated land expansion, and brings along other economic and societal benefits, including reduced leaching of agro-chemicals and improved water quality. It is expected that promising practices, tools, and models developed in this project will contribute to advancing our scientific understanding of how irrigated cropping systems in humid regions may be altered and managed to produce more yield with less water via conservation, improved sensor technology, better scheduling, and system upgrade.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

405,"Colon cancer is the third most common type of cancer and is the second most deadly. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute estimated over 148,000 new cases of colon cancer were detected. In this same year nearly 50,000 deaths were attributed to colon and rectal cancers. In Arkansas between the years 2001-2005, approximately 221 out of 100,000 people contracted colorectal cancer and nearly 100 deaths (per 100,000) occurred as a result of the disease. These statistics are some of the highest numbers in the nation. A strong link exists between colon cancer and diet. A diet high in red meat, fat, sugar and refined grains is thought to lead to a higher incidence of colon cancer, whereas a diet high in fruits and vegetables, calcium, vitamins D and E and fiber is thought to reduce colon cancer risk. Obesity as well as alcohol and tobacco use are also risk factors for colorectal cancer. Consumption of low-fat dairy products has been associated with a decrease in colon cancer risk which is attributed to high level of calcium and vitamin D. Probiotic bacteria, present in fermented dairy products such as yogurt have also shown positive association for lower incidences of colon cancer. Reasons for this include: binding of potential carcinogens and alteration of the colonic microflora to reduce the number of putrefactive bacteria. Probiotic bacteria also produce fermentation products such as conjugated linoleic acids, which may be antitumorigenic or antimutagenic. Despite the purported benefits of probiotic bacteria, little information is available regarding the molecular mechanisms of chemoprevention. We plan to elucidate the mechanisms by which probiotic bacterial fermentation products produced in both dairy and soymilk reduce the incidence of colon cancer and identify the specific compound(s) responsible. Identifying these compounds will help establish mechanism(s) for specific health benefits from consumption of probiotic cultures. In addition, it will provide a scientific-based rationale for selecting and optimizing probiotic cultures and dietary choices for predictable nutritional management to maintain colonic health.

406,"The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) rises by approximately 1.51 ppm per yr and is responsible for around 69.6% of global warming. Terrestrial soils are both a source and a sink of carbon (C), with about 10% of atmospheric CO2 passing through them each year. In an effort to offset the increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, researchers are striving to harness the C sequestration potential of croplands through improved cropping systems and more efficient fertilizer use. Of particular interest are maize-based systems, since maize is currently planted on over one fifth of the world's agricultural land devoted to cereal production, an area that covers approximately 137.6 million hectares. Any effort to establish a carbon budget for a growing crop by means of a thorough accounting of all C sources and sinks will require the ability to discriminate between CO2 production by the root system, which recycles recently fixed C, and the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) by microbial activity, which releases C into the system from the soil surface. On a global basis, the carbon contained within soils far exceeds that within aboveground biomass however accurate measurement of soil C dynamics in the short run is difficult because soil C is distributed non-uniformly with pools that vary in degree of recalcitrance to oxidation and loss. In this project, autotrophic soil respiration (Ra) is defined as combined root respiration and the respiration of soil microorganisms residing in the rhizosphere and using root-derived carbohydrates as an energy source. Heterotrophic respiration (Rh) is defined as the respiration of soil microorganisms and macroorganisms not directly under the influence of the live root system and using SOM as an energy source. These will be separated via analysis of stable carbon isotope analysis (d13C) of soil respiration, Soil respiration and C contribution to soil humic acid pools (MHA and CaHA) will be monitored two separate soil environments a.) implanted soil cores that have a d13C signature vastly different than the growing crop and b) indigenous soil (i.e. soil existent at the site). Implanted soil cores are intended to provide a means of quantifying plant C accumulation and loss from humic acid pools and to separate plant-derived C from soil-derived C in soil CO2 flux measurements.

408,"The worldwide success of maize as a high-yielding staple crop is undoubtedly tied to its C4 photosynthetic biochemistry. The C4 syndrome enables more effective use of high intensities of sunlight, high rates of carbon fixation, and superior water use efficiency. The ultimate goal of this project and cooperating groups is to identify those genes in maize that specifically encode essential steps leading to expression of C4 photosynthesis. If that were achieved it should be possible to introduce these genes, using existing molecular methods, into crop plants (i.e., wheat, rice, soybean) that possess the less efficient C3 mechanism. The challenge is to identify C4 genes in the complex and changing background of gene expression occurring in the developing leaf. One way is to overlay such patterns of gene expression on corresponding gradients in photosynthetic performance in order to correlate expression patterns with specific processes. Numerous physiological parameters are available that reflect different subprocesses that contribute to overall photosynthetic capacity. Such parameters are not trivial to measure, but require an experienced investigator and proper instrumental capabilities.

However, every plant has some degree of innate tolerance or resistance to such stresses but for a successful crop we need to improve the tolerance levels of these crop plants to keep pace with the future food demands. Our hypothesis is that the stress-tolerant phenotype is a result of differential expression of unique proteins in resistant cultivars as compare to the susceptible ones to protect them during stress periods in plant's life. To develop better crop plants for our future needs, discovery of these unique proteins and understanding of the stress-tolerance mechanisms at molecular level is very important. Insights of the stress tolerance proteins-  the key players inside the cell ; will assist our plant breeders in developing better cultivars for our state needs. We can modify these key molecular players to enhance crop's stress tolerance. Discovery of such proteins that are involved in regulating biotic and abiotic stresses will help plant breeders to improve the crop plants using both conventional breeding and transgenic technologies. At present there is much progress in transformation of plants like arabidopsis, tobacco and rice but crops like wheat and soybean have lagging behind. Wheat and soybeans are still considered recalcitrant plants in terms of their genetic transformation potential. Hence, establishing efficient genetic transformation protocols are very important.

The conduct of supervised research by DPM students has yielded results identifying the application timing and products best suited for control of Asian Soybean Rust. In another supervised research program conducted by a DPM student a common pathogen in ornamental crop production systems was evaluated for tolerance to five commercially recommended fungicides for disease control. The results indicated that four of the five materials were no longer effective in disease control.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

It has long been postulated that more risk-averse farmers are less likely to adopt and are likely to wait longer before adopting new technologies. Recent research seeks to distinguish between risk aversion (aversion to choices for which the probability of each outcome is known) and ambiguity aversion (aversion to choices for which the distribution of outcomes is unknown). We hypothesize that ambiguity aversion is a significant deterrent to adoption. Resolution of ambiguity may vary across farmers based on learning processes and cognitive ability. We will conduct experiments measuring risk aversion, ambiguity aversion, cognitive ability, and learning processes with Wisconsin soy and corn farmers who have participated in a panel survey regarding GM adoption.

413,"Drainage losses from tile-drained agricultural fields in the upper Midwest are now well established as the major source of nitrate to the Gulf of Mexico, delivered by the Mississippi River. This is a major factor in causing an hypoxic zone that forms each summer in the Gulf. The flat, productive soils of central Illinois produce high yields of corn and soybeans, but the tile-drainage needed to make agricultural production practices feasible and timely on these fields leak large amounts of nitrate. Therefore, the long-term goal of our project is to develop biophysical and social science techniques that could lead to large watershed-scale reductions in nitrate export. Our project will focus on the effectiveness and social barriers to implementation of two drainage-related management practices; drainage water management (controlled drainage) and saturated riparian buffers in the heavily tile-drained and high nitrate Spoon River subwatershed of the Upper Salt Fork watershed in east-central Illinois. We will work closely with an active watershed group in all phases of our work that includes a wide range of stakeholders. Modified drainage systems will be installed on the watershed and their effectiveness fully assessed, focusing on where the water goes as well as overall nitrate removal. Simulation modeling will be used to better understand how modified drainage systems would work under varied weather conditions that might occur over many years. We will implement a full range of extension activities including: fact sheets that highlight research results and document the water quality benefits of the project; field days to demonstrate results to producers, landowners, and the general public; a DVD that explains the benefits of modified drainage systems; and information on the watershed group's website about the benefits of modified drainage systems. Surveys and focus groups will assess stakeholder interests and motivations before and after extension programming. At the end of our study we will have a thorough understanding of the biophysical aspects of modified drainage systems, as well as knowledge of stakeholder acceptance and barriers (and what incentives might overcome the barriers), effective extension programs, and evaluations of our work. The next generation of professionals will receive education from both biophysical and social science viewpoints, including a field methods course using the watershed as a laboratory, a seminar discussion course that integrates biophysical and social sciences, and a service learning course for 6-8 grade students about watersheds and water quality problems.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
414,"The function of this proposal is research and it is a standard grant. The program priority addressed is the molecular mechanisms of communication between symbiotic, nitrogen-fixing bacteria and legume plant hosts. These bacteria, rhizobia, invade the roots of legume plants, induce these plants to form a nodule to house them, and establish a symbiotic interaction. In this symbiosis, the bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that the plant can utilize and the plant provides the bacteria with fixed carbon compounds produced by photosynthesis. This symbiosis is critical for agricultural productivity in crops such as alfalfa, soybean, and pea. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which this symbiosis develops is required for improving the symbiotic interaction and ultimately for transferring the plant symbiotic genes to non-legume crops, such as rice and wheat. We are probing the molecular mechanisms of communication between the bacterial symbiont and its plant hosts by studying mutants of the bacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti, that are unable to produce the important polysaccharide succinoglycan, and as a result are unable to invade host plants. We will focus on the role of exoK, a glycanase that is required for succinoglycan modification and specifically required for invasion of one host (Medicago truncatula) but not another (alfalfa). We will also study M. truncatula mutants to determine how the plant responds to succinoglycan to facilitate invasion. These M. truncatula mutants are being screened as part of a collaborative effort to establish genetic tools in this plant, in which our laboratory is participating.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
415,"The increasing demands on agriculture to supply food, feed, fiber, and fuel create a complex set of drivers and responses that may cause enormous changes in ecological, economic, and social systems in the Midwestern U.S. One potential mechanism for addressing these changes is the incorporation of perennial vegetation cover within agricultural landscapes. This integrated project analyzes the economic, social, and environmental implications from experimental annual-perennial agroecosystems and creates educational programs for a wide range of stakeholders. Our project has linked a research component that quantifies biophysical and socioeconomic impacts of incorporating native prairie vegetation into an annual crop production system with an education component that promotes dialogue and improved understanding about the role of perennial vegetation within agroecosystems. Strategic placement of small amounts of native prairie cover within agriculturally-dominated landscapes has the potential to provide disproportionate benefits for biophysical and socioeconomic components of those row-cropped dominated landscapes. As part of this project we are studying 14 watersheds (4-10 ha each) having different configurations of native prairie strips within a corn-soybean cropping system. As part of this we are investigating the impacts of incorporating small percentages of perennial vegetation on water quality, carbon, and biodiversity. In addition, we are surveying surrounding landowners to assess their knowledge of agroecosystems and willingness to pay for practices that provide environmental benefits. This project also will work to educate a variety of stakeholders about the potential impacts of incorporating small percentages of perennial vegetation in the row-crop dominated landscape. From this a project advisory committee of farmers, government agencies, and farm and environmental organizations will be used to exchange information and provide input on our research and educational efforts. We will also develop modules that promote learning and discovery of multi-functional agricultural management and production systems among the thousands of people visiting the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge each year. In addition, we will create a course that links students with agricultural producers to develop multi-functional agricultural management plans for their respective operations that are informed by data gathered from the watersheds and that conform to guidelines outlined in federal and state programs. The impact of the project will be assessed by documenting treatment effects on watershed characteristics and the public's knowledge and perceptions before and after the project activities are implemented.

416,"Between the winter of 2006 and the summer of 2008 prices of the world's four most importat staple food commodities (rice, wheat, corn and soybeans) more than tripled. These four staple crops comprise about 75% of the world's caloric base. This project develops a new methodology to use detailed data about weather and agricultural output to examine how climate change affects food commodity prices and particularly commodity price variability. The project begins with using econometric techniques and detailed data on weather and agricultural output. The data are used to estimate and test a statistical model of a non-linear relationship between weather and output; the results of that model are predictions about the yield variability of the four major staple crops in all major global production regions. The next step uses existing climate change projections to develop sensible predictions for future specific changes in weather patterns, including changes in the mean/average outcome, changes in the variability of climate, and correlation between the different production regions. The results of the first two steps are then combined to give a prediction of how climate change will change the distribution of agricultural yields. The next step is to consider how past weather shocks have affected supply and demand for these staple crops. This information is used to estimate a structural model of supply and demand for each of the four staple crops. Combining this market model with the predicted changes in the distribution of agricultural yields allows the PIs to make predictions about how future climate change will affect commodity prices. The models will also be used to examine the likely effects of changes in government policy and changes in how farmers and commodity traders store crops from year to year. The specifics of the research plan includeA: Linking weather and yield variability.  The PIs extend their earlier work to examine yield variablility of the four major staple crops throughout the world.B: Climate change projections.  The PIs summarize the predictions of various General Circulation Models on (i) mean outcomes; (ii) changes in variability, and (iii) correlation between production regions.  Each one of these three changes in weather patterns would directly influence the distribution of yields.C: Predict yield distributionsCombining parts A and B gives revised yield distributions under climate change.  The non linear temperature-yield relationship from part A implies that even a mean increase in temperatures with constant variance could impact yield variability, as would a change in weather variability.  Finally, if weather becomes more (or less) correlated or if the geography of agricultural production becomes more (or less) concentrated, idiosyncratic productions shocks will no longer average out and total world production could become more (or less) variable.D: Yield variability and commodity prices.Using weather-induced yield shocks as instruments allows the researchers to estimate supply and demand elasticities for the four staple crops.  While randome yield shocks have previously been used to estimate demand elasticities, lagged yield shocks can also be used to identify supply elasticities, as past production shocks are linked to the current period's effort through storage.  With the elasticity estimates the researchers can translate their yield distribution into a distribution of commodity prices.E: Simulate the effects of competitive storage and government policies.  Farmers and commodity traders are likely to resond to changes in production and price variability by adjusting inventory holdings.  Inventories help to attenuate price variability in the face of year-t0-year productions variability.

418,"Adaptation to the environment is fundamentally important to plants since, unlike animals, they cannot move.  Such adaptation often is accompanied by changes in plant phenotypes (appearance) and gene expression, some of which can be controlled by epigenetic mechanisms involving changes in chromatin (DNA or histones) or small RNAs.  This research will identify epigenetic changes induced in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in response to high ambient temperatures and carbon-dioxide concentrations that lie within the ranges that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes predicts will occur at the end of this century. This work particularly may identify so-called  global-warming  genes responsible for high temperature and CO2 induced variations in plant phenotypes. High throughput deep sequencing, in combination with bioinformatic analysis, will be used to identify epigenetic changes in cytosine methylation, histone modifications, non-coding small RNAs expression, and mRNA expression.  This study will demonstrate the value of this approach for investigating how Arabidopsis adapts to other biotic- and abiotic- environmental factors, such as viruses, fungi, bacteria, drought, cold, and salt concentrations.

419,"Legumes such as soybeans, alfalfa or peanuts have the unique ability to associate with soil bacteria named rhizobia.  This symbiosis leads to the formation of root nodules inside which the rhizobia transform air nitrogen into forms assimilable by the plant.  Every year, in the United States, this symbiosis saves around $4.5 billion in fertilizer costs and prevents ecological and health issues associated with the excessive use of chemical fertilizers.  The rhizobium-legume symbiosis presents a high level of species specificity which means that specific legumes only associate with specific rhizobia.  This specificity mechanism is mostly controlled by the structure of LCO (Lipo-Chito-Oligosaccharide) signals produced by the rhizobia and recognized by their host plants. LCOs also mediate associations with symbiotic fungi which occur in legumes but also in many other non-legume crops such as corn, wheat and cotton. LCOs are now used by farmers as plant growth promoters for legume and non-legume crops. Genetic analysis in plants allowed the identification of LCO receptors and proteins such as HMGR1 (3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase 1) that interact with LCO receptors and are required for the establishment of symbiotic associations.  This project will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms allowing legumes to recognize symbiotic LCOs and of the downstream pathways allowing LCO receptors and HMGR1 to mediate the development of root nodules with rhizobia and associations with symbiotic fungi.  In the short term, understanding these mechanisms can have a direct impact on yield improvement through a more efficient use of LCOs as plant growth promoters.  This knowledge will also help improve the establishment of plant-microbe associations, with especially high impact under suboptimal and stressful field conditions.  In the long term, engineering new symbiotic associations through these mechanisms may help improve the sustainability of our agriculture for food, feed and biofuel production.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

425,"Gene Regulatory Processes Required to Make a Soybean SeedPI: Robert B. Goldberg (University of California Los Angeles)Co-PIs: John J. Harada (University of California Davis) and Matteo Pellegrini (University of California Los Angeles)During the next 50 years, more food must be produced on less land than has been required during the entire history of humankind. A major challenge for the 21st century, therefore, is to increase the yield of major crop plants, such as soybean, using state-of-the-art genetic technologies.  Seeds represent a major source of food for human and animal consumption and the long-term goal of this project is to understand all the regulatory networks required to make a seed. In the process, novel approaches can be designed for increasing seed yield and, therefore, food production. Soybean is ideal for this kind of study because soybean seeds are one of the largest sources of protein feed and vegetable oil in the world, providing $30 billion annually in farm value to the U.S. Also, soybean seeds have been well studied at the cell and molecular level and the full soybean genome sequence is now available. This research project will characterize all aspects of soybean seed development from embryo inception to seed dormancy. To accomplish this goal, the project will use a laser to cut and capture individual cells and sequence their genomes. Three types of genomic data will then be studied including: (1) mRNA sequence sets, (2) microRNA populations, and (3) DNA methylation patterns of specific soybean seed compartments. This project will integrate these datasets and will thereby provide a comprehensive view of all the interacting genetic components needed to make a soybean seed. Proper seed development impacts the synthesis and storage of proteins and carbohydrates needed for human nutrition. By identifying the networks operating during seed filling, this project will provide a new genetic toolkit for future use.

The ultimate goal is a new, predictive view of cellular function, supplanting the older descriptive understanding. However, even with the availability of advanced technologies, systems biology has yet to achieve its promise due to a variety of issues, not the least of which is the overall complexity of biological systems. The project reduces this complexity by studying the response of a single, plant cell type, the root hair, to infection by the beneficial nitrogen fixing bacterium, Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The current project builds on past work that has developed the soybean root hair cell as an ideal model for genomic study. The goal is to focus specifically on the regulatory networks that control the infection process leading to the successful establishment of a nitrogen fixing symbiosis. Beyond its relevance to systems biology, the work promises to yield new insights into plant cellular function, root development and the nitrogen fixation process, which is of great agronomic and ecological importance. The root hair is the first site of plant response to bacteria during the nitrogen fixation process. Therefore, identifying the plant response pathways at a systems level could provide new avenues for manipulating nitrogen fixation in crop plants. The project will yield sequence data that will be made publicly available through GenBank and through our project website (www.soyroothair.org), as well as the Soybean Knowledgebase (www.SoyKB.org). The latter is being designed as a comprehensive resource to house, visualize and analyze all types of soybean functional genomic data.

427,"The production and role of plant compounds, known as secondary compounds, is a key scientific problem that has many agricultural and ecological dimensions.   The fundamental goal of this project is to identify and characterize novel genes responsible for triterpene saponin biosynthesis, in important class of plant secondary compounds, in Medicago truncatula using revolutionary technologies.  The plant species Medicago truncatula has emerged as an important experimental model for leguminous crop species such as alfalfa.  Triterpene saponins are a class of structurally diverse plant natural products with a wide range of demonstrated bioactivities including allelopathic, antifungal, antibacterial, antiinsect, anticancer, antinutritive activities. The antinutritive properties of triterpene saponins in legume forages such as alfalfa and soybean are of particular and substantial economic importance.  However, the biosynthesis of triterpene saponins is poorly characterized and this pathway is absent from most textbooks. This project will use cutting-edge metabolomics, genome wide association mapping, correlated gene expression profiling, and traditional molecular validation approaches for gene discovery and characterization related to triterpene saponin biosynthesis in M. truncatula. The goal of this project will be accomplished through the following specific aims: 1) Metabolome analyses of a large and diverse M. truncatula germplasm collection to identify hyper- (high) and hypo- (low) saponin accumulating lines and to enable genome-wide association mapping between specific loci with saponin content 2) Comparative gene expression analyses of hyper and hypo saponin accumulating lines to identify putative genes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis and regulation, and 3) Molecular and biochemical confirmation of select targeted saponin biosynthetic genes prioritized based upon multiple levels of evidence. Preliminary data document substantial metabolic diversity in saponin accumulation which is a necessary prerequisite for successful association mapping and comparative microarray analyses.Broader Impacts: This project will identify and characterize specific genes involved in legume triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis. Specific genes identified in this project have the potential for future metabolic-engineering of crop varieties with: 1) improved fitness and defense, 2) decreased bloat and antinutritive properties resulting in optimized livestock weight gain performance, and 3) potential plant neutraceuticals and adjuvants related to human and animal health. High resolution biochemical phenotype data generated for a large number of M. truncatula accessions core collection will be generated and will be made publicly available via an anonymous FTP server (ftp://sumnerftp.noble.org/pub). This data will highlight specific germplasm critical for further molecular and biochemical dissection of saponin biosynthesis. More importantly, the copious metabolomics data generated will provide substantial community value in that it will enable association mapping with a wealth of other metabolites (both known and unknown) and related fitness traits including, but not limited, to symbiosis (flavonoids, isoflavonoids, dicarboxylic acids), drought/salinity tolerance (proline, manitol, and other osmoprotectants), and/or aluminum tolerance (malate). Funding of this project provides multidisciplinary training for two postdoctoral researchers and one undergraduate summer intern/hourly worker in advanced technologies, plant molecular biology, large-scale integrated systems biology, and largescale analytical biochemistry. A postdoctoral researcher is being mentored in scientific writing, scientific presentations, publishing, grant applications, constructive peer review, project management, time management, and personnel management to further mold a great scientific mind more towards the realistic and professional expectations of modern academic and commercial research. A series of enrichment workshops focused upon local high school students is being provided. Participating groups include Oklahoma Upward Bound Science/Math Program, Ardmore High School AP and Science Club, and Southern Oklahoma Technology Center Biotechnology Program. These annual enrichment opportunities  stimulate student interests in science, plant biology, and natural product biochemistry. An international symposium is being be hosted in year three of the project.  This will provide a forum for the latest advances in saponin research and serve to highlight the outcomes of this project.

428,"1033552BennettIntellectual MeritThe production of biofuels from renewable resources is currently an area national interest.  In particular, butanol isomers have gained interest as an alternative fuel due to their superior fuel properties to relative to ethanol.  The proposed research will use metabolic engineering approaches to enable the fermentation of the non-digestible, soluble carbohydrate fraction isolated from many common oilseeds such as soybean, cottonseed, and sunflower seed, to butanol.  Many of these materials are byproducts of biodiesel or bioethanol production.  For example, large amounts of galactose-rich soluble carbohydrates, constituting approximately 10% of oil seed weight, represent a sustainable yet underutilized feedstock for biofuel.  Towards this end, the hydrolysis of the galactose-rich oligosaccharides and subsequent fermentation to 2-butanol by engineered E. coli will be studied and optimized.   Furthermore, natural and engineered strains of Clostridia may also be able make effective use of this feedstock.   Genetic modules for engineered strains of Clostridia will be developed that enable the efficient uptake and metabolism of galactose-rich oligosaccharides and their fermentation to 1-butanol.Broader ImpactsThe education plan will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students in biochemical engineering, molecular biology, and biochemistry.   Undergraduate students from under-represented groups will be recruited for these activities through existing programs at Rice University.   As part of the outreach plan, after school and summer research experiences for local high school students will be coordinated through the Harmony Science Academy, a largely minority charter school.

429,"Mark A. Johnson      IOS-1021917HAP2(GCS1): Mechanisms of double fertilizationThe molecular mechanisms that allow gamete cells (sperm and egg) to fuse are unknown. Overcoming this gap in our knowledge is an important goal because gamete fusion is central to the life cycle of all sexually reproducing organisms. Flowering plants (including major crops like corn, rice, and soybean) undergo double fertilization: one sperm fuses with the egg cell to form an embryo and another sperm fuses with the central cell to produce endosperm, a specialized tissue that supports the embryo. These cell fusion events lead to formation of seeds, the basis of the human food system. Gaining greater understanding of gamete fusion in flowering plants will lead to technologies that can improve seed crop production and control reproduction of crop plants. The hap2-1 mutant was identified using genetic analysis in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. hap2-1 mutant sperm appear normal, but fail to fuse with either the egg or the central cell.  These mutants lack a protein, HAP2(GCS1), that is normally on the surface of sperm cells. The hypothesis that will be tested in this project is that the HAP2(GCS1) protein is directly involved in a process that allows the male and female gametes to fuse.  The goals of this project are 1) to identify new proteins that participate with HAP2(GCS1) to mediate gamete fusion, 2) to identify proteins that regulate the function of HAP2(GCS1), and 3) to determine how HAP2(GCS1) and other proteins allow gamete cells to fuse.  The results of this project will have broad scientific impacts because HAP2(GCS1) is found in many eukaryotic species and is likely part of a gamete fusion mechanism employed by many plants and animals.

430,"Over the past two decades, an agricultural revolution has occurred in the Brazilian Amazon.  Regions within the Amazon have quickly emerged as significant producers of grains and oilseeds, and they now provide consumers across the world with vegetable oils and animal feeds vital to distant economies. Despite the fact that beef production remains the primary driver of Amazonian deforestation, questions have emerged about the potential environmental impact associated with the expansion of large-scale agriculture in the region.  This doctoral dissertation research project will address this issue and considers the impact of soybean production on regional forest cover.  The doctoral student will focus the project on two principal questions:  (1) By what mechanism does intensification at the intensive margin (with soybean production) influence the expansion of less intensive production strategies, such as ranching?  (2) To what extent is pasture-led forest loss linked to encroachment by more intensive agricultural production on existing pastures?  By answering these questions, the student will seek to ascertain how much Amazonian deforestation is caused by soybean farming, both from direct encroachments into forest and by virtue of compensatory pasture expansion following displacement by soybeans.  He will employ a conceptual framework based on an adaptation of Thunian rent theory and considers the cascading spatial effects that emerge as land uses expand on one another, specifically the  pushing  of soybean farming against existing pastures.  He will use a spatial-temporal regression model to test the relationship between regional expansion of soybean production and increases in cattle populations at distant locations.  His statistical work will be complemented by interviews with producers' organizations in order to ascertain the destination of displaced ranchers, to understand production shifts associated with changes in ownership, and to gain greater behavioral insight into land-use dynamics.   The project intends to fully comprehend the linkage between the expansion of soybean production and forest loss attributable to clearings for new pastures.This project will provide a better understand of the factors affecting Amazonian forest loss.  It will consider the role of soybeans as an underlying factor of pasture-led deforestation, and it will provide new information and insights regarding the mechanisms through which this occurs.  In so doing, the project will bring to light linkages between soybean and cattle that have until now gone largely unseen, hidden by the regional land-use system.  Project results will be useful for policy makers, managers, and members of the public who are attempting to strike a balance between regional economic demands and the preservation of the forest cover.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.

This project will develop a general theory of vector-transmitted pathogens and test that theory using as a model system barley yellow dwarf virus, one of the most economically important diseases of grass crops worldwide. The experiments will be carried out in grasslands in California . The project will test how changes in the environment (moisture and nitrogen availability) interact with changes in plant species diversity and composition to alter aphid behavior, thereby controlling pathogen transmission. The general mathematical theory will allow us to predict the effects of human activity on a variety of plant and animal hosts and their pathogens using a single framework.

434,"This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop a novel bionematicide to control soybean cyst nematode (SCN) in soybeans.   In wide-ranging preliminary research, this bionematicide controlled several nematode stages, including up to 90% of cysts (the primary inoculum source for SCN infestations).  The isolate also controls SCN over a broad range of soil temperatures and SCN races (biotypes), indicating that resistance to the isolate by SCN will be of minimal consequence.  The overall objectives of this project are to 1) demonstrate and determine field parameters for application of the technology and 2) evaluate scale-up production protocol(s) for eventual commercial production.  The advantage of the project is supported through the collaborative efforts of a strong public and private alliance utilizing very diverse professional expertise.  This alliance provides an excellent framework to design and implement field and laboratory testing as well as marketing (and related) strategies to make the project successful.  Results will provide data and structure for an expeditious commercialization track.The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that SCN is one of the most economically important disease pest of soybeans in the world.  Most chemical nematicides have been removed or are little used, resistant cultivars continue to break down to SCN biotypes, and crop rotation is not feasible in most areas due to economic and environmental constraints of applicable crops.  Based on these factors the technology, once commercialized, will have a significant impact in the market.   In the U.S. alone, there are 50,000,000 soybean acres (and growing) infested with SCN, costing farmers an estimated $1.5 billion annually. And, because of the environmentally (or  green ) sound and sustainable nature of the product, the technology will create much broader impacts for the consuming public through the overall reduction of chemical pesticide applications and by providing for a much needed option in soybean cyst management.

435,"The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to investigate biorenewable thermosetting polymers derived from vegetable oils and to explore the use of microencapsulated liquid healing agents in these bio-based polymers as multifunctional composites with the ability to heal damage autonomically (i.e. self-healing bio-based polymers).  These biorenewable polymers will be synthesized from the ring-opening metathesis polymerization of modified castor, soybean, and linseed oils to maximize the thermal and mechanical properties of the resin for structural composite materials.  The research approach then examines whether viable and compatible self-repair mechanisms can be incorporated into these systems to mitigate damage, similar to those developed for synthetic epoxy systems.  If successful, the results of this research will provide biorenewable alternatives to petroleum-based resins.  These bio-based thermosets employ substantial amounts of renewable resources which are substantially cheaper than the petroleum-based feedstocks used in conventional composites, suggesting that this technology should have a huge impact economically and environmentally.  In addition, polymeric structural materials are prone to microcracks and the ability to heal them will enable structures with longer lifetimes and less maintenance.  Though the potential benefits are quite high, there are several practical limitations (such as crack healing kinetics, manufacturing limitations, and stability of the healing agent system to environmental conditions) that need to be overcome in order for the benefits to be realized in society.  This research program is a first step in transitioning this technology to biorenewable polymers and overcoming the limitations that plague the current state-of-the-art in self-healing materials.

Many current approaches to managing groundwater contamination rely on further advances in amendment delivery to initiate and sustain contaminant degradation or immobilization.  The PI?s research integrates laboratory experiments across multiple scales to better understand how engineers can control the placement and flux of remedial amendments within the contaminated subsurface environment.  Emphasis in this project is placed on the addition of alkalinity using oil-in-water emulsions.  Interest in harnessing coupled physical, chemical and biological processes for remediation and stewardship of contaminated sites often necessitates control of pH during treatment and, in some cases, long thereafter.  The central hypothesis of this research is that oil-in-water emulsions can be effective tools for modulating alkalinity release during remediation. This project aims to elucidate the mechanisms that control alkalinity release from oil-in-water emulsions designed to contain nano- or submicron-size carbonate and metal oxide particles.  Project objectives are: (i) assess mechanisms controlling particle stability within soybean oil; (ii) create and optimize emulsions containing alkalinity release particles within a dispersed soybean oil phase; (iii) elucidate the influence of soybean oil composition on the rate of alkalinity release; and (iv) analyze the ability of oil-in-water emulsions to deliver and release alkalinity for control of groundwater pH.

438,"Almost all plants fix CO2 into carbohydrate using an ancient photosynthetic process termed C3 photosynthesis (i.e., C3 plants). A subset of plants utilize a more efficient photosynthetic process termed C4 photosynthesis (i.e., C4 plants). In open sunny environments the rate of CO2 fixation, biomass accumulation, and grain yield in C4 plants is nearly twice that of C3 plants. The increased photosynthetic performance of C4 versus C3 plants is due in part to the evolution of an additional set of photosynthetic CO2 fixation enzymes referred to as the C4 pathway. Despite the inherently higher productivity of C4 versus C3 plants, there are only four agronomically important C4 crop species: maize, Sorghum, sugar cane, and switch grass. All other crop species (e.g., rice, soybean, wheat) are C3 plants. Thus an ongoing research goal of plant scientists is to breed or engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop plants for improving yields. Efforts to date have fallen short in part because of the lack of understanding on how the C4 pathway is controlled in leaves for optimizing use of available sunlight. The ultimate aim of this project is to elucidate how such regulation works. A first step in this endeavor, and the goal of this one-year project, is to develop maize plants that are deficient in two interrelated light-responsive C4 pathway enzymes, pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) and the PPDK regulatory protein (RP). It is hypothesized that these enzymes control the rate of the CO2 fixation by the C4 pathway in response to sunlight. Using RNA interference, a genetic engineering method, stable lines of maize plants will be isolated with reduced levels of PPDK or RP enzyme. These plants will be subsequently assessed for photosynthetic performance. From these analyses, an accurate picture of how PPDK and RP confer sunlight-responsive C4 pathway regulation is expected to emerge. This knowledge will be critical for projects now underway that seek to introduce a functional C4 pathway into leaves of C3 crop species.

However, the use of PN in pediatric populations, especially premature infants, is frequently associated with liver injury that may ultimately result in liver failure that can lead to transplantation and/or death.  Studies suggest that soybean oil containing intravenous fat emulsions (IFE) may be a major contributing factor.  Recent experience suggests that discontinuing soybean based IFE and switching to a product comprised of omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oils (Omegaven) may be effective in reversing preexisting PN associated liver disease through a combination of factors, including improved triglyceride clearance coupled with anti-inflammatory properties.  In 2002, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) stated that 20,000 individuals in the US were supported by PN for intestinal failure and of these, approximately 30-60% of children develop hepatic dysfunction after receiving prolonged courses of PN.  This project plans to study 30 such pediatric patients over a 3 year period with preexisting liver disease due to PN use.  The primary aim is to assess the efficacy of the fish oil fat emulsion in reversing cholestasis due to PN use.  Using an open label study design, patients with PN cholestasis will have the conventional soybean oil lipid emulsion stopped and be treated with the fish oil based IFE.  Time to reversal of cholestasis of subjects treated with the fish oil will be compared to 60 similar subjects (contemporary historical controls) who continued to receive soybean based IFE after developing cholestasis.  Other hepatic, growth, and safety outcomes will be also assessed.  Based on preliminary results, it would be difficult to perform a prospective randomized trial with these patients.

The proposed research project, a post-transcriptional control of cancer, is in a promising field and has the potential to elucidate a novel role of protein synthesis control by dietary soy in breast cancer metastasis, contributing to eradication of this deadly disease.Research PlanBackground:  At the molecular level, soy isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and glycitein) have been shown to have estrogenic/antiestrogenic, antioxidant, and anti-angiogenic activities and may affect cancer due to their effects on apoptosis, cell cycle progression, growth, and differentiation.  Previous research data from Dr. Dharmawardhane's laboratory demonstrated differential effects of dietary soy isoflavones genistein, daidzein, and combined soy on metastatic cancer progression in nude mice.  Genistein decreased while daidzein increased mammary tumor growth and metastasis.  Combined soy isoflavones did not affect primary tumor growth but increased metastasis.  PI3-K pathway real-time PCR array analysis and western blotting of excised tumors show that genistein significantly downregulated the expression of genes implicated in cell survival, proliferation, and invasion.  In contrast, daidzein significantly upregulated genes that regulate proliferation and protein synthesis including eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F members eIF4G1 and eIF4E.  Combined soy treatment significantly increased eIF4E expression.  eIF4F members (eIF4A, B, G, E) have been shown to be overexpressed in advanced cancer and to be essential for translation of a subset of proteins that regulate cellular bioenergetics, survival, and proliferation.  An important regulatory signaling pathway for translation is the AKT/mTOR, and deregulation of this pathway is associated with increased transformation and oncogenesis.  We believe that soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein exert disparate effects on translation initiation via PI3K/Akt/MAPK pathways to mTOR signaling as well as by direct regulation of eIF4F and eIF4G levels.Objective/Hypothesis:  Our hypothesis is that soy isoflavones modulate breast cancer progression by specific regulation of the eIF4F eukaryotic initiation factor complex to affect the synthesis of cancer regulatory.  The objective for demonstrating that genistein reduces breast cancer progression while daidzein increases breast cancer progression by affecting expression and activity of eIF4F initiation factors will be achieved by the following specific aims.Specific Aims:  (1) Delineate the effects of genistein, daidzein, glycitein, or combined soy isoflavones on Akt/mTOR signaling.  (2) Investigate the effects of genistein, daidzein, glycitein, or combined soy isoflavones on expression of mRNAs that are specifically regulated by the eIF4F initiation complex.  (3) Demonstrate that differential regulation of eIF4E and eIF4G levels by soy isoflavones can directly contribute to breast cancer progression.Study Design:  The study design consists of a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of protein arrays to total and phospho forms of mTOR signaling pathway in response to vehicle and soy individual and combined isoflavones.  Ribosomal preps to analyze expression of mRNA associated with ribosomes for proteins translated by eIF4F complex and investigation of the effects of vehicle or soy isoflavones after targeted silencing of eIF4E or eIF4G will be conducted.  This design involves a range of biochemistry and cancer biology techniques guaranteed to train and prepare the PI for a future career as a breast cancer researcher.Impact:  This research promises to deliver novel information regarding potential molecular mechanisms by which soy isoflavones affect established breast cancers.  This study is expected to generate important information as to the controversial benefits of soy foods as chemopreventives for established breast cancer.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
443,"Background:  The ingestion of food antigens plays an essential role in the development of eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) as total removal of dietary antigens by using an amino acid-based oral formula improves clinical symptoms and esophageal histology in 98% of patients with EE within a month.  EE is thought to be mediated by both immunoglobulin (IgE) and non-IgE-mediated food allergy.  The majority of patients with EE (50%-80%) are atopic based on the co-existence of EE with atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and/or asthma.  In addition, approximately two-thirds of EE patients have food allergen-specific IgE based on immediate hypersensitivity skin tests or measurement of allergen specific IgE in blood.  Approximately 75% of EE subjects had increased total IgE levels.  Approximately two-thirds of children with EE have positive immediate hypersensitivity skin tests to at least one food allergen.  The mean number of positive food immediate hypersensitivity skin tests ranges from 3-6 positive tests per subject with EE.  The most common foods reported to be positive in EE by skin immediate hypersensitivity skin test included common food allergens (i.e., peanut, egg, milk, soy, wheat) as well as beans, rye, and beef.  Dietary therapy is considered an effective therapy in children diagnosed with EE.Objective/Hypothesis:  Although studies of the genetics of EE are in their infancy, the importance of genes to the development of EE has been demonstrated in studies showing an important association of EE with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the eotaxin-3 gene, a chemokine gene important to eosinophil chemotaxis into tissues such as the esophagus.  In this proposal, we hypothesize that in EE there is a gene polymorphism (transforming growth factor beta 1, or TGF-b1) environment (IgE food sensitization) interaction that contributes to increased IgE-mediated TGF-b expression in the esophagus and increased esophageal remodeling in a subset of EE subjects.  As esophageal stricture formation is an important complication of remodeling in EE (6%-12% of children; 33% of adults), resulting in food impactions and emergency room visits, identifying genetic polymorphisms in TGF-b in EE may allow the early identification of food sensitized children at risk for the development of this significant complication of EE.Specific Aims:  The focus of the genetic studies in EE we have proposed has two specific aims, namely:  (1) Do food-sensitized EE subjects with the TGF-b TT genotype have increased levels of esophageal expression of TGF-b and pSmad?  (2) Do food-sensitized EE subjects with the TGF-b TT genotype have increased levels of remodeling?Study Design:  We will characterize SNPs in a candidate gene of esophageal remodeling (TGFb) in patients with EE and food sensitization patients with EE and no food sensitization (n=381) matched for age, gender, and ethnic background.  Levels of esophageal remodeling and expression of TGF-b and pSMAD will be quantitated in esophageal biopsies.Impact:  This study focuses on increasing our understanding of a gene (TGF-b) environment (food IgE sensitization) associated with remodeling and stricture formation in the esophagus in EE.  If this gene environment interaction contributes to esophageal remodeling and esophageal stricture formation, their identification may lead to biomarkers to detect patients at risk of this complication, as well as potential novel therapies.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
444,"Plant viruses in the Carmovirus, Panicovirus and Umbravirus genera are economically important viruses of soybean, legumes and lentils in US and other parts of the world causing up to 100% crop loss. These viruses occur and cause economic impact wherever these and similar crops are grown. In addition to its economical importance, viruses described here use an array of unconventional tools to express encoded genes. Little is known how carmo-, panico-, and umbraviruses are able to recruit translation machinery in the absence of canonical modifications in their genome. Even less is known of how they are able to break resistance encoded by natural recessive resistance genes. The success of plant breeding for improved avirulence determinants depends on how much we know about virus gene replication and expression. The purpose of this study is to determine the roles of RNA sequences from these three different viral genera in cap-independent translation initiation, their interaction with the protein synthesis machinery and how these interactions modify RNA structure using combination of structural and functional methods such as X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis. A detailed understanding of mechanism of cap-independent translation employed by these plant viruses will make it possible to 1. identify key regulatory steps and find common themes for viral translation shared with other economically important plant viruses that will ultimately suggest new ways to control viral disease and reduce crop losses in US and world; and 2. use the RNA translation signals to control expression of nonviral genes in transgenic plants expressing any gene of agricultural interest.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
445,"A third of all plant viruses are part of the Potyviridae family. These viruses cause substantial losses in a wide variety of crops such as soybean, potato, cabbage, plum and other fruits and vegetables. Generally, genetic resistance is used to minimize the impact of potyviruses in conjunction with pesticides to control the insect carriers of the virus. Both of the control methods can be overcame due to adaptation of the insects or evolution of the virus. An essential aspect of the virus life cycle needs to be targeted for effective control and to achieve this, better understanding of potyvirus molecular biology will be required. A new gene, pipo, that was recently discovered is present in all the members of Potyviridae. Previous data show that pipo expression is required for proper establishment of infection in plants. Studying the mechanism of pipo expression will provide more knowledge about potyviruses and protein translation.

446,"This project will develop new animal feed protein supplements that, as co-products of biofuel production, allow the entire algae biomass to be used as a high-value, sustainable commodity. Microalgae are much more productive than other bioenergy crops. We have demonstrated sustained production of marine microalgae at pilot scale, order 1 ton per month; and we have extracted the oil and have processed it to produce various types of liquid fuels. The important purpose of this project is to now demonstrate the value of the remaining co-product. We propose to develop new animal feed supplements from the defatted algae biomass. In a related project, we recently demonstrated the nutritional and cost-effectiveness of defatted algae biomass as a replacement for fishmeal in aquatic animal feeds. This project expects to develop animal feed supplements for the two largest feed markets, swine and poultry. Results from a preliminary 3-week trial with weanling swine were excellent. We will now produce algae of several different types, formulate feeds, and run numerous feed trials at Cornell's experimental swine and poultry farms. We will also perform evaluations of techno-economics and sustainability, including comprehensive life cycle analysis of the animal feed production pathway. Algae biofuels, in our technology pathway, have unique energy and environmental benefits over other biofuels. Unlike conventional agriculture, microalgae cultivation uses seawater; it does not compete for freshwater, uses no pesticides, herbicides, or GMOs, and wastes no fertilizers. Algae must first deplete all nutrients in the medium to achieve the highest rates of oil production, so nutrients are exhausted from the growth medium before discharge to the environment. As an added environmental benefit and - unlike any terrestrial biofuel crop - algae can fully utilize industrial point-sources of carbon dioxide, sequestering and thus avoiding CO2 emissions. Algae cultivation requires far less land - at least 10&#61620; less land - than any other biofuel crop. Moreover, algae can be grown on barren, infertile land - they do not require arable land. The potential benefits of algae over vegetable proteins in compound livestock feeds are significant. For every hectare in algae production, arable land would be released from agriculture needs - equivalent to >40 hectares for maize, or >80 hectares for soybeans. Algae-based livestock feeds would thus spare valuable agricultural land to produce crops for human consumption. Optimized feed products are aimed at benefiting human health by producing meat and eggs with improved nutritional quality.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
447,"Legumes (Fabaceae) comprise one of the largest and most diverse families of vascular plant on the planet, with an estimated 18,000 species spread across all continents except for Antarctica. The Papilionoidaea legume subfamily includes the majority of legumes of agronomic value, such as alfalfa, soybean, chickpea, garden pea, and lentil. Estimates of the dietary intake of legumes show that this family is responsible for ~1/3 of the total protein intake in the human diet. In addition to their human dietary importance, certain legumes (e.g. alfalfa) are major forage crops important in sustaining livestock agriculture worldwide. Most legume species have the ability to form symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This is an unusual yet important feature, shared among few plants outside the legume family, enabling them to thrive in environments with minimal nitrogen input. Due to their nitrogen-fixing ability, they are also used as a rotation crop to enhance available soil nitrogen. Barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) has been studied extensively as a model legume since the 1990s, and work on this plant and its associated microbiota has resulted in significant advances in understanding of the basic biology of the legume, mechanisms of plant-microbe communication, and the biology of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. It is now recognized that bacteria and fungi accumulate in large, diverse populations at the plant root-soil interface (the rhizosphere). This microbial community accumulates to take advantage of the rich collection of nutrients secreted by the plant roots (plant root exudate). Some plant root exudate chemicals are demonstrated to act as signals to specific microbes. These signals can result in alterations to the rhizosphere microbial community that enhance plant nutrient uptake, aid in suppression of plant pathogens, and enable a symbiotic relationship between plant and microbe resulting in nitrogen fixation by certain bacteria in legume plant root nodules. We aim to identify genetic features of the plant that enable optimal microbial community assembly in the Medicago truncatula rhizosphere. While our work will be done with a legume, we strongly believe that the research will be relevant to rhizosphere microbial community assembly and function in all agriculture crops. This work will result in an increased knowledge of signaling pathways between plant and microbe that enhance plant health, plant productivity and sustainability of the agricultural system. Ultimately, crop breeders and plant genetic engineers will use knowledge generated from this research to select for crop varieties that will optimize their rhizosphere microbial community to enhance these features.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
448,"Agriculture has seen rapid increases in productivity over the last few decades. The process of technology adoption among farmers is at the heart of evaluating these productivity gains. The last 15 years have seen the rising role of agro-biotechnology. U.S. farmers have exhibited high adoption rates of new agro-biotechnology. The current biotech revolution in agriculture has been associated with the rise of large biotech companies that invested heavily in private R&D to improve crop productivity through genetic modifications. The GM seeds produced by biotech firms are patented. They are sold to farmers in seed markets that have become highly concentrated. This has raised questions about whether biotech seed companies could exercise market power and price their seeds in a way that would reduce farm profit. The interactions of both supply-side and demand-side factors and the current biotechnology revolution have raised several critical questions: What is the exact nature of the technology adoption process Who captures the benefits of new agro-biotechnology How does agro-biotech adoption affect farm profitability and agricultural productivity How is agro-biotechnology going to affect the future competitiveness of U.S. agriculture These questions are particularly relevant in the U.S. corn and soybean sectors, which have seen a rapid adoption of GM seeds over the last 15 years. This proposed research will examine the process of biotechnology adoption, productivity, and farm profitability in U.S. agriculture, with the objective of providing information that would answer these questions. To proceed, we combine test plot data with an expansive proprietary dataset of corn and soybean seed purchases to measure the rate of productivity growth since 2000. We will update and extend our previous research that evaluated the effects of market structure on pricing in U.S. GM seed markets. Our new research will focus on analyzing the factors affecting how the benefits of GM technology are shared between seed firms and farmers both spatially and over time. We will then develop conceptual and empirical models of dynamic adoption to evaluate the factors that cause farmers to adopt various seeds with or without GM traits. Finally, we bring together each of the above parts to simulate GM adoption under alternative market scenarios, and infer implications for farm profitability, agricultural productivity and the competitiveness of U.S. agriculture. Our analysis will shed new light on the factors that impact adoption of biotechnology seeds in U.S. agriculture. The model results will help generate new insights into technological adoption and diffusion in agriculture and its implications for farm productivity and profitability, and the performance of the U.S. agricultural sector. Our simulation analysis of the interaction of both supply-side and demand-side factors and the current biotechnology revolution can evaluate the dynamic effects of that an increasingly complex and concentrated seed industry pricing behavior has on aggregated estimates of technology diffusion in the US.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
449,"In October of 2009, an invasive stinkbug from Asia, Megacopta cribraria was first identified on kudzu vine in North America and has since been observed in 40 counties of Georgia and South Carolina. In parts of Asia, Megacopta are devastating pests of soybeans, and in its native range, this ability to utilize soybeans is dependent on the bugs harboring specific, beneficial bacteria in their guts. Given the rapid spread of this pest insect, our first goal is to develop an understanding of where this pest came from, which will provide information on what agricultural crops it attacks in its native habitat. We will also study the genetic diversity of the bugs and their bacteria in North America to understand how they are spreading and whether some of the bacteria are similar to those known in Asia to facilitate utilization of soybeans. We will also develop genetic resources for researchers that are interested in understanding how these insects maintain their bacteria. These genetic resources could provide insight into potential targets for genetic-based biocontrol efforts. Beyond Megacopta, this project will serve as a model for understanding how invading species must be studied not in isolation but in association with the microbes that they harbor. Because many pest insects are dependent on symbiotic bacteria, the success of other pest insects is also likely dependent on the ability of their microbes to adapt to agricultural crops in new environments.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
450,"Soybean is the world's largest oilseed and legume crop and the second largest crop in the US. As such, understanding seed development in soybean is of paramount importance. Gene expression studies in Arabidopsis seeds imply that epigenetic mechanisms involving the modification of DNA or histones play a role in seed development. Studies in Arabidopsis and maize also show that transposable elements (TEs), which are targeted by endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), influence the expression of nearby genes through DNA or histone modifications. We hypothesize that changes in endogenous siRNAs targeting TEs and repeats in the genome influence gene expression during soybean seed development. The goal of the project is to determine whether the flux of endogenous small RNAs and the resulting changes in epigenetic states play a role in regulating gene expression programs during seed maturation and germination when storage reserves are being accumulated and remobilized, respectively. The proposed research is the first to focus on the role of endogenous siRNAs in seed filling and seed germination and will lay the foundation for a full appreciation of new regulatory mechanisms that program gene expression in the seed.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
451,"Economic and environmental concerns with current annual-based crop production systems has lead to a call for the development of production systems and landscapes organized around optimizing a combination of food, bioproducts, and ecosystem services. We will focus on the sustainable integration of diversified perennial-based cropping systems that supply feedstock for bioenergy and bioproducts as well as offer ecosystem services including those that offer crop protection for other crops such as soybean. Our goal is to 1) develop an agronomically-realistic platform for the production of perennial bioenergy crops, and 2) support a knowledge-based strategy for integration of bioenergy cropping systems in a way that supports ecosystem services that lead to reduced pest pressures in surrounding crops. The ecosystem service that we are targeting is biological control of the soybean aphid, a devastating invasive pest. We will focus on four bioenergy cropping systems; a polyculture mix comprising forbs, legumes, and tall grass prairie species, a monoculture of willow, a mix of willow and herbaceous polyculture crops in an alley cropping configuration and a monoculture of soybean that will serve as the control. The study emphasizes two main objectives. First, we will compare crop growth and productivity of the various bioenergy cropping systems. This information will be used to estimate net energy balance and biomass conversion rates. Second, we will compare biological control of soybean aphid adjacent to three classes of bioenergy plantings and the control site. This will be done using a combination of sampling to determine the abundance of soybean aphids and their natural enemies, determinations of the extent of resource use in the biofuel plantings, and estimation of a biocontrol services index, which defines the contribution of surrounding landscapes to biological control. The biological control objective will also include releases of approved, exotic parasitoids of the soybean aphid. An understanding of the implications of diversified multi-species bioenergy cropping systems in the context of providing crop protection and ecosystem services benefits is critical to the long-term sustainability of multi-use landscapes. This research will provide information that will help make decisions on biomass cropping systems design, placement, and potential scale of influence as it relates to the surrounding landscape. We will conduct workshops through a partnership with the University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment to provide information to farmers, landowners, lawyers, business professionals and policy experts that will lead to more effective planning as it relates to the long-term sustainability of agricultural systems in the future.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
452,"Landuse changes associated with increasing adoption of bioenergy crops will continue to accelerate in the future. These changes will alter the what agricultural landscapes look like in the near future. The consequences of those changes on our ability to provide consistent biomass yields and other ecosystem services is unknown. What is known is that as the structure of the landscape changes so does the capacity of beneficial arthropods (e.g., ladybeetle predators) to carry out their functions. Although this is expect to negatively affect natural biological control, this has never been demonstrated, nor have the consequences for biomass yields. In this research we will examine how landscape structure influences crop yields by combining on-the-ground measurements of insect pests (aphids) of soybean (an important bioenergy crop) and crop physiology modeling. From these relationships we will develop models predicting how landscape structure affects crop yields through the effects on insects. Using remote sensing tools we will validate our models and develop regional predictions of crop yields.

453,"Flowering response to seasonal photoperiod changes is a critical factor to environmental adaptation of crop plants. Flowering is a key trait that determines plant's survival and productivity, and a major target of the domestication process of crop species by human selection. Flowering gene pathways are one of the best-understood molecular networks in plants; nevertheless, applications of such knowledge for modern agricultural use have been limited, largely because most of our current knowledge has been restricted to model species, and studies in crop species are well behind. Soybean is an ideal crop to address this problem. One approach to increase soybean production is to extend the seed filling period between the flowering time and the beginning of seed maturation. Modification of photoperiod responsiveness would make this possible by advancing the flowering time, allowing cultivation of soybean at wider latitudes while improving yield. To obtain genetic tools and information to allow modification of flowering time independently of seed maturation through molecular breeding, we will elucidate global gene expression patterns on floral transition in soybean using transcriptome sequencing technique by comparing the standard variety and known flowering QTLs, and construct the soybean flowering gene networks. Our approaches will clarify the genetic basis of environmental adaptation of soybean and provide valuable information to breed superior germplasm that is highly adaptive to diverse environments to maximize the yields.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

455,"The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates increased reliance on biofuels to reduce our dependency on foreign oil. Biofuel feedstocks produced from annual food crops such as corn and soybean offer only marginal improvements in net energy production because their cultivation requires relatively high inputs of fossil fuels. Because production of these feedstocks competes with food production on prime agricultural lands, their use will stimulate land conversion and generate a  carbon debt  because soil carbon (C) sinks are diminished when unmanaged land is converted to production agriculture. It has been suggested that prairie grasses can provide a sustainable, low-input biofuel feedstock, while at the same time sequestering large amounts of soil C. Temperate grasslands have an enormous capacity to capture C from the atmosphere, largely because the extensive root systems of long-lived prairie plants facilitate belowground C sequestration. A better understanding of the factors controlling soil C dynamics is necessary to develop sustainable feedstock production practices. Mycorrhizal symbioses facilitate plant growth in infertile and droughty soil and they also mediate soil C accrual; consequently, these plant-fungal associations need to be considered in the design of feedstock management practices. We have studied the importance of mycorrhizas to prairie ecosystems, as well as their contribution to belowground C storage for over 25 years.

456,"Switchgrass and cottonwood have high potential for sequestering C when managed as cellulosic biofuel feedstocks. Relative to conventional agricultural crops used for biofuel production, switchgrass and cottonwood have low nutrient and agricultural chemical requirements, which foster minimal fossil fuel expenditures associated with farm equipment. Additionally, switchgrass and cottonwood have high annual biomass growth rates, which promote C sequestration in biomass. Due to the deep, dense rooting habit of switchgrass and expansive rooting of cottonwood, these species may also foster long-term C storage in soils. For a comprehensive understanding of the potential of switchgrass and cottonwood management systems to sequester C, fluxes of C associated with these cropping/management systems need to be monitored throughout multiple harvesting cycles on a variety of sites. Monitoring of C sequestration and fluxes necessitates monitoring of : (1) above- and below-ground biomass C, (2) long-term storage forms of C in soil, (3) greenhouse gas emissions, and (4)  carbon costs  of feedstock production associated with fossil fuel emissions of equipment used in management and harvest activities. The objective of this proposed project is to monitor these phenomena throughout several harvesting cycles of switchgrass and the first harvesting cycle of cottonwood grown as monocultures and agroforests. We will also compare C sequestration and greenhouse gas emission of switchgrass and cottonwood cropping systems to that associated with a soybean-grain sorghum rotation in order to elucidate the potential impacts of the conversion of conventional cropping systems to biofuel feedstock production systems on C sequestration. This study would likely provide needed information for the development of agricultural policies associated with biofuel feedstock production in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV). This project has the potential to yield several improvements in the long-term sustainability of U.S. agriculture and food systems. Development of viable management systems for growing cottonwood and switchgrass crops for biofuel production on marginal soils of the LMAV will allow productive soils to remain in conventional agriculture to sustain food production capability of the region. Producing switchgrass and cottonwood in the LMAV could reduce nutrient transport in surface and subsurface waters due to the relatively low fertilizer needs of these crops and the lack of annual tillage and reestablishment that occurs with the annual crops currently grown on these soils. Adding switchgrass and cottonwood to the landscape of the LMAV can also contribute to improving C sequestration capacity of the region because switchgrass and cottonwood have higher C sequestration potential than conventional agricultural crops.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
457,"In addition to enhancing national security by providing a renewable domestic alternative to imported petroleum, sustainable bioenergy systems address important environmental issues. Agricultural bioenergy localizes energy production, providing rural economies with a new income source. In contrast to first generation bioenergy crops (corn, soybeans), perennial grass bioenergy crops provide not only greater net energy returns but also environmental benefits including carbon sequestration in soil and improved soil quality. Bioenergy forecasts envision the use of marginal lands (former croplands that have fallen out of production because they are unable to support sustainable economic returns in conventional agriculture) for bioenergy production in order to avoid food versus fuel land use issues. In the Northeastern US (NE), most soils deemed marginal suffer from hydrologic characteristics that lead to problems linked to their moisture status: excessive wetness in spring, summer and/or fall, summer drought susceptibility, etc. Unfortunately, the impacts of these marginal soil characteristics on yield, carbon cycling and trace gas emissions have been given little attention for perennial grass feedstocks for the NE and are needed to accurately assess regional production potentials and environmental impacts. Conversion of marginal lands in the NE to perennial grass bioenergy crops is not merely a future possibility - it is underway, as evidenced by collaborating private firm (Beneterra Agritech) establishing 10,000 to 20,000 acres of new plantings in New York State over the next several years. This ongoing land conversion provides not only the challenge to determine the long-term impacts and sustainability of these efforts, but also the opportunity to observe the effects of land conversion from the outset. This research is intended to measure trends in two important environmental impacts of perennial grass feedstock production: 1) accumulation and sequestration of carbon in the soil, and 2) the emissions of nitrous oxide and other trace gases that strongly govern the overall emissions footprint of the bioenergy production system. Both of these impacts along with yield trends will be determined in the context of marginal NE soils and using current production practices. Five years of testing will be carried out in large field-scale experiments primarily using switchgrass (a warm season perennial grass), with results compared to non-converted lands. Soil sampling will monitor trends in soil carbon along natural soil moisture gradients, allowing determination of soil moisture impacts. Two complementary methods will be used for measuring trace gas emissions: continuous field-scale monitoring of nitrous oxide, and periodic field chamber studies measuring both nitrous oxide and methane across fields and treatments. GIS-based modeling will be used to provide a tools that links soil properties, topography and hydrology to observed yields, carbon sequestration and emissions.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

459,"The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys Stal (BMSB), is a highly polyphagous stink bug of Asian origin. In its native range of China, Korea and Japan, it is considered an agricultural pest of soybeans, apples and other tree fruit and various ornamental crops. BMSB is also a nuisance pest in these countries due to its overwintering behavior of entering enclosed structures such as residences in large numbers each fall. BMSB was first observed in the US in Allentown, PA around 1996 but was initially misidentified as a native pentatomid species. Following correct identification in 2001, it has been found in several Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States and in CA, FL, OH, OR, TN and MS. In several of these states, its presence in agriculture crops has been confirmed and has been observed causing late season damage to apples and pears in NJ, PA, and WV. Traditionally, management of stink bugs in soybeans, tree fruit and horticultural crops was accomplished through the use of targeted applications of organophosphate insects. However, these materials have been slowly phased out resulting in increased damage by stink bugs. The addition of BMSB with its high rates of reproduction and survival puts these crops at greater risk. In the laboratory, replacements for organophosphate insecticides exhibit high levels of toxicity to BMSB but have not tested under field conditions. In Asia, BMSB is attacked by several egg parasitoids and a tachnid fly. Little information is known however, about endemic natural enemies in the US. The use of microbial agents is another potential non-chemical control method but again no screening for possible candidates has been conducted. BSMB has become a severe residential nuisance pest wherever it occurs. Currently, there are no adequate pest management alternatives to prevent overwintering BMSB adults from entering residences in areas where they occur. The use of insecticides to control BMSB has proven effective in Japan; however, this usage is not currently labeled in the US and is not currently an option. A non-insecticidal management method is the potential use of mass trapping. If successful, residents in PA, NJ, MD, DE VA and elsewhere where BMSB occurs will directly benefit due to reductions in illegal pesticide use, a reductions in potential environmental problems, and reductions in entomophobia and exposure to pesticides by affected homeowners thereby improving their health and decreasing calls to county cooperative extension offices and other agencies. These issues make it imperative that research be conducted this year in order to begin development of management strategies. This importance is highlighted by PI's Leskey and Hamilton having received a NE IPM Center grant to form a BMSB working group charged with identifying current abilities and research needs. Therefore, we propose to 1) investigate the biology of BMSB on and the potential susceptibility of soybeans, apple, peach and pear to feeding by BMSB, 2) determine the current and projected distribution and pest status of BMSB on soybeans, tree fruit and peppers, and 3) develop and evaluate various BMSB management strategies.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
460,"Mississippi has over 2.9 million citizens, representing just over a million individual households. Each of these households is faced with insect and plant disease problems that can adversely affect the health, economy, and quality of life of Mississippi citizens. In addition, over three million acres of major agronomic row crops: soybeans, corn, and cotton, are produced in the state annually, and each of these crops is subject to attack by multiple insect pests that can greatly reduce yields and profitability. Because of these situations there is an ongoing need to develop and maintain effective IPM educational programs for each of these areas: IPM of Agronomic Crops, IPM of Insect Pests in Consumer/Urban Environments, IPM of Plant Diseases in Consumer/Urban Environments, and IPM in Public Health Pests. The overall purpose of the Mississippi State University's Integrated Pest Management Program is to provide Mississippi citizens and producers with unbiased information on how to avoid and/or solve insect and disease problems in an effective, cost-effective manner that is sustainable and environmentally acceptable. This helps save money in household budgets, improve profitability in commercial crop production, protect property, improve quality of life, protect human health, and protect Mississippi's environment by reducing pesticide use. Information on how to effectively manage and control pest problems is delivered to producers and homeowners and producers through a variety of ways. These include, but are not limited to: extension publications, educational newsletters, web-based information, educational programs, field visits, and individual consultations. The expected outcome of the Mississippi State University Integrated Pest Management Program is that producers and homeowners who use the training, information and recommendations provided will be able to avoid or effectively manage pest problems affecting their lives or the commodities they produce.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
461,"The current state of the art of soybean processing requires heat processing to eliminate anti-nutrition factors and make the protein available for digestion. The proposed research will investigate the opportunity to process a new soybean variety that has been traditionally bred (not genetically modified) to eliminate and/or significantly reduce these anti-nutrition factors. This research will investigate applying new and new-to-this-use, simpler, ambient or cool, less energy intensive processing in combination with these new soybean varieties to create feeds and feed ingredients with improved protein quality. Applying ambient processing technologies to these soybeans to deliver the next generation of soybean food ingredients and/or feed components is a key step in realizing the full commercial benefit of this material. Proof of concept work has been conducted in various university labs using bench-top processes (Herkelman, 1992) that must be validated with research and development using small pilot-plant and commercial scale processes. In this Phase II project we will again use small-scale processing to further the validation of the concept with the next generation of low trypsin inhibitor soybean and reduced oligosaccharide soybean. We will complete digestibility studies on the second generation RTI soybean in poultry and swine and with reduced oligosaccharides (ROS) soybeans in poultry. This will be followed by controlled, lab-scale feeding trials in swine and poultry research facilities at collaborating universities to validate the acceptability of ambient processed soybeans in monogastric diets. Then, in year two, we?ll scale up to pre-commercial feeding trials with livestock feeders as larger quantities of these soybeans become available ? to demonstrate commercial viability in preparation for commercial rollout in 2012-13. This will scale up to truckload quantities and allow validation of both commercial processing and feed efficacy. In summary, this research and development will demonstrate and validate the combined benefits of reduced trypsin inhibitor (RTI) soybeans, low oligosaccharide (LOS) soybeans, and ambient, non-thermal temperature processing to create a new generation of soy ingredients for feed (and possible future food) use by means that require less energy use than conventional soy products.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

463,"According to the National Petrochemical Refiners' Association, the US uses around 2.5 billion gallons (19 billion pounds) of lubricant products; much of this volume ends up in the environment as  lost-in-use  products. At the same time, the United States is the world's leading producer of soybeans, generating over 12 billion pounds annually, and accounting for nearly half of world soybean production. Soybean oil, along with some of the newer non-edible oils, can replace a large portion of these lubricants. Having higher value than fuels, biolubricants can create market opportunities for farmers and reducing our dependence on oil imports. Additional oilseeds can be grown throughout the US, to provide renewable oil supplies with desirable properties for lubricant applications, as well. Throughout the Program's earlier years, it's primary focus was on development and commercialization of lubricants and greases. It is anticipated that market growth will continue for biobased lubricants, amplifying the demand for quality assurance support to ensure that biobased products meet industry performance standards. In addition, areas of biolubricants research remain relatively unexplored, i.e., biodegradability and toxicity, and health and safety questions persist. Some of the benefits derived from soybean-based lubricants are summarized below: 1. Biolubricants possess inherent performance benefits that add value to lubricant products, such as substantially higher viscosity index, better lubricity, and better adherence to metals than conventional alternatives. 2. Biolubricants offer environmental, health and safety value, including low toxicity and higher flash and fire points. NABL's soy products are formulated to be  readily  biodegradable according to ASTM and OECD standards and lower in toxicity according to EPA and other standards. 3. Value-added opportunities for farmers and agri-business are realized, providing potential for rural development and enhanced commodity prices. A new genetic high oleic variety soybean cultivated exclusively for lubricant use provides nearly $1/bu premium to growers, with minimal yield drag. 4.

464,"People in all walks of life have to deal with pests and, therefore, have to make pest management decisions. Row crop farmers, who primarily grow corn and soybeans in Indiana, must deal with a number of pests that impact their yields, which in turn affects their profits. Because economic returns on corn and soybeans are not great on a per acre basis, farmers need to be sure to make wise management decisions. Fruit and vegetable growers have greater income per acre, but face greater pest related challenges because they have to worry about the quality and appearance of their crops in addition to yields. Homeowners are confronted with many pest related challenges in their yard and gardens and often do not have the knowledge or experience to properly diagnose the problem and arrive at a satisfactory management decision. The Purdue IPM program addresses the educational needs of all these groups through the various types of publications, websites, and educational programs. Field crop producers will receive training in a number of formats, including intensive workshops and hands-on, in-field training. The goal is to help farmers remain profitable, while managing their pest problems in an environmentally friendly manner. Fruit and vegetable growers have many venues for interaction with Extension IPM specialists. Again, the goal is for the producers to remain profitable, but there is a greater emphasis on food safety since these products are eaten directly by people. For example, a class of relatively toxic insecticides known as the organophosphates has been the primary insecticides used on apples for many years. As recently as 1997, 85% of the insecticides used on apples in Indiana were organophosphates. One of the goals of this project is to reduce that percentage to below 25% by 2014.

It is important to develop a new interdisciplinary paradigm to capture the value of U.S. soybeans and build a competitive advantage for U.S. soybean farmers in the global market. The overall goal of the National Center for Soybean Biotechnology (NCSB) is to integrate genomics and breeding research to develop superior soybeans to benefit U.S. farmers in maintaining global competitiveness and expand utilization of the soybean crop.

What was of particular concern for 2009, was that rust was identified very early in the growing season on kudzu in both Florida and Louisiana at higher levels of incidence and severity. This pattern has continued and some of the data presented at the 2009 Soybean Rust Symposium covered actual yield losses due to soybean rust in a few states. Despite the 2008-2009 regionally limited occurrence of soybean rust, there have been many discoveries and much progress has been made towards our understanding of how soybean rust overwinters, streamlined methods of monitoring, and how plants can resist this potentially threatening soybean pathogen.

Maine farms produce a wide variety of agricultural commodities including grain crops such as corn, soybeans, and canola, fruit crops such as apples, strawberries, and blueberries, as well as broccoli, dry beans, peas, and multiple other vegetable crops. The potato industry, however, is the top agricultural sector in the State of Maine with a total economic value to the state of over $500 million, including farm-gate receipts of $100 million, and employing over 6,000 individuals. In order to ensure the sustainability and economic viability of Maine's potato industry, timely and efficient management of pests is crucial. A successful IPM program can not only potentially reduce production costs through decreased pesticide applications but, through the use of effective monitoring techniques, can ultimately save growers millions of dollars in potential crop losses. Integrated pest management programs, such as those offered by the University of Maine Cooperative Extension Service, play a pivotal role in supporting the Maine potato industry by offering assistance directly to growers. The University of Maine Cooperative Extension's Potato Integrated Pest Management Program impacts approximately 56,000 acres of potatoes. The program employs 18 seasonal program aides, maintains nearly 150 specialized insect traps, coordinates a statewide network of electronic weather stations, and surveys 100 potato fields on a weekly basis for weeds, insects and diseases. The data produced helps IPM scientists track potential pest outbreaks and helps provide growers with current information on specific and timely treatments in order to minimize the number of pesticide applications and maximize potato yield. The current market demand for perfect, pest and damage-free produce and crops, combined with the public's desire to decrease pesticide use for human health and environmental reasons, creates a difficult challenge for Maine potato growers. Homeowners and growers are increasingly at odds over the application of pesticides on farms adjacent to new or existing housing developments. The Potato IPM Program plays an integral role in ensuring that Maine's potato crop is pest and damage free while attempting to minimize the amount of pesticides that are applied. The presence of late blight in Maine during the 2009 crop year has produced the potential for inoculum to be widespread in 2010. Although, potato late blight does not typically survive Maine winters, early snow cover, could facilitate the proliferation of volunteer potatoes, which could serve as a host for late blight. This potential inoculum source, combined fungicide resistance of the late blight organism, and the confirmed presence of both the US-8 and the US-14/17 late blight strains, have the potential to create a considerable threat to the Maine potato industry's 2010 crop. For the 2010 crop year and beyond, it will be imperative for growers to eliminate all inoculum sources by controlling volunteers, cull piles, and by planting only late blight free seed.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

479,"Corn and soybean growers in the United States often rotate these crops with one another in consecutive years. In many areas, however, corn is grown without rotation (i.e. continuous corn), either as a result of local market pressures (e.g. biofuels), unfavorable conditions for non-corn crops, or both. Both factors are at play in Indiana, where continuous corn production has increased recently and is forecast to continue to do so (Erickson et al. 2008). A direct-mail survey of 241 Indiana growers conducted by Erickson et al. (2008), found that insect and disease management were the top two concerns expressed by continuous corn growers, with the western corn rootworm (WCR) being the top single concern overall. As a result, there is high demand for Bt corn hybrids developed to combat WCR in continuous corn systems. These insecticidal traits are now usually combined or  stacked  with glyphosate-tolerance leading to no  single-trait  insect control option for growers, amounting to an increase in the adoption of both simultaneously. Adoption of corn hybrids expressing  stacked  or multiple traits has also increased dramatically in the US in recent years; from 29% (9.5 million hectares) in 2004 to 46% (15.1 million hectares) in 2009 (NASS 2009) - driven primarily by the introduction and rapid adoption of hybrids that express toxins active against the rootworm beetle complex that are combined with glyphosate-tolerance genes. This convergence and simplification of pest management practices and the incorporation of transgenic traits in plant breeding has largely benefited producers by contributing to increasing yields. However, the widespread adoption of any pest management strategy carries with it a potential for an increased selection pressure upon the target pests, followed by an increased risk of resistance evolution. This caveat is particularly relevant to the WCR/Bt corn system currently in place. When transgenic corn for rootworm control was registered in 2003, an insect resistance management (IRM) plan, based on mandatory refuges, was required and included with the purchase of the seed. In brief, this strategy hopes to overwhelm the rare adults that survive Bt exposure and carry with them recessive resistant alleles with susceptible alleles when they mate with the more numerous beetles emerging from refuges. The strategy works best when the Bt dose is high, largely because the numbers of heterozygote survivors (and correspondingly, the numbers of resistance alleles) will be reduced. Importantly, none of the currently available Bt toxins for WCR control are considered high dose (Miehls et al. 2008; Tabashnik 2008), a factor that lends even more urgency to research into factors that may hasten resistance development.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
480,"Pennycress is a non-food member of the mustard family that is grown as a winter annual producing seeds containing 36% oil or twice that of soybeans. This oil can be extracted and converted to high quality biodiesel fuel while the remaining de-oiled presscake biomass can be converted to other energy products. Planted in the fall after corn harvest, Pennycress is then harvested in the spring before planting soybeans. Farmers growing this crop can earn extra income on land that would otherwise be left bare during the winter while still growing corn and soybeans in a tradition rotation. One ton of seeds grown on one acre can produce 190 gallons of liquid fuel. To establish Pennycress as a viable energy crop, practical knowledge and optimized farming practices must be established through well-designed experiments that validate the findings. This project will establish the best farming practices to allow growers to maximize yields thus enhancing economic returns in the production of a dedicated energy crop. Field experiments will be conducted to establish optimized planting, harvesting and storage practices.

There is also a growing global concern around ready availability of wood and wood fibers which has driven the industry to investigate alternative sources. E2e Material's green composite material platform represents a revolutionary opportunity to shift many products used by humanity today away from non-renewable, petroleum-based products to materials produced from annually-renewable agricultural products providing a safer, cost-effective solution with higher performance. E2e Materials is proposing the development of affordable soy protein-based green plastic resins for use in manufacturing green composites constructed from soy protein resins and agricultural fibers such as jute, flax, and bamboo.

In order to control foam, anti-foaming chemical agents are added. Because they meet GRAS status as determined by the chemical manufacturers, not the FDA, (Since 1997 the FDA has stopped affirming substances.), chemical agents/formulas are subject to interpretation by the manufacturers that produce and sell these compounds. Also, maximum use rate can be unknowingly exceeded by the food processors. The effectiveness of water rinsing of foods processed in chemical laden water is variable, so, on balance, these chemicals are present on the final product. Aside from an inherent desire to improve food quality by eliminating in-process reactive chemical additives, the elimination of chemical use will increase productivity and reduce operational costs.

This research program addresses the most difficult challenge of viticulture: the transition from the current chemical-intensive disease control technology to a biology based approach. Long-term benefits from this proposal would enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of rural farm economies and create economic opportunities for improving the quality of life in rural America. In Missouri alone, wineries provide employment, production of highly value-added agricultural products, and opportunities for tourism in hilly rural areas where mechanized production of cash crops such as soybean and maize is not feasible. Before prohibition, the State of Missouri was a major wine-producing state in the nation. This industry was subsequently devastated and is now making a come-back, but is severely hindered by the pronounced fungal disease load in warm humid climates. On a national level, the major fungal diseases powdery mildew and grey mold cause significant economic and ecological losses to the US grape and wine industry. These pathogens, along with downy mildew and black rot, are even more important in the Midwest and East Coast regions where high humidity is so conducive to fungal pathogens. The exploration and application of these genetic resources through biotechnology will accelerate the improvement of grape varieties and will help solve some of the fungal and viral disease problems facing the viticulture industry.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
484,"Consumers are more conscious of the environmental impacts of food production than ever before, as seen by the increased interest in organically and locally grown foods. Still, many consumers may not fully understand what it takes to produce a good-quality crop on large acreages. Citizens are bombarded by a range of claims about current agricultural practices that create confusion and mistrust about the food supply, its safety for human consumption and adverse environmental impacts of these practices. Even in Iowa, a major agricultural state, public awareness and knowledge of food production and farming practices is declining. This lack of understanding makes it difficult for the public, policy makers and producers to have open discussions about critical agricultural practices that lead to making informed management decisions. In Iowa, corn and soybean are grown on approximately 23 million acres each year. Although these acreages have remained consistent for several decades, there have been significant changes in production practices in the past 10 years that have, in turn, affected statewide pesticide use. In addition, the average age of Iowa farmers is around 55, so the bulk of row crop acres farmed in Iowa soon will be passed from this generation of farmers to the next generation. This upcoming generational shift will present challenges, but it also presents a clear opportunity for reinvigorating the concept of IPM among the people making day-to-day decisions on the land. Another contributing factor that has led to the reduction of IPM-based pesticide applications is limited access to IPM education materials and related unbiased information. Growers need this information as the basis for critical management decisions. For much of the 20th century, University Extension programs through the Land Grant University system were recognized as the primary source of crop management information for growers. Recently, however, private-sector agribusinesses have become the predominant vendor of this information. Although this shift is not inherently bad, IPM is not always emphasized when growers base management decisions on information that is often packaged with the marketing of agricultural inputs such as seed, fertilizer and especially pesticides. This paradigm shift to growers relying on private agribusinesses has in part emerged out of necessity from the reduction in Extension program staffing and related resources. The most recent example is in Iowa where Iowa State University recently announced a dramatic reduction of Extension staffing in mid-2009. A possible way to reinforce the importance of IPM for growers, agronomists and the general public is to lay the educational groundwork for IPM in today's youth. Our primary goal is to provide educational IPM-based resources to instructors that educate the next generation of growers and agronomists, in turn increasing the adoption of IPM for decisions about pesticide use. In other words, we want to educate Iowa youth on basics of IPM, potentially fostering a lifetime of understanding about the concepts and importance of proper pesticide use.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
485,"Soybean rust is an important threat to US soybean production. The pathogen overwinters in the US south. For the North Central states, a primary question for management is whether the disease will reach soybean fields early enough in the season that use of a fungicide is economically supported. The sentinel plot network established to support soybean rust management has saved farmers huge amounts of money by supplying information about where soybean rust was present in time for farmers to anticipate whether fungicides were needed or not. As funding for the sentinel plot network has been reduced, it is important to optimize the usefulness of disease monitoring. We have developed a dynamic network model for soybean rust in the US using the sentinel plot data from previous years. This model uses information from the sentinel plots in a very direct way, such that we can estimate how useful the information from any given county has been for predicting movement of soybean rust to the north. This allows us to estimate how important particular sampling regions will be as an epidemic is ongoing. We will provide this information to ipmPIPE and other collaborators so that sampling to inform soybean growers will be as efficient as possible.

486,"Soybean rust is a disease causing significant losses in world agriculture. This project represents a first step to understand the genomic constitution of the pathogen and the determinants of disease, two aspects needed for the management and eradication of the pathogen. The soybean cyst nematode is the most damaging pathogen of soybean in the United States. The potential impact of the research is large since this is a new discovery in nematology. The use of nematode viruses for direct control of nematodes is promising, but also the use of viral genomes for gene expression and gene silencing studies will have a huge impact on how molecular nematology experiments are conducted in the future. By cloning and sequencing alleles known to influence SCN resistance, we will be able to pursue development of resistant varieties by combining these alleles using genetic engineering. Knowing the molecular basis of race-specific resistance will help overcome resistant SCN races in future. A label-free method to rapidly determine the expression level of small RNAs will be a breakthrough for the soybean industry and would also have much broader applicability to the biotechnology industry. High-throughput gene expression studies, such as microarrays, have brought a new dimension to biology. However, without easy-to-use tools to access the data, this rich data source ends up being untapped by all but a few labs. We developed SGED with the goal of presenting gene expression results in a format where the data can be easily retrieved by user searches, as well as cross compared across multiple projects using one of three different clustering programs. Research has shown the positive effect CNTs can have on seed germination and early growth. Positive effects of CNTs on seed germination could have significant economic importance for agricultural and energy and biofuels sectors. Additionally, use of nanomaterials for accelerated plant growth and water uptake could address drought tolerance, enhance plant nutrition, and improve early growth of crops under adverse conditions. Because soy products contain compounds not tolerated by young animals, most are fed diets containing animal proteins rather than soy meal. Fermentation of soy meal will remove some compounds that young animals do not tolerate. We will determine if fermented soy meal is a viable protein source for young animals. For the Center to continue to develop and respond as a primary line of defense against major threats to the U.S. soybean industry, a dedicated professional who understands the diversity of the Center research and who can focus on outreach to the industry and sustainability of the Center support will be hired.

The proposed and recently initiated research will explore areas to improve sustainability of various production systems. Some will be organic, others will be conventional production. Several cover crop studies presently underway will be continued. Trials are already underway on eleven farms. Additional support is being sought to increase the detail of cover crop study and the breadth of application of lessons learned. The focus of cover crop studies will be to reduce weed pressure on cash crops in the rotation and improve soil fertility. Increasing nitrogen production from legumes in an age of increasing energy costs will be a necessity. A Pennsylvania Soybean Promotion board funded project will be continued during 2010 to develop a network in PA soybean growers who seek to conduct their own on-farm evaluations. They employ some of the latest computerized planting and harvesting mapping capabilities. Coupled with aerial photography, these tools will aid in the identification of yield and profit-limiting factors in soybean production. Supported with a NE SARE Research and Education grant, researchers from Penn State, USDA-ARS Beltsville, and Rodale Institute will continue a project that seeks to improve the sustainability of dairy cropping systems for the northeast. Manure injection, increased use of cover crops, controlling cover crops with a roller/crimper, and the possible inclusion of canola into the cropping rotation for purposes of producing liquid fuels for farm use will be included. A project supported with funding from the USDA-OREI program, recently begun and to continue through 2013, will include researchers from Penn State, USDA-ARS Beltsville, and University of Delaware. The goal is to improve the sustainability of organic grain production by reducing the amount of tillage normally practiced. Making use of varieties with shorter growing season needs to enable more intensive usage of cover crops is the focus of the project. Weed and insect pest management techniques will also be tested.

488,"Because of escalating petroleum and food prices, new processes are needed to convert soybeans into fuel and biobased products as well as food and feed through advanced soybean biorefineries. Extracting flaked soybeans with the organic solvent hexane is today's most cost-effective oil-recovery method, but hexane is flammable and a neurotoxic and hazardous air pollutant. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is enforcing new regulations to reduce hexane emissions and compliance costs are highly burdensome. Using soybeans as feedstock for producing biofuels has not moved beyond extracting the oil, largely with hexane, and reacting the oil with methanol to convert it to biodiesel (methyl soyate). A promising alternative is Enzyme-assisted Aqueous Extraction Processing (EAEP) in which flaking, extruding and treating with enzymes are used to free the oil and water is used as a separation medium. EAEP has low capital costs and less safety and environmental issues compared to hexane-extraction enabling more distributive processing. Thereby rural economic growth and the potential for soybean biorefineries to produce biobased products and biofuels are enhanced. These advanced processing methods should enable second-generation soybean biorefineries to more efficiently produce food, feed, biofuels and biobased products. The new soybean processing technologies should also integrate well into today's dry-grind corn ethanol production facilities to reduce costs, produce more valuable co-products (DDGS, distillers dry grins with solubles), and conserve water. More efficient utilization of corn as well as soybeans should result including less water use and smaller carbon footprint, improved feed and biobased products, more fuel and less stress on the food supply when producing bioethanol. We have partnered with Genencor International (Rochester, NY), a major enzyme manufacturer who has allowed us access to their commercial and proprietary library of enzymes, and Modular Genetics (Cambridge, MA), a biosurfactant manufacturer, to commercialize the new soybean processing technologies.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Most crop protection products (fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators and biopesticides), necessary tools in the integrated  war  against destructive pests, are developed for large markets on major crops such as corn, soybean and cotton where the cost of discovery, development, registration and production can be offset by significant sales of the product. Due to the expensive process of bringing a new chemical crop protection product to market (in the US, the cost is in excess of $50 million dollars), the agriculture chemical industry often does not register their products on specialty crops (most vegetables, fruits, nuts, herbs, nursery and flower crops) - the cost of necessary data is greater than any potential return on investment.

490,"Kentucky agriculture is as diverse as the landscape from the Mississippi River bottoms in western Kentucky to the eastern Kentucky Appalachian Mountains. In 2002, 18.4% of Kentucky employment was farm or farm-related (Census, 2005). According to the 2005 Kentucky Department of Agriculture Report, agriculture is the largest industry in the state. In 2007, Kentucky ranked fourth nationally in the numbers of farms with 85,260 - the highest number east of the Mississippi River. Of these, 89% were family farms and over 95% were small farms. The average age of Kentucky farmers increased to 56.5 years, with the number of full-time farmers decreasing to 40%. Farm operators included 32,652 women, 1,005 were minority/socially disadvantaged including African American, and 29,247 were 65 or older. Overall Kentucky's farm product sales were $4.82 billion (NASS, 2007). The vast majority of Kentucky's farmers, particularly high percentages of Kentucky's African American and women famers, have livestock on their farms, with horses, poultry, and beef cattle being Kentucky's three major agricultural products. Kentucky farmers have diversified from large row crops (corn and soybean) to hay, vegetable, horticulture, and nursery. Kentucky is a largely rural state, with 117 of its 120 counties classified as rural. Those living in agricultural settings often experience greater isolation and depressed economic opportunities. Kentucky is the 6th poorest state in the country, with over 17% of the population living below the poverty line (US estimates, 2008). According to the US Census Bureau, 23.7% of Kentuckians, age 5 and older, have a disability as compared to 19.3% of the US population (Census Brief, 2003). In fact, only West Virginia's disability rate exceeds Kentucky (Census Brief, 2003). Of those with disabilities, nearly 30% live in poverty. For people who have a disability, the implications of a rural life can mean even larger disparities in opportunities. Urban and rural communities have different health priorities that are related to differences in demographics, health behavior, geographic isolation, and access to health care (Eberhardt, 2001). While it is true that those with disabilities in rural settings have experienced a long history of problems with transportation, employment, and access to health care, a new reliance on technology and innovative approaches to service delivery, such as Kentucky AgrAbility, can offer new insights (Harley, Bishop & Wilson, 2002). Having a disability merely increases the need for interventions that may be medical, physical, social, emotional, or societal. This is compounded when those who experience injuries or disabilities don't know where to look for assistance. Typically resilient and self-reliant farm families may not ask for help when disability strikes. This means that without an understanding of the potential for rehabilitation, these individuals may be forced to choose alternate occupations or, worse yet, no occupation at all.

491,"United States consumes around 138 billion gallons of gasoline per year (EIA, 2009), with two-thirds being imported from oil rich nations. This huge dependency on imports made the nation search for alternative sources of fuel to feed its transportation sector, which is the primary mode of movement of goods across the nation. Other factors that contributed towards the run for biofuels are the high crude prices sustaining over longer periods than the past, increased demands from both developed and developing nations, and a concern for environmental quality. With above concerns in mind, United States introduced an energy policy for developing a renewable energy system. Several amendments were made to the energy policy over the years and the recent amendment mandates 11 billion gallons of renewable fuels, which includes corn ethanol, soy biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol and aims at producing 36 billion gallons by 2022, which is also subject to change. Though corn ethanol is the most familiar form of biofuels, plant material converted to ethanol also gained popularity in the transition to alternative fuels. In a rush to become energy independent, the national policy left out some of the interrelationships across the national and global economy. The ambitious plan of energy policy laid additional pressure on already sensitive agricultural lands demanding change in cropping patterns, intensive use of fertilizers, increased irrigation water use, and crop production on conservation land to supplement the current crop yield levels to reach the set targets. Some examples include increased N, P and K application rates on corn crop from 58 to 138, 41 to 58and 41 to 84 lbs per acre over a period of 40 years (NASS, 2005). Similarly, corn acres received about 1ac-ft of water per acre in 2008 and reports from some states indicate that an ethanol plant with 100 million gallon capacity requires approximately 1300 ac-ft of water (IATP, 2006). Though it is unclear under what crop the matured Conservation reserve acreage (CRP) went, the CRP enrollment decreased by 130,000 acres in 2009 (FSA, 2009). These scenarios do indicate the changing production activity among the biofuel farmers. Although corn based ethanol dominates the fuels from biomass, transition to fuels from grasses, forest debris and other non-grain plant material started to gain attention. A recently proposed standard by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires 10.5 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel by 2022 in the transportation fuel. To avoid the potential conflict between food and fuel a national policy that will address the price effects for crop fertilizers and implications of increased water use on expanded crop acreage in first and next generation biofuels has to be developed.

494,"This project will develop efficient and economic technologies to convert renewable, bio-based oils and fatty acids to new products. Specifically, we will develop direct reactions with the double bonds found in bio-based oils. The resulting materials will be used as polymeric materials and building blocks for large markets with specialty and commodity applications. Bio-based starting materials will include oils and acids derived from soybeans, algae, and other naturally occurring, renewable feedstocks. Product areas will include monomers, oligomers and polymers that could be used as specialty oils, lubricants, additives and coatings. Vegetable and other bio-based oils contain internal double bonds which are less reactive and not readily polymerizable. We will focus on transformations that convert these oils into products in a single step. Many bio-based oils require multiple steps and the formation of intermediate species to form polymers, and the techniques developed in this project will be more efficient, more economical, and less expensive to produce. We have identified several chemistries which allow the direct reactions of the double bonds in renewable oils, including cationic polymerization, hydrosilylation, metathesis, and addition of phenol. We will optimize these technologies for bio-based oils, which will lead to ways of using 100% vegetable oils or will copolymerize them with a range of monomers for tailoring specific properties. Structure-property characterization will allow the creation of new polymers and materials for different applications. The benefits from this project include: (1) a reduction in U.S. dependence upon foreign petroleum by replacing petroleum-based feedstocks for plastics with bio-based feedstocks, (2) the creation of new uses for renewable, U.S. agricultural commodities such as soybeans and algae, and (3) development of new,  green  materials that will compete in the marketplace. Feedstocks based on plant-based oils have the advantage of more stable agricultural prices, and consumption of these oleochemicals is estimated to be several hundred thousand tons per year.

496,"Natural areas in agroecosystems provide important ecosystem services to agriculture and society. In the Midwest, however, there are few patches of native grassland left to provide services: tallgrass prairie is one of the most endangered ecosystems in North America, with less than one percent of its original extent remaining. The leading cause for prairie loss has been conversion of this productive system to row crop agriculture, primarily corn and soybean production. As demand for biofuel crops increases and as land is converted to other uses such as roads and housing, some of the remaining patches of prairie and semi-natural land will undoubtedly disappear. Loss of these natural areas would cause direct and substantial reductions of associated ecosystem services. Two of the more valuable services provided by the grassland patches in agricultural landscapes are climate regulation through carbon sequestration and pest control via support of natural enemy populations. We will examine how soil organic carbon (SOC) and natural enemies of soybean aphids vary across seven land management regimes in northwestern Indiana. These include remnant prairie preserves, high diversity grassland plantings, two types of USDA grassland plantings (moderate and low diversity), and soybean fields under three pest management treatments. These comparisons will show how pest management strategies, grassland plant composition, and land use affect natural enemy abundance and carbon sequestration. We will use our field-collected data to parameterize a model that will estimate the supply of biocontrol services across the larger agricultural landscape. We will use the spatial relationships identified in our fieldwork and in the landscape model to quantify economic benefits of ecosystem services in the same landscape. By documenting the dynamics and economic value of two primary ecosystem services provided by natural areas in Midwestern agroecosystems, these values can be incorporated into economic decisions regarding land use and management. Spatially explicit economic analysis and online decision support tools produced in this project will enable farmers, resource managers, and policy makers to better understand ecosystem functions and optimizing services, including the response of these systems to soybean pest management, changing land use, and effects of invasive species. With this understanding, decision makers can have an informed scientific basis for managing agricultural lands and develop strategies to continue to optimize ecosystem services. Policy makers within USDA who make decisions regarding payment for conservation practices may consider these important ecosystem services in their payment structure. Farmers may be motivated by this knowledge and through new compensation pricing to change pest management in a way that reduces pesticides or may chose to enroll in a conservation practice that will contribute to carbon sequestration and biocontrol services. Taken as a whole, these actions can increase complexity and connectivity in the landscape that is important not only for natural enemies, but for many other species.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Safety problems and ecological disruptions continue to ensue, and there are renewed appeals for effective, safe, and economically acceptable alternatives. The overall objectives of this project are to conduct research on the basic biology and ecology of weeds and insect pests and beneficial insects in corn/soybean/wheat production systems and to develop integrated pest management systems and decision aids. Our specific objectives are to: 1) investigate the behavior and genetics underlying the resistance of corn rootworms to pest management tactics and develop novel pest management technologies for northern and western corn rootworms; 2) reduce emerging weed and insect problems in corn/soybean and corn/soybean/wheat rotations; and 3) develop and evaluate cultural, biological control and host plant resistance management tactics for emerging and invasive insect pests of soybean.

Comparisons between different species of tung that produce medium or high amounts of eleostearic will also be used to detect evolution of enzymes well-suited to tung oil production.  Mutagenesis studies will identify the active sites and critical residues in these enzymes, thus facilitating the design of engineered forms of important proteins.  Model laboratory species of plants and microbes will be used to express combinations of multiple tung genes to find the minimal sets necessary to produce useful levels of eleostearic and other novel fatty acids.

502,"Cotton remains the dominant crop for the Texas High/Rolling Plains region, with 3.3 million acres planted and 3.82 million bales harvested in 2009 (NASS 2009). It is estimated that 70% of Texas cotton is exported and must be marketable, both in terms of price and quality to compete in global markets. Producers must increase efficiencies by utilizing new technologies including improved transgenic varieties, tillage systems, and irrigation technology. Advances in genetics have improved fiber quality, however other quality parameters related to crop maturity vary due to weather and crop management. Integrated production systems must be developed to optimize yield, profitability and more importantly, lint quality. An economically and environmentally sustainable cropping system must optimize soil and water resources, manage insects, weeds, and diseases, and respond to changing commodity markets. Two trends which influence cropping systems include the adoption of conservation/no till systems and herbicide-tolerant crops. The Texas Southern High Plains (TSHP) is a semi-arid region with approximately 50% of crop acreage irrigated from the non-recharging Ogallala aquifer. Improved irrigation technology, such as low-energy precision application (LEPA) and more recently sub-surface drip (SDI) has made irrigation more viable where water is limited. These systems have replaced furrow irrigation and allowed producers to use water more efficiently, but have not reduced the quantity of water pumped. Returns are higher from cotton than from alternative crops leading to a cotton monoculture. Crop rotations, when combined with conservation tillage can have significant impacts on soil, crop yields and profitability. Cover crops, including small grains or legumes have been investigated to provide crop residue in cropping systems which do not produce sufficient residue to provide adequate cover, such as with cotton or soybean. The use of conservation tillage to maintain crop residues on the soil surface offers great potential for reducing soil erosion by wind and water, which is especially important for the sandyland areas of the Southern High Plains. Cotton seedlings are extremely susceptible to abrasion damage. Studies have attempted to identify amounts of crop residue needed to protect soil in the Northern Great Plains from wind erosion, and to estimate losses under various tillage systems and crop residue combination. Previous research has established effective weed control programs in conventional tillage cotton for the Southern High Plains. In several states, including Tennessee and Arkansas, intensive glyphosate use has led to the development of glyphosate-resistant horseweed. New and improved GR crops continue to be developed with multiple herbicide resistance genes to meet changing weed management needs to help sustain the efficacy of glyphosate. Widespread development of Palmer amaranth resistance to glyphosate has been reported in numerous states. The control of volunteer GR crops is an increasing problem.

Major sources of pollutants arise from the combustion of fossil fuels and agricultural activities. Monitoring the chemistry of precipitation is critical because many of the pollutants also are essential plant nutrients (e.g., nitrogen). Thus in part, the NADP is monitoring the inadvertant fertilization of natural and managed ecosystems. This fertilization can influence ecosystem productivity, nutrient balances in soils, and plant species composition in natural ecosystems.

The benefits of plant-rich diets are not only derived from the caloric energy provided by carbohydrates, lipids and protein, but also from the phytonutrients, non-nutrient phytochemicals, and bioactive proteins that are believed to prevent, mitigate and treat human disease. The mechanisms by which the nutritive (and non-nutritive) constituents of diet influence health and disease outcomes are not well understood. There is strong epidemiological evidence that dietary soy plays an important role in reducing the risk of several cancer types including prostate cancer. This could possibly explain the 4 to 10-fold lower incidence of prostate cancer in some Asian countries compared to Western nations. The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which lunasin, a protein constituent of soy, can prevent and/or reduce cancer risk. Past studies suggest that lunasin can activate chemopreventive genes by the targeted epigenetic modification of the human genome. To further understand the action of lunasin, the project will use a combination of molecular biology and genomic analysis to elucidate lunasin?s impact on regulatory genetic networks and physiological pathways involved in lowering cancer risk.

Most of the viruses have a direct impact on productivity due to the loss in yield experienced in crops affected by the diseases. Among the dominant viruses which cause losses to North Carolina agriculture are Tospoviruses and Potyviruses. These two genera of viruses account for most of the losses due to viruses in field crops, vegetable crops and floral crops. It should be noted, however, that there are other individual viruses in other genera that cause losses, for example barley yellow dwarf in grain crops, bean pod mottle virus in soybean, and tobacco streak and tobacco mosaic viruses in tobacco.

508,"The focus of this project is to investigate therapies for the management of obesity and obesity-related conditions (for example, high blood pressure), in terms of their impact on body composition, nutritional status, and/or clinical outcomes, with the overall aim to improve knowledge about how best to manage obesity and its associated conditions more effectively. Gastric bypass (GB) surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures for inducing weight loss. While GB surgery is quite effective at causing weight loss, it may cause more muscle tissue to be lost than is healthy, and it may have negative effects on other aspects of nutritional status. The primary study that comprises this project investigates the clinical and nutritional impacts of gastric bypass surgery, and will yield valuable information about the effectiveness of protein supplementation in the early period following surgery on the loss of muscle mass. Gastric bypass surgeries in the US have increased from 67,000 in 2002 to an estimated 144,000 in 2004. This study could have far-reaching social impact. Excessive loss of lean tissue and malnutrition is associated with loss of strength and functional status, diminished quality of life, and reduced capacity for work. A simple regimen of protein supplements after surgery may be able to prevent these changes and improve quality of life after gastric bypass surgery. The combination of methods we are using to measure body composition allows us to accomplish several objectives within this study. We will measure changes in fluid status and body fat, as well as hormones and proteins that are related to the regulation of fluid status and blood pressure, in order to gain a better understanding of how GB surgery may affect obesity-related health risks. In addition, we will test methods for measuring fluid and other components of body composition to see if they can be used in the clinic setting. Furthermore, this study will yield data that will help us better understand how vitamin D status may change after GB surgery. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a number of health risks, and it is a common problem in Northern latitudes with limited sun exposure during extended winters, making it an important public health issue for Minnesotans. The second study that is currently planned as part of this project will investigate the effects of particular protein fragments that come from soybeans and milk (called bioactive peptides) on blood pressure and the system that regulates it, in overweight men and women.

509,"Field crops (including corn, soybean, wheat, alfalfa and other hay crops, perennial grasses) play an integral role in the New York economy by providing feed for animal industries, principal ingredients for food products produced in the state, and feedstocks for biofuels. Both chronic and currently undermanaged, and emerging plant diseases are a continual threat to New York field crops and can reduce the already narrow profit margin for producers. This project addresses the most critical and timely crop disease management issues and directly supports several extension education initiatives. The project provides basal support for the plant pathology research component of an integrated field crops management program. It offers both fundamental contributions to disease epidemiology and management, and short-term research results on disease management tactics that can be recommended to extension educators, agribusiness, and growers. Methods employed include farm survey; experimental field plot assessment of cultivars, fungicides, biological control agents and cultural practices; controlled environment experiments; molecular genetic evaluation of pathogen populations; and aerobiology methods for studying fungal spore dispersal. Research efforts in the next 3 years will be focused on the biology and management of mycotoxin producing fungi in corn and wheat; viruses and foliar fungal diseases of wheat; brown root rot of forage legumes; disease management with resistant culitvars and clean seed programs in biofuel feedstock grasses; and optimized use of fungicides in the protection of corn, soybean and wheat. Intended outcomes include guidelines for disease management tactics that have been validated under New York conditions. Field crop producers will benefit financially from more efficient production of their crops (less disease-induced losses and savings from unnecessary application of control measures).

510,"It has been almost 20 years since the first heterologous protein was expressed in plants, and the potential of making proteins with industrial and therapeutic applications was demonstrated. Compared with microbes, animals and mammalian cell culture, the attractiveness of transgenic plants as a platform for production of recombinant proteins stems from their safety (absence of human pathogens and toxins) and inexpensive biomass generation. Between 1995 and 2003, we witnessed remarkable research and development activities in the area of plant-made pharmaceuticals which since have declined primarily because plant systems failed to fulfill the prospect of making low cost pharma products. Several factors that were responsible for the downturn and unfulfilled promise include low transgene expression levels, biosafety questions about growing plants in an open environment and lack of clear and standardized cGMP guidelines. Lower than expected protein expression levels have been the major setback for downstream process development, because they hampered the design of novel and efficient methods for protein extraction and recovery from transgenic plant tissues. The increased demand for conversion of biomass to fuels has generated a renewed interest in transgenic plants (corn, sugarcane, and soybeans) for producing biomass-degrading enzymes in extremely large volumes that are not achievable by microbial production systems. The recent advancements in boosting expression levels such as increased transcription, direct transcription in tissues suited for protein accumulation, and targeting protein to subcellular locations for optimal and stable accumulation have increased the probability for achieving a cost-effective downstream processing of transgenic products. In summary, lowering the cost of plant-derived products by way of reduced bioprocessing cost is yet to be demonstrated, and is one of the aims of the proposed research. Regardless of end application, the common denominator for any recombinant protein production (industrial or therapeutic) is the overall efficiency of downstream processing, which directly impacts overall production cost. The current downstream processing of recombinant proteins from mammalian and microbial systems relies on selective and rather costly bioseparations methods that typically contribute to 90% of the manufacturing cost. Industrial enzyme bioprocessing cost can be as low as 50% of the total manufacturing cost but their value is typically more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of therapeutic proteins. For industrial enzymes like those intended for biomass degradation, product and process yields are important, but even more so is the ability to fractionate transgenic tissues and capture the value of cellulosic plant residue and seed components for bioenergy and feed (starch, sugars, oil, fiber and protein). Therefore, to reap the benefits of low-cost transgenic biomass production one needs to develop bioprocess technologies that are less expensive than those developed for already established microbial and cell culture platforms.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
511,"Soybean (Glycine max) is a crop of great economic and environmental importance in the Northern U.S. Soybean was produced on 7.0 million acres in Minnesota in 2008 with an average yield of 38 bu/ac and a total direct production value of approximately $2.7 billion. Yields were about four to six bushels lower this year than in previous years due in large part to several diseases and dry weather in August. Several factors constrain yield and profitability of soybean every year, and plant diseases are especially important. Fungal pathogens reduce soybean yields on millions of acres each year in Minnesota. The diseases they cause may result in obvious severe losses exceeding 30%, or may cause lower losses in the 10% range that are not readily noticed. The extent of yield loss depends on many factors that may include interactions with other pathogens, insects, and abiotic stresses. The many different types of fungi that typically infect soybean plants also make disease diagnosis challenging. The main goals of this project include enhancing our understanding of the biology and ecology of key pathogens and root-stem disease complexes, and development and validation of new molecular technologies for pathogen detection and diagnosis. Much has been learned in previous research about many important diseases, but much more critical information and improved methods are needed to improve our levels of understanding and disease management.

512,"Glyphosate-resistant corn, soybean and sugar beet is now available to growers. Additionally, glyphosate is often used in minimum tillage farming and as a pre-harvest treatment in small grains. This reliance on one herbicide may result in glyphosate-resistant or glyphosate-tolerant weed species. Farmers can save their own seed of conventional cultivars, which reduces input costs. At present, NDSU is the primary provider of improved conventional cultivars to the state of North Dakota. The development and release of conventional cultivars provides farmers with an alternative to buying GMO cultivars from private companies and this is an importance service to North Dakota producers. There is a growing identity-preserved (IP) industry in North Dakota and western Minnesota. The development of natto, sprout and tofu types serves this IP industry. The development of these specialty IP genotypes contributes to value-added agriculture. Each year, private company breeders, such as Monsanto, Pioneer Hi-Bred, and Syngenta request permission to use NDSU developed cultivars and germplasm in their crossing program. Each year, approximately six Material Transfer Agreements are signed to permit this use. Germplasm development efforts that may aid private companies in the future include: i) incorporation of the Rag1 and Rag2 alleles for aphid resistance into populations adapted to North Dakota; ii) incorporation of the virus resistance gene Rsv4 into populations adapted to northern growing conditions; iii) availability of the Rps6 gene, which confers resistance to Race 25 of phytophthora root rot; iv) development of high-yielding, lodging-resistant lines with SCN resistance. Cultivar selection is one of the most important factors that determine the yield and economic profit per unit area of land. Testing of public and private cultivars in both highly productive and stress environments enables growers to select the best cultivars for different soil types and biotic stress factors. It is difficult to estimate the impact of these data on cultivar selection. Production experiments provide information that enables growers to make the best management decisions and the best use of new technology. The economic impact of these studies depends on the results. Evaluation of breeding methodology enables both public and private company breeders to increase the rate of genetic improvement and this indirectly benefits growers.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

The corresponding acreage amount of farms in North Dakota increased from 28,427 thousand acres to 39,400 thousand acres leading to an increase in farm size from 382 acres to 1,300 acres.

515,"Much effort will be required to meet food and freshwater demands for an anticipated 2030 global population of 8.1 billion. The agricultural industry diverts the largest amount of water on a worldwide basis, so it must take a leading role in achieving sustainable water use that will provide for both the growing need for food and the need for clean and safe water supplies. Most water planners and resource managers recognize that there will be no magic bullet that will remove all of the world?s or nation?s water problems. Instead there is a growing realization that it will take many tools working together to help avoid the significant disruption in the economies and societies grown accustomed to widespread irrigation use. Microirrigation is just one of the many irrigation and water management technology tools, but it is a tool that has several advantages. Microirrigation can reduce the waste of water to a negligible amount and the transport of contaminants to surface water and groundwater. Irrigation events can be fine-tuned to spoon feed water and nutrients just in time to avoid plant stress. It can optimize crop production (more crop per drop) and in many cases increase the quality of agricultural products. Some scientists, water planners, and resource managers have been disappointed with the rate of adoption in microirrigation. The U.S. land area that is microirrigated varies on an annual basis but during the last 10 years has hovered in the range of 3 to 4% of the total irrigated area. It is recognized that some crops and locations are not physically or economically suitable for microirrigation, but this is probably the exception rather than a common situation. Although microirrigation is expensive, there is a growing realization that leaders in the farming community can and will adopt and adapt cutting-edge technologies when given the knowledge and incentives to do so. This is evidenced in the tag line of the recent USDA-NRCS Conservation Security Program (CSP) which is ?reward the best and motivate the rest.? In this project, the Kansas effort will be a combination of new field and laboratory research, synthesis of existing results into publications and website material suitable for public use and educational efforts in the form of workshops, conferences and in-service trainings related to subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) for the typical irrigated crops (corn, soybean, sunflower, alfalfa and grain sorghum) grown in the region. The expected impacts of the project are that Kansas and regional producers will have an increased familiarity with SDI and the techniques needed to ensure its success, that improved design and water and nutrient management procedures for SDI will allow broader penetration of microirrigation into non-traditional microirrigation regions of the country, that economic losses associated with microirrigation system failures due to maintenance issues will be reduced. Comparisons of alternative irrigation systems will allow growers to make the best system choice for their operations and will allow them to optimize performance of existing systems",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
516,"Bioenergy expansion will continue in the USA, due to energy security concerns and the need to control greenhouse gas emissions. The overall goal of this project is to advance the development of a grass bioheat system (grass pellets for combustion heat) that is economically viable and environmentally superior to fossil fuel heating. Approximately 75% of the total energy budget for rural households is allocated to heating. Grass pellet combustion has been shown to work on a residential scale in certain pellet stoves and several indoor and outdoor pellet boilers. Additional research is needed to optimize this system and increase its visibility. This research focuses on a closed loop, local energy system that should improve the economic status of farms while maximizing environmental benefits. Field-scale research will be conducted to evaluate the feasibility of overwintering switch grass in the field in NY, resulting in a feedstock with higher combustion quality the next spring. Grass biofuel quality will be evaluated in the field, as impacted by grass species, soil type, moisture availability, and nutrient availability. Besides providing increased dairy farm nutrient management options for farmers, a grass bioheat system will maintain open spaces, improve soil conservation, increase local energy security, generate rural jobs, increase economic diversification, and have a positive impact on wildlife nesting. The overall result will be a positive impact on everyone in the rural community. NY State has between 1.5 and 2.5 million acres of unused or underutilized land that could generate grass bioheat. Research has estimated that one acre of switch grass pellets used for heating will offset 2.5 times as much greenhouse gas as one acre of grass cellulosic ethanol, 9 times as much as one acre of corn ethanol, and 14 times as much greenhouse gas as one acre of soybean biodiesel. Perennial grass species are suited to all agricultural soil types and can cope with imperfect drainage better than row crops or alfalfa. Biomass cropping systems in northern regions must compliment existing dairy operations and enhance dairy farm sustainability. Currently, many dairy farms struggle with excess nutrients and a shortage of crops and acreage that can efficiently use manure nutrients. Perennial grass biomass production has the potential to solve both problems by using manure to meet grass biomass nutrient needs on a larger acreage. Furthermore, a grass-based biomass cropping system will be adopted readily by dairy farmers because it can be implemented using equipment and expertise already available on farms.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The primary objective of this research will be to determine the effects of corn residue removal and cover crops on individual tillage treatments (NT, CP and MP) used for corn and soybean production on the organic C contents of the surface layer, subsoil, and root zone of eroded soil. Tillage accelerates the soil erosion of sloping lands and decreases soil productivity. It is anticipated that cover crops will reduce soil erosion and corn residue removal will increase soil erosion.

518,"Increasing emphasis on biofuel production has the potential to radically change the face of the agricultural landscape in the upper Midwest and elsewhere in the country. This trend has already been observed in some states where high corn prices have encouraged farmers to increase acreage planted to corn at the expense of other crops such as soybean (NASS 2007). If this trend continues, states with a historically diversified agriculture, such as Wisconsin and Michigan, are likely to see the diversity of crops currently planted in the landscape decline. Moreover, lands typically left idle, in woodlots or in Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) set-asides, may be converted to crops destined for biofuel production. As a society we are on the verge of carrying out one of the largest scale experiments ever performed-an experiment that will unfold rapidly within the next 15 to 20 years, an experiment for which the consequences for sustainability are currently uncertain. Changes in landscape structure, with fewer types of crops and reduction of non-crop lands, and in the configuration of agricultural lands, with larger tracts of land grown fence-row-to-fence-row, has the potential to influence biofuel sustainability. Some ecosystem services, such as pollination and natural pest suppression, are dependent on mobile organisms that respond to land-use changes that occur at scales that transcend the boundaries of individual fields or farms. This is because the agents that carry out those services, such as bumblebees or predatory ladybeetles, traverse large areas and have nesting and/or food requirements found in different areas of the landscape. This proposal's principal objective is to understand the consequences of changes in landscape structure due to biofuel agriculture on the diversity and abundance of native pollinators and the pollination services they provide. Given the current crisis facing the domesticated European honey bees in North America (Colony Collapse Disorder), it is imperative that we understand ways to encourage and enhance the effectiveness of native pollinators. Because of the sensitivity of pollinators to changes in landscape structure, this study will be a critical examination of the effects of biofuels across the landscape and the effects of biofuel production on one critical and declining ecosystem service: pollination. Ultimately, the long-term sustainability of biofuel agriculture will be contingent on our ability to devise cropping systems where multiple ecosystem services are optimized.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
519,"Oilseeds are important alternative crops that add diversity to South Dakota agriculture. The two leading oilseed crops in South Dakota, other than soybeans, are sunflower and flax. South Dakota is currently the second leading producer of both sunflower and flaxseed in the United States, following North Dakota (USDA/NASS, 2009). Oilseeds like sunflower grow well in areas of South Dakota where crop choices are limited by environment. They also work well in rotation with more traditional crops such as corn, soybean, and wheat, helping to break up weed and pest cycles. There are only two public sunflower breeding programs in the United States. One is here at SDSU and the other is a USDA-ARS program at the Northern Crop Science Laboratory in Fargo, ND. This research project will focus on the development and release of improved sunflower genetic material that can be used by the sunflower industry to produce hybrids adapted to South Dakota. Emphasis will be placed on economically important traits such as yield, oil content, oil quality, pest resistance, stress resistance and adaptability to South Dakota growing conditions. Drought is a recurring threat to sunflower production in many areas of the U.S., including the sunflower production areas of South Dakota. One strategy for mitigating the effects of drought stress is improved crop genetics which allow plants to withstand stress and produce a crop. Another objective of this research project is to develop molecular markers associated with drought tolerance in sunflower that can be used to assist with future selection for this trait. Besides improved genetic resources, there is a need for sunflower production research in South Dakota. Producers will benefit from production practices that minimize inputs and produce higher yield and quality for a greater economic return. This project will cooperate with SDSU, CES, NDSU, USDA-ARS, and other regional personnel to conduct research and provide advice to growers on hybrid selection and general production practices for maximizing seed yield, oil content, and crop quality. Several other oilseed crops may be useful in crop rotations in South Dakota. We will evaluate the potential of new or underutilized oilseed crops such as camelina, flax, winter canola, and Crambe for increased South Dakota production and provide resources to growers interested in including them their cropping systems.

Nematode population development and damage to crops varied dramatically in different fields. In some fields, plant-parasitic nematode population density maintains at relatively low levels even planted to susceptible crops, and the soil in these fields may be suppressive to the plant-parasitic nematodes. In this project, the nature of the nematode-suppressive soils associated with cultural practices will be studied.

523,"Wisconsin field and forage crops are intimately linked as alfalfa is the primary perennial legume crop in rotation with annual commodity crops. This agricultural system is undergoing rapid and unprecedented change in terms of increasing crop prices (e.g., corn, soybeans, small grains and alfalfa), the proportion of Wisconsin acreage planted to each of these crops, and resulting state and regional forage supplies. In 2007, alfalfa prices increased sharply, partly due to tight hay supplies and partly in response to rapid increase in corn costs exerting upward pressure on forage value (Mintert 2008). Although refined to incorporate the use of glandular haired, potato leafhopper-resistant alfalfa varieties (Lefko et al. 2000), land-grant university economic threshold recommendations for potato leafhopper on standard, leafhopper-susceptible varieties have not been validated or updated with field research data to reflect the current high value crop market. This Integrated Research and Extension activity is designed to update linear yield-loss models for alfalfa and potato leafhopper. Model coefficients from new field research data in Wisconsin, over multiple years with additional data points at lower potato leafhopper numbers, will be used to re-calculate the Economic Injury Level and determine if the Economic Threshold should be lowered. In addition, laboratory experiments will test the hypothesis that alfalfa weevil and alfalfa blotch leafminer parasitoids are negatively impacted by increased insecticide use for potato leafhopper in the absence of field scouting data and clientele loss of confidence in economic thresholds developed over 30 years ago. Results will be delivered to county agents, farmers, and crop advisors through UW Madison Entomology and Agronomy research/extension programs. This project will generate research-based knowledge and develop educational programs that will provide updated IPM decision support to UW Extension county agents, farmers and crop advisors allowing them to continue to benefit from highly effective potato leafhopper insecticide management tactics, while refocusing on practices to preserve long-standing biological control success for alfalfa weevil and alfalfa blotch leafminer in alfalfa.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
524,"Feed cost is a substantial proportion of the total cost of production for sheep enterprises. The bio-fuels industry has been expanding rapidly over the past 10 years. Consequently, the availability of co-product feeds such as soybean hulls (SH), dried distillers grains (DDG), and more recently, glycerol, has increased dramatically. These co-product feeds are frequently available to sheep producers at favorable prices than traditional feeds like corn and soybean meal. This project will determine if feeding co-products to sheep at various stages of production results in enhanced animal performance and profitability. Furthermore, meat products produced from lambs fed these diets will also be analyzed to identify any differences, positive or negative, in case life and palatability. Because of the non-traditional nature of these feeds, this component is particularly critical to the project. If the co-product based diets result in enhanced profitability, but reduced case life or a substantial reduction in consumer preference, they may not be sustainable over the long-term. Three experiments will be conducted to evaluate the use of biofuel co-product feeds in sheep diets. The first experiment will compare a diet comprised nearly exclusively of biofuel co-product with traditional, corn-based finishing diets in finishing lambs. Animal growth, feed efficiency, and carcass quality will be measured and meat samples will be collected to identify any effects on fatty acid concentrations, palatability, and case-life of meat from lambs fed each of the diets. The second experiment will be conducted to evaluate the effect of fat from DDG or corn oil on nutrient digestion in the rumen of lambs. The third experiment will be conducted to determine the impact of DDG supplementation on forage intake of mature ewes. Data generated will be reported in peer-reviewed publications and should ultimately benefit sheep producers by improving their profitability. The factors that could enhance or impede the adoption and utility of the outputs are essentially one in the same, price. Under conditions where co-product feeds are less expensive per unit of energy or protein, they will result in a lower unit cost of production. However, if conditions are opposite, producers will more profitable with traditional diets.

525,"There is a critical need to focus on the role of agriculture in mitigating environmental change and in adapting to it. A major focus should be building organic matter in soils through appropriate soil, crop, and animal management practices. In the next few years, cap-and-trade opportunities will generate prices of $20 - $30 per ton of CO2 sequestered in soil here in the U.S., given that those are current prices in the European Union. Where effective soil carbon management results in one to two tons per acre that can be documented to build up per year, the farmer can realize thousands of dollars in additional income with a relatively small investment. In Illinois alone, with 20 million acres planted in corn and soybeans, if 20% were to enter carbon trading situations and gain $30 per acre on average, this would represent a net increase in farm income of $60M per year. However, to trade carbon stored in soils confidently, we need accurate and comprehensive tracking mechanisms that truly reflect rates of C accumulation in soils. Soil testing methods for carbon as well as other nutrients need to be greatly modernized and applied to areas beyond agriculture and horticulture, including all areas of natural resources and the environment. Most of our methods of soil sampling, sample preparation, extraction, and analysis were developed 60 to 70 years ago. Increased organic matter addresses both the mitigation and the adaptation aspects of climate change. Increasing soil organic matter increases storage of relatively stable carbon forms that are not released back into the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration by soils has become a major tool in cap and trade systems, but we need to know much more about how to quantify and verify the estimates that are used in these trading schemes. Soil organic matter also creates a soil ecosystem much more robust in its response to varying water regimes. Under wet conditions, it enhances infiltration of water and better aeration. Under drought, soils with good organic matter status hold more plant-available water, and allow roots to penetrate more deeply into soil to access subsoil moisture and nutrients.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
526,"Futures markets exist to serve two roles; price discovery of the traded commodity and transfer of risk from physical market participants to speculators. Because the assets underlying the futures contracts have physical presence, and contract performance can entail the delivery or receipt of the physical good, futures markets for physical commodities present special challenges to users, regulators and researchers. It is delivery that ties the prices of the physical commodity at the delivery point to the prices traded in the futures markets. For this reason, the operation of the delivery mechanism is crucial to the operation of the futures market. In the last three years, prices in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Corn, Soybean and Wheat futures contracts have demonstrated significantly poorer connection to physical commodity prices. (Irwin, Garcia, Good and Kunda) Likewise, the entire delivery structure of the South African Futures Exchange maize and wheat contracts have been called into question by members of the South African grain industry. (National Agricultural Marketing Council) Integrating futures and cash markets in a single, even modestly tractable, model is inherently quite difficult. To this point, explicit models of futures markets, such as in Hull, have typically assumed well-functioning delivery markets with neither frictions nor constraints. Likewise, explicit models of physical markets have assumed well-functioning and efficient futures markets (Williams and Wright). However, many of the most interesting research questions, such as the effects of speculation, and the lack of cash and futures price convergence, posed by recent futures market behavior cannot be answered without a model that encompasses both cash and futures markets. Such a model is not only useful for exploring the effects of changed delivery locations, such as current proposals to eliminate Ohio as a wheat delivery location, but can also be used to identify conditions under which speculation would or would not impact underlying cash commodity prices.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
527,"Soil erosion has been a major problem in TN, and thirty five years ago the western TN region was reported by the Natural Resource Conservation Service to have the highest soil erosion rates from water erosion in the entire U.S. Since that time no-tillage cropping (planting crops in a narrow slit without tillage) and residue management (keeping at least 30% cover present on the soil) has become the common way crops are grown in TN. This has dramatically reduced erosion and led to increases in soil carbon, species biodiversity, etc. The changes have also led to new research concerning how these increases affect soil borne diseases, nematodes and other plant pests. The findings from this research may allow for enhanced cropping scenarios to reduce pest levels using the natural biological control systems in no-tillage cropping. This could reduce use of pesticides, especially nematicides for many crops, most notably soybeans. Positive changes in soil physical and chemical properties have also been observed when cropping is changed from intensively tilled to no-tilled systems. Many of these changes, including higher organic matter, improved soil structure, enhanced earthworm activity, increased water infiltration, etc. all are part of enhanced soil quality. These changes, especially carbon sequestration effects in no-tillage, have become more important with increasing concerns about global warming resulting from greenhouse gas emissions, including agricultural sources of carbon dioxide. Production of bioenergy, especially biomass energy from crop residues and use of dedicated bioenergy crops such as switchgrass, could also result in many societal benefits. We could reduce our dependency on foreign fossil fuel sources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions (especially carbon dioxide), and provide alternatives to annual row cropping systems. Development and use of fossil fuels are viewed as major contributors to air and water pollution and global warming. A major thrust is therefore present, locally and nationally, for biobased products such as ethanol to replace gasoline. Coal production and utilization in coal-fired electricity plants has resulted in numerous waste product problems. An emerging issue is the enhanced production of a coal combustion byproduct, flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum. The amount of this byproduct is expected to increase rapidly as various clean air initiatives are implemented. Presently, a small fraction of this material is landfilled, a costly and possibly environmentally damaging method of waste disposal. The rest is utilized in construction products such as wall board. The use is presently optimized in this market, meaning that as clean air technologies are used more widely, the greater amounts of gypsum produced will be left unused, to be either landfilled or possibly applied to agricultural land. Effective land application for maximum soil and crop benefits needs investigation. This would reduce the need for landfill space and minimize other potential environmental effects from large scale stockpiling, etc.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
528,"Free-radicals in food products can catalyze deteriorative type reactions, both in foods during storage and in the consumer of foods that contain high levels of free radicals. In 2008, Boatright and others were the first to quantify the levels of carbon-centered free radicals in commercial soy protein products and retail products made from isolated soy proteins (ISP). These levels ranged from 2.96 x 10^14 to 4.10 x10^15 free radicals per gram of soy protein. The higher radical contents were found in the powered drink mixes. The one-electron oxidation potentials for the alpha-carbon centered radicals of glycine anhydride, L-alanine anhydride, and DL-alanine anhydride have been shown to be similar to the alkyl peroxyl radicals, and likely contribute to numerous reactions once the protein is hydrated including the generation of hydroxyl radials from the reaction with molecular oxygen. Because high levels of free-radicals in food proteins can be harmful to the consumer of foods containing them, it is important to understand the mechanisms that led to the production and stabilization of these radicals in the food protein. As the second largest food crop in the U.S.A., with about 87 million metric tons produced in 2006, soy protein can have a strong economic impact. Since first commercially isolated in 1941, soy proteins have primary been used in non-human food applications; in large part because of their objectionable taste.

The situation in each field is unique and several factors must be considered in order to determine the best course of action. The challenge for growers in the future will be to integrate weed management programs in a pest management system specific to their operation. Weed species differ greatly in their ability to compete with the crop. The efficacy of herbicides and other suppressive tactics depends upon weed species and environmental conditions. As the cost of production increases, growers must be keenly aware of weed control costs. Decisions will need to be made concerning the cost of each herbicide input to determine whether the potential gain is greater than the cost. This will become more important over the next several years as new weed control technologies become available.

533,"Zone/no-tillage acreage of both corn and soybeans is growing due to concerns about energy costs, and about soil health and conservation. Tillage practices affect the types of weeds in a field. While winter annual, biennial, and simple perennial weeds do not survive primary (plowing) and secondary (fitting) tillage operations associated with conventional tillage systems, these weeds can become a problem when tillage is eliminated. Because they live for many years, simple perennials like dandelion are among the most problematic. Dandelions are considered simple perennials because they only spread by flowering and setting seed unlike many perennials that spread both vegetatively and by seed. Perennial forages, most commonly legume/grass mixtures, are a key component of crop rotations on NY dairy farms and are commonly infested with dandelions. Dandelions produce abundant seed and each seed has a tuft of hairs that facilitates wind dispersal to adjacent fields. While dandelions have always been a problem with continuous zone/no-tillage corn and soybean production, the potential for dandelion problems has increased with the growing popularity of glyphosate-resistant (GR) corn and soybeans. Since their introduction in 1996, acceptance of GR soybeans has been overwhelming. More than 95% of soybeans grown in NY and other northeastern states were GR varieties in 2008. Acceptance of GR corn has been slower and more variable among northeastern states than for soybeans. In 2008, GR corn acreage in the Northeast ranged from 52% in NY to an average of 78% for the states of DE, MD, and VA. All too often, glyphosate, a non-residual herbicide, is used alone on these GR crops. Residual herbicides that might prevent dandelion establishment are not routinely used, especially in GR soybeans. As the zone/no-tillage acreage of these GR crops increases, dandelions will become a greater problem than in the past. This project would demonstrate the value of residual herbicides in preventing dandelion encroachment into zone/no-tillage fields and determine whether this can be accomplished with less than labeled rates of residual herbicides. This would provide economic benefits for growers and environmental benefits for the public. The economic benefits for growers come from increased yields compared with yields from dandelion infested fields. In addition, if reduced rates of residual herbicides prevented dandelion encroachment, growers could realize cost savings from these reduced rates and/or reduction in costs associated with control of established dandelions. While environmental benefits are difficult to document, it is generally assumed that reduced rates of residual herbicides would minimize the potential for herbicide runoff into surface waters and for leaching into groundwater. Additional research is proposed to evaluate new herbicides and/or herbicide combinations for control of existing dandelion infestations in zone/no-tillage corn and soybeans. Incorporation of residual herbicides into weed management programs for zone/no-tillage cropping systems with GR crops would also delay or prevent development of GR weed populations.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
534,"Climate change is in the forefront of the agricultural community. Current predictions on crop and animal performance are based on our understanding of the current biological systems. These systems are likely to change in the future climate, however. A range of climate scenarios exist that attempt to describe how the climate will change over the next century. These scenarios vary in basic interpretation, but all tend to predict increased temperatures in the range of 1C to 2C for most of the Great Plains and Midwest. Meanwhile, according to these scenarios the total rainfall amounts in the Midwest and Great Plains will be reduced approximately 10% with a shift toward more precipitation during the winter months and less during the summer months. Numerous groups have sought to evaluate the impact of these climate changes on crop performance and the subsequent impacts that these changes may have on global food, fiber and fuel supplies. The results have indicated that high nighttime temperatures will reduce crop yields as a result of higher respiration requirements and carbon loss. Higher temperatures are also likely to cause more rapid crop development which may result in lower yields by shortening the grain filling period. Available predictions foresee a 17 percent yield reduction in corn and soybean yield for each 1C increase in air temperatures when temperature effect was confounded with rainfall limitation. Currently, most climate change scenario predictions are at planetary scales (in the order of 1000 km in spatial resolution). How these predictions may apply to local areas in the NC region and how the future climate may affect the local crop environment (soil condition and crop production) and bioenergy productions remain to be understood.

536,"When proteins are partially hydrolyzed with appropriate enzymes, many of the resulting products (protein fragments, known as peptides) show antioxidant activity. Compared with synthetic antioxidants, antioxidative peptides have the main advantages of exerting no known health risks and can offer additional functionality. Despite the demonstrated antioxidant potential, the fate of antioxidative protein hydrolysates or peptides in foods during processing and subsequent storage is poorly understood. This project seeks to investigate the physicochemical changes in antioxidative peptides as a result of exposure to reactive oxygen species (objective 1), interactions of antioxidative peptides with various food components under different food processing pH, temperature and salt conditions (objective 2), and properties of selected foods treated with antioxidative peptides (objective 3). Mixed antioxidative peptides (protein hydrolysates) will be prepared from soy, milk whey, potato and buckwheat proteins that have proven to be excellent sources of antioxidant peptides from previous research. Antioxidative peptides and proteins in 0.1-0.6 M NaCl at pH 5-7 will be oxidatively stressed by exposures to hydroxyl radicals produced from FeCl3/ascorbate/H2O2 reactions, or auto-oxidized at different temperatures (5-80C). Oxidatively modified peptides and proteins will be evaluated for structural characteristics, physicochemical changes, tendency to interact with major food components, and influence on the quality of selected foods (meat batters, pork loins, and gravies). We expect that in the process of neutralizing small-sized radials, for example, hydroxyl radicals, antioxidant peptides and proteins will undergo major structural changes and form aggregates among themselves and with other chemical components in food, and ultimately, alter the physicochemical characteristics of final food products. Furthermore, we expect peptides to degrade into fragments when exposed to strong oxidizing environments while serving as antioxidants. It is likely that many of the antioxidative peptides not only can protect foods from oxidative destruction, but they also can enhance the functional attributes of final food products. With an annual output of 46.92 million bushels (1.28 M tons) of soybeans, Kentucky ranks 17th in the nation in total soybean production. Through identification of antioxidant activity and physical and chemical stability of soy peptides during processing, the proposed research may lead to novel utilization of soybeans or soy proteins thereby stimulating the economy of the state. Results obtained from this study will be disseminated to the stakeholders through presentations at local, regional and national meetings and publication in technical and non-technical journals.

537,"Nitrogen is the most critical nutrient for growing corn and accounts for the largest fertilizer investment in modern agriculture. Since the 1970's, this investment has been viewed as a form of insurance against yield loss from N limitation, and there has been widespread reliance on yield-based N recommendations. In these recommendations, an expected yield goal is multiplied by 1.2 and the product is then corrected, if appropriate, by applying estimated credits for a previous legume or the use of manure for the current growing season. The usual result is overfertilization beyond what the crop needs, which not only reduces profitability for the farmer but also leads to air and water pollution and even degrades the soil itself. Clearly, the use of N fertilizers should be matched to crop N requirement, but in a humid region such as Illinois, this only becomes feasible if there is some means to estimate the soil's N-supplying power. The Illinois Soil N Test (ISNT) was developed for precisely this purpose, and has been used successfully in several field trials to predict yield response by corn to N fertilization. There have, however, also been negative evaluations, suggesting the need to improve ISNT interpretations by accounting for other factors that can affect soil N availability or crop N requirement, such as soil series, cropping system (continuous corn versus corn-soybean), planting rate, tillage, residue management, and weather conditions. In the present project, these and other factors will be evaluated for improving the calibration of the ISNT in optimizing N fertilizer rates for corn. The expected outcome is a more accurate fertilizer N recommendation that enhances profitability for producers while reducing the adverse environmental effects of overfertilization.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

539,"Soybean is a major U.S. agricultural crop and export commodity. New and versatile uses of soybeans such as soyfoods, vegetable soybeans (edamame), animal feeds, pharmaceutical products, and industrial products such as biodiesel fuel generate increased domestic and worldwide demand for U.S. soybeans, soybean meal, and soybean oil. Nevertheless the U.S. currently faces issues which limit U.S. export shares of the global soy market including increased competition from expanded soybean production in Brazil and other regions of South America, and competition in world markets from expanded production of other oil producing crops. The increased competition puts extra pressure on U.S. producers to maximize production from optimized inputs. The broad array of uses and the world demand for soybean, soybean oil, and soybean meal coupled with the projected expanded use for soy products in the future provides an optimistic outlook for soybean. Innovative research will provide new genetic lines and knowledge allowing U.S. soybean producers to compete in a global market. Genetic gains will be accomplished through plant breeding research, leading to increased soybean production potential. The methods will include hybridization of genetically diverse parental stocks which are complementary in genes for desirable attributes. Parent stocks will be chosen from breeding lines from the University of Tennessee program, breeding lines and varieties from other public and commercial breeding programs, and from the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection. The inheritance of genes affecting various traits deemed to be important for plant growth, seed yield, or seed quality will be investigated with classical genetic and molecular genetic analyses. Specific populations will be analyzed for protein, amino acid composition of the protein, oil concentration, fatty acid composition of the oil, and other seed quality traits (eg. isoflavones) in order to identify and develop superior new value-added soybean lines. New advances in quantitative trait loci detection and molecular genetic marker assisted selection will accelerate genetic gains. The goals, objectives, and anticipated outputs are 1) the development of high-yielding soybean varieties that are resistant to pests of economic importance and are adapted to the climatic and cultural practices of Tennessee, the Mid-South, and Southeast regions of the U.S., 2) the development of superior soybean lines or varieties with modified oil quality, enhanced protein concentration, improved vegetable soybean nutrition and flavor, or other value-added traits, and 3) the discovery of new information on soybean genetics and breeding methodologies to enable new technologies which will enhance the science and effectiveness of plant breeding.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
540,"Over the last decade, a lone biotechnology --Roundup Ready Soybeans-- has single-handedly transformed the global soybean complex, delivering billions of dollars in economic gains while drastically changing the acreage base and cropping practices of soybean production in North and South America. Industry and research observers regularly suggest that this is a precursor to an exciting pipeline of new input traits that will fight disease and improve agronomic performance and output traits that will greatly expand the uses and reach of the soybean industry. The technical pathways for the development of new soybean traits, while still challenging, are becoming more clear and predictable because of ongoing advances in biotechnology. The pathways to commercialization, however, are becoming more costly and less predictable due to increasing uncertainties in the regulatory process. Indeed, the global regulatory environment for biotechnology is in flux and is becoming increasingly complex. In keeping pace with globalization trends, there is increasing emphasis on the development of international/global regulations (e.g. the Biosafety Protocol). Yet it has become increasingly difficult to effectively govern and implement such regulations across various countries with widely different technical and regulatory infrastructure and capabilities. Health and environmental safety regulations are also on the rise across the globe with increasing attention paid to non technical decision factors. Furthermore, asynchronicity across countries is creating significant trade problems. The cases of new biotechnology crops that have received regulatory approval for production in some countries but have not been deregulated in others is on the rise causing abrupt interruptions in trade and significant market disruptions. The development of certain novel (e.g. compositional) biotech traits might also bring about new regulatory challenges. Over the last twenty years, regulatory approval of agronomic biotech traits has been built around the internationally accepted concept of  substantial equivalence  - a comparative analysis that seeks to demonstrate that biotech foods and feeds are compositionally similar and as safe as their conventional counterparts. However, the very concept of  substantial equivalence  maybe inappropriate for regulating crops designed to be compositionally different from conventional ones. If recent history is any guide, one might anticipate that the emerging regulatory environment could cause increasing approval and registration costs for new products; time delays in getting from the lab to the field and into the market; and increasing compliance costs after commercialization. All such costs could diminish the potential market value of new traits and the viability of many value added markets. In this context, successful development of new biotech traits and post commercialization success could depend on effectively anticipating and understanding the economic and strategic implications of US and global biotech regulatory policies but also influencing their development in constructive ways.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

542,"1. THE EVOLUTION OF WRKY TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN THE PLANT KINGDOM WRKY transcription factors are one of the largest and most important families of plant transcription factors. They are of ancient origin but are completely absent from yeast and animal lineages. In higher plants, the majority of these members are key regulators of important stress responses such as the responses to drought, wounding and pathogens. Lower plants contain less WRKY genes and certain subgroups are missing. I aim to discover the roles of WRKY transcription factors in mosses and algae, as well as higher plants and thereby shed new light on the function of this important family of transcription factors across the entire plant kingdom. 2. PLANT PROMOTERS FOR USE IN BASIC RESEARCH AND PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY For many strategies aimed at improving crop plants using transgenes, the stumbling block is not what gene or genes to express but rather how to express it. The right gene will not improve crop performance if it is not expressed in the right way. Being able to express genes in the desired way requires a collection of different promoter regions that can be used to turn a gene on and off when and where expression of the gene is required. Large collections of suitable promoters that direct gene expression in the desired way (for example drought, cold or pathogen inducible) are lacking and this project looks to provide useful promoters for both plant biotechnology and basic plant research. 3. BRACHYPODIUM DISTACHYON AS A MODEL SYSTEM TO STUDY COLD AND DROUGHT-INDUCED GENES IN GRASSES Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) is poised to become to monocot crops what Arabidopsis is to dicots - the model system for gene discovery. The JGI describes it as the new model plant for temperate grasses and herbaceous energy crops. This project aims to isolate genes that regulate drought and cold responses in Brachypodium. These genes will then be used to dissect the processes of drought tolerance and cold hardiness. The ultimate goal of the project is to use Brachpodium as a model system for wheat as this should bypass the technical problems associated with wheat and lead to new strategies for wheat improvement. 4. WRKY TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS AS TOOLS TO IMPROVE DROUGHT RESPONSES Drought is the major culprit behind crop losses worldwide, with billion dollar losses in the USA. WRKY transcription factors are key regulators of many plant stress responses but until recently, there was little evidence linking WRKYs with drought responses. We now know that many WRKY genes are induced by drought. We have identified this as a major gap in our knowledge and an opportunity to increase drought tolerance. Our hypothesis is that WRKYs are regulators of water stress responses and that similar genes regulate these responses in different plant species. Our goal is to identify WRKY genes that regulate drought responses in rice and soybean and develop a tool to identify similar genes in other crop plants. The project will not only increase our knowledge of drought responses in crop plants but also lead to new approaches aimed at reducing crop losses in the USA.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

In addition, plant response is modulated by RNA regulation in stress hormone signal transduction though this process is not well studied. is unclear. We have found that Arabidopsis and rice tandem zinc (AtTZF1) acts as a positive regulator of ABA, and a negative regulator of GA accumulation and/or response. Plants over-expressing AtTZF1 are superior in both drought and cold tolerance. By contrast, loss-of-function mutants are drought sensitive. We hypothesize that plant TZF proteins are involved in stress response by mediating the expression of genes involved in ABA/GA accumulation and/or responses. To test this hypothesis, we will genetically characterize the roles of Arabidopsis and soybean TZFs in various stress responses, and further decipher their relationships with hormones and other stress signaling pathways.

Across major agricultural regions and crops within the continental United States, the annual loss caused by plant-parasitic nematodes is seven to ten percent, an estimate that translates into tens of millions of dollars. In the south, where there is great crop diversity and where winter conditions are relatively mild, losses probably exceed these estimates because of the widespread occurrence of the three most damaging nematode species in the world: the root knot nematode, Meloidogyne spp.; the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines; and the reniform nematode, Rotylenchulus reniformis.

546,"In 2006, more acres of soybean were harvested in the U.S. (74.6 million) than acres of any other crop, including corn (70.6 million). Given this large acreage and wide distribution, it is not surprising that soybean continues to suffer from insect pests that impact plant growth, grain quality, and yield. Changes in cropping practices, or global climate change, the distribution and impact of native and established pests is increasing in soybean. Producers are encountering insect problems that they have never seen or managed. Changes in pest distribution and status require greater understanding of pest biology and movement, as well as the development or modification of scouting and control methods. Although pesticides are often the easy first tools used to deal with new or growing insect problems, long-term sustainable solutions must include host plant resistance and biological control. In the northern U.S. and eastern Canada, the discovery of the soybean aphid (SBA) in 2000 fundamentally changed soybean insect management. SBA feeding impacts all components of yield; under heavy aphid pressure, yield differences between treated and untreated research plots may reach 50%. Although scouting methods and an economic threshold (ET) for aphid control were developed under the previous multi-state project, these management practices are only applicable to soybeans in the R1 to R5 growth stages planted in 30-inch rows. The thresholds must be modified to account for plant maturity group and age, differences in planting systems (for example, varying row widths), and populations of biological control agents. Specialty soybean production is a growing, profitable market for producers, including production of seed, non-GMO, identity preserved (IP) and USDA-certified organic soybeans. IP soybeans are sought for traits such as high protein, high isoflavone, or improved flavor or texture in the case of tofu (bean curd) and edamame (vegetable soybean). By volume, soybeans make up the largest segment of organic legumes in the U.S. Production practices and quality requirements of specialty beans differ from those of conventionally-produced roundup-ready beans, thus insect management practices are also likely to differ. The introduction of soybean aphid resulted in an increase in pesticide use on soybeans in the Midwest. Industry recommendations to customers now routinely include tank mixes of insecticides and fungicides for plant health benefits, even in the absence of pest pressure. The recent registration of seed-applied insecticides also encourages growers to use products as insurance treatments rather than basing applications on scouting. The efficacy and economic viability of insurance treatments need to be addressed in a concerted way. To move beyond chemical use, particularly to control bean leaf beetle, soybean aphid, stink bug, and other chronic pests, alternatives are critically needed. These alternatives include both biological control and host plant resistance, preventative tactics which form the foundation of IPM, and which must be integrated with therapeutic tactics such as insecticide use.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Seeds provide a wide variety of human nutrition as well as materials for fuel and chemical production. Engineering crops to produce biodiesel will help reduce the dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels, while introducing nutritionally beneficial, low allergenic proteins or other metabolites (e.g. vitamins and pharmaceuticals) will help to produce healthy foods. Soybean, as the major crop for biodiesel production, offers the best opportunity for an improvement, as it accumulates only 20 percent of oil. Increases in soybean oil content to 50 to 60 percent (found in peanuts and canola) are expected. Annually, 3.4B lbs of vegetable oil are converted to biodiesel in the U.S. worth $1.5B. Tripling the production of oil from the same amount of seed material will promote the long-term improvement and sustainability of U.S. and Virginia agriculture and economy. Plant metabolic engineering (ME) has been a matter of trial and error and success was scarce due to complexities in seed metabolism and its regulation. In this research, new techniques in systems biology will be explored in attempt to propose rational seed ME strategies for altering seed composition. Producing more oil can be viewed as moving carbon from another major storage reserve in the seeds, for example storage protein, to the relevant oil-related pathways. Therefore, it is important to understand how these fluxes (flow of material through metabolic reaction reaction rate) are regulated. Transcriptional regulation (turning on and off protein synthesis from genes by transcription factors (TFs)) is important for accumulation of seed storage compounds. In addition, TFs tend to regulate the expression of multiple genes/ gene families and as such, metabolic fluxes through whole pathways. Therefore, TFs are ideal candidates for rational ME. One first needs to find the TFs that regulate oil and protein accumulation, which can be achieved by disrupting their genes and screen these TF mutants for altered seed metabolism and composition by analytical methods. Arabidopsis is a great model system due to availability of many tools including mutants. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is a powerful toolset in systems biology for quantifying carbon flow. MFA will be used on Arabidopsis TF mutants to aid in rational ME of seed storage compounds. From the scientific perspective, this interdisciplinary research will provide the starting point for unraveling the fundamental concepts of regulation of seed metabolic variability. Identified mutants will provide material for genuine research experiences for Virginia high school students participating in the Partnership for Research and Education in Plants (PREP) program.

Such metabolite movement is an important part of plant biochemistry. Our research investigates genes involved in the movement of particular nitrogen-containing compounds called nucleobases between cells and into different cellular compartments. Indeed, nucleobases play a key role in the synthesis of ureides the main nitrogen transport molecule nitrogen-fixing soybeans. We will examine the nucleobase transport genes form the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and determine the function using microbial systems. Here the plant genes are moved into microbial strains that are deficient in transporting specific nucleobases. Experiments will be performed to determine if the plant transporter genes can function in place of the mutated microbial genes. In this way the function of the plant genes can be ascertained. Once such information is known, further studies will be undertaken to determine exactly where and when in the plant these specific nucleobase transporter genes are active. The information gained from this proposal will be used by other scientists in the development of improved crops.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
556,"Projects related to the control of corn aflatoxins and charcoal rot of soybean have been ongoing since 2005. In addition, a newly emerging problem to producers in Mississippi, sweetpotato rot is causing increased yield losses annually. Therefore, the research will focus on 1) Continue research on the biology and epidemiology of the charcoal rot pathogen as it affects soybeans. Previous research has shown a correlation between specific nutrient deficiencies with increased disease symptoms (increased toxin production by pathogen) and yield reductions. Research on nutrient-toxin interaction is the key to developing control practices for charcoal rot. 2)Primers and PCR inhibitor/modifiers have now been identified for use in real-time PCR work on the aflatoxin forming fungus, Aspergillus flavus, in corn. These techniques will allow us to easily identify and quantify the fungus in corn tissues. Research can now focus on inoculating seedlings of corn varieties, and test them for resistance. In addition, fungal species are known to produce aerial or volatile chemicals that can be detected and quantified. This procedure will also be tested using inoculated seedlings for resistance studies. 3) Sweetpotato work will focus essentially on determination of the causal pathogen(s) responsible for sweetpotato rot. This research will be conducted across all tissue types during each stage of root development and storage. Identification of isolates will be done using traditional isolation-molecular and directly from tissues using molecular sequence data for bacteria and fungi. 4) If funding is available, rotation-tillage studies and their effects on fungal pathogen populations will be continued.

557,"Flowering is a major developmental transition from a vegetative growth phase to a reproductive phase to produce progeny. The flowering transition is central to reproductive success in plants and for determining environmental fitness. In the case of crop species, flowering-related traits are major targets of the domestication process by human selection. The flowering process involves extensive rearrangement of plant architecture and is extremely costly for both annual and perennial plants. Therefore it is important to achieve tight and precise control of the timing of flowering to synchronize with suitable environments (i.e. availability of pollinators or seasonal timing that allows seed maturation) or with agricultural procedure. Understanding molecular mechanisms of the flowering process will provide genetic and genomic tools to modify flowering time in a variety of plant species. Although flowering-gene pathways are known to be one of the best studied molecular networks in plants, applications of flowering genes for agricultural use have been limited. First, most of our current knowledge has been focused on perception and response to external signals, rather than the internal signaling mechanisms that may allow molecular switches to be turned on/off easily and directly by artificial modulation. Secondly, most of the present efforts are restricted to model species, and studies in commercially-important crop species are well behind. In this project, we aim to clarify the core flower signaling mechanisms by antagonistic regulators FT and TFL1, a major florigen and its close homolog in a model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and an important crop soybean. FT and TFL1 provide excellent tools to dissect the processes of flower signaling. Elucidation of the molecular actions of FT and TFL1 and examination of evolutionary relationships through species comparisons will bring essential information closer to agricultural application of flowering genes and will expand future potential for developing superior crop species by genetic modification or breeding techniques.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

559,"Stink bugs are a key pest of soybean management. The redbanded stink bug has recently become a pest in MS soybeans. A better understanding of the biology of this pest is needed to develop sustainable management strategies. Two important gaps in our knowledge of this insect are its cold tolerance and its alternative hosts before soybeans are suitable. Research will try to improve our understanding of these areas with the expectation that cultural control strategies may be developed to exploit these parts of its life cycle. All stink bugs feed by piercing the pod and seed coat to extract nutrients from the seed. During feeding they open a wound that can be exploited by pathogens. The relationship between stink bugs and soybean diseases is poorly understood, so we will conduct a series of studies to examine the interaction of stink bug and Phomopsis seed decay, one of the more common soybean diseases. The outcome of this research could alter stink bug thresholds or the timing of insecticide or fungicide applications. Bollworm is a major pest of many crops, including soybeans and is known to travel long distances. Proposed research will indirectly try to estimate movement based on trends of larval hosts, pyrethroid resistance, and cropping patterns so we can better predict future problems with this pest.

560,"The rapid increase in price of conventional feed ingredients such as corn and soybean for poultry feed has made the search for alternative feed sources become urgent. Algae and corn biofuel production may provide cost effective and nutritionally valuable by-products (e.g. algae meal and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS)) to the poultry industry. In order to help reduce feed costs, DDGS have been intensively studied throughout the past few years in effort to efficiently incorporate them into feed for farm animals including poultry. However, newly developed biofuel refining processes have changed the composition of DDGS to create new by-products such as de-oiled DDGS. The production of de-oiled DDGS is expected to surpass the production of regular DDGS as production demands for biodiesel increases. Little information exists regarding the effects of the new merging alternative feed ingredients, (algae meal and de-oiled DDGS) in poultry and other species is available. The huge rise in production and availability of by-products from the bioethanol and biodiesel industries has sparked increases in research work to examine the potential of adding exogenous enzymes in animal feed in order to upgrade their nutritional value. Exogenous enzyme supplementation in the diet may improve the digestibility of nutrients and have a beneficial effect on intestinal microflora. Previous studies have shown that carbohydrases increased AME (Apparent Metabolizable Energy) and growth performance of the broiler diet with high DDGS. In addition, phytase inclusions may increase the bioavailability of phosphorous (P) in DDGS. Dietary supplementation with NSP (non-starch polysaccharides)-degrading carbohydrases has potential to further improve the release of P by phytase and improve nutrient digestibility by eliminating the phytate chelating effects of NSP, as well as the nutrient encapsulating effect of cell walls while also reducing digesta viscosity. Exogenous enzymes may also eliminate the anti-nutritive properties of certain dietary NSP by their enzymatic hydrolysis to prebiotic type components which, in turn, may facilitate GI (gastro-intestinal tract) development and health in young chickens. There is a great importance in examining and monitoring the GI microflora because changes in the microbial community might affect the overall feed digestibility and animal and human health. However, no studies have been conducted on the effects of incorporating Algae meal and de-oiled DDGS into the diet or the interaction of these alternative feed ingredients with exogenous enzymes (phytase and carbohydrases) on the microbial populations in the broiler GI tract. Therefore, it is critical to determine the effects of alternative feed ingredients and supplementation of exogenous enzymes on the establishment of GI microflora profile. Determining proper inclusions of these by-products into poultry diets and their efficacy when one or more exogenous enzymes are included in the diet is important to minimize monetary inputs and maximize broiler performance and health.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
561,"Ryegrass baleage is an important commodity in South Mississippi. Its use has been widespread among dairy producers will little practice among beef producers. However, with rising commodity feed costs, it has become more attractive to beef producers, however little data exist with regards to its complete value as a feedstuff for livestock. The physical characteristics of the baleage (highly digestible forage crop), as well as the chemical ensiling that occur may increase the digestible protein within the feed. Numerous studies have shown that growing cattle have a specific need for undegradable protein therefore our hypothesis is that a deficiency may exist. One commonly available source of undegradable intake protein is dried distillers grains. This may help overcome any deficiencies that exist. However, a limiting nutrient in the dried distillers grains may be lysine, which might impact animal performance. Therefore to address the concern that lysine might be limiting a protein source high in lysine will be used in addition to the dried distillers grains. Thus, the treatments we will examine will be baleage fed alone, baleage fed along with a supplement of dried distillers grains, and baleage fed with a supplement of dried distillers grains and a heat treated soybean meal.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
562,"Plant nematodes have been referred to as the hidden enemy of crops because the losses resulting from these plant pests are often over-looked and under estimated. Yet nematodes are among the most wide-spread pests affecting crop production, especially in the southern United States where the warm climate and abundance of sandy soils provides an ideal environment for this group of pests. As a group, nematodes are estimated to cause 10-14 percent yield losses annually. They are especially important on cotton, peanut, soybean, turf, and numerous vegetable crops. Although several species of nematodes are recognized as important pests of individual crops, the root-knot nematodes are widely considered to be the most important nematode pests because of their extensive host range, with one or more species able to parasitize nearly every crop grown in the United States. The soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) is also a major pest because of its aggressive behavior and widespread distribution in soybean production areas of the South and the Midwest. Recently the reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis) has received increasing recognition and attention as a pest of several crops, especially cotton. The importance of nematodes and the losses they cause is substantiated by the level of financial support given by stakeholders to the research efforts of many of the scientists that will be involved in this project. These stakeholders include Cotton Incorporated, the National Soybean Board, the National Peanut Board, and state level growers associations for each of these major crops. Much of the support for the proposed research will come directly from these stakeholder groups. Historically, nematodes were controlled (when growers were cognizant of their effects on crop yields) by the application of either a fumigant nematicide or one of a few granular insecticides that also had nematicidal activity. All of these products have been shown to present significant hazards to both environmental and human health. The recognition of these risks have resulted in either a loss of registration or greatly increased restrictions on the use of these pesticides. No new nematicide or nematicidal chemistry that has proven effectiveness has been developed in nearly 30 years to fill this void. A few new products have been developed, such as the use of abamections as a seed treatment but with limited success. Crop rotation has the potential to suppress nematode populations but is not widely practiced by growers. The wide host range of several important nematode pests limits the number of crops that a grower can use in rotation with their primarly crop of interest to suppress nematode populations because effective rotation crops are frequently of lesser economic value. Because of the intensive crop production systems utilized by many growers, if a rotation crop is to be adopted it must have substantial benefit beyond just suppression of nematode pests.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

564,"Humans have been rapidly altering the air around us ever since the discovery of fire. Today, there is widespread combustion of fossil fuels to meet our transportation, energy, and industrial needs. In a country that relies heavily upon the combustion of diesel fuel for construction, agricultural, and transportation needs, exposure to diesel exhaust (DE) is widespread. DE is a large contributor to soot and fine particles in the air and inhalational exposures have been implicated in increasing one’s risk for chronic lung inflammation and fibrosis, allergic immune responses in the lungs, asthma, lung cancer, and cardiovascular events. However, much of this understanding stems from population, animal, or limited in vitro studies. There exists a need for an improved understanding of what occurs at the cellular level following diesel exposure. Further, the nature of diesel exhaust is changing as environmental and public health concerns dictate stricter EPA regulation of emissions from diesel engines. Environmental and energy concerns have called for the use of alternative fuels like biodiesel, which also changes the physical and chemical nature of diesel exhaust. Given the changing dynamics of the particulate matter (PM) found in DE, there exists a need to more fully understand the human health implications of switching to more efficient and “cleaner” (Tier 4) diesel engines, and engines that run on alternative fuels like soy-based or algae-based diesel. This project seeks to utilize an improved lung cell culture and exposure system to (1) compare the health effects of diesel exhaust from a Tier 4 engine vs. a Tier 2 engine and (2) compare the health effects of DE from engines run on traditional petrodiesel vs. alternative biodiesel fuels.Synopsis:In a country that relies heavily on diesel fuel combustion, exposure to DE is widespread.

567,"Climate change will expand the distribution of warm-climate agricultural pests, with adverse consequences to U.S. agriculture. Adapting to this threat requires the monitoring of pest movements, the ability to forecast climate-induced changes in pest migration, and environmentally benign methods of preemptive pest control. This proposal uses fall armyworm as a model system to address these objectives. In addition to being a major agricultural pest in the Western Hemisphere, fall armyworm migratory behavior is representative of many other moths of agricultural importance (e.g., corn earworm, black cutworm, beet armyworm, soybean looper) that are primary contributors to losses in corn, forage, biofuel, and vegetable crops. It is also a semi-tropical insect, representing the type of pest whose geographical range in the U.S. will likely expand if climate change trends continue. Therefore, fall armyworm studies will produce information of broad applicability while providing unique technical advantages important to achieving the following objectives. First, is the establishment of self-sustaining networks to monitor fall armyworm movements and collect specimens. Second, is to analyze the collections from these networks by a novel genetic method to delineate migratory pathways. Third is to correlate the observed migration patterns with seasonal meteorological factors to develop air transport models that can explain fall armyworm movements and identify agricultural regions at risk for climate-induced changes in fall armyworm distribution. Fourth is the development of environmentally-benign strategies using plant species as cover crops that are unsupportive of fall armyworm development to mitigate the anticipated expansion of infestations without added pesticide use. This proposal is a multidisciplinary effort that establishes fall armyworm migration as a bioindicator of climate change effects in the U.S. and is focused on the goals of improving the forecasting and control of pest outbreaks brought about by climate variability and long-term climate change. The anticipated products include: a network for the monitoring of fall armyworm movements in the U.S.; a detailed map of migration pathways and overwintering ranges in the U.S.; models for predicting the influence of weather patterns and climate change on migration and infestation patterns; and new strategies for controlling the predicted spread of fall armyworm infestations. Predicted impacts include: reduced economic losses by targeting susceptible areas for early monitoring and preemptive control measures; reduced pesticide costs by adoption of alternative control techniques adapted for fall armyworm; and improved grower decision-making capability with respect to crop choice and planting time due to better understanding of pest migration and improved pest monitoring.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

569,"Soybean aphid is an invasive insect that is native to Asia. It was first discovered in North America in 2000 and is currently the major insect pest of soybean in North America. To reduce use of insecticides, researchers have used traditional breeding to create soybean varieties that are more resistant to soybean aphid. Most soybean aphids do not survive and reproduce on these new plant varieties, which are just reaching commercial availability. However, some soybean aphid  biotypes  develop perfectly well on resistant soybean varieties. It is not known why some soybean aphids perform well and some perform poorly on resistant soybean, but it is important to understand the biological basis for this variation in the aphid, so that we can use the best strategies for deploying resistant soybean and preserving its usefulness. In this grant, we are investigating the hypothesis that a bacterial symbiont in the aphid, known as Arsenophonus, might affect the aphid's ability to use resistant soy. Many insects have bacteria living inside of them that perform a wide variety of functions, and can affect ecological factors such as host plant usage and interaction with parasitoids (insects that attack and consume other insects). The function of Arsenophonus in soybean aphid is unknown, but preliminary tests suggest that aphids with this bacteria perform differently on resistant soy than aphids without it. For this grant, we will cure multiple aphid biotypes using antibiotics, and then compare the performance of aphids with and without the symbiont on resistant soy. We will also test whether the symbiont affects the susceptibility of the aphid to introduced parasitoids that are being used for biological control of the aphid population. This seed grant will therefore 1) generate differentially-infected aphid lines that can be used in this and future grants to understand the biology of the aphid and the bacteria, 2) indicate whether the bacterial symbiont affects soybean aphid ability to use resistant soy plants, and 3) test whether the bacterial symbiont affects soybean aphid susceptibility to biological control.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

571,"In February 1998, during an inspection of root nodulation in the soybean, cysts of the nematode Heterodera glycines race 2 were discovered at Isabela, Puerto Rico. The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is considered one of the most damaging invasive species worldwide and the major yield-limiting nematode of soybeans in the United States. Recent surveys have shown the rapid spread of this parasite in agro-ecosystems. Periodic monitoring for the presence and population densities of SCN is essential to prevent dissemination, to determine crop losses, and to devise management strategies. However, a monitoring program has not been established in Puerto Rico. Since the first report of SCN in 1999, no further work has been performed. The presence of this nematode is at this point entirely unknown in Puerto Rico; therefore, this study is warranted. The objectives of this proposal are (1) to conduct region-wide coordinated surveys on soybean plantations to determine the incidence and spread of Heterodera glycines and thus avoid potential major detrimental economic effects; and (2) to implement a practical training program for the early detection of SCN. To detect the SCN, a survey will be performed in areas planted with soybeans. Suspected plants with roots and surrounding attached soil will be collected from these areas shortly after the soybean is harvested. In addition, soil samples will be collected by using a cylindrical soil probe. A total of 1,500 samples will be collected in a zig-zag pattern across the entire area to be sampled. In the laboratory, samples will be processed using the Fenwick can method. In orderfor this method to be effective in detecting the problem in a short time, a training program will be developed and implemented. The first step will be a workshop on morphological identification of the SCN, larvae and adults. This workshop will be addressed to the representatives of the diagnostic clinics in Puerto Rico, graduate and undergraduate students, and related research laboratories throughout the island. This effort will be called  Train the Trainers in SCN . Once this group has been trained, a series of workshops will be designed to train the personnel of Seed Companies, extension educators, regional specialists, farmers, and related workers interested in SCN diagnosis. Also, material will be prepared and circulated among the participants. Topics to be covered include nematode biology and ecology; symptoms of nematode damage in the field; sampling procedures; basic morphology of soybean cyst nematode; and common control practices for nematode population management.

Objective 3: Develop feeds and feeding strategies to improve nutrient retention, production efficiency, product quality and fish health.Approach:   The U.S. aquaculture industry faces numerous challenges including high feed and energy costs, low-cost imports and lower fish prices paid to producers. Among these, feed cost represents the largest expenditure in aquaculture operations, and protein is the most expensive component in fish feeds. Lower cost alternative protein sources to replace fish meal and other expensive protein sources must be identified. Soybean meal (SBM), because of its low-cost, availability, consistent quality, and high nutritional value, is the most commonly used plant ingredient in fish feeds, comprising up to 45% grow-out diets. Distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS) is readily available and less expensive than SBM and other conventional protein sources on a protein-cost basis, but its use in fish feeds is very limited. Replacement of SBM or more costly ingredients by DDGS would reduce feed costs. This proposed project will investigate the nutritional value and nutrient bioavailability of DDGS derived from various grain sources, and corn DDGS from ethanol plants for channel catfish and tilapia, define the essential fatty acid (EFA) requirement, optimum ratio of n-3 to n-6 and their effect on gene and protein expression, identify biologically active compounds in DDGS which may improve fish growth and health, and develop least-cost feed and feeding strategies to improve nutrient retention, product quality and health. This project should lead to reduced feed costs, increased use of DDGS, and improved feeding practices which will lead to improved growth and survival and product quality, lower producton costs, as well as increased demand of DDGS.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Develop economically sustainable production systems for forage and biomass crops that reduce the net emissions of greenhouse gases per unit of forage or biomass production. The research will contribute to the ARS GRACEnet project.Approach:   Experiments will be conducted in available open top field chambers, greenhouse exposure chambers, and custom Outdoor Plant Environment Chambers (OPECs) or in a new air exclusion system to be developed by this project that allow for testing of plant responses to combinations of carbon dioxide and ozone under contrasting conditions of temperature and vapor pressure deficit. A multi-year field study will be established using the air exclusion system to test the effects of elevated ozone, temperature and carbon dioxide on a soybean-winter wheat continuous no-till cropping system. Detailed assessments of plant growth, biomass, and yield along with measurements of leaf gas exchange, tissue chemistry and micrometeorological data will be used as inputs for parameterization of DSSAT-CSM CROPGRO-Soybean and CERES-Wheat models. Ozone-sensitive and tolerant snap beans will be grown in the OPECs where control of relative humidity and temperature allows for the study of plant responses to elevated ozone and carbon dioxide under contrasting vapor pressure deficit conditions. Wheat cultivars that are susceptible and resistant to stripe or stem rust will be grown in the OPECs and inoculated with pathogens under a range of carbon dioxide, ozone, temperature and vapor pressure deficit conditions to examine the potential impact of these climate change factors on infection and progression of disease. Soybean germplasm will be exposed to elevated ozone conditions in greenhouse exposure chambers or open-top field chambers and foliar injury and seed yield measurements used to identify tolerant cultivars.

576,"Objective(s): Project objectives are: 1) Measure and model the impact of agricultural systems (animal and cropping) on air quality components to identify and develop potential mitigation strategies, 2) Measure and model the impact of agricultural systems on greenhouse gas emissions and develop and evaluate potential mitigation strategies, 3) Measure and model soil and atmospheric factors limiting water, nitrogen, and light use efficiency of annual and perennial cropping systems to determine how they can become more resilient to climate change and 4) Intercompare crop and economic models and foster improvements in these models to increase their capability to utilize data from climate scenarios as part of AgMIP.Approach:   Studies across the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in this project will develop new methods for quantifying emission and dispersion (particulates, NH3, VOC?s) from animal and cropping systems, improve methods for measuring different compounds in the air to provide increased quantitative capability to measure impacts of CAFO?s on air quality, determine greenhouse gas emissions (N2O, CH4, CO2) from cropping systems, and quantify effects of changing climate on water, light, and nitrogen use by crops. The initial development of a lidar-based approach to measure plume dynamics from animal facilities will be evaluated to produce a remote-sensing approach that will be used to guide sampling methods that use point-based samplers. These data will be collected over a range of facilities and throughout the day to capture the range of atmospheric stability conditions. Air sampling methods for volatile organic compounds will be accomplished with a range of methods from sorbent tubes and canisters. These will also be coupled with methods to measure the volatile organic compounds attached to particulates. These observations will be collected in different livestock facilities. Greenhouse gas emissions will be quantified using soil chambers for a range of soil management and nitrogen management studies to quantify the emissions throughout a year. Measures of water, nitrogen, carbon accumulation, and light use efficiency will use an integrated approach that blends micrometeorological with physiological measurements. These experiments will be conducted using field-scale environments and will integrate all efficiency factors into a combined assessment. The energy balance approach used in these studies blends the fast response of CO2 and H2O vapor signals with sonic anemometers, net radiation components, soil heat flux, and surface temperature along with remote sensing to obtain growth characteristics of the crop. Studies will be conducted in the rhizotron to assess the impact of rapidly induced temperature changes on crop physiological responses under a range of soil water conditions. Accomplishing these three objectives will result in the development of agricultural practices and mitigation strategies that reduce environmental impact, while maintaining or increasing productivity. Mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions will balance agricultural production efficiency and increased carbon capture and nitrogen use efficiency. Climate change and its impact on cropping systems raise additional concerns regarding resilience of current production practices and plant adaption to those changes. Methods are needed to quantify plant-climate interaction to link field observations with simulation models for corn, soybean, wheat, and native prairie systems.

578,"Objective(s): The overall objective of the project is to improve the stability and functionality of commodity vegetable oils so they can be used as alternatives to hydrogenated oils and imported tropical fats for frying and for margarines and shortenings. To achieve this goal, we will investigate the effects of several types of phytochemicals in frying oils and will explore methods to produce healthful margarines and shortenings with low or no trans fatty acids and low saturated fats. The research will focus more specifically on the following objectives: Objective 1: Develop commercially viable methods that utilize tocopherols, phytosterols and phytosteryl ferulates to synergistically improve the oxidative stability of frying oils and fried foods; Objective 2: Develop commercially viable methods that utilize naturally-derived antioxidants and anti-polymerization compounds to improve the stability of frying oils; Objective 3: Develop commercially viable methods that utilize specialty vegetable oils to enhance the nutritional properties and oxidative stability of commodity oils; Objective 4: Develop commercially viable processing technologies to reduce or eliminate trans fatty acid content in margarines, spreads, and shortenings.Approach:   Food manufacturers, restaurants, and bakeries that need stable oils for frying and/or oils with the appropriate functionality for shortenings are looking for alternatives to hydrogenated oils because of trans fatty acids hydrogenated oils contain. However, commodity oils such as soybean, sunflower and corn that are processed without hydrogenation are not stable enough for frying oils nor do they have the proper functionality for margarines and shortenings. Even most oils with fatty acid compositions modified to increase oleic and/or to decrease linoleic or linolenic acids are still not as stable for frying as hydrogenated oils. This project proposes to improve the stability and functionality of commodity vegetable oils so they can be used as alternatives to hydrogenated oils and imported tropical fats for frying and margarines/shortenings. To help solve the problems of frying oil stability, we will: 1) Develop commercially viable methods that utilize tocopherols, phytosterols and phytosteryl ferulates to synergistically improve the oxidative stability of frying oils and fried foods; 2) Develop commercially viable methods that utilize naturally-derived antioxidants and anti-polymerization compounds to improve the stability of frying oils; and 3) Develop commercially viable methods that utilize specialty vegetable oils to enhance the nutritional properties and oxidative stability of commodity oils. To help solve functionality problems for margarines and shortenings, we will develop commercially viable processing technologies to reduce or eliminate trans fatty acid content in margarines and shortenings.

Increasing the RL yields in non-pathogenic P. chlororaphis by metabolic engineering will be attempted by increasing the copy-number and transcription level of the responsible genes (i.e., rhlAB), or by µknocking out? the gene(s) responsible for diverting precursors away from RL biosynthesis. We will also enhance the value of P. chlororaphis by introducing another gene, rhlC, to allow the biosynthesis of dirhamnose lipids. The efficiency of RL- and SL-producing microorganisms to utilize soy molasses (SM) will be improved by introducing genes encoding enzymes that breakdown the complex sugars in SM. We will also express in Candida bombicola (an SL-producing yeast) and P. chlororaphis the genes that are used for glycerol metabolism to improve the organisms? efficiency of using bioglycerol. To enhance colonization and biofilm formation for higher RL yields from P. chlororaphis, we will experiment with attaching a sponge-like adapter to the impellers of a fermenter and then use minimal aeration (slow impeller rotation, reduced air introduction, or both).

Manipulate swine dietary ingredients to improve nutrient utilization and reduce nutrient excretion and the emission of gasses into the environment. 2. Quantify and modify swine gastrointestinal microflora to improve nutrient utilization and reduce the emission of gasses into the environment. 3. Quantify the impact of swine dietary regimens on nutrient metabolism and immune function of the gastrointestinal tract and the whole animal in order to assess the potential tradeoffs between environmental concerns and production. 4. Exploit genetically-mediated mechanisms involved in Salmonella colonization of the swine gastrointestinal tract to reduce subsequent shedding into manure.Approach:   The impact of dietary ingredients on nutrient utilization in the pig and subsequent nutrient excretion and emission of gasses into the environment will be assessed through altering the source and level of dietary protein and carbohydrate. The protein level will be adjusted relative to the level of soybean meal and amino acid supplementation utilized in diet formulation, while the protein source factor will be accomplished by replacing soybean meal with either canola meal, corn gluten meal, or poultry meal. The source and level of complex carbohydrate will be accomplished by utilizing barley, beet pulp, distillers dried grains with solubles, soybean hulls, and wheat bran as a partial replacement of soybean meal. Nutrient retention, excretion, and gas emissions will be accomplished using animal metabolism trials and the employment of a manure storage system currently in place at the lab.

Analytical techniques, such as stable carbon isotope analysis, will be used to determine the influence of C4 host plants, such as field corn or pigweed, on populations of tarnished plant bug adults infesting cotton fields. This information will identify sources of tarnished plant bugs that may lead to alternative control measures prior to infestations into cotton fields. Tarnished plant bug populations will be monitored for resistance to various classes of insecticides commonly used by mid-South producers. This will provide real-time information to decision makers that will allow them to adjust their control recommendations based on the type of resistance that is found in their area of the mid-South. Detoxification enzyme activity surveys will be conducted in an effort to correlate and quantify insecticide resistance levels in field populations of the tarnished plant bug.

Processing, Performance Evaluation, and technology transition of Advanced Green Nanobiocomposites to productsThe PIs and their students will extract bacterial cellulose fibers from waste sugars obtained from defatted soy flour and calcium carbonate nanoparticles from egg shells. They then make use of them along with biopolymers to make composites. Calcium carbonate nanoparticles have many potential applications in polymer composites as fillers and property enhancers.  They are also considered as materials for biomedical applications.The current generation of composites materials utilize petroleum based polymers and man-made fibers like glass and carbon which are energy intensive to produce.  These materials have two significant disadvantages.  First, they are based on petroleum feedstock, a non-renewable resource.  Second, they are not biodegradable.  At the end of their service life, about 95% are discarded in landfills while a small fraction is incinerated or crushed into powder for use as filler.  These alternatives energy intensive and potentially environmentally hazardous. Another class of materials that end up in land-fills includes egg shells. Hence, there is an attractive potential to develop materials that are environment-friendly and biodegradable at the end of their design life. The materials so developed will provide alternative to the current generation of high performance  advanced  composites materials, which could have a positive impact on landfill use and lead to a wide range of new green technologies.The intellectual merits lie in the fact that the development of biodegradable nanofibers, nanoparticles, nanobiopolymers and their characterization, processing and characterization of advanced green composites will provide significant knowledge that can be used to develop new applications in automotive and building industries. The processes and knowledge developed through the three subprojects will help in diversifying the research portfolio into other fields like drug delivery, packaging, wound healing, and pharmaceuticals that will result in sustaining the center beyond the funding period. The materials developed will provide an environment-friendly alternative to currently used synthetic, non-biodegradable, petroleum based fiber reinforced composites.

Riethoven, collaborator, University of NebraskaMitochondria and chloroplasts serve as bioenergetic focal points of the cell, compartmenting the metabolic underpinnings of cellular function. Likewise, they act as key environmental stress sensors, and are vital to processing plant defense responses.  Yet, their integration to a systems model for the plant cell has been complicated by inability to perturb their functions with adequate specificity.  This research team has implemented an elegant approach to alter mitochondrial and chloroplast properties that focuses on manipulation of a single nuclear gene, MSH1 (MutS homolog 1).  Loss of MSH1 function produces organelle changes to condition distinct plant growth phenotypes without altering genotype of the plant.   These include dramatic changes in growth rate, flowering time, reproduction, chloroplast development, and biotic and abiotic stress responses.  it is postulated, as the central hypothesis to this research, that the msh1-associated organelle alterations cause heritable, programmed changes to the plant epigenome.  The planned investigations capitalize on recent key observations involving MSH1, and implement cross-species comparative analysis in transcript profile-based dissection of emergent phenotypes.  The project tests for msh1 effects on small RNA and DNA methylation changes, using Arabidopsis as an initial model for future tests in sorghum and soybean.  The collaboration combines expertise in organelle biology, quantitative genetics, epigenetics and next-gen sequence technologies to investigate the influence of organelle signals on the plant epigenome.  These studies address major unanswered questions in biology regarding the mode of trans-generational transmission of stress signals and the role of organelles as stress sensing components of the plant cell.Broader impacts.  Since Darwin's time, geneticists have speculated about the underlying basis of hybrid vigor and trans-generational adaptations to stress.  While more recent evidence has suggested an epigenetic nature to these phenomena, direct investigation of the process linking bioenergetic or environmental sensing with epigenetic programs in the cell has generally been intractable.  The system we investigate may prove invaluable in addressing these processes.  Consequently, this research could have important implications for the plant breeding process and for our understanding of plant defense and adaptation.

588,"Program Director's Recommendation Proposal #1127846 This project seeks to develop a class of bio-derived, biodegradable, oil dispersants which resist wetting and spreading on solid substrates such as plants and animals. The intellectual merit of this project is that more safe and effective dispersants are needed to help mitigate the impacts of oil spill disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon incident. The PIs have effectively used funds from the NSF RAPID program to identify a class of dispersants that are macromolecular aggregates of natural cellulose polymers and soy bean lecithin. A clear case is made that these compounds do not allow oil to foul bird feathers, and it is presumed that since they are natural in origin, they would be a safer alternative to the current petrochemically derived dispersants. The PIs have a strong record of expertise in this area, and are uniquely suited to this work. They clearly outline a detailed list of scientific and business-related questions that must be answered to push this product to the marketplace. The broader impact of discovering more effective and non-toxic oil dispersants is clear.

Yet grassroots social movements, such as O Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST -- the Rural Landless Workers' Movement), have also become important actors in the region, pressuring the government for more progressive distribution of land ownership and establishing land reform settlements. These settlements represent a growing countertrend that can potentially inform widespread development of food systems that are ecologically sustainable and socially just. Though the MST's national leadership promotes production based on the science of agroecology, adoption of these practices on MST farms is complex and variable. This project is a comparative analysis of several land reform settlements in Mato Grosso combining data from a farmer survey, qualitative interviews, on-farm sampling of plants and soils, and secondary data analysis. The primary objectives are to understand: Within and among MST settlements in Mato Grosso, who is farming using agroecological practices and why? How do agroecological practices emerge on MST settlement farms and how are they sustained? And, what effects do these farming systems have on ecological efficiency? Efficiency is being assessed using standard metrics from ecosystem ecology including productivity per unit area, energy inputs, and nutrient mass balances for nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. This research will increase knowledge of the potential for the alternative farming systems of agrarian reform settlements to produce food sustainably in the ecologically-threatened Cerrado. This work is advancing interdisciplinary approaches to the study of land use and sustainability and addresses the important question: Under what conditions can these alternative systems be replicated or scaled-up? Finally, through this project, the PI is building institutional ties between the Federal University of Mato Grosso and Cornell University to establish a foundation for future research collaborations.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
590,"Nucleic acids, proteins and phytohormones have routinely been assigned key regulatory roles in plant signal transduction pathways. Our studies demonstrate a unique and previously undefined role for fatty acids (FA) as signaling molecules. We have shown that the monounsaturated FA, oleic acid (18:1), mediates defense signaling in Arabidopsis and soybean. Specifically, a reduction in the levels of 18:1 induces the expression of a variety of resistance (R) genes in plants. In turn, this global induction of R genes confers broad-spectrum disease resistance against multiple pathogens. This project aims to elucidate the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying the 18:1-derived regulation of R gene expression and defense activation in plants. This will be achieved by characterizing proteins that directly bind 18:1. The project would not only help elucidate this novel 18:1-mediated pathway, but will likely provide useful insights into networking between R gene and low 18:1-mediated signaling. Results obtained here could be applied to signaling networks in many other systems, since the underlying biochemical activities are conserved amongst a variety of plant species and 18:1 is an essential monounsaturated fatty acid in plants and animals alike.  Intellectual Merit. Characterization of the 18:1-regulated pathway will help elucidate novel, hitherto uninvestigated mechanisms of plant defense. This work will provide critical information about the regulatory role of fatty acids in addition to their traditional role as energy reservoirs. It could also redefine our current understanding of known defense signaling pathways as well as provide important insights into the complex networking between metabolic and defense signaling. Research findings from Arabidopsis will be applicable to less genetically tractable crop plants, and may help us to develop alternative disease controls that are less costly and less harmful to the environment and human health. Broader Impacts. Critical insights into the complex networking between metabolic and defense pathways in plants are key to developing novel disease protection strategies. The information obtained here could potentially be applied for engineering broad-spectrum disease resistance in economically important crop plants. Therefore, knowledge obtained from this study will eventually increase crop productivity. Furthermore, 18:1 is also known to affect several vital physiological processes in mammalian systems. For example, 18:1 affects the contractile activity of heart and vascular smooth muscle cells, is the cause of pulmonary edema induced in adult respiratory stress syndrome, and is well known for its cancer protective abilities. Thus, understanding 18:1-derived signaling in plants is likely to provide insights into disease processes in humans as well. This research will incorporate training of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students, and enhance the research infrastructure through sharing of ideas and materials. The investigators aim to foster a community of undergraduate students, particularly those from traditionally underrepresented groups, by including them as members of their scientific team. They also plan to integrate their research with the extension services available at the University of Kentucky to enhance awareness of the recent advances in crop resistance among farmers and agribusiness representatives.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
591,"Kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata) is a noxious, invasive weed in the U.S. that presents a significant threat to native biodiversity. Since its introduction ~130 years ago, this legume has literally engulfed thousands of square miles and cost millions of dollars in eradication measures. Considering its economic and ecological impact, it is surprisingly understudied. This project will integrate the efforts of citizen scientists, graduate and undergraduate students, and collaborating scientists from four Asian countries to examine the evolutionary history, taxonomy, and genetic diversity of the genus Pueraria in an effort to understand invasiveness in the kudzu species complex and determine how Pueraria species relate to other legumes, including several of economic importance such as soybean (Glycine max) and jicama (Pachyrhizus erosus). Extensive fieldwork will be integrated with genetic and geographic analyses to determine how many introductions of kudzu have taken place in the U.S., from what genetic source(s), and how genetic diversity and interplay within and among Pueraria species and populations have influenced range expansion.  This work will integrate education and research to provide educational opportunities for K-12, post-secondary students and the public through programs connected with Earth Day Activities, A Time for Science Nature Center, citizen science, and an innovative ecotourism venture within Great Smoky Mountain National Park.

592,"This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project from Iowa State University (ISU) is based on the overarching goal of developing an effective and adaptable system for disease control in farmed shrimp.  The project emphasizes two emerging technologies RNA interference--(RNAi) and nano-structured materials--to function in concert as an antiviral effector molecule and delivery system, respectively.  Infectious diseases caused by viral pathogens account for substantial mortality in farmed Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and result in devastating financial losses.  The aim of this project is to rapidly develop highly specific RNAi-based antiviral molecules to protect individual shrimp from emerging viral infections.  These antiviral molecules will be combined with a nanoparticle substrate so that the antiviral can be delivered orally to individual shrimp during the rearing process.   The goals and predicted outcomes of this project will result in a platform system that can be rapidly adapted to respond to ever-evolving and emerging infectious disease issues in shrimp farming.  Therefore, the project has strong potential for sustained innovation and to transform disease control for this industry. The broader impacts of this project, beyond those for the partners, are economic benefits to the U.S., including the following:  1) Stable or even lower consumer prices for a high protein seafood product supplied from an industry that would dramatically increase its supply, if vaccines were available; 2) benefit to U.S. companies that export wheat and soybeans-- the two main ingredients in shrimp feeds--along with U.S. feed companies that export high tech microencapsultated larval feeds to shrimp hatcheries worldwide; 2) producers of breeding stocks of shrimp, 3) sustainable and predictable harvests for domestic shrimp producers, and 4) positioning the U.S. as the leader in the aquaculture biotechnologies needed for shrimp/fish farmers to supply future increases in demand for seafood that the capture fisheries cannot meet. Broader impacts will also be witnessed through training junior scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels in a manner that will advance their capacity to practice science in an environment of entrepreneurialism--balancing bench work and scientific advancement with the demands and timelines of business.  Trainees will benefit from academics and professional development mentoring at the lead institution and from regular interactions and time with the employees and leadership at the associated knowledge-enhancement partner companies.

593,"The focus of this project is on Nodulin-like Instrinsic Proteins (NIPs) involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes.  This process represents a major pathway for conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into reduced ammonia, which is a biologically usable form of nitrogen.  The symbiosis is established by the infection of legume roots by rhizobia soil bacteria, resulting in the formation of the nitrogen-fixing organ, the root nodule.  Rhizobia bacteria are enclosed within a specialized plant organellar compartment, the symbiosome.  The symbiosome membrane mediates the exchange of metabolites between the bacterial symbiont and plant host, and is critical for a successful symbiosis.  NIPs belong to an ancient family of channel proteins that mediate the flow of water and metabolites across cellular membranes.  Nodulin 26 (Nod26) is a NIP that constitutes the major protein component of the symbiosome membrane and has two important roles in nitrogen-fixing symbioses.  First, as a rapid transporter of ammonia, Nod26 is proposed to facilitate the release of this fixation end product from the symbiosome.  Further, Nod26 forms interaction complexes with glutamine synthetase which is a critical nitrogen assimilation enzyme.  This interaction is postulated to prevent accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia gas by allowing its rapid incorporation into the nontoxic amino acid glutamine.   In a secondary role, Nod26 facilitates the bulk movement of water across the symbiosome membrane and is proposed to be part of an osmoregulatory network that controls the diffusion of oxygen gas within nodule tissues.  This provides a finely tuned regulation of nitrogen fixation rates in response to metabolic need and environmental stresses.  The aim of this project is to investigate the multifunctional symbiotic role of Nod26 in soybean and a model legume, Medicago truncatula.    The specific objectives are: 1. To define the structural basis for water vs. ammonia transport of Nod26 and its interaction with glutamine synthetase; 2. Investigate mechanisms that regulate Nod26 selectivity for water and ammonia, and its overall transport behavior in response to environmental cues (e.g., soil drought and water logging) that affect nodule gas diffusion and fixation rates; and 3. Address the impact of Nod26 on the establishment and maintenance of the rhizobia-legume symbiosis by using the molecular genetics tools available in Medicago.  This project should contribute fundamental insights into the molecular basis of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume/rhizobia associations as well as its regulation.   In addition, since Nod 26 is the structural archetype of the NIP transporter family, the project will shed light on the molecular basis for differences in transport selectivity and biological functions of NIPs in other plant membrane systems.    Broader significance and importance This project will serve as a training vehicle for multiple graduate students and undergraduate student research scholars, as well as a postdoctoral associate, in fundamental aspects of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.  In addition, this project will provide support and promote the following STEM initiatives at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK):  1. The P.I's involvement as scientific director of the Tennessee Junior Science and Humanities Symposium (TJSHS), which is a state-wide program designed to foster basic science research by high school students.   The TJSHS is held annually and involves a three day symposium during which the very best high school students from throughout the state of Tennessee are convened and are given an opportunity to present their research.  2.

594,"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the use of  green  composite building materials as a replacement for conventional plastics and wood products. These green composites have the advantage of superior strength-to-weight ratios over pressed wood products while eliminating use of the carcinogen formaldehyde.  They also offer comparable strength-to-weight ratios to petroleum-based advanced composites while having the advantages of being generated from sustainable resources and being biodegradable. However, one of the significant challenges with composites that use protein-based resins is poor moisture resistance. This project will investigate the use of accelerants to produce highly cross-linked soy-protein resins.  The Phase I program will result in the development and characterization of several formulations of the composite material resin in combination with fibers.  The resulting green composites will be characterized after varying levels of exposure to moisture to determine their suitability for a variety of commercial applications.  The Phase I research will enable the production of samples for potential customers and partners based on their application specifications.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will involve a shift of many consumer products away from non-renewable, petroleum-based products to materials produced from annually-renewable agricultural materials, providing a cost-effective solution with higher performance.  These composites have the potential to replace formaldehyde-containing pressed wood products and petroleum-based advanced composites in building applications such as residential cabinetry and office furniture. They also have the potential to be used in the automotive industry for auto trimming. These materials do not use hazardous chemicals and have greater strength-to-weight ratios than pressed wood products (even without the use of nano-clay and microfibrillated cellulose additives), enabling weight savings.  This reduction in materials results in a cost savings while having the advantages of being biodegradable and generated from sustainable resources.  Further, existing pressed-wood manufacturing and assembly facilities can be readily converted to the manufacture and use of these composite systems without major retooling, enabling companies to shift to eco-friendly products without job losses or worker displacement.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

599,"The overall goal of this work is to identify molecular mechanisms that determine whether a given bacterial strain will be harmful or beneficial to the organism in which it lives. Rhizobia are soil bacteria that are known to greatly benefit plants in the legume family by providing them with nitrogen-rich nutrients. Rhizobia are of great agricultural importance, since they dramatically reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers on legume crops such as soybean and alfalfa. This project investgates naturally occurring strains of rhizobia that behave like pathogens on some legume species, and like beneficial symbionts on others. This variation in outcome is dictated by a limited set of genes that have been detected but not fully sequenced. These genes define an important but mysterious biological process that determines whether rhizobia will harm or help the plants that harbor them. The investigators are using molecular-level analysis to define the precise biochemical process that is governed by these genes. The research goals are integrated with an educational plan that will allow undergraduate and high school students to participate in the discovery of more of these outcome-determining genes, through a combination of outdoor collection activities and laboratory-based molecular analysis of bacterial isolates. The project will support the training of high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students and will inform directly the development of more effective strategies for using rhizobia to enhance crop productivity.

611,"Limiting damage from insects to agriculture has been a long-term challenge. Advances in genetics and in understanding plant response to insects is starting to make it possible to breed and develop plants which protect themselves from insects. Such host plant resistance is an alternative to the traditional use of insecticides. We have identified a candidate gene which makes soybean resistant to a wide variety of chewing insects, and increases the effectiveness of other genes, such as Bt, meaning it could contribute towards effective and sustainable insect resistance in soybean and perhaps other crops. The first goal is to verify that our candidate gene is in fact the gene for insect resistance. Once the gene is confirmed, its function will point out the biochemical pathway responsible for resistance; thus the second objective is to dermine which secondary metabolites are involved in resistance. We present two complementary strategies: First we will confirm the gene underlying resistance by engineering it into susceptible soybean and looking for a change in insect resistance; Secondly, we will do metabolic-profiling of resistant plants to determine what differentiates them from susceptible plants, and possibly identify novel metabolites associated with resistance. Deployment of insect-resistant crops is an example of how resistance to pests benefits producers, consumers, and the environment by reducing insecticide applications and production costs. However, the shift towards insect management through the crops' inherent defenses first requires understanding the mechanisms by which plants achieve resistance, including the nature of insect-resistance genes.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
612,"Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is a nutritious legume grown in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate climates. It is the 4th most important oilseed crop in the world, ranked by production, exceeded only by soybean, rapeseed, and cottonseed. The US accounts for approximately 6% of world production and is a major exporter. Peanut has the unusual reproductive habit of above ground flowering and below ground fruiting. Its subterranean reproductive strategy poses additional plant health problems not encountered by most seed crops. Of particular concern is invasion of underground pods by fungi that can produce highly carcinogenic aflatoxin. Aflatoxin biosynthesis is induced when the host tissues attain a permissive physiological state under drought stress and elevated temperatures, conditions almost certain to be increasingly encountered in this era of climate change. We hypothesize that molecular indicators of host plant stress response are correlated with induction of aflatoxin biosynthesis and that genotypic variation for aflatoxin contamination is associated with variation in stress response. The objectives of this study are to use physiological and gene expression tools to determine the pre-harvest stress threshold at which aflatoxin biosynthesis is induced in developing peanut seeds and to map quantitative trait loci for indicators of this stress response. Advancing phenotyping protocols and associating phenotypes with nucleotide sequences will have an immediate impact on conventional breeding for preharvest aflatoxin contamination resistance that will eventually translate to improved farm efficiency, sustainability, profitability, and food quality.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
613,"Cyst nematodes are among the most damaging nematode pathogens of crops worldwide, and the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, continues to cause the most severe (~ $1 billion/year) yield losses among all soybean pathogens in the U.S. Cyst nematodes invade host plant roots and orchestrate dramatic changes in localized plant cell gene expression that give rise to elaborate feeding cells that are of unique phenotype and essential for nematode growth and reproduction. Parasite secretions, called effectors, are the primary tools in processes like penetration and migration within host tissues, suppression of host defenses, and host manipulations to promote parasitic success of the pathogen. Our research team has discovered greater than fifty different SCN effectors encoded by parasitism genes with roles in host plant cell defense and stress suppression, cell wall modifications, hormone transport, regulation of nuclear activities, and peptide signaling. While much of the previous work was conducted in model plants, it is now time to move to the crop plant soybean. Therefore, the goal of this project is to use our available resources and technologies to identify the soybean proteins that interact with known SCN effectors to derive a fundamental understanding of overlapping molecular pathways in susceptible and resistant interactions between SCN and its soybean host. Functional analyses of effectors and their interacting plant proteins will expose critical elements in the interaction that are vulnerable to disruption to reduce nematode parasitism of plants and will reveal effective resistance mechanisms that can protect soybean plants. This proposed project is critical to our long-term goal of identifying vulnerable points in the parasitic process to devise novel control strategies against cyst nematodes. Primary project objectives are: 1. Comprehensive identification of soybean proteins that interact with SCN effectors. 2. Functional analyses of effector and interacting plant proteins and signaling networks. 3. Identification of effector variants among inbred SCN populations differing in virulence. Successful completion of the proposed work will result in the discovery of new targets or mechanisms for disruption of SCN parasitism, which is needed for the development of novel resistance mechanisms in soybean. Ultimately, the generation of broad, durable resistance in soybean should significantly reduce the estimated $1 billion in annual soybean yield losses due to SCN.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

615,"Non-Technical Summary At present, organic chemicals are almost entirely derived from building blocks that are obtained from natural gas, petroleum, and coal. Approximately 13 percent of the crude oil used in the United States currently goes into the production of nonfuel chemicals. Since fossil resources are limited, there is an ongoing need to develop useful chemicals from renewable resources. Renewable resources that have been used to produce chemicals include plant oils, polysaccharides, sugars, and wood. Of these, plant oils are the most important renewable raw materials for the chemical industry. Chemicals derived from plant oils have been used to produce surfactants, components for cosmetics, lubricants, polymers, coatings, and flooring materials. A primary drawback associated with the use of plant oil-based materials for many coating applications is their significantly lower thermomechanical properties compared to petrochemical-based materials. The proposal team recently developed a break-through technology involving the synthesis of novel plant oil-based vinyl ether monomers and the subsequent controlled polymerization of the monomers to produce high molecular weight polymers. Using soybean oil (SBO) as the plant oil, it was demonstrated that replacement SBO or SBO derivatives with the novel, high molecular weight polymer derived from SBO dramatically decreased cure time and increased thermomechanical properties of a variety of coating systems. A powerful synthetic tool used extensively in essentially all industries that utilize polymeric building blocks is copolymerization. A major attribute associated with the polymer technology developed by the proposal team is that copolymerization can be used to tailor properties to a specific application. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed project is to utilize copolymerization to tailor properties with primary emphasis being the enhancement of mechanical and thermomechanical properties to enable the replacement of a much larger fraction of petrochemical-based polymers and oligomers than can be accomplished with current plant oil-based technology. To facilitate transition of the technology to industry, five major coating manufacturers have reviewed the proposal team's background technology and indicated their willingness to provide consultation and potentially evaluate promising copolymers resulting from the project. A Life Cycle Analysis will be conducted to demonstrate the environmental advantages of the most promising copolymer composition over a commercially available petrochemical analog.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
616,"Nanomaterials are used in electronics, chemicals, transportation, health-care, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food processing, and agriculture. They can enter agricultural soils directly as additives in pesticide and fertilizer formulations, or indirectly as contaminants in recycled water and municipal solid wastes applied to crop lands. Due to their small size and characteristic properties, a number of nanomaterials are toxic to soil organisms and may be taken up by certain crop plants. The potential risks posed to consumers , farmers, food crops, and the environment require a deep understanding of their chemical, physical, and biological fate in soil. The mobility and biological accessibility of nanoparticles in soil depends critically on how, and how strongly, they bind to each other and to soil particles; yet, almost nothing is known about such behaviors.  Black carbon  is an important component of soil as a result of the input of charcoal from natural and deliberate fires and from the growing practice of adding charred biomass waste (biochar) to improve soil fertility. The goals of this project are to obtain a comprehensive understanding of how and to what degree nanoparticles bind to black carbon, and to determine the effects of black carbon addition on the bioavailability of nanomaterials by representative crop plants (corn, soybean, lettuce, tomato) and animals (earthworms). We chose four nanomaterials relevant to agro-ecosystems: nanosilver, nanoceria, fullerenes and carbon nanotubes.

617,"Listeria monocytogenes is a major cause of severe foodborne illness and death in the United States. Even though several high-profile outbreaks of listeriosis have involved deli meats and soft cheeses, current epidemiological trends suggest that Listeria -contaminated produce is associated with significantly higher disease burden than previously recognized. A multistate outbreak in 2008-09 was attributed to soybean sprouts, and in 2010 an outbreak with high mortality was due to chopped celery. This past summer and fall one of the largest known outbreaks of listeriosis (133 cases, 28 deaths) involved contaminated cantaloupe. Listeria is also responsible for numerous recalls. However, in spite of the evident public health and economic burden of Listeria-contaminated produce, only rudimentary knowledge is available on mechanisms and attributes mediating Listeria's ability to adhere to and colonize produce. Under Objective 1, produce dip inoculation will be employed to assess produce adherence and colonization ability of a carefully chosen panel of strains. Strains with high adherence and colonization potential will be chosen to identify and characterize genes required for adherence and colonization, in Objective 2. In Objective 3 we will employ molecular, bacteriological and microscopy tools to characterize biofilm formation on stainless steel and on produce surfaces, taking into account the presence of produce-associated microbiota. This component of the study is especially relevant for Listeria, a bacterium which is notorious for its ability to persistently colonize the food processing plant environment. Such environmental contamination has indeed been implicated in the recent cantaloupe outbreak of listeriosis as well as in the previous celery-associated outbreak. The study will provide baseline data critical for novel targeted strategies to reduce food safety threats associated with Listeria-contaminated produce, including threats associated with persistent colonization of produce-processing facilities and with bacterial adherence and growth on the produce itself.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
618,"Tile-drained corn and soybean fields in the upper Midwest are the major source of nitrate delivered by the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico each winter and spring. This is a major factor in causing the hypoxic zone that forms each summer in the Gulf. The flat, productive soils of the upper Midwest produce high yields of crops, but the tile-drainage needed to make agricultural production practices feasible and timely on these fields often leak large amounts of nitrate. Therefore, the long-term goal of our project is to develop techniques that could lead to large watershed scale reductions in nitrate export. Our project will focus on the effectiveness of constructed wetlands and woodchip bioreactors, both of which are placed at the end of tile lines before they enter a ditch or stream. This work will be conducted in the Embarras watershed in east-central Illinois, where we have been sampling water quality since 1993. We will work cooperatively with a range of interested stakeholders on this watershed. New constructed wetlands and bioreactors will be installed with monitoring equipment on cooperators fields, and we will use some wetlands built in 1994 to assess long-term performance. We will determine how well these end-of-pipe techniques work in reducing nitrate export, as well as determining whether they contribute greenhouse gases during nitrate removal. We will implement a full range of extension activities including fact sheets that highlight research results and document the water quality benefits of the project and field days to demonstrate results to producers, landowners, and the general public. Interviews and surveys will assess stakeholder interests and motivations before and after extension programming. At the end of our study we will have a thorough understanding of how well wetlands and bioreactors work to reduce nitrate loss from fields and their greenhouse gas impact, as well as knowledge of stakeholder acceptance and barriers, effective extension programs, and evaluations of our work. This will help to design programs to reduce nitrate loss across the tile-drained Midwest.

620,"Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for food production. Nitrogen moves in the environment where it can be lost to the air as a gas and to water by moving through the soil or over the soil surface. Because of this, it is difficult for crops to use all the nitrogen that was applied. This loss is primarily the result of the timing between the supply of nitrogen and crop demand for that nitrogen. Of particular environmental concern are the emissions of nitrous oxide--a greenhouse gas from agricultural soils that can contribute to global warming and ozone destruction. Lost nitrogen also represents a significant economic loss to farmers. Any practice that improves the timing between soil nitrogen release and crop growth will decrease nitrogen loss, protect the environment and improve farm profits. Cover crops are grown when cash crops such as corn and soybeans are not growing. Cover crops can be a useful management tool for reducing negative environmental impacts. The timing of nitrogen use can be improved by cover crops. Cover crops also benefit farming by recycling nutrients, reducing erosion, improving soil, supporting soil organisms, and suppressing weeds and insects. Cover crops are important to organic farming and the transition of land from conventional to organic farming. Conventional farmers are also showing increased interest in cover crops. We propose a study to investigate the effects of various cover crops on nitrous oxide emissions, nitrogen availability and carbon accumulation in major Midwest farming systems under organic and conventional management. Four cover crops will be studied: annual ryegrass, red clover, oilseed radish and a commercially available cover crop mix. Our goals are to determine the potential of cover crops as a farm management option for improving nitrogen timing with cash crops, evaluate the impact of cover crops on nitrous oxide emissions, and improve farmer knowledge of cover crop benefits to nitrogen use and farm economics.

622,"Currently, the world population is approaching 7 billion and it is expected to reach 9 billion by the year 2040. There is an urgent need to increase the availability of food to prevent the escalation of hunger and protein/calorie malnutrition in the world. One of the immediate strategies might be development of processing technologies to better utilize proteins derived from soybean and other oilseeds in human foods. The current soybean production in the world is about 258 million metric tons (MMT), of which about 92 MMT is produced in the United States. Soybean is cultivated mainly as a source of edible cooking oil. The soy meal, which contains about 50% protein on dry matter basis, is mostly used as cattle feed to produce meat (animal protein). This biological conversion requires about 8-10 kg of plant protein to produce 1 kg of animal protein. As the population increase races towards 10 billion in the next three decades, this low conversion efficiency will not be sustainable and it will force the world population to adopt a new plant protein-based food system. If soy protein can be directly used in the human diet, the protein availability to feed the growing population would be more than adequate for several decades. A major factor that severely limits consumption of soy protein products by almost 2/3 of human population in the world is its objectionable off-flavor. Sensory perception plays a dominant role in food acceptance and human food habits. It is often said that even a hungry person would not eat a food that is sensorially offensive. If a novel process that can remove the offensive off-flavor of soy protein products is successfully developed, it would make it possible to use this highly nutritive and cardiovascular health-promoting protein in numerous human diets. The proposed project addresses this potential. The project will use a combination of ultrasound technology, enzyme technology, and molecular-inclusion technology to remove off-flavors and their precursors from soy protein. This novel approach is not employed in any existing protein processing technologies. We expect that the soy protein product resulting from this process may have some unique/improved functionality.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
623,"The national demand for energy and need for economic development has been driving efforts to create a domestic biofuels industry. Significant investment by both the public and private sectors have resulted in progress but recent government rule making has set ambitious requirements for renewable fuel supplies that can not be met with existing technologies or feedstocks. This significant unmet market for biofuels created by Federal regulation is the business opportunity identified by ATI to be met by producing Field Pennycress as a non-food energy crop. Pennycress has seeds with 36% oil and is grown as a winter annual on unused land following the corn harvest and prior to the spring planting of soybeans. This means that farmers can continue to grow corn and soybeans in the traditional way but add our new crop in the winter allowing them to earn additional income. Approximately 40 million acres of land are available each year for Pennycress under this strategy with no impact to the food supply or critical wildlife habitats. When fully deployed, Pennycress could supply eight billion gallons of biofuels and generate $4 billion in new farm income. In addition, approximately 23,000 new non-farm jobs could be created in rural communities enhancing local economic development. Our Phase I research has confirmed that Pennycress can be grown commercially as an energy crop and the logistics of harvest, transportation and storage were proven. Our SBIR Phase II project is designed to enhance Pennycress profitability through higher yields, gain acceptance from the farmers while reducing risk and uncertainty so that the crop is adopted and production acres can grow. In addition, a complete Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) for Pennycress biofuel production will be undertaken. ATI and its research partners will conduct agronomic research to address planting strategies, fertilizer regimes to enhance yields and evaluate new genetic lines of Pennycress. We will assess the impact of growing Pennycress on soil nutrition as well as its impact on the following soybean crop. ATI will gather data necessary to support the LCA of Pennycress required for EPA and USDA rule making on advanced biofuels and conclusion of this project will allow ATI to deploy a Pennycress supply chain from the farm to the pump as an innovative bioenergy business. The ATI commercialization plan is to contract with farmers to produce Pennycress from seed provided by us, take delivery of the crop and then process the seed by crushing and sell the resulting oil and remaining high-energy presscake. Our five-year goal is to have 100,000 acres under cultivation. ATI expects to grow geographically to more than one million acres as the crop proves itself to farmers.

624,"Soybean is the major source for production of edible oils worldwide and in United States. Pressing of the soybean into flakes followed by the solvent extraction with hexane (solvent) is most widely practiced for extraction of oil. Separation of solvent from oil-solvent mixture for solvent recovery and reuse is usually carried out by solvent evaporation. Evaporation (or distillation) demands considerable amount of energy and associated costs since it involves an energy and capital intensive phase change of the solvent. Solvent used for oil extraction (i.e. hexane) from oil seeds is highly volatile, flammable, and is also explosive; therefore, solvent recovery by distillation is also a physical hazard. Hexane is also categorized by the EPA as hazardous air pollutant and the inevitable loss of hexane vapors into the environment during the solvent recovery by distillation is a severe environmental issue. Based on our experience with chemically resistant membranes, Compact Membrane Systems (CMS) has proposed and demonstrated the feasibility of superior membrane filtration technology for separation of solvent from vegetable oil-solvent mixture. Benefits of developing this superior membrane filtration technology are associated with (i) energy and capital savings by replacing the conventional technologies such as evaporation, (ii) increased process safety, and (iii) reduced solvent emissions into the environment from vegetable oil processing plants. The proposed membrane filtration technology will have a significant impact in many of the industrial processes using distillation/evaporation. For example, solvent recovery by the superior membrane filtration technology will be of great value in processing other oil seeds such as corn, cotton seed and canola. Other applications of the proposed membrane filtration technology include solvent recovery from algae oil extraction process in biofuel production and solvent recovery from solvent-deasphalting process in petroleum refining.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

More than 440,000 jobs in the US are directly associated with the cotton industry, generating revenues in excess of $120 billion. Crop losses caused by stink bug damage in cotton have been estimated at $60 million in  bad  years. Stink bugs infested 6.5 million acres of cotton in 2006 and destroyed 151,347 bales across the United States. Damage was particularly severe in the southeastern US, with losses of 51,607 bales, 25,000 bales, and 20,488 bales in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, respectively. Due to insecticide resistance issues and limited information on basic stink bug biology, growers currently have few treatment options except blanketing entire fields with insecticides. It is imperative that pest managers develop a better understanding of stink bug biology and develop alternative management strategies to mitigate these pests. Here, we plan to conduct research that seeks to improve our understanding of basic stink bug biology and ecology, while evaluating a novel insecticide application strategy that could reduce insecticide applications by nearly fifty percent. Specifically, we plan to investigate weekly changes in stink bug population density and reproductive status within a farmscape, and determine whether stink bug populations and damage in cotton can be managed by spraying alternating strips, as opposed to the entire field. All proposed objectives will be completed by the end of the project.

Volunteer corn can increase the level of western and northern corn rootworm egg-laying in soybean fields, significantly increasing the rootworm injury to the planted corn in the following year, thus eliminating one of the major benefits of a corn-soybean rotation. Finally, volunteer corn may act to reduce the beneficial effects of crop rotation, one of the most effective ways to manage residue borne foliar disease of corn.

Perennial crops are less dependent than annual crops on energy-intensive inputs, such as nitrogen fertilizer and herbicides, and more resilient to climate stress, such as drought and flooding. The results of this research will have significant implications for evaluating carbon cycling in the production of bioenergy feedstocks as well as the potential for bioenergy cropping systems to be part of the country's agricultural strategies to adapt to climate change and to mitigate the effects of climate change in vulnerable parts of agricultural ecosystems. The feedstock production systems compared in a replicated field study include: continuous corn grown for grain and stover (with and without a winter cover crop), a multi-species mixture of perennial prairie plants (with and without fertilizer addition), and a conventional corn-soybean cash grain rotation for baseline comparison. Our working hypotheses are that (1) mixtures of perennial species used for biofuel feedstocks may result in greater net carbon storage and lower export of excess nutrients than corn-based feedstock production systems, and (2) cover crops such as rye will reduce net carbon and nutrient losses from corn production systems. The theme of the proposed research is to explore interactions among (1) land management for agricultural production; and (2) greenhouse gas fluxes and net carbon sequestration (or loss) as a result of land use decisions. Our end-to-end study will monitor fundamental chemical, biological, and physical processes in soil and then use those observations to support end-user decision tools. By studying a range of possible biofuel production systems, we will offer new insights and alternatives concerning the tradeoffs in optimizing bioenergy production with GHG emissions and ecosystem services.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

634,"Objective(s): The overall aim of this research project is to evaluate the quality and safety of transgenic soybeans using proteomics technologies.  We will determine whether the expression of transgenes in soybeans results in an unusual accumulation of non-target proteins in the seed.  The data from these studies would be useful to measure and compare the deviation of protein variation within transgenic soybeans.  To achieve this goal, we propose the following two key objectives: Objective 1.  Measure the natural variation of seed proteins in a wide range of soybean germplasm using proteomics and establish a baseline for subsequent estimation of collateral effects that may be associated with transgenes. Objective 2.  Determine the potential collateral effects in protein expression resulting from tissue culture, transformation protocols, and transgenic events in soybean.Approach:The experimental approach is to compare and characterize protein variation of a group of twenty-seven soybean genotypes that will include wild, Glycine soja and cultivated Glycine max germplasm accessions.  Also, variation in seed protein levels in four different seed samples from plants derived via tissue culture and non-tissue culture methods will be compared.

Hypothesis: There are detectable gene and protein differences between uninfected and pathogen-infected plants and between susceptible and resistant plants, and there are pathogen virulence factors critical to pathogen infection, development and survival.Objective 2: Determine modes of action for plant disease resistance genes,pathogen virulence factors and molecular signals responsible for host-parasite interactions through analysis and characterization of genetic, molecular, protein and metabolite networks. Hypothesis: Examination of the many genes involved in plant-pathogen interactions will reveal critical molecular networks with specific modes of action that are essential to resistance in soybean and to virulence in soybean pathogens. These networks may share commonalities to networks in other plants and pathogens.Objective 3: Engineer and evaluate new methods for obtaining resistance, such as gene silencing, over-expression and protein antagonism, and chemical inhibition of host and pathogen processes, with special emphasis on soybean rust and the soybean cyst nematode. Hypothesis: Expression of gene silencing constructs or of proteins inhibitory to important aspects of pathogen infection, development or maintenance can result in increased tolerance or resistance to a particular pest or pathogen.Approach:We have soybean genotypes resistant to one or more rust isolates, but susceptible to all others. These soybean genotypes will be challenged with specific pathogen isolates to study the resistance and susceptible response. Gene and protein expression in both plants and pathogens will be monitored using microarrays, membrane arrays, expressed sequence tag analysis, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR. Proteins will be detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS). Cell fractionation, laser capture microdissection, and subtractive hybridization will be used to isolate specific tissues, organelles, or materials involved in disease processes or responses. Other methods such as antibody localization, gene silencing, plant hairy root transformation (for SCN studies) and mutant analysis will be used to determine the function of genes and proteins and toevaluate their importance in resistance and susceptibility.The disease and pest resistance responses to infection in soybeans will beelucidated systematically using microarrays, proteomics and metabolomics to resolve the biological network evoked. A comparison of differential gene expression and protein accumulation in the resistant and susceptible response of soybean to pathogens will identify components of the network. These networks will be built, examined, and perturbed to confirm function of components using an array of tools, including bioinformatics, yeast two-hybrid screens, mutation analysis, immunolocalization,immuno-precipitation, affinity purification, protein tagging, geneover-expression, phage library display, and other methods that will resolve proteinprotein interactions and interactions among molecules. Based on these data, we can identify candidate members of pathways and networks involved in signaling and evoking the resistance response. Other plant systems, including common bean and Medicago truncatula, will be used as needed in parallel investigations studying host-pathogen responses and interactions to take advantage of the knowledge and specific traits of the resistance response in these systems.Approaches for achieving pathogen control include engineering transgenic plant tissue and organs to express genes that boost the natural defense system of the plant or to provide the plant with a new trait that confers resistance by blocking pathogen attack or survival.  Genes shown to have important roles in plant defense may be over-expressed in transgenic plants.  Likewise genes that are critical to survival of the SCN in the host or that make the plant susceptible to SCN may be silenced in transgenic roots using hairy root transformation techniques.  Additionally, genes that express antibodies or protein antagonists will be engineered into soybean to block the survival and development of the pest or pathogen.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Identify effects on key performance determinants of crop seed quality resulting from modified seed composition using traditional or non-traditional genetic methods.Approach:To reach the overridging objective of the modification of soybean seed composition for food, feed, and industrial uses requires a team approach that spans the complete range from basic biochemical assessment of possible target sites to the evaluation of the agronomic properties and value of modified soybeans.  Basic biochemical approaches will be used to assess the effect of manipulating the expression of a key enzyme complex that is at the interface of carbon partitioning into oil or carbohydrates. A proteomic approach to the analysis of soybean seed development will allow for the discovery of other key regulatory events that offer possibilities for manipulation. Transgenic approaches will be used to modify the protein content and constitution of the soybean seed such that the nutritional quality as feed can be improved. A similar approach combined with classical molecular genetic approaches to plant breeding will be directed at altering the fatty acid components and anti-nutritional compounds of soybean seed to improve not only the nutritive value of the seed but also the health aspects of soybean consumption.

641,"Objective(s): Develop environmentally friendly methods to manage subtropical pests found in south Texas cropping systems. All projects are under the umbrella of the Texas Boll Weevil Eradication program. With the reduction of the boll weevil in commerical cotton fields, the role of volunteer cotton in non-roduction areas needs to be thoroughly determined. In addition, the continued use of the insecticide Malathion to control the boll weevil needs to be monitored to ensure adequate control of this pest. Furthermore, newer crops are being adopted rapidly in south Texas, and the assoicated pests and natural enemies have yet to be fully characterized. Specifically, over the next 5 years we will focus on the following objectives: 1) Determine the range of susceptibility/tolerance of the boll weevil to Malathion in south Texas and northern Mexico.2) Determine the role of volunteer cotton and alternative feeding hosts on the ecology of the boll weevil.3) Investigate the reproductive biology, sampling schemes, and economic injury levels for Creotiades signatus in cotton and non-cotton landscapes.4) Develop an IPM program for subtropical fall and spring soybeans and conventional corn, as well as Bt cotton and Bt corn.4A) Evaluate the influence of soybean planting date and insecticide seed treatments on thrips, whiteflies, and stink bug populations.4B) Identify, collect, culture, and evaluate candidate natural enemies for efficacy against key pests of soybean in south Texas.4C) Determine the role of non-prey resources for cursorial spiders that are important predators of crop pests in annual crops such as soybean, corn, and cotton, and evaluate the potential of yeast-based nutrient sprays to augment populations of these predators in these crops.4D) Evaluate transgenic Bt corn and cotton for management of Lepidopteran pests in a subtropical climate.Approach:Because we have established the baseline susceptibility of the boll weevil to Malathion we will determine if certain metabolic and/or physiological mechanisms for detoxifying this class of insecticide are correlated with the observed variability of survival. This also will reveal how detoxification works with adult boll weevils and organophosphate insecticides. Collections will be made from infested cotton squares from volunteer and commercial cotton fields. The resulting cohort of immature boll weevils will then be reared to adulthood in the laboratory.  We will then conduct dose-mortality bioassay and compare to determined detoxification mechanisms. We will also examine the role of volunteer cotton that may be a source or sink for boll weevil's ability to infest commercial cotton fields. Appropriate non-crop habitats (ditches, roadsides, waste areas) within these quadrates will be identified and systematically sampled for volunteer cotton plants to generate estimates of the distribution and densities of volunteer plants for the entire Lower Rio Grande Valley. In addition, a sub-sample of sites detected with volunteer cotton will be sampled for determining and recording selected life history parameters such as damage and infestation, life stage characterization, and mortality factors (desiccation, predation by ants, parasitims). The model will be developed to simulate boll weevil populatioin dynamics and to forecast weevil densitities in volunter cotton stands. Once the model has been field validated, it will be used to simulate weevil dynamics in spatially explicit context to incorporate landscape characteristics, and used to examine the interaction between commerical cotton practices, landscape features, and the metapopulation of volunteer cotton stands. We will also investigate the reproductive biology, sampling schemes, and economic injury levels for Creotiades signatus in cotton and non-cotton landcapes. In the laboratory, the crop species that this pest utilizes will be exposed to mature, mated female C. signatus where the development of F populations will be reared on a minimum of three phenological states to determine the oviposition sites and reproductive potential (i.e., number of eggs, nymphs, and adults). In addition, multiple samples for all life-stages will be recorded during the growing season from several large-scale production fields to further determine the distribution of the life-stages and reproductive potential within the given crop species. Lastly, we will examine the influence of soybean planting date and insecticide seed treatments on early season pests found in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. For both spring and fall soybeans, experimental plots will be planted in a split-block design (commonly referred to as a strip-split plot) on an in-house ARS research farm as well as an additional location on a cooperator's research farm.

643,"Objective(s): Objective 1: Analyze mRNA and storage oil profiles of cotyledons over the course of seed maturation to infer biological networks underlying soybean seed oil composition and content, and to predict their key gene candidates.Objective 2: Analyze small RNA profiles of cotyledons over course of the seed maturation, and further predict small RNA candidates regulating soybean seed oil composition and content.Approach: Objective 1: Soybean oil synthesis and deposition occur mainly in cotyledons and are differentially regulated over the course of seed maturation. The oil synthesis and deposition are accomplished through the concerted activities of many gene products and biological pathways that are primarily regulated at transcription levels. Gene expression patterns change very quickly over the course of an organismÆs evolution if it is not subjected to functional constraints. Although it is not a universal rule, evidence suggests that expression patterns of many genes are intended to co-evolve with their biological functionalities. The co-evolution is reflected by a correlation of gene expression pattern with the related biological functions, and co-expression of functionally related genes such as those that encode proteins that reside in the same metabolic or signal pathways, or in the same cellular complexes under a variety of biological conditions (Stuart et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2006). The expression pattern correlation is widely used as criteria to predict biological functions of genes, functional relatedness between genes, and gene regulatory networks (Horan et al., 2008). We have examined transcriptomes and storage lipid profiles of cotyledons at six distinct developmental stages over the course of seed maturation.Objective 2: We have conducted deep sequencing of small RNA populations in the same RNA preparations used for transcriptome analysis. It is believed that miRNAs function as master regulators in gene regulatory networks underlying diverse biological processes in Arabidopsis. However, much less is known about soybean miRNA species and their accumulation patterns over the course of seed maturation.   As part of our effort to delineate regulatory networks and identify key genetic components controlling oil composition and content, we will conduct genome-wide characterization of small RNAs, particularly miRNAs, in cotyledons over the course of seed maturation. We will use a bioinformatic approach to analyze the small RNA sequences we have conducted to discover miRNA species and their accumulation patterns. MiRNA species recognize their target mRNA by high sequence complementation, and function mainly as suppressors of the accumulation of the target mRNA by directing the degradation of its functional target mRNAs in plants. Sequence complementarities and negative correlation of mRNA and miRNA accumulation patterns should offer a more effective approach to identify the functional target genes, and can be used to delineate the topology of small RNAs in the TF networks inferred in Objective 1. The miRNA species that locate in TF networks enriched with oil related genes or target oil related genes would be strong candidates for future investigations for oil composition and content improvement.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
644,"We can contribute to stable, environmentally responsible small grains production in North Carolina through the development of wheat, oat and triticale varieties and germplasms with superior agronomic traits, disease and insect resistance, and end-use quality. The average acreage planted to winter wheat and oats in North Carolina is approximately 550,000 acres with a production value of around $130m. Wheat is the most important small grain in the state. Triticale occupies a negligible acreage at present but its potential as a hog and poultry feed warrants research in cultivar development. Three public institutions and two private companies have wheat cultivar development efforts in the southeastern United States, in addition to NCSU. Private efforts in winter wheat mirrors a trend seen in corn and soybeans where investment is being concentrated in the Mississippi delta and Corn Belt states. Many southeastern seed retailers are licensing public developed wheat and oat cultivars on an exclusive basis. To better meet these needs, small grains programs at state universities in NC, SC, GA, FL, and LA formed a cooperative effort (SUNGRAINS) to coordinate cultivar development research and share in royalties. Even before these recent developments, it was widely acknowledged that both public and private cooperation was needed to provide for the needs of the commercial small grain grower and end user. The basic research on breeding methodologies and genetics conducted by the public sector can be exploited by public and private breeders to develop superior cultivars more efficiently or to develop value-added grain types for new market opportunities. The average life of a wheat variety in North Carolina is five seasons. The demise of a typical cultivar results from changes in virulence patterns of the powdery mildew and /or leaf rust fungi. There is a continuous need to provide wheat breeders with new sources of resistance to these pathogens. Four additional pathogens, Fusarium head blight (FHB), stripe rust, Stagonospora blotch (SNB), and stem rust have threatened, or caused serious economic impact, to wheat production during the past five years. It is estimated that over one half of all US wheat cultivars are susceptible to the new Ug99 race of stem rust and a major global initiative is in place to incorporate resistance into wheat cultivar development programs. We can provide new and potentially more stable resistances to these fungi by 1) continuing to introgress new alleles from wild wheat relatives, 2) pyramiding these novel genes with resistance genes currently in the wheat gene pool using molecular markers, and, 3) conduct comprehensive greenhouse and field evaluations annually on advanced generation lines for all six pathogens. A major constraint in winter oat production is winterkilling due to extreme temperatures. We can improve winterhardiness in oat by building on recent work whereby we determined the genetics and associated molecular markers for winter survival component traits.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
645,"1. In nearly all soybean varietal development programs, biparental matings are used to create progeny to evaluate for their potential yield superiority over the two parents. Recurrent introgression (RI) methods involving random mating would be expected to increase the genetic diversity in the elite germplasm pool, thereby enhancing annual genetic yield gain. However, manual pollination in soybean is quite tedious, so RI is not currently used. Male-sterile-based RI allows insect-mediated pollination to occur, but is useful only if each F2 seed can be assayed to determine if that seed will produce a male-fertile (MF) or a male-sterile (MS) plant, and also if the MF seed is a homozygote (breeds true for MF) or is heterozygote (produces both MF and MS). This assay can be made possible by identifying molecular markers that flank the MF/MS gene, since markers allow the breeder to conduct the seed assay. 2. Drought tolerance has been defined in many ways, but the only definition that ultimately counts is greater yield in low rainfall growing seasons. Therefore, one must seek (preferably native) genes whose expression improves yield in drought conditions. Such genes potentially exist in the land races that farmers have selected and grown in drought-prone regions of China for thousands of years. After testing hundreds of these land races for yield performance in Nebraska drought conditions, 22 were identified as being drought tolerant and thus a possible source of genes that might improve drought tolerance in Nebraska elite cultivars. Progeny derived from the matings of the 22 land races with three high-yielding cultivars will be evaluated for yield performance at drought-prone locations in the next few years. The yield data are expected to reveal the location of these genes in the soybean genome, so that breeders can use marker-assisted selection to more easily introgress these genes into the elite germplasm pool used by today's breeders. 3a. Thousands of molecular markers known as SNPs recently became available for use by soybean geneticists and breeders. These SNPs can now be used to intensify the search for genes that control soybean yield potential (as opposed to genes that defend yield against pests). To accomplish this goal, a set of 40 populations created by mating diverse parents to one hub parent will provide the germplasm resource to evaluate whether a nested association mapping method can be used to detect yield QTLs in soybean. Such QTLs, if identified, could lead to an acceleration in the rate at which ever-higher-yielding soybean varieties are developed and released to USA soybean producers. 3b. The thousands of available SNPs also serve as a resource for locating genes in the soybean genome that govern seed protein content. Soybean is the predominant source of vegetable protein, but as yields move higher, seed protein content has a propensity to decline. Thus, genes that would mitigate this decline are needed. The selective genotyping project of Objective 3b was designed to identify the genes in high protein germplasm that could be used for this purpose.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
646,"Over 80 million acres of field corn and 600,000 acres of sweet corn, worth about $41 billion in total are grown in the U.S. each year. European corn borer (ECB) accounts for over $1.85 billion in control costs and grain losses annually. Southwestern corn borer, sugarcane borer, corn earworm, fall armyworm, and black cutworm can cause significant damage regionally. Western bean cutworm increasingly is a pest of corn ears across the north central region. The long-term goal of our research is to develop sustainable ways to manage lepidopteran corn pests. This is a high regional priority, and in the context of demonstrating sustainable practices, it also is an important national priority. _____Implications of GM corn in the landscape and pest management. Since the commercial release of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn in 1996, a revolution in corn insect pest management has occurred. To preserve this valuable technology, insect resistance management (IRM) must be implemented. Bt corn acreage has increased dramatically and new Bt technologies have emerged, increasing the potential for resistance evolution, generating new demands on IRM, and revealing new knowledge gaps about ECB and other corn pests. Our research was used to develop IRM models which led to the IRM approach using a 20% non-Bt corn refuge. However, recent developments have stretched our ability to provide sound, timely knowledge. In addition, because of the widespread use of Bt corn, there has been an area-wide suppression of ECB populations, the extent and consequences of which need to be quantified. Another issue has been the need to more fully understand the impacts of GM technologies on non-target organisms. Never before in the history of pest management has there been as much pressure placed on the scientific community by the general public to understand the ecological impacts of new pest management tactics. _____Adaption of IPM systems for changing pest complexes. Climate change has important implications for corn IPM. Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns may be in part responsible for a host of new corn pests. Range expansion of four major corn pests, including corn earworm and ECB, has been predicted by analyzing pest overwintering thresholds and degree-day requirements along with climate change projections. These range expansions could have significant economic impacts via increased yield loss and management costs. Corn IPM will necessarily have to adapt to these changing conditions. _____Ecology, evolution, genetics, and behavior. Despite nearly a century of research on ECB, spatial and temporal aspects of ECB movement and mating behavior have proven difficult to characterize. A clear understanding of mating behavior is important for IRM modeling and policy development. Enhancing natural control is the first line of protection in IPM. Even though the biology of most of the natural enemies associated with corn has been described, the effects and value of these natural enemies in the landscape is not well understood. Information gaps include understanding patterns of variation in natural enemy communities in a corn and soybean agroecosystems.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
647,"Lack of diversity in crop rotations and intensive tillage practices (primarily before corn in rotation) impair both soil quality and field crop productivity. One of the goals of this project is to examine the effectiveness of alternate rotations, tillage systems and nutrient management to improve soil quality and crop yields while reducing the release of greenhouse gasses from the same fields. Corn production systems are changing rapidly, and cropping systems research can help drive good decision making at the farm level. Corn producers in the Eastern Corn Belt are growing progressively higher plant populations of corn hybrids with transgenic pest resistant traits incorporated, and this has brought with it a need to better understand the changing dynamics of nutrient uptake and how to minimize the development in crop canopies of yield-reducing plant-to-plant variability. Integrated management systems can help corn stands achieve higher uniformity, especially in stress environments, and these will help to advance yield. Environmental consequences of current corn production systems can be negative, and it is imperative that research investigations on the use of modern technologies to grow corn with potentially less deleterious environmental side effects be continued. Of particular interest is the whole area of greenhouse gas emissions associated with nitrogen fertilizer application, because nitrous oxides have about 300 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide (on a molecule to molecule basis). Thus this project aims to investigate how advances in nitrogen application equipment (associated with precision guidance) and products (such as nitrogen stabilizers) can reduce the emissions of nitrous oxides while achieving corn that yields more grain per unit of N fertilizer.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
648,"Prof. Camapbell's research is important because older and elderly people are the fastest growing segments of our population and they are at increased risk of morbidities and premature mortality due to diet and lifestyle-related behaviors that promote excess body weight and obesity, along with reduced skeletal muscle and sarcopenia. In addition, the dietary protein needs of older and elderly people are not known with confidence and emerging research suggests the habitual consumption of protein intakes at or moderately below the recommended dietary allowance, which 25-40% of older and elderly people consume, may contribute to sarcopenia and frailty. The outcomes and impacts of the three planned research projects are as follows Objective 1: : Influences of whey protein on body composition, glucose metabolism, and appetite in middle-aged adults at risk for the metabolic syndrome This study will examine the effectiveness of whey protein supplementation, under free-feeding conditions and in conjunction with resistance and aerobic exercise training, to positively change body composition, glucose metabolism, appetite, and clinical markers of metabolic syndrome in overweight and obese adults. It is hypothesized that compared to a non-protein supplement, the consumption of an iso-caloric whey protein supplement will promote increased fat-free mass and decreased fat mass; improved glucose metabolism; lower appetitive responses; greater dietary compensation; and reduced risk factors for the metabolic syndrome. Collectively, the results of this study will provide important and novel information about the benefits of whey to provide high-quality protein that positively influences the body composition and health profiles of middle-aged overweight and obese persons. Objective 2: Increased protein intakes from predominantly meat- versus soy protein/pulses-based foods: Effects on daily and postprandial appetite during energy restriction-induced weight loss The objectives are to assess the effects of dietary protein intakes across the acceptable macronutrient distribution range of protein (10%, 20%, and 30% of energy intake) with lean beef/pork or soy/pulses as the predominant sources of protein during energy-restriction-induced weight loss in overweight adults. The outcomes of interest are daily appetite and postprandial appetite, energy expenditure, and postprandial glycemic response. Findings from this research will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of consuming lean beef and pork products to promote satiety during weight loss. The novel comparison of beef and pork against soy/pulses will provide a foundation for new initiatives to understand the unique benefits of using these higher-protein foods for satiety during weight loss. Objective 3: Assessment of the dietary protein requirements of elderly humans: a pilot study using the indicator amino acid oxidation technique. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dietary protein needs of octogenarian women. This will be the first study to do so. The findings will establish a foundation to improve the understanding of how much protein this group of women should consume.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The project will concentrate on major problems in Michigan including potato, soy bean, sugar beet, wheat and ornamental (perennials) foliar diseases and soilborne diseases. High yielding cultivars of crops are often susceptible to disease and engender dependence on high inputs of crop protection materials such as fungicides. This project generates information on the interactions between environment and host plant resistance that impact plant disease development. The project seeks to generate information that rationalizes crp protection practices with environmental stewardship. For example, applications of fungicides for crown and root rot control have been optimized based on phenology of the plant. Potato varieties with increased resistance to potato late blight have been developed that will reduce fungicide reliance in the future. The impact of seed contaminated with P. infestans has been quantified and effective management strategies developed.

650,"Corn, cotton and soybean were harvested from 2.9 million acres with a farm value of over one billion dollars in North Carolina in 2008. Estimated annual yield losses for these crops to disease causing organisms is about 10% and the farm value of these losses is approximately 90 million dollars. Current strategies and tactics employed for management of these diseases generally limit their impact on North Carolina agriculture and permit profitable production of these crops. Changes in agricultural production systems, the introduction of new plant pathogens and (or) the development of new pathogen biotypes can be devastating to agriculture. Research on the ecology of soilborne pathogens and their management in row crops is critical to the continued productivity of North Carolina Agriculture. Economic losses to the agricultural community as a result of disease, and a variety of negative environmental impacts that occur as a result. The poor growth of unhealthy plants in particular results in an array of negative impacts, including a crop unable to utilize available soil moisture and nutrients. Research on the ecology of these plant pathogens results in biologically based approaches to management with few adverse impacts. Previous Work and Present Status of Pertinent Research: Worldwide, the most damaging pathogen of soybean is the soybean cyst nematode (SCN). This parasite is distributed throughout most soybean growing areas in the US and virtually all areas of North Carolina where soybean is grown. Resistant cultivars have been shown to be cost-effective in management of SCN. The use of SCN-resistant cultivars, however, places selection pressure on populations of cyst nematode, often resulting in populations of that can parasitize previously resistant cultivars. Periodic assessments of the ability of field populations to reproduce on resistant cultivars are required. Currently, resistant cultivars play a minor role in management of SCN in North Carolina because new genetic resources needed to manage the prevalent races are not currently available.tant cultivars. The damage potential of nematodes to cotton has been recognized since the late 19th Century. Plant-parasitic nematodes, however, received only limited study as cotton pathogens until the 1950's. Currently, the four most damaging species of plant-parasitic nematodes affecting cotton in North Carolina are the southern root-knot, reniform, Columbia lance, and. Estimated losses of cotton lint yield by these pathogens in the United States have increased from 1% to 2% in the 1950's to more than 4% in 2000. This increase in estimated losses due to plant-parasitic nematodes can be attributed to several factors, the most important of which is the lack of genetic diversity in the cotton crop. Tactics for management of plant parasitic nematodes in cotton are limited. Protection against biotic pathogens, such as nematodes, thus becomes increasingly important.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
651,"Fungal pathogens of plants destroy thousands of acres of crops annually. In addition to losses, control of fungal diseases frequently involves the use of pesticides that are expensive and can have an impact on the environment. Research that advances our understanding of how fungi cause disease on plants may lead to the development of crops that naturally resist infection. Cultivation of disease-resistant crop varieties reduces crop losses and the need for chemical pesticides and other expensive control methods, and thus is the control method of choice for affordable and environmentally-sound crop disease control. Fungal pathogens of plants utilize many strategies for successful disease development. Among them is the production of toxins that kill host plant cells. This project focuses on two important fungal pathogens of plants and the toxins they use to infect their hosts. Fungi in the genus Cercospora are a group of highly successful and destructive pathogens that cause disease on a wide range of host plants world-wide including sugar beet, corn, soybean, coffee, and peanut, as well as vegetable and ornamental crops. Previous studies have shown that these fungi utilize a light-activated toxin for successful disease development. The toxin produces toxic forms of oxygen that harm living cells and is toxic to animals and microorganisms in addition to plants. The Cercospora fungi, however, are resistant. This project will identify and characterize genes from the fungus that are required for toxin resistance. Once identified, these genes will be engineered into crop species to determine if they can provide disease resistance. This project will also study the fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis, the causal agent of one of the most destructive diseases of banana, the black Sigatoka disease. Previous studies have suggested that this fungus also uses a light-activated toxin for infection. This project will focus on identifying and characterizing toxins produced by this fungus and confirming their importance in successful disease development. If successful, resistance genes identified in the Cercospora system may also have utility in engineering resistance in banana to this destructive disease. This project will advance our understanding of two highly destructive pathogens of important crop plants. It has the potential to lead to the development of crop plants with improved disease resistance, leading to more sustainable and environmentally sound crop production.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Species such as P. infestans, P. sojae, P. capsici and P. ramorum cause major losses on potato, soybean, pepper, ornamental and forest tree species. Some species have wide host ranges such as the root pathogen P. cinnamomi which can infect over 3000 host species. Migrations of Phytophthora species in plant materials over large geographic areas have led to some of the most devastating epidemics known to mankind including late blight of potato which spread by migration of infected tubers from South America and sudden oak death (P. ramorum) which has moved repeatedly with the nursery plant trade between continents and across the US. In 2009, late blight epidemics in the eastern US were the worst in recent history due to movement of the pathogen in infected tomato transplants.

This utilization of no-till has been facilitated by improvements in planters and weed control options. As with any system, adaption and modifications have been made to refine no-till crop production. Updates in equipment, pest management and varieties have been made to help address some of the challenges faced in no-till crop production. Even the definition of what can be classified as no-till has changed as well. Originally, no-till was described as the only tillage was when the planter went through the field. Currently, a field can be classified as no-till if crop residue is covering 70% of the field surface. With this increased latitude in what can be called no-till, numerous tillage tools have been developed that can perform either deep or shallow tillage operations, yet leave 70% or more residue on the soil surface to protect against soil erosion.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
654,"Agriculture is a key industry for the economic prosperity for Arkansas. Five major grain crops are grown on approximately 2.26 million ha each year in Arkansas with an estimated annual value of $2.84 billion. With the exception of soybean, yields of these crops in Arkansas are very close to, or exceed, average national yields (Table 1). Although crop yields for Arkansas are generally close to the national average, these yields for soybean, corn, grain sorghum, and wheat are approximately one-half of their yield under optimum conditions. In the absence of biotic limitations (such as pathogens), there are four essential resources required for crop growth and yield: (1) an adequate water and (2) nutrient supply, (3) solar radiation to drive photosynthetic processes, and (4) adequate time during a growing season (frost-free for warm-season crops) for plant development. The primary limitation for yield of soybean, corn, and grain sorghum is adequate and timely water availability. The most obvious method of increasing yield under water-limited conditions is to irrigate, and, indeed irrigation is an important aspect of Arkansas' crop production systems. For soybean, 75% of the crop is irrigated and yield due to irrigation usually ranges 30 to 50% over the nonirrigated crop. Although statistical data are not available for corn and grain sorghum crops in Arkansas, similar yield responses to irrigation would be expected. Despite obvious yield benefits, irrigation may be limited by initial costs of investment, pumping facilities, aquifer depth, quality of water, and competition of irrigation water by other crops. Therefore, there is a need to develop management systems and genetic resources that can efficiently utilize irrigation and rainfall resources for crop production. Genetic variability for all of the five major grain crops listed in Table 1 are great. Our current breeding, management, and Extension programs at the University of Arkansas are focused on using genetic resources that fit well within current management systems. Extending the germplasm pool that we use in Arkansas may be accomplished in two ways. First, high-yielding cultivars (or hybrids) may be available from other regions that can be used effectively in Arkansas for increasing utilization of specific resources. For example, using short-season crops from the northern U.S. may enable farmers in the Midsouthern U.S. to avoid late-season drought. Secondly, specific traits may be available in germplasm collections that when combined with adapted, high-yielding cultivars (or hybrids) would provide increased efficiency in resource utilization.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
655,"Research on unique functional properties, and industrial uses of plant proteins has been emphasized as an expanding area of national need. Rice bran and soy bean meal are co-products of the rice and soybean oil processing industry, and if novel uses for the proteins in rice, rice bran, soybean meal and alternate crops could be found, it would add value to both these industries. This project investigates modified proteins, and co-products, as value-added ingredients for functional and health benefits. Investigating the functional properties of these native and modified proteins differing in albumin, glutelin, globulin and prolamin content will give valuable information that could lead to design of suitable protein mixtures to obtain novel protein ingredients with unique functional properties and possibly enhanced nutritional value. Moreover, hydrolyzed proteins and their resulting peptides can also bear functionalities that can be used in a variety of food product applications. Since proteins are highly complexed with other constituents, improved and optimized methods need to be employed to obtain optimum quantities of the proteins or peptides. For the purpose of human consumption the proteins/peptides need to be resistant to the degradative environemnt of the gut and hence, processes need to be developed to obtain proteins/peptides resistant to the gut. Without proper separation and fractionation techniques it will be difficult to characterize the proteins/peptides that show enhanced functions. The methods used will be optimized and improved methods will be designed to generate proteins and peptides that can show improved function, and value added uses for application in new product development.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
656,"Betaine is the methyl donor substrate for BHMT. Betaine is produced in animals as well as being present in the diet. Our previously published work (Szegedi &amp; Garrow, 2008) has shown that BHMT can use S-methylmethionine (SMM) as a methyl donor substrate. This work also showed that, despite its name, BHMT-2 does not use betaine as a methyl donor substrate but is in fact a SMM-specific methyltransferase. SMM is not made in animals and is only produced in plants and fungi. Also, work published in the 1950s and 1960s indicated that BHMT could use dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) as a methyl donor substrate. However, the ability of both BHMT and BHMT-2 to use DMSP has not been characterized using modern initial rate kinetics. Interestingly, DMSP is also a compound that is only produced in plants. The work will characterize the substrate specificity of BHMT-2 toward DMSP as the first step in charactering how mammals have evolved to use this methyl donor, which is not produced in the body but rather a phytochemical, in aidingmethionine biosynthesis, an essential amino acid that from an evolutionary context is considered a limiting amino acid for animal growth and development. Methionine is routinely added to the soy- and corn-based pig and poultry diets, but is an expensive supplement. DMSP could be a cost-saving nutritive additive to animal feeds.This work will provide new information regarding the structure and function of two enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) and BHMT-2.

657,"Recently there has been an increased interest in growing food in urban settings, including market gardening on abandoned city lots. Some of this city land may be parking lots covered with asphalt. There are several reasons for this interest. First, land is becoming more available in cities because of the recent economic/foreclosure crisis. Second, consumers are demanding more local produce because of environmental considerations and keeping food dollars in the local economy. Third, if we are near peak oil production, as some claim, or a carbon tax is implemented, the price of fuel will increase dramatically in the future and the cost of food produced under our current industrial agriculture model will also increase substantially. This will result in an increase demand for local produce that required less transportation and will make local food production more profitable. Small acreage or urban farmers can use many integrated pest management (IPM) tactics to manage pests, increase yields and increase profits that larger industrial acreage farmers would find cost prohibitive. These tactics include such things as the use of polyculture systems, high tunnels, raised beds, and growing crops in containers. Although there is some research information available on all of these components there is little to no information on growing food on asphalt and the impact on pest and beneficial arthropods. Therefore the purpose of this project is to evaluate several different growing systems that are designed for urban farmers interested in turning areas covered by asphalt into productive land. This experiment is located on an abandoned parking lot of the Ohio State University Agricultural Technology Institute and will evaluate a polyculture system that includes 4 perennial crops (apple, peach, blueberry, raspberry) and 4 annual crops (tomato, edamame soybeans, strawberry, green beans) using 3 different growing systems on an asphalted parking lot. The 3 treatments replicated 3 times are: 1) growing the crops in pots, 2) removing the asphalt within the rows and planting directly in the soil, and 3) planting in raised beds on a wood chip base. Treatments will be repeated on a grass area immediately adjacent to the parking lot to serve as paired comparison. High tunnels will also be applied over one replicate of each treatment to measure the impact on food production and pest management.

658,"In order to optimize sprayer performance both efficacy and drift need to be considered. Many applicators, particularly aerial, are looking to reduce their application volumes to increase their productivity. In addition, many of the pesticides currently used in crop protection are contact or locally systemic products. These products require increased coverage in order to be effective. Lower spray application volumes and less systemic pesticides both require the use of smaller droplet sizes in order to maintain efficacy. Even systemic products have experienced efficacy issues in recent years, likely because of poor coverage and deposition associated with the use of large drift-resistant droplets. Due to glyphosate resistant weeds, dicamba and 2,4-D resistant crops are expected to be commercially available within the next several years. These two herbicides will likely require a smaller droplet size then glyphosate in order to be effective. The need for a smaller droplet spectrum to provide effective coverage will increase the risk of these products drifting off target. Benefits of low volume aerial applications include increased productivity and timelier applications. Foliar fungicide applications to corn and soybeans, insecticide applications to treat soybean aphids, and applications to control Asian soybean rust, are all applications that need to be made at the correct time. With millions of acres of both corn and soybeans potentially needing to be treated in a short time period, the ability to make low volume applications is critical. For low volume applications, it becomes more difficult to balance efficacy with drift reduction. Knowing what droplet size is required for an application and then properly setting up the application equipment to provide this droplet size is critical. Spray droplet size is impacted by nozzle type, orifice size, spray angle, operating pressure, application speed, the pesticide formulation being applied, nozzle deflection angle, spray adjuvants, and sprayer electronics. In order to help applicators select the proper equipment and use it correctly, research is needed to determine what droplet size is best suited for different types of applications, how the various factors impact droplet size, and how to best mitigate drift under these application scenarios. Applicators need guidance on how to properly set up sprayers for lower volume applications in order to maintain the correct balance between efficacy and drift. There has been some recent work focusing on efficacy instead of drift reduction. Several projects have examined making effective applications to control Asian soybean rust. All of this work, however, focused on ground applications, which will be less effective than aerial applications in covering many acres of soybeans in a short time period, as will be required should a large outbreak of Asian soybean rust occur. While there has been research conducted involving improving the efficacy of aerial applications, much of it has focused on crops other than corn and soybeans, which are the two most important crops in Illinois.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The plant kingdom contains the largest genomes of all, and though it will be some time before the very biggest are sequenced, the large genomes of crop plants such as maize, soybean and rice are now completed. Although annotation of the genomes will provide an overview of the protein coding sequences, regulatory sequences of crop plants are not currently accessible to automated annotation, with some relatively simple exceptions such as intron splice sites. This problem is essentially one of code breaking. The more that is known about the functions, expression and structure of genes and their products, the more the deficiencies in our knowledge about the regulatory DNA become apparent. The regulation of gene expression is the key to understanding most of the agriculturally important characteristics and responses of plants, including tolerance to environmental stresses, nutrient partitioning and morphology.

660,"Dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) introduced by the Native Americans from Mexico, Central America, and South America, has been grown in the U.S. for millennia. However, compared to corn, soybean, and wheat, the average national yield of dry bean is low (1700 lbs/acre). Abiotic and biotic stresses can severely limit both dry and snap (vegetable form) bean production. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases are the main production constraints. In the same way, some production regions are severely affected by drought, heat, soil mineral deficiencies, and short growing seasons, among other problems. Many of these diseases are seed-borne, or are caused by pathogenetically variable and sometimes emergent pathogens, and for whom chemical control can be expensive, is not practical, or in the case of plant viruses, requires resistance genes (traditional or engineered) to reduce damage. This project involves inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaborative researchers developing alternative recombination and selection methods and identification, and the use of molecular markers in bean and pathogen genomes. New Phaseolous markers will make possible efficient introgression and pyramiding of favorable alleles and QTL into improved bean cultivars for a diverse cropping system. The efficient development of such germplasm and cultivars having multiple-disease resistance and abiotic stresses, requires a team of researchers with expertise and facilities and that share responsibilities as well as the exchange of segregating populations and breeding lines that complement screening and selection in contrasting field environments, combined with expertise in plant pathogen identification, culturing, manipulation and genetic/genomic studies to pinpoint pathogenicity genes (gene for gene and other resistance mechanisms), laboratories, and greenhouses regionally and nationally.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Its commercially valuable members include fruit producing (e.g., stone fruits, apples, brambles, and strawberries), nut-producing (almond), lumber producing (e.g. black cherry) and ornamental (e.g. roses, flowering cherry, quince, and pear) species. Rosaceae is the type family for the Rosales, the largest order in the Rosidae. In the study of Rosaceae genomics, we have established a consortium of laboratories in the US and worldwide. These laboratories are carrying out research on genome organization of representative species of five genera (Malus, Prunus, Rosa, Fragaria, and Rubus). The goal of our research is to develop peach as a model genetic resource for the identification, characterization and cloning of important genes of Rosaceae species and employ comparative genomics to transfer this information into other species including strawberry, apple, raspberry etc. Although the Rosaceae is typified by broad diversity in growth habit, fruit type, reproductive traits and other important characters, we have insufficiently capitalized on this unique resource for basic research. This is in part historical in that many Rosaceae species are, in general, not easily amenable to traditional basic genetics analysis (long generation time, significant requirements of space and labor) and, in part, due to the strong emphasis of funding agencies into plants with a perceived greater potential for economic return (maize, rice, soybean). However with the introduction and application of molecular genetics technologies and the tools of genomics and transgenics, species which in the past were considered unsuitable for basic research are now moving to the forefront because they present unique opportunities to extend and enhance our understanding of the evolution of specialized gene systems and their diverse functions in different plant families (e.g. the floral genome project). It is in this regard that the Rosaceae offers one of the best systems for the comparative study of the evolution of particular plant genes systems in relation to the exploitation of specific growth habit niches. This fact has become rapidly apparent, as genomics projects on Rosaceae species have revealed that the diploid species representatives of this family have very small, compact genomes: 200 Mb strawberry, 290 Mb (raspberry), 220 MB (peach) and at the same time exhibit a huge diversity in growth form ranging from herbaceous to cane to bush to tree forms. Thus, of the plant families available for genomic scale comparative studies in respect to the adoption of particular growth forms, the Rosaceae genome (Roseome) is unparalleled. However, to exploit the Roseome for understanding the genome scale evolution of specific character states whole genome sequences of the key diploid species genomes are critical.

663,"Corn and soybean growers in the United States often rotate these crops with one another in consecutive years. In many areas, however, corn is grown without rotation (i.e. continuous corn), either as a result of local market pressures (e.g. biofuels), unfavorable conditions for non-corn crops, or both. Both factors are at play in Indiana, where continuous corn production has increased recently and is forecast to continue to do so (Erickson et al. 2008). A direct-mail survey of 241 Indiana growers conducted by Erickson et al. (2008), found that insect and disease management were the top two concerns expressed by continuous corn growers, with the western corn rootworm (WCR) being the top single concern overall. As a result, there is high demand for Bt corn hybrids developed to combat WCR in continuous corn systems. These insecticidal traits are now usually combined or  stacked  with glyphosate-tolerance leading to no  single-trait  insect control option for growers, amounting to an increase in the adoption of both simultaneously. Adoption of corn hybrids expressing  stacked  or multiple traits has also increased dramatically in the US in recent years; from 29% (9.5 million hectares) in 2004 to 46% (15.1 million hectares) in 2009 (NASS 2009) - driven primarily by the introduction and rapid adoption of hybrids that express toxins active against the rootworm beetle complex that are combined with glyphosate-tolerance genes. This convergence and simplification of pest management practices and the incorporation of transgenic traits in plant breeding has largely benefited producers by contributing to increasing yields. However, the widespread adoption of any pest management strategy carries with it a potential for an increased selection pressure upon the target pests, followed by an increased risk of resistance evolution. This caveat is particularly relevant to the WCR/Bt corn system currently in place. When transgenic corn for rootworm control was registered in 2003, an insect resistance management (IRM) plan, based on mandatory refuges, was required and included with the purchase of the seed. In brief, this strategy hopes to overwhelm the rare adults that survive Bt exposure and carry with them recessive resistant alleles with susceptible alleles when they mate with the more numerous beetles emerging from refuges. The strategy works best when the Bt dose is high, largely because the numbers of heterozygote survivors (and correspondingly, the numbers of resistance alleles) will be reduced. Importantly, none of the currently available Bt toxins for WCR control are considered high dose (Miehls et al. 2008; Tabashnik 2008), a factor that lends even more urgency to research into factors that may hasten resistance development.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
664,"The soybean breeding project has released non-GMO cultivars for more than 60 years. Food-grade cultivars with large seed and high protein developed during the past 50 years have been widely grown by farmers for the food industry. Higher yielding cultivars of this type will continue to be important in the future. The soybean cultivars currently grown to produce a low-saturate oil were all developed by Iowa State University. A major market for the low-saturate oil has been the USDA School Lunch program where it is used to reduce the saturated fat in the meals served to children. The retail market for the low-saturate soybean oil has been small because of the competition from canola oil, which has a low saturate content. The commercial production of soybean cultivars with low linolenic acid has been important to meet the demand for an oil that has adequate oxidative stability without chemical hydrogenation. The reduction of linolenic acid to 1% in these cultivars has been achieved through the combination of three alleles developed at Iowa State University: fan1(A5), fan2(A23), and fan3(A26). The present outlook is that demand for the low linolenic oil will continue until one with high oleic acid is available. A non-GMO alternative for an oil with high oleic acid will be possible through the use of alleles recently identified by the USDA-ARS/Univ. of Missouri-Columbia. One advantage of the non-GMO approach is that the cultivars also will provide non-GMO protein for the food industry. The importance of the soybean aphid has increased since it was first identified in the Midwest during 2000. Outbreaks of the insect that cause economic injury have been difficult to predict. Research will be conducted to determine how the available resistance genes impact agronomic and seed traits and aphid growth. The soybean cyst nematode has been a problem for some soybean farmers for many years. Public and private breeding programs have placed considerable emphasis on development of cultivars with resistance. Sudden death syndrome has increased in importance during recent years. There are differences in resistance among cultivars that seems to be influenced by multiple genes. Evaluation of lines for resistance generally is done in the field where the results are variable from year to year. Improved methods of greenhouse screening are under development. The carlavirus is a problem of economic importance in Mexico, Brazil, and other countries.

The US soybean crop is worth approximately twice that of wheat and 10 times that of rice. Soybean has numerous nutritional and industrial uses due to its unique seed chemical composition. With its high protein content (40%) and moderately high oil (20%), the soybean seed is the world's main source of vegetable protein and oil. It accounts for 55% of all oilseeds produced. Unfortunately soybean suffers from both biotic and abiotic stresses, and on an annual basis it suffers yield losses worth over 2 billion dollars just from biotic stresses. Therefore, improvement of soybean for disease resistance is a major priority to protect yield, growers' income and country's export and gross national product. Abiotic stress resulting in from iron deficiency chlorosis is a major problem in Iowa and much of the upper Midwest soybean producing states. In addition to improving soybean for resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses, we will investigate the basis of insect attractants of flowers for improving cross pollination between male sterile and fertile lines for producing hybrid seeds. The project uses current molecular tools in understanding the genetic components involved in the expression of resistance or tolerance of soybean against the biotic and abiotic stresses. We will apply the new knowledge to be gained from these molecular studies and conventional breeding strategies in improving soybean for resistance/tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Similarly, we will apply a genetic-molecular approach in order to decipher the genetic mechanism of pollen attraction for improving soybean for enhanced cross pollination; and thereby, higher yield from heterosis.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
666,"Sorghum Sorghum bicolor Moench is a C4 cane grass originating in Africa. Worldwide it is an important cereal crop grown for food, feed, and ethanol production. In the United States, total sorghum production ranks only behind maize, soybean, and wheat. Sorghum is well adapted to grow in harsher environments where other crops fail to thrive. Sorghum is also tolerant to many abiotic stresses that plague other cereals including heat, flooding, and drought. These traits have driven the interest in utilizing sorghum as a dedicated energy crop in the US. However, as a warm season cereal, sorghum is susceptible to colder temperatures. At present, a major limiting factor in sorghum production is low air and soil temperatures. Sorghum germinates optimally at soil temperatures of 21 degree C or greater. In the Midwest, low soil and air temperatures in the early spring greatly reduces germination, emergence, and early seedling growth. Making tolerance to cold and freezing two highly desirable traits for increased US sorghum production. Cold and freeze tolerance allows for early season planting and stand establishment allowing for multiple harvests. To date limited there is limited information on QTLs for cold and freeze tolerance a major QTL for early seedling cold tolerance hasn't been identified. Cold tolerance has been identified in several landraces from temperate regions of China. These landraces however carry many unfavorable agronomic traits along with the cold tolerance. So it is necessary to formulate a strategy to dissect and transmit the cold tolerance trait from these landraces into elite agronomic lines. The objectives of the study is to identify markers associated with various traits for early season cold and freeze tolerance and identify new germplasm sources of cold and freeze tolerance. These objectives will be studied through the cross between Tx430 (cold and freeze susceptible) and CT19 (cold and freeze tolerant) recombinant inbred lines. Phenotyping of the population will be conducted in optimized conditions of 25 degree C and Cold temperature of 10 degree c where germination percentages will be scored at seven days at optimal conditions and 14 days at cold conditions.

667,"Legumes provide an estimated 33% of protein in the human diet and compensate for the low lysine content of grain proteins. The majority of legume crops suffer significant yield loss from plant disease caused by viruses, fungi, bacteria and nematodes. This project will identify the molecular basis of disease resistance to important pathogens of grain legume species, including cowpea, peanut, chickpea and pigeonpea, and deploy this knowledge for purposes of crop improvement through plant breeding.  Our approach is to leverage knowledge gained from the study of well-characterized legume species, such as soybean and Medicago. Both of these species have fully sequenced genomes, and we have developed comparative data sets that permit us to transfer molecular genetic information from these well-characterized species to less characterized crop species. Using this approach, we can accelerate the characterization of disease resistance traits in less characterized species, and ultimately arrive at a detailed description of the genes that underlie disease resistance against specific pathogens.  Key outputs will be a better understanding of the genes that confer resistance to important plant pathogens of legumes. Such knowledge can lead to more precise and rapid breeding strategies to provide disease resistant varieties of key crop legumes.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
668,"The typical Iowa corn-soybean rotation is detrimental to the ecological sustainability of Iowa's soils and agriculture. In this rotation 1) fields remain open during the winter, increasing the potential for wind and water erosion of soil 2) soybeans host a number of pest management problems reducing profitability and 3) the crop rotation lacks plant diversity that could enhance pest management. The purpose of this research project is to increase crop species diversity on the Iowa farming landscape. This will be achieved by developing longer crop rotations that include summer and winter annual species as well as perennial species. Oilseed crops such as canola and cereal grains such as wheat exhibiting summer and winter annual life cycles as well as perennial legumes such as red clover could possibly fit into an Iowa crop rotation providing growers with alternative options. Additionally, the inclusion of summer and winter annual crop species in rotations increases the potential of economically viable double-cropping scenarios. The inclusion of species with different life cycles such as these can also serve to improve cropping systems by increasing the amount of ground cover throughout the year and help disturb life cycles of problematic weed species. Incorporating multiple species into a crop rotation may also improve yields of other crops such as corn and improve a farmer's economic stability.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
669,"Winter wheat is a critical crop for Wisconsin's dairy and row crop producers. Since 2000, winter wheat production in Wisconsin has increased by 250% and the value of production has increased 8-fold, providing an excellent source of income for Wisconsin producers (Source: USDA-NASS). In addition to income from grain, winter wheat also provides straw for use on the dairy and an excellent rotational crop for corn, soybean, and alfalfa production. We estimate that, when conditions for planting in the fall are most favorable, winter wheat acreage could reach approximately 500K acres, indicating there is still room for expansion. A key limiting factor for winter wheat production in Wisconsin is yield loss due to diseases. In both 2008 and 2009, winter wheat production was affected by Fusarium head blight (Fusarium graminearum), both in the field, and post-harvest when growers were docked at elevators for having levels of deoxynivalenol (DON), a mycotoxin, above the FDA mandated threshold level of 2 ppm. In 2009, we have also seen an increase in the number of questions about the risk of mycotoxin contamination in hail-affected corn (and soybean), indicating that our proposed research has broader implications beyond wheat. We propose an Interdisciplinary and Integrative Research and Extension project, which fits the mission of both PIs (Conley and Esker) programs. As State Specialists in the area of field crop production, we aim to provide information of highest relevance for our stakeholders in the state, while also provide new and novel research that has broader implications. Within Wisconsin, this research fits into areas of need for: (i) mechanisms of pest and pathogen resistance and safe and effective control, with minimum effects on environmental quality and human health, (ii) sustainable agricultural and forestry production and processing systems that provide improve food safety and security, environmental protection, economically viable communities, protection of public goods, and human well-being, and (iii) research and development related to agricultural processes with the potential to enhance the productivity and quality of livestock and food and bio-fuel crops in a sustainable manner. We need further research to understand both the short- and long-term risk associated with Fusarium spp., and how best to develop  Best Management Practices  to reduce this risk. Additionally, our proposed research links into a regional and national scale by providing up-to-date information specifically for Wisconsin that can be used to improve upon existing management tools like the Fusarium head blight prediction center (http://www.wheatscab.psu.edu/).",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
670,"In corn and soybean production, nutrient inputs can comprise a significant portion of the per acre expense on a yearly basis. Optimum management of these nutrients is critical in maintaining high yields and optimum profitability for farmers to grow and maintain their enterprises. Emerging technologies and fluctuating fertilizer prices bring into question better ways to manage fertilizer inputs to decrease costs and keep profits high. For nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium, soil testing has long been used to determine when and how much fertilizer should be applied. However, with ever increasing yield potential of crops there have been questions concerning the adequacy of current state P guidelines for many crops. Current recommendations are based on the philosophy of management from a particular researcher and are prescriptive for appropriate fertilizer rates that the farmer should apply yet tend to lack information such as probability of crop response to the nutrient based on a given soil test and the potential yield reduction when the nutrient is not applied. Since producers have differing goals for their operations and technology is changing on a rapid basis, the most up to date information needs to be provided to growers on crop response to nutrients utilizing the newest genetics available to growers. In Minnesota crop producers apply small amount of starter fertilizer with the planter to speed up slow plant growth early in the season. It is most common for starter fertilizer to consist of liquid fertilizers that are applied directly in contact with the seed. This practice is generally used in combination with broadcast fertilizers potentially lessening the impact of the nutrients applied in starter fertilizer. Additionally, the cost per pound of many nutrients in liquid sources tend be high and can significantly limit the potential economic response to starter fertilizer. Identifying starter fertilizer mixes that give the best economic benefit is key to determine the best economic alternative in a given situation. This may mean switching from N and P sources to N only or N and S fertilizers.

671,"The Midwest U.S. is one of the world's most agriculturally dominated areas, with soybean, maize, and wheat being produced on nearly 35% of the total land area. This is significant for three reasons. First, the future effects of land use and climate change on ecosystem goods and services in the Midwest will be dominated by the response of soybean, maize and wheat agriculture. Second, the impacts of land use and climate change on the ecosystem function of the soybean-maize-wheat growing area will significantly contribute to the overall feedback of the U.S. biosphere on the atmosphere. Third, the Midwest provides a model setting in which to evaluate the impact of environmental change on both natural and agricultural ecosystems at the regional scale, with direct relevance to national and global issues. Because the Midwest U.S. is such a productive region, it has been proposed as a region for growing biomass for the production of bioenergy. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires annual production by 2022 of 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels, and demand could be higher with further climate change legislation in the coming years. Current legislation lacks detail on where biomass sources can best be produced, and there exists little understanding of the environmental impacts of large-scale land cover change for bioenergy production. My research advances understanding of how land use and global climate change combine to affect ecosystem functioning in the Midwest U.S. I use global vegetation models (DGVMs) to test the integrated effects of multiple global factors in combination with (1) year-to-year climate variability over multi-decadal timescales and (2) spatial variation in climate and soil properties at the regional scale. My research group is currently quantifying the potential effect of grasses grown for cellulosic ethanol on the Midwest U.S. hydrologic cycle. To evaluate the effects at a regional scale, we are using a model that we have developed to represent the growth of miscanthus and switchgrass: two perennial grasses proposed for use as bioenergy crops. Because we run the model over the entire U.S. Midwest and Great Plains, we are able to predict how regional variations in climate and soil will impact the productivity of these bioenergy crops. We hope to inform policymakers and stakeholders in identifying the most suitable and sustainable locations for large-scale production. We are also evaluating how future climate change might affect regional energy, carbon, and water budgets of U.S. agroecosystems by developing a vegetation model that will simulate the response of crops to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and surface-level ozone. We hope to not only predict potential changes in yield with climate change at a regional scale, but also to predict effects on water usage.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
672,"Giant ragweed is a native, annual plant species that is the most competitive weed in Midwest cropping systems. In Wisconsin, farmers consider giant ragweed as the most troublesome weed in corn and second most troublesome weed in soybean. Giant ragweed is a difficult to manage and persistent weed due in part to its extended emergence pattern (April to July), rapid and aggressive growth, and adaptation to a wide-range of cultivated and non-cultivated habitats. Its risk to crop production has increased further as several populations of giant ragweed in the U.S. have developed resistance to widely used herbicides, with some showing cross-resistance to more than one herbicide mode of action. In Wisconsin, giant ragweed with suspected resistance to glyphosate (Roundup herbicide) has recently been reported. Selection for glyphosate-resistant giant ragweed is an ominous development for Wisconsin agriculture as glyphosate is relied on extensively for weed management in corn and soybean. The goal of the research is to better understand the potential for additional selection, spread, and persistence of glyphosate resistance traits in giant ragweed populations. Outcomes/impacts will include a change in knowledge about giant ragweed resistance to glyphosate, illuminating a potentially serious threat to Wisconsin cropping systems. Results will contribute to a change in action towards giant ragweed management in glyphosate-resistant Roundup Ready crops. Results will convey the selection potential for resistance development, and should provide a strong incentive for crop producers (and other agricultural professionals) to adopt resistance management tactics that reduce or eliminate selection for resistance to glyphosate.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
673,"Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), introduced to North America by both the Native Americans and settlers from Mexico, Central America, and South America, has been cultivated in the U.S. for millennia. However, compared to corn, soybean, and wheat, the average national seed yield of dry bean is low (~1700 lbs/acre). In addition, several abiotic and biotic stresses can severely limit both dry and snap (vegetable form) bean production. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases are among the main production constraints, whereas drought, heat, soil mineral deficiencies, and short growing seasons, reduce productivity in many production areas. In order to remain competitive with other crops produced in the U.S., these production constraints need to be addressed. In spite of these limitations, beans are one of the most nutritious and healthiest foods, being the only item included into two different food groups in the USDA food pyramid. In addition to human health, beans promote soil and environmental health through biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen which allows beans to be produced with less N-fertilizer than other crops. Several diseases can be present simultaneously and reduce dry and snap bean yield and quality within and across different production regions. Yield losses can range from 10 to 90%, depending on the diseases involved and severity. Many of these pathogens are highly variable and new races or strains can appear in different regions. A recent example is the new rust races reported in Michigan and North Dakota. Many of these diseases are seed-borne, are caused by genetically variable pathogens, and cannot be economically controlled with chemicals (e.g., common bacterial blight). Fungicides increase production costs and can result in environmental and human health hazards if improperly used. This interdisciplinary, multi-state, collaborative W-1150 project proposal comprises several complementary sub-projects. Key collaboration among participants in these sub-projects is designed to achieve our overall goals and objectives of developing high yielding cultivars with enhanced culinary and nutritional qualities and resistance to major abiotic and biotic stresses. These cultivars will help reduce production costs and pesticide use, increase yield and competitiveness of the U.S. bean growers, and sustain production for domestic consumption and export. Researchers participating in each sub-project have complementary expertise and represent two or more institutions. This research scheme has been very successful as evidenced by the Excellence in Multistate Research Award given to the W1150 multistate project by the Western Association of Agricultural Experiment Station Directors (WAAESD) in 2009. For simplicity, these projects are grouped into the following priorities: (1) biotic stresses, (2) abiotic stresses and production/sustainability, (3) nutritional and health related benefits in the human diet, and (4) characterization/utilization of exotic germplasm.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
674,"Soybean is No. 2 major crop in South Dakota State, taking over 4 million acres of harvested areas and producing 1.2-1.6 billion dollars of economic values (138-176 million bushels of total production) per year. South Dakota ranks among top eight soybean-producing states in the America. However, South Dakota, being on the fringes of the U.S. soybean belt, faces unique environmental factors that negatively affect both of the soybean yield and quality. These factors lower the profitability of SD soybeans and cause increased production costs and decreased net returns for the state growers. Northern and western soybean production areas represent a major part of the increase in U.S. soybean production. Expansion and increase of soybean production in South Dakota and surrounding areas will significantly accelerate the overall U.S. soybean production. With strong support from multiple disciplines on and off campus, this project will directly address the concerns of soybean growers and meet their requirements in crop production, and help research community as well as higher education. Therefore, the this project will continue basic genetic research on soybeans and developing superior germplasm and varieties with high yield, high quality and improved resistance, to meet the needs of SD growers and soybean industries or markets. High-yielding varieties will possess not only high yielding potential, but also good stability and adaptability that include resistance to damaging pests in South Dakota, such as soybean aphids, soybean cyst nematodes, and phytophthora root rot, as well as tolerance to abiotic stresses. High protein and high oil are two aspects in quality improvement. Improved nutritional qualities will also target emerging markets for oils low in saturated fats and better cooking stability, such as mid-higher oleic acid, low linolenic acid, etc. The improvement of soybean, as a major food and oil crop worldwide, is relevant to the food safety and health of human beings. GMO varieties are based on and rely on conventional varieties and germplasms. This project will more emphasize the germplasm innovation and variety development of conventional soybeans, including specialty soybean for aquafeeds/fish meal, soymilk, Tofu, organic soybean, etc. in addition to Round-up Ready soybeans. Modern breeding approaches and novel techniques (e.g. molecular markers) will be used. It is expected that elite soybean germplasm and new varieties with unique/value-added traits will be developed and released, which will expand soybean markets and benefit soybean growers and research community.

675,"Corn for grain was produced on 640,000 acres and valued at ~$400M in NY in 2008. Obviously, grain corn contributes significantly to rural economies. Soybeans, which doubled in acreage and quadrupled in value in NY in the past decade, occupied ~260,000 acres and was valued at ~$100M in 2008 and 2009. Although corn and soybean farmers have recently received higher prices for both crops, the price of inputs, especially seed, has dramatically increased. Farmers paid ~$100 bag-1 about 10 years ago compared with the current ~$250 bag-1 for corn seed. This translates into increased seed costs from $40 to 100 acre-1. Compounding the increase in seed price is the general perception among growers and promoted by industry that new transgenic hybrids compared with older hybrids respond to very high plant populations. An increasing number of corn growers in NY now plant at 36,000 instead of the current Cornell recommendation of ~30,000 kernels acre-1, despite higher seed costs. Likewise, soybean seed costs have more than doubled from ~$25 to ~$55/bag, translating into a $30 acre-1 increase in seed costs. Many new soybean growers are planting with corn planters instead of grain drills, despite small-plot research that shows soybeans perform best in 7-inch row spacing in NY. Furthermore, there is no information on recommended soybean seeding rates for 30-inch row spacing in NY. In addition, many soybean growers are planting at rates more than 200,000 seeds acre-1 with a grain drill, significantly higher than Cornell's recommended 180,000 seeds acre-1. We propose to conduct small-plot research at Cornell's Aurora Research Farm as well as field-scale studies on leading growers' fields in western, central, and northern NY. We will evaluate seeding rates from 25,000 to 40,000 seeds acre-1 for corn grain with elite hybrids from Pioneer and DeKalb. In addition, we will evaluate seeding rates of elite Pioneer and Asgrow soybean varieties at 7, 15, and 30 inches at Cornell's Aurora Research Farm and on growers' fields in the same regions of NY. We believe that field-scale research on leading growers' fields will demonstrate to other farmers and agricultural practitioners that seeding rates of ~36,000 kernels acre-1 for corn grain is too high for growing conditions in NY, despite the drought and lodging tolerance of modern hybrids to high plant densities. We also believe that optimum soybean row spacing in NY is ~7.5 inches. If growers wish to plant with a corn planter at 30-inch row spacing to reduce the potential for white mold disease, we believe that seeding rates can be lowered to 150,000 seeds acre-1 or less. Results of the proposed research should temper industry claims, based on research results in the Midwest that new corn hybrids perform best at much higher seeding rates than currently recommended by Cornell. A unique problem that exists in NY but not in Midwest is that the dry-down period for corn harvest is much longer because of cool and cloudy conditions leading to increased lodging and disease problems (i.e. anthracnose stalk rot that current transgenic hybrids do not have a gene for resistance to)that are associated with higher seeding rates.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
676,"The soybean aphid is a native of Asia that was first discovered in Wisconsin in 2000 and has since spread throughout the northern soybean growing regions of North America. This aphid can build up to populations exceeding 1,000 per soybean plant and as a result can cause significant yield loss. In addition, the aphid is known to transmit several viruses that are pathogens of soybeans. Entomologists in the North Central Region of the U.S. responded quickly to this new soybean pest, and through cooperative research efforts established a management plan for this pest utilizing an economic threshold to guide decisions on insecticide applications. A major effort toward biological control of the soybean aphid was also launched, which has sought to import and establish  parasitoids  to help control soybean aphid populations. Parasitoids are tiny non-stinging wasps that lay their eggs in aphids, and the wasp larva devours the aphid and pupates within the aphid shell (known as a  mummy ). A new wasp then emerges and continues the cycle. There are two reasons parasitoids (rather than predators, the other type of natural enemy often used in biological control efforts) were targeted for importation and establishment against the soybean aphid: 1) parasitoids have a narrower range than predators and thus are very unlikely to result in unintended negative consequences; and 2) a number of predators, mainly lady beetles, are already providing some measure of control, but parasitoids of soybean aphid were largely absent in North America. However, we have observed an interesting phenomenon over the past few years in southern Wisconsin. Lysiphlebus testaceipes, a native parasitoid with an unusually broad host range of over 100 aphid species, has become increasingly abundant, to the point that in 2009 this parasitoid appeared to be limiting the increase of soybean aphid populations early in the growing season. Thus it is conceivable that Lysiphlebus testaceipes is adapting to take advantage of the availability of the recently introduced soybean aphid. However, little is known about Lysiphlebus testaceipes as a parasitoid of the soybean aphid. The goal of this project is characterize aspects of the biology of Lysiphlebus testaceipes in the north central U.S. (especially Wisconsin), and to assess the role the parasitoid plays in biological control of the soybean aphid. Specific objectives will investigate 1) the development and resulting sex ratio of Lysiphlebus testaceipes in relation to temperature, 2) the host range of Lysiphlebus testaceipes, including its preference for selected aphid hosts relative to the soybean aphid, 3) the dynamics of Lysiphlebus testaceipes field populations including the impact of the parasitoid on reducing soybean aphid populations, and 4) the aphid host species utilized by Lysiphlebus testaceipes to pass the winter (as a pupa within the aphid mummy).",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
677,"Since there are few novel herbicides with new modes of action being introduced today and resistance to currently available herbicide classes continues to increase, it is important to fully understand how to most effectively and efficiently utilize the herbicides currently available and take advantage of potentially beneficial synergistic interactions, such as interactions between HPPD and PS II or PPO inhibitors. If current programs that include HPPD inhibitors for weed management in corn select for HPPD-resistant waterhemp biotypes and populations, then a synergistic interaction between HPPD and PS II or PPO inhibitors would become even more important for corn and soybean growers. For example, it would be important to determine if waterhemp biotypes are only HPPD resistant or both HPPD- and triazine-resistant (or resistant to other chemistries as well), then design treatments to test if HPPD-PS II or HPPD-PPO synergistic interactions can overcome all types and mechanisms of herbicide resistance in waterhemp in a single plant. If this is not the case, then it may be necessary to further investigate interactions with other herbicide chemistries, such as HPPD-glufosinate, HPPD-dicamba, or HPPD-glyphosate tank-mix combinations, for weed management in corn and soybean. Knowledge gained from these studies will provide important, useful, and timely information that can be used for improved management of multiple-resistant waterhemp biotypes in corn and soybean, in particular with respect to the anticipated commercialization of HPPD-resistant soybean varieties in the near future. The unique ability to utilize a synergistic interaction between a corn-selective herbicide (HPPD inhibitor) and soybean-selective herbicide (PS II or PPO inhibitor) presents a novel method for management of multiple herbicide-resistant waterhemp as well as other problematic broadleaf weeds. In addition, this unique synergistic interaction would provide additional PRE and early POST herbicide options to increase the effectiveness and diversity of weed management programs for soybean growers in the U.S. Findings from these studies will be disseminated through paper and poster presentations to research scientists and plant biologists at the North Central Weed Science Society annual meeting, Weed Science Society of America annual meeting, American Society of Plant Biologists annual meeting, and to growers at the University of Illinois Agronomy Day in Urbana and AgMasters Conference in Champaign.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
678,"Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), introduced to North America by both the Native Americans and settlers from Mexico, Central America, and South America, has been cultivated in the U.S. for millennia. However, compared to corn, soybean, and wheat, the average national seed yield of dry bean is low (1700 lbs/acre). This may suggest that some market classes suffer from a narrow genetic base, or show some degree of inbreeding depression. In addition, several abiotic and biotic stresses can severely limit both dry and snap (vegetable form) bean production. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases are among the main production constraints (Beaver and Osorno, 2009, Schwartz et al., 2005), whereas drought, heat, soil mineral deficiencies, and short growing seasons, reduce productivity in many production areas. In order to remain competitive with other crops produced in the U.S., these production constraints need to be addressed. Several diseases can be present simultaneously and reduce dry and snap bean yield and quality within and across different production regions. Yield losses can range from 10 to 90%, depending on the diseases involved and severity. For example, in the Western U.S., Beet curly top virus (BCTV), Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), Fusarium root rot (caused by Fusarium solani f.sp. phaseoli) and wilt (caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. phaseoli), and white mold (caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), can simultaneously attack susceptible cultivars. Similarly, in Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, anthracnose (caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum), bacterial brown spot [caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Psp)], BCMV, common bacterial blight [caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli (Xcp) and X. campestris pv. phaseoli var. fuscans (Xcpf), Syn. with X. axonopodis], halo blight (caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola), root rots (caused by a fungal complex in most cases), rust (caused by Uromyces appendiculatus), and white mold can occur together and cause severe yield losses. The root rot pathogens cause serious problems in snap beans across all production regions. In addition, snap beans are vulnerable to regional epidemics of virus diseases including Beet Curly Top Virus (BCTV) in the intermountain west, and a new virus complex in the Great Lakes states which includes Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) in the southeast, and Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV), among others. Many of these pathogens are highly variable in many cases and new races or strains can appear in different regions. A recent example is the new rust races reported in Michigan and North Dakota (Markell et al., 2009, Wright et al., 2008). Furthermore, the introduction of soybean rust into the southeastern U.S. has serious potential implications for dry and snap bean as they are susceptible to the soybean rust pathogens, Phakopsora pachyrhizi and P. meibomiae. Many of these diseases are seed-borne, are caused by pathogenetically variable organisms, and cannot be economically controlled with chemicals.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Corn yields increased 8 fold and wheat yields tripled in the U.S. during the past century. Several studies have examined the contribution of plant breeding to this phenomenal increase in productivity, and, for both corn (2) and wheat (3), 50% or more of the increase in productivity has been attributed to genetic improvement of these crops. If we used 1920's era technology for today's corn production, the United States would need to plant over 120 million hectares of corn to meet the current annual demand for this grain.

680,"Climate change and variability, escalating costs of agricultural inputs, and growing competition for land, water and energy, and feeding increasing population with greater purchasing power are challenges facing agriculture in the 21st century and beyond. The future of agricultural production is critical to regional and national economies and to global food/fiber/energy security. In production agriculture, every season is unique, and the timing of the rain, temperature, and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation regimes combined with cultural practices, soils, and variety characteristics, the crop production and policy managers have more variables to consider than the human mind can reasonably organize. . With the availability of computers and a comprehensive knowledge of how crops respond to weather variables, decision support systems can be developed to assist in making production-management and policy decisions. Therefore, understanding crop responses to environment and management is pivotal in providing decision support for stakeholders such as farm managers, governments and planners to meet the food, fiber and energy needs of the growing world population. This project addresses our long-term goal of understanding the interactive effects of environmental factors on crops. Crops grown for food and fiber (cotton, corn, soybean and sweetpotato) and energy (switchgrass) grown in the US Midsouth will be our main focus. Despite many experiments on the effects of environmental factors including the changes projected in climate on crops, there are still few studies that have addressed and quantified the effects of a range of environmental factors to develop meaningful functional relationships for various growth and developmental processes for plants grown under realistic field-like conditions. We will investigate the effects of temperature, elevated atmospheric [CO2] and UV-B radiation, and other environmental variables on these crops to provide functional algorithms for improving existing crop models and/or developing new models. We will use an internationally unique system of sunlit chambers that allow the growth of tall crops under complete control of microclimate and atmosphere, with simultaneous precise monitoring of water and carbon balance throughout the life of the crop. The crop will be grown from sowing to specific growth stages under current and projected climatic conditions. Quantitative data on various growth and developmental processes will be measured, and functional algorithms will be developed for those processes. We intend to contribute our data to improve the performance of crop simulation models such as cotton (GOSSYM) and corn and soybean (DSSAT or CEREES-Maize), sweetpotato, and to assist in the integration of these crop models with that of the regional climate models. The improved cropclimate assessment tools can be used to assist producers for day-to-day production decisions and to assist policy makers in devising mitigation strategies to minimize the impact of climate change on food, fiber, and energy production in the coming decades.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
681,"Invasive species pose one of the greatest threats to natural and semi-natural plant communities and diversity, second only to habitat loss. Terrestrial weeds continue to evolve in association with the rapid global changes in our land-use systems and this is likely to be exacerbated by projected changes in our climate. Invasive weeds are estimated to cost the U.S. economy more than 37 billion dollars annually and this total is rapidly increasing, as greater numbers of invasive species become naturalized. Two invasive non-native plants that have become particularly problematic in agricultural, landscape, and natural settings in NY State and other NE States in the last 20 yrs are the perennial vines, pale swallow-wort (PSW) and black swallow-wort (BSW). The adaptability of the swallow-worts places many ecosystems and plant communities at risk including the globally-rare alvar communities (grasslands growing on thin soils over limestone bedrock). PSW is competitively displacing native plants and, consequently, is negatively affecting local animals and plants. The detection of PSW plants in no-till corn and soybean fields in central NY State is especially problematic given the difficulty in controlling these plants using common herbicides. Forest owners have also claimed that swallow-wort infestations are compromising forest regeneration and depressing land values. Control of the swallow-worts has been challenging, in part, because of limited information on their biology. Currently, we know little about what proportion of swallow-wort seeds remain viable in soil and for how long. Thus, we will determine the viability and emergence of PSW and BSW seeds sown in the fall of 2010 at three soil depths during each of four growing seasons (2011-2014) in a common garden experiment in Ithaca, NY. Microplots consisting of 120, 20-L plastic pots buried with the rim nearly flush with the surrounding soil will be used. Seeds will be placed in custom built screen bottom pans placed at the appropriate depth and then covered with soil. PSW and BSW seeds will be sown in separate pots. Germination rates will be estimated each year by monitoring seedling emergence monthly during the growing season. At harvest in the fall of designated years, remaining seeds will be extracted and counted. Intact seed will be assessed for viability. Findings from this research will confirm whether the swallow-worts have a limited and/or temporary seed bank (e.g. seeds remain viable for 4 years or less in soil). If so, then future control efforts should focus on suppressing vegetative growth with less concern for the long-term impact of seed production. Also, re-vegetation programs in affected areas would likely not be as costly and as time-consuming because of fewer and less expensive follow-up treatments since most seedlings would not be emerging over an extended period of time. Finally, this information will be valuable for biological control researchers interested in refining their selection of candidate biocontrol agents targeting these two species.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
682,"Camelina sativa (false flax) is an emerging Brassicaceae oilseed crop in the Great Plains and Pacific Northwest of the United States. The growing interest in camelina is due largely to its potential for biodiesel production in geographic areas that are not well-suited for soybean cultivation. We are also exploring the use of camelina as a platform for the production of lubricants, biofuels, and high-value industrial oils. Camelina is a good candidate to fill this niche because it is not widely grown in the US for food use. In addition, genetic transformation of camelina can be achieved by a simple floral vacuum infiltration of agrobacterium. With this method, metabolic engineering of camelina can be conducted in a rapid and non-labor intensive manner. To this end, a biotechnological pipeline will be generated to metabolically engineer camelina lines for improved fuel and lubricant properties (e.g. enhanced oxidative stability). The genetically enhanced camelina resulting from these studies will also have potential for generating new sources of rural agricultural income for the Great Plains.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
683,"It is well known that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA) have positive health benefits. Clinical trials have shown that this group of fatty acids reduces cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disorders, autoimmune disorders, Crohn's disease, and certain cancers (Conner, 2000). The American Heart Association recommends that consumption of 2-3 fatty fish meals per week would yield an amount of omega-3 FA that would have beneficial health effects. Fish consumption data suggests that Americans are still not eating the recommended amounts and that children under age 15 are consuming less than half the amount that adults consume (EPA, 2002; NMFS, 2007). Therefore, there is a need to develop foods high in omega-3 fatty acids more appealing to parents and children. Nutraceutical foods are defined as food products that resemble typical foods, but with added health benefits. Standard examples are milk fortified with vitamins A and D, flour enriched with vitamins and minerals, orange juice fortified with calcium or fiber, ice cream or bread fortified with omega-3 FA, soymilk fortified with DHA, infant formula fortified with DHA, and so on. The current market trend is that consumers are more often seeking health-beneficial and wholesome foods for themselves and for their families. The 21st century consumers are fully aware of health benefits associated with omega-3 FA. Similarly to organic foods, the sales of nutraceutical food products have steadily increased over the past decade and it is expected that this trend will continue. The main goal of this research is to develop nutritional foods that are high in omega-3 FA and would appeal to consumers. Development of foods containing higher concentrations of omega-3 FA are of interest because of their role in decreasing the risk of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity.

685,"Any improved management in alfalfa through new varieties, improved resistance to diseases, and improved forage quality will impact the total value of hay production. Also, indirectly, good hay quality will impact livestock producers rations cost and increase efficiency in their operation. Without continued investigation on management of annual and perennial forages production practices, the forage producers will not be able to stay competitive, switching to grow more profitable annual crops, such as corn-soybean rotation. The loss of alfalfa or other legume forages in the crop rotation will negatively impact the soil, reducing water quality, increasing C release to the atmosphere, and increasing operation cost. The bioenergy crop component of this project will generate decision-making information and crop production guidelines for growers in the near future when markets are open for crops dedicated to biomass production or as feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol.

These polices generally are enacted to enhance the development and increase the use of domestically produced, renewable energy. Currently, corn and soybeans are the primary agricultural feedstocks utilized for liquid transportation fuel production. It is unlikely that these crops will be sufficient to meet growing biofuel demands, particularly since the use of these crops for fuel competes directly with their use as food sources for humans and livestock. Thus, production of dedicated non-food cellulosic feedstocks will likely be needed to meet biofuel and renewable energy demands. Since the most productive soils will continued to be used for food production, bioenergy feedstock production will need to occur on marginal agricultural lands. This project capitalizes on the need to develop cropping systems that can be utilized on marginal land to produce cellulosic feedstocks for bioenergy production. Two potential crops, cottonwood and switchgrass, are being grown in three different areas of the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley in order to assess their ability to produce biofuel feedstocks in an ecologically sustainable manner.

687,"The general purpose of this research is to study the performance of agricultural commodity futures markets in price discovery and risk management for Louisiana wheat, corn and soybeans. In recent years, and particularly during the U.S. financial crisis, the convergence between futures and cash prices has been of concern to decision makers in the grain industry. The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), for instance, submitted its views to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2008, stating their concerns about  effective performance of futures exchanges as mechanisms for price discovery and risk management.  The AFBF's concerns were extreme price volatility, expanding and volatile cash/futures basis relationships, and the difficulty hedgers have of meeting margin calls (margins are the deposits farmers must keep with brokers to offset adverse futures market price movements). The AFBF expressed its belief in the importance of the functions of futures markets but requested more disclosure and transparency around the composition of traders in the markets and their impact on the price discovery and risk management function of futures markets. These concerns bring forth research questions of interest to the grain industry in Louisiana. Numerous questions arise, and some that are of immediate local interest are: is the convergence of cash and futures prices reliable Are basis forecasts reliable How useful are basis forecasts in setting local cash prices What is the dynamic interaction between speculative activity and price volatility Local grain elevators provide sellers of grain crops (producers) bids for various crops such as wheat, corn, soybeans and grain sorghum. Conditional on historical bid-offers, what are the chances that a producer will be offered a better bid This project proposes econometric and statistical models to provide a quantitative answer to such questions.

688,"The US economy is dependent on cheap oil, but recent high prices and our increasing dependence upon imported foreign oil must change. The increasing and somewhat volatile costs of petroleum-based fuels have created a great deal of interest across the US and in Alabama on alternative energy solutions. Biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel offer an attractive alternative and in Alabama crops like field corn, soybeans, timber, switchgrass and industrial sweet potatoes offer promise as a means to produce this biofuel and help our land owners. The technology to convert corn to ethanol is well understood and is a proven commercial success. However, maximum corn yields such as though in the Midwest are not readily obtainable in the southeast due to droughty growing season conditions. However, industrial (non-edible) sweet potatoes and trees are drought tolerant and well suited for our climate and soils. In addition, industrial sweet potatoes grow well on marginal land. Furthermore, three-year averages in Alabama have produced over 1,000 gallons/acre of ethanol from industrial sweetpotato grown dryland. Production of industrial sweet potatoes as a bioenergy crops could be very beneficial to farmers in Alabama but further research is vitally needed in order to develop a feasible system to make such an alternative reality. Those interested in pursuing these alternative solutions need information on equipment, techniques, and costs to successfully transition to providing feedstocks for the production of renewable fuels. One aspect of industrial sweetpotato production which limits large scale, sustainable production is the current manual labor required at planting. Research is needed to develop a total mechanized system of planting sweetpotato slips to replace the current mechanical transplanters. Typical transplanters plant four to six rows at a time but require excessive labor. Labor requirements for sweetpotato production are about 60 man-hours per acre which is currently too high to support the use as a feedstock for ethanol production. Machine automation can greatly reduce production costs while increasing the capacity of producers to expand their production acres to meet the demand of a biofuel production facility. Similarly, the forest industry is in great need to improve operation efficiency to remain globally competitive. There is a need to develop information technology systems that will lead to lowered production costs and improved environmental stewardship. Farmers have recognized the value of emerging precision techniques to their bottom line and drove industrial development of agricultural technology, but the process required many years and a great deal of research. Forestry is in a similar developmental stage in that there is a tremendous need for research to create the information and machine systems that will propel silviculture into the next technological age. The ability to evaluate the timber quality at is needed to maximize land owner return and the delivery of a consistent product to conversion facilities.

689,"Louisiana has had a dramatic decrease in slaughter plants from 1988 to 2010. Therefore, it is important to provide research that can help these remaining firms stay in business. One method for these firms and the numerous wholesale and retail meat outlets in Louisiana to increase profit is to purchase wholesale meat products from out-of-state venders and through fabrication and enhancement add value to their retail products. Value-added meat research can be defined as experiments leading to new information about meat which results in a significant increase in value. It can also be defined as work that demonstrates processing of raw materials to create a desirable product with enhanced value. One of the main methods to add value to raw meat products is enhancement. The three most common methods of creating an enhanced meat product are injection, soaking, and marinating. With enhancement, ingredient formulation is very important to develop new products that maximize flavor, tenderness, and yield. These ingredients can include salt, phosphates, ammonium hydroxide, sodium lactate, food starch, soy protein, sugar, seasoning and flavors, gums and others. The best combination of these ingredients should be used to give the desired moisture and texture for the product. The small meat plants in Louisiana can't compete directly with the large meat packing companies in other states but there is potential to increase their profit margin with product enhancement. Our research will address various aspects of fabrication and further processing of purchased product from out-of state venders that can be sold as Louisiana meat products which will have the potential to stimulate the Louisiana meats industry.

690,"About 60% of the fossil oil consumed by the United States is imported. This dependency for fossil oil on other countries is raising an enormous concern over this nation's energy security. An alternative way to the dependency of foreign oil is to develop biofuels, bioethonal and biodiesel, made with renewable materials produced domestically. However, most biofuel feedstock is derived from food crops, such as corn and soybean, which is not only expensive, but also limited because of the needs of human consumption. Therefore, alternative crops with low production cost is a requisite for a sustainable biofuel industry. Additionally, a winter crop with short growing season is needed for the double cropping system in TN. Camelina (Camelina sativa L.), an ancient oilseed crop, shows a great potential as an alternative winter crop for biodiesel feedstock in TN since it requires low inputs and matures in the early spring. Camelina oil can produce quality biodiesel, which has been successfully tested in jet engines. However, camelina biodiesel has relatively poor oxidative stability because of its high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acid component. Our long-term goal is to develop camelina as a bioenergy crop in TN. This proposal will focus on the introduction of camelina cultivars/lines with the adaptability in TN. High yield and oil content, suitable fatty acid profile for biodiesel, winter hardiness, and early maturity will be the major traits considered in this project. There are four specific objectives for this project: 1) evaluate all available germplasm to identify those lines most adaptable for TN and determine the extent of genetic variance for the future genetic improvement; 2) broaden the genetic variability and create new genotypes via mutation method, particularly for fatty acid profile, which has limited genetic variance among the germplasm; 3) initiate a breeding program to improve germplasm and develop elite lines/cultivars; 4) develop molecular markers for the traits of interested to speed up the breeding process. Discoveries generated through this project will be delivered to the scientific community at conferences and journal publications. The elite lines identified by this project is expected to fit into the double cropping system in TN, which will increase farmers' potential income and provide an inexpensive feedstock for biodiesel production. Because Camelina is a low input crop in that it does not require much fertilizer and water, it will reduce agricultural impacts on the environment.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
691,"Soilborne diseases, including charcoal rot, Phytophthora rot, Rhizoctonia rot, soybean cyst nematode, and sudden death syndrome, cause significant annual reductions in soybean yield in Illinois and throughout the soybean growing regions of the U.S. Yet soybean production usually relies on only three limited disease management strategies, crop rotation, resistant varieties, and fungicides. These methods all have limitations, and may not be useful for all diseases. Developing alternative soybean disease management practices would contribute to the development of sustainable disease management strategies, resulting in increased yield and yield stability. One strategy being evaluated in several cropping systems is the enhancement of the disease suppressiveness of soils. It has been clearly demonstrated that some soils are less conducive, or more suppressive, to disease development than are others, and that this disease suppressiveness characteristic can be manipulated. Increased levels of soil organic matter, through the incorporation of cover crop residues or direct organic matter applications, have been shown to affect the levels of root and foliar diseases in several cropping systems. Disease suppressiveness can be elevate through the enhancement of naturally present microorganisms, inhibition of pathogen activities, and stimulation of host defense mechanisms. The additions of various kinds of organic matter have been shown to affect disease levels, in some cases through direct impacts on soilborne pathogen levels, but more often through induced changes in soil microbial populations, which result in increased levels of disease suppressiveness of the soil. This project will evaluate the effect of manipulating the disease suppressive characteristic of a soil through practices such as the addition of organic matter, cover cropping and other soil management strategies. Such practices could be used to aid in the management of diseases for which crop rotation, disease resistance, and fungicides are not effective or available, or to supplement and extend the effectiveness of these other management strategies. Understanding the impact of disease suppressiveness on soil microbial populations and root system development could help in the development of better disease management strategies.

693,"Cereals such as maize are a major source of protein in the diets of humans and livestock but they are not a complete source since they are deficient in several essential amino acids especially lysine. Human protein deficiency disorders are common in developing countries where maize is used as a staple and in the U.S., mono-gastric livestock require supplementation in the form of soybean and/or purified amino acids. The zein storage proteins are devoid of lysine and tryptophan and since they account for 70% of maize endosperm protein, overall protein quality of maize grain is poor. Paradoxically, this high-level zein accumulation in protein bodies is central to vitreous endosperm formation; an essential trait underlying most of maize's functional grain properties. The o2 mutant has double the wild type levels of lysine and tryptophan since it accumulates low levels of zein proteins and high levels of non-zein proteins that impart a complete array of essential amino acids. o2 was not commercially developed due to the poor agronomic properties associated with its soft endosperm but subsequent breeding projects led to the development of hard kernel and high lysine o2 varieties called QPM. High yielding QPM varieties are being cultivated in many developing countries, where they are reducing protein deficiency disorders in humans and allowing more efficient livestock feeding. Despite the potential of QPM, it remains as an untapped resource in the U.S. and its future development and utilization has great potential impacts at the state, national and international levels. In the U.S. traditional QPM or novel engineered lines would improve the feeding efficiency in monogastric livestock and reduce the amount of supplementation and its associated costs. This would allow a higher percentage of soybeans to be used for other purposes such as processing for human protein sources and for biodiesel. A reduced soybean demand could also free up acreage for other crops. Breeding of QPM into elite hybrids is difficult because there are multiple unknown o2 modifier (QPM) genes, the recessive o2 mutation must be maintained and it has multiple negative effects. The work described in this proposal addresses each of these limitations and therefore has the potential to result in new, high yielding maize lines with high quality protein. The project will identify the nature and mode of action of QPM genes and target their utilization in, dominant low zein, high lysine transgenic lines. Unraveling the genetic basis of QPM should generate a renewed interest in its future breeding into elite lines as well as the development of biotechnologically optimized lines. Development of high lysine corn as value added and incentivized crop would require a renewed interest in these traits in the industrial sector and a radical revision in government subsidy and farming practices. However, if we are going to include improved nutritional quality and feeding efficiency in our priorities for meeting our food demands in the coming years, identifying and exploiting the molecular processes involved in crops such as QPM is an essential first step in the process.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
694,"Colon cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in the United States. Poor prognosis also makes it one of the deadliest cancers. Dietary factors are closely associated with tumorigenesis and development of colon cancer. Soy foods and soy bioactive components such as genistein have been linked to the lowered colon cancer incidence in populations consuming large quantity of soy foods. However the mechanisms by which soy products and soy bioactive components exert anticancer effects remain unknown. Because of the lack of scientific evidence on the mechanisms of soy foods' cancer prevention potentials, there are no nutritional recommendations made to Americans. In gut, multiple signaling pathways intertwine and delicately balance the rapid growth-maturation-sloughing off cycle of intestinal epithelium. Among them, Wnt signaling pathway is critical to the growth of epithelial layer. Because of its growth promoting effects, it is estimated that abnormal activation of the Wnt pathway is associated with 90% of colorectal cancer. Previous studies from others and my laboratory have established that: 1) Genistein regulates Wnt signaling pathway through specific Wnt genes; 2) Genistein induces DNA methylation of CpG at specific genes through maternal exposure; 3) Gene-specific hypermethylation or hypomethylation is closely associated with aberrant Wnt signaling in colon cancer; and 4) Genistein is reported to exert effects on histone modifications at specific regions of genome. Based on current knowledge of colon cancer development and preliminary data on beneficial actions of soy foods, the present study will test the hypothesis that dietary soy and soy genistein modulate colon cancer development through epigenetic programming at specific genes of Wnt signaling pathway. A maternal exposure model from rat will be used to study timing of exposure to dietary soy and genistein. We will examine how soy diets could modify the epigenetic codes so that the Wnt signaling is maintained at normal level and therefore chances of colon cancer development are greatly reduced. We will compare the effects of soy feeding at different stages of life and between generations. The concept of early life exposure for later protection of disease will be tested. By studying maternal exposure during prenatal period and lifelong exposure from conception to adult life, we will be able to illustrate the maximum protection from colon cancer development by soy and genistein. Findings from this project will improve our understandings on mechanisms of soy products at lowering colon cancer risk and facilitate the identification of molecular markers, especially epigenetic markers, associated with colon cancer.

698,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in men in the United States. Men with PCa do not die from the primary cancer, but rather from complications of metastasis when cancer cells invade other tissues such as bone, lymph, and lung. It has been suggested that different foods reduce the risk of PCa; however, people consume complex diets, and there is limited research on the protection offered by combinations of  protective  foods. Evidence suggests that soy foods or tomato products have anticarcinogenic properties, but little is known about the ability of these foods, alone or in combination, to reduce the progression and aggressiveness of PCa. The objective of the proposed project is to determine whether individual or combined consumption of soy and tomato products may reduce cancer progression in a mouse model for PCa. We hypothesize that the consumption of soy germ or tomato powder will reduce PCa progression and incidence of metastasis. Potential interaction effects of soy germ and tomato on PCa progression will also be evaluated. Diets containing tomato and/or soy germ will be fed to mice that genetically develop PCa and eventually display metastasis. Diets will be initiated at 12 weeks of age when all mice should have early stage PCa. For 6 weeks, mice will consume experimental diets and undergo weekly, non-invasive 3-D ultrasound imaging of the prostate. Tumor growth requires the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) to supply nutrients and oxygen to cancer cells. Through ultrasound imaging and targeted contrast agents, we will track dietary effects on tumor growth and angiogenesis throughout the progression of PCa. At the conclusion of the study, incidence of metastasis will be determined and markers of angiogenesis and cancer invasion will be measured. The long latency period between PCa diagnosis and potential metastasis provides an ideal window for dietary interventions; however, reduction of PCa progression and invasion by dietary interventions is largely under investigated. The proposed research will utilize innovative ultrasound imaging technology to investigate the extent and potential mechanisms by which tomato powder and/or soy germ may reduce PCa growth and metastasis.

699,"Hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) is one of the most promising species for the production of both bioproducts and biofuels in the US, as its rapid growth rates enable rotations of 3-15 years, depending on environmental and edaphic parameters and desired end products. While popular biofuels news has centered on ethanol from corn (Zea mays L.) and biodiesel from soybeans (Glycine max Merr.), recent studies indicate that hybrid poplar and switch grass (Panicum virgatum L.) provide the largest net greenhouse gas (GHG) sinks and biomass conversion to ethanol or biomass gasification for electricity generation as well as reduced GHG emissions compared to corn and reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.). However, poplar can have 10 times the total above ground biomass and resulting sequestered C as switchgrass. In addition to ethanol production, there are new technologies being developed to convert trees and their waste products into liquid transportation fuels (Herrera 2006). Regions of commercial hybrid poplar in North America include Canada (8,100 ha), the Pacific Northwest (17,025 ha), the North Central Region of the US (10,125 ha), the Mississippi Valley (11,350 ha), and the Atlantic Northeast (6,900 ha). Superior material for plantation establishment in North America is readily available for asexual propagation through vegetative planting of unrooted dormant stem cuttings or 'whips', although some species have poor rooting ability compared to others. Whether poplar plantations significantly contribute to the southwest?s future regiment of renewable energy resources will be primarily dependent upon the availability of plant materials characterized, not only by the excellence of their agronomic traits, but also by their adaptability to sites with elevated temperatures, high potential evapotranspiration, and of marginal agricultural quality including saline and/or sodic soils. Species and hybrids of the genus Populus are well suited as bioenergy feedstock due to their rapid growth, high C-sequestration capacities, extensive adaptation domain, ease of propagation, and relatively low water content compared to herbaceous bioenergy candidates.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

701,"Soybean is a key crop in the U.S., which supplies 35% of the world's production. In 2006, more acres of soybean were harvested in the U.S. (74.6 million) than acres of any other crop, including corn (70.6 million). Soybeans are produced in 31 states and 3 provinces in the eastern, central, and southern U.S and Canada, from Quebec to Florida, and Delaware to Nebraska. Given this large acreage and wide distribution, it is not surprising that soybean continues to suffer from insect pests that impact plant growth, grain quality, and yield. Whether it is a result of accumulated years in soybean production, changes in cropping practices, or global climate change, the distribution and impact of native and established pests is increasing in soybean. The populations of soil pests such as slugs, grubs, and millipedes, and foliar and pod feeders such as bean leaf beetle and stink bugs, are increasing in many regions. The distribution of other insects, such as Dectes stem borer and pyrethroid-resistant Lepidoptera (such as corn earworm), appears to be growing. Producers are encountering insect problems that they have never seen or managed. From a research standpoint, changes in pest distribution and status require greater understanding of pest biology and movement, as well as the development or modification of scouting and control methods. As in many other production systems, invasive species in particular are also an increasing issue in soybean production. In the northern U.S. and eastern Canada, the discovery of the soybean aphid (SBA) in 2000 fundamentally changed soybean insect management. SBA feeding impacts all components of yield; under heavy aphid pressure, yield differences between treated and untreated research plots may reach 50%. Outcomes/Impacts * Obj 2b. Success in classical biological control will reduce populations of, and yield loss from, SBA. A partial success could save producers tens of millions of dollars in control costs alone, with societal benefits of reduced human exposure, reduced non-target impacts from pesticide use, and slower formation of insecticide resistance. A better understanding of North American natural enemies and their conservation will have similar impacts as a partial success in importation biological control. * Obj 2c. The introduction of resistant varieties will reduce grower inputs by protecting yield and reducing outputs for insecticides. As a further result of reducing insecticide use, resistant varieties will lessen human exposure and non-target impacts, and eliminate or slow the formation of insecticide resistance. Management of SBA through the use of aphid-resistant varieties may also manage plant viruses through changes in aphid behavior. Further, host plant resistance is highly compatible with biological, cultural and chemical control of pests, and as such is a key component of soybean IPM programs.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

704,"It is recommended to separate peanut crops in the same field by four years. Shorter rotations open opportunities for a bevy of pest issues. Since peanut and soybean are both legumes and have similar disease problems, it is not recommended to include them in the same rotation. When comparing the acreage of the four most relevant summer agronomic crops in GA, the combined peanut + soybean acreage must stay at a certain fraction of the combined cotton + corn acreage in order for three or four year rotations between legumes to be sustainable. Therefore, alternative cropping systems for peanut must be investigated to alleviate such pressure and be able to maintain maximized yields and profits with minimized pest incidence and costs. Wheat acreage can also affect availability of peanut acreage. A double crop of wheat followed by peanut may be possible, but this puts peanut planting beyond the recommended planting window, which interferes with other crop planting activities, and creates a risk of peanuts not reaching full maturity when cool fall temperatures set in. Research is needed to determine how to distribute available acreage with proper rotations. The availability of research-based scientific decision support tools in peanut agronomics is lacking. To maximize yields and profits and minimize losses to pest outbreaks and input costs, growers need fast answers to questions. County agents and extension specialists need data to defend or alter current recommendations to be relevant with current cultivars available, which is what this project is designed to provide, centered on four primary objectives: I. Peanut cultivar response to agronomic practices. II. Managing cover crops for improved timing and sustainability. III. Fertility and nutrition issues for peanuts and preceding or succeeding crops. IV. Long-term rotational systems for effective and efficient land utilization. The most important factors in reducing input costs are agronomic management strategies, which are often the easiest strategies to implement. In peanut production, highly influential effects on yield and pest incidence include cultivar selection, tillage management, row pattern, seeding rate, cover crop selection and management, and soil conditions/plant nutrition. However, new cultivars are released each year with varying growth habits, pod and seed size, hull thickness, fertility requirements, and vegetation characteristics, which cause different responses to various combinations of these factors. Therefore, it is imperative to test new cultivars upon release to determine those that have greatest potential for seed increase and those less likely to improve on what is commercially available. So, experiments will be conducted to maximize peanut production with minimized inputs to improve farmers' profitability based on the variables listed above.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
705,"Plant diseases are major problems in plant production and there are many instances of pathogens moving to new geographic areas or even the emergence of new pathogen variants. Application of antibiotics or fungicides is the most common and effective approach to managing plant diseases. However, resistance of plant pathogens to antibiotics and fungicides has reduced disease control efficacy. Furthermore, physicians are concerned that plant pathogens pass their resistance traits on to other microbes. Therefore, development of novel antibiotics and fungicides for agriculture uses is in demand. Bacteria with antimicrobial activities can be found in suppressive soils, plant rhizosphere, or inside of plants. More than 50 bacterial isolates with broad spectra of antimicrobial activities have been obtained in Mississippi from disease suppressive niches. Some asymptomatic soybean plants can always be found in disease patches where almost all plants died of charcoal rot disease caused by the fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina. However, these plants have the same genetic makeup, grow under the same soil and weather conditions and have the same pathogen pressure. It is hypothesized that endophytic bacteria play a critical role in plant resistance to the disease. Specific objectives of the proposal include: (1) isolation and characterization of antimicrobial bacteria associated with suppressive soils; (2) analysis of antimicrobial activities of bacterial isolates; and (3) characterization of endophytic bacteria associated with soybean resistance to charcoal rot disease. It is expected that characterization and identification of these antimicrobial isolates will provide important clues to developing novel antibiotics and/or biofungicides that could be used for agriculture and the expected results will build the foundation to further understand the roles of these bacteria in disease resistance and to develop biologically-based approaches for plant disease management.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
706,"The brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB) is an invasive insect pest native to eastern Asia. BMSB feeds on a wide range of host plants and almost any crop with fruit can be at risk with the presence of BMSB. Crops at risk include fruits (e.g. apple, peach, pear, and berries), vegetables (e.g. tomato, pepper, and cucurbits), and field crops (e.g. corn and soybean). During the last three years, severe damage and economic losses by BMSB were observed in apple, peach, pear, corn, lima bean, soybean, and apricot throughout the Mid-Atlantic States. Specifically, high value crops are more prone to BMSB damage. Currently, insecticides are available to control BMSB (Nielsen et al. 2008) and new egg parasitoid wasps are being tested as potential natural enemies of BMSB. However, such control measures do not always provide an effective and economical BMSB control. Chemical control of BMSB has not been successful because BMSB outside of treated fields readily re-infest crops after insecticides are applied. Therefore, growers execute calendar-based insecticide spray, which is against the core concept of integrated pest management (IPM). Natural enemies of BMSB have been identified in Asian countries, but importation of the natural enemies will take multiple years to be available for growers in the United States. Although previous studies indicated that the spined soldier bug could be an important natural enemy of various stink bugs, much less attention has been given to the potential of the spined soldier bug. This project is designed to investigate the effectiveness of spined soldier bugs for controlling BMSB in fruit orchards, specifically for developing an IPM strategy by testing capability of spined soldier bugs to control BMSB and by investigating the effect of insecticides on spined soldier bugs.

In its native range of China, Korea and Japan, it is considered an agricultural pest of soybeans, tree fruit and various ornamental crops. Since its introduction into the United States around 1996, it has spread to numerous states, become a homeowner nuisance wherever it occurs and in the eastern United States, become a severe agricultural pest with little or no management options. Need: A rapid response to this issue is warranted given the heavy losses incurred by agricultural producers in the eastern United States during the last two growing seasons. Justification: The brown marmorated stink bug was first observed in the United States in Allentown, PA around 1996 but was initially misidentified as a native pentatomid species. Following correct identification in 2001, it has been found throughout the United States east of the Mississippi river and in Arizona, California, however, their usage is not currently labeled in the United States and therefore, is not currently an option.. We anticipate this project to have the following impacts: 1. The IPM tactics we propose to develop will be adopted by farmers in 23 states thereby potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of people through reductions in pesticide residues on field, fruit, nursery and vegetable crops. It would result in the cessation of illegal pesticide applications to control H. halys by farmers. Adoption of this program over large areas also has the potential to reduce the spread of this invasive insect to agricultural areas in other states not currently impacted by BMSB. 2. This project will result in economic benefits in the form of decreased monetary looses due to yield reductions caused by this insect. It will also result in increased time being available for marketing of the crop that would otherwise be spent managing this insect.

Objective 1: Develop new technologies that enable the commercial polymerization of vegetable oils into high value products. Objective 2. Develop commercially preferred industrial/automotive lubricants based on vegetable oil. Objective 3. Develop technologies that enable new, commercially-viable chemical processes for producing superior vegetable oil-based surfactants.Approach:   The approach to objective 1 will involve the use of a two step process. Strong acid polymerization catalyst used at relatively high temperatures will cause intermolecular polymerization of the double bonds of soybean oil. Catalyst studied will include trifluorsulfonic acid and fluorosulfuric acid, strong Lewis acids, such as aluminum trichloride, and heterogeneous catalysts such as aluminum doped titania or sulfated treated zirconia. In the second polymerization step, appropriate cross-linking agents will be used to expand the range of available materials to solid materials such as hard resins for composite panels, hydrogels and elastomeric materials for energy absorbing packaging. These polymers will be characterized by techniques such as NMR spectroscopy in order to find a large range of applications. The approach to objective 2 will involve a strategic combination of chemical modification, blending, and additive packages will produce vegetable oil-based lubrication fluids with properties superior to petroleum-based lubricants. The low stability of vegetable oil towards oxidation will be addressed by chemical modifications which remove the bis-allylic protons of the molecule while, at the same time, improve the poor low temperature flow properties of the oil. Nucleophilic addition of heteroatom-containing compounds will be performed on the activated substrates with the use of appropriate catalysts. For example, di-butyl phosphate can be added to epoxidized methyl oleate using zirconium doped titania as a ring opening catalyst, and aniline can be added to the same starting material. The approach to objective 3 will involve the formation of a new type of structure of branched surfactants which has not been previously reported in the literature. A sugar moiety will initially be connected to the fatty material by a precedented tosylation reaction which will be updated to a modern catalytic reaction. It will have hydrophile-lipophile balances suitable for use in water in oil emulsification and as wetting agents. Functional groups will be added to the surfactant using epoxidation and ring opening addition. This will change the suitability of these surfactants leading to potential application in dispersants and coating products. This surfactant material will have significant advantages over the currently used ethylene oxide based surfactants because traces of un-reacted ethylene oxide or dioxin byproducts will not be an issue. Also, because the soy-based monomer is large compared to ethylene oxide, a narrow range of molecular weight surfactants will be synthesized. Biosafety exempt.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Improve peanut grading processes by developing a rapid system for nondestructive determination of peanut kernel moisture from measurements on pre-cleaned samples and samples consisting of a mixture of pods and foreign materials. 4. Develop methods for monitoring water migration in almonds and other nuts and its effect on their quality by dielectric and spectroscopic methods.Approach:   Developing a cost-effective microwave system for rapid moisture measurement will require analysis of existing dielectric properties data to determine the optimum frequency and measurement parameters. From these results, microwave components will be specified, assembled into a low-cost rapid prototype, compared to a network analyzer, then calibrated and validated for moisture content of wheat, corn, soybeans, almonds, oats, sorghum, and barley. For peanuts, dielectric properties from 2 to 18 GHz on Runner, Spanish, Valencia, and Virginia will first be collected on shelled and unshelled peanuts. As with the other grains above, these data will then be analyzed to determine the optimum dielectric properties parameters and associated algorithms for a density- and variety-independent measure of peanut moisture content, and a prototype low-cost rapid peanut moisture measurement system will be developed. From these measurements and system development for peanut moisture content of shelled and unshelled peanuts, further development of a system to measure the moisture content of peanut kernels without shelling will be developed. Additional dielectric properties of both the unshelled and shelled kernels will be collected as needed, along with the moisture content of both the shells and the kernels. From these data, moisture algorithms will be developed. Additional dielectric properties measurements on unshelled peanuts with and without foreign material will also be collected for development of moisture models that are also independent of foreign material (trash). Models will be developed for both pod and kernel moisture contents. Besides kernel moisture content, meat content and percentage of foreign material are also important grading parameters. Attempts to correlate the dielectric properties data with these parameters will also be made. For almonds, since no dielectric properties data exists, fundamental dielectric properties measurements of almonds of varying varieties, growing locations in California, and moisture contents will be collected with a network analyzer. Correlations between moisture content and dielectric properties data will be developed. To investigate the dynamics of water migration in the almond kernels, known amounts of water will be sprayed on almond kernels of known moisture content, mixed, and then sealed in a Styrofoam box. The sealed box will then be placed between two horn-lens antennas for free-space measurement of the dielectric properties between 2 and 18 GHz at room temperature. Changes in the dielectric properties will be recorded over time as water moves from the almond surface to water in equilibrium inside the kernels. The next stage will be the use of these dielectric spectroscopic methods to monitor water migration inside the almonds under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature. In this instance, the water will permeate the almonds from the atmosphere for varying relative humidities from 20 to 80% in a controlled environmental chamber.

Biological control introductions against soybean aphid. 3.2 ? Biological control introductions against Russian wheat aphid. 3.3 ? Biological control introductions against cherry vinegar fly.Approach:   Safe and effective biological control depends on using narrowly host-specific agents, and host specificity depends on internal physiological state and previous experience, as well as ecological factors. Furthermore, the likelihood that a host-specific insect will evolve to attack a novel host species depends on the genetic architecture of host use. We will determine the behavioral and genetic bases for host shifts in the herbivores in the genus HELIOTHIS and aphid parasitoids in the genus APHELINUS using laboratory experiments on host use behavior and quantitative genetics/genomics analyses of inter and intraspecific crosses to map and identify genetic architecture. We will also test whether introduced aphid parasitoids have evolved to parasitize endemic species and whether aphid parasitoids resident prior to introductions have evolved to parasitize invasive pests. To do this, we compare host ranges parasitoids before and after introduction in laboratory experiments. Cryptic species are closely related species that differ little in the morphology, but differ critically in traits like host specificity, and studies on host range have often confounded cryptic species.

716,"Objective(s): Our overall objective is to maintain and improve grain quality and international competitiveness through the application of engineering principles. Most of our work concentrates on measuring properties of single kernels so that they can be segregated or the distribution of properties in a sample can be ascertained, versus measuring the average quality of a bulk sample. In general, the project will include the development of instruments to improve rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) measurement of grain quality at receiving stations, the development of non-destructive and rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) single-kernel sorting systems to improve post-harvest grain quality and similar systems to help grain breeders rapidly select specific traits for improved lines, and improve grain-storage and handling systems. Specific objectives are: 1. Develop sensors and methods to rapidly and accurately quantify attributes such as protein composition, starch composition, end-use quality, toxins, and micronutrients. 1.A.

Investigate insect-pest densities and commingling of insects in grain that causes the spread of an infestation from bucket elevator boots. 3.D. Develop monitoring systems for grain-storage quality management. 3.E. Develop improved, environmentally-friendly insect-pest control methods for stored grain. While the objectives of this project include pre-harvest (seeds) and post-harvest handling of grain, the work is interconnected in that the overall goal is to improve the quality of grain produced in the United States. Instruments developed to assess grain quality will be used to study how grain quality might change during storage and handling. An instrument previously developed by this group to detect insect-infested grain will be used to study the spread of insect infestations and the storability of grain based on insect population levels.Approach:   U.S. farmers grow over 15 billion bushels of corn, wheat, soybeans, and other grains annually to supply the nation and world with food, animal feed, and biofuels. A significant amount of this grain may be stored for a year or more before it is used or processed. Our goal is to improve U.S. grain quality and international competitiveness through the application of engineering principles, specifically to the areas of rapid (inspection results from at least 60 individual kernels per minute) quality measurement and in maintaining quality during storage. Much of our research concentrates on measuring the distribution of quality within samples, and on detecting traits that are present at very low levels. We propose to develop instruments to rapidly (up to 500 kernels/s) measure quality traits for inspection at the first point of grain delivery, for breeders in selecting traits for new lines, and for processors prior to grain buying or processing. We also propose to develop chemical-free technology to control insects and maintain quality during handing and storage.

This project focuses on discovery, evaluation, and establishment of classical biological control agents of selected agricultural pests in the U.S. Previous research continued into this project addresses as targets mirid plant bugs, soybean aphid, and brown marmorated stink bug; and a fourth target, spotted wing drosophila, has been added for evaluation of its biological control potential. New targets may be added at any time according to national need. To address objective (1) we will conduct foreign exploration in Asia and other regions as needed to discover, identify and evaluate the biology, ecology, and efficacy of exotic predators and parasitoids as classical biological control agents of the targeted pests. Agents discovered in exploration will be returned to our laboratory and identified using the best available morphological characters in conjunction with molecular sequence data, and evaluated in our quarantine facility for efficacy by measuring attack rates, reproductive output and development rates, and for host specificity by testing both close relatives to target hosts and progressively more distantly related species under choice and no-choice conditions. Objective (2) will address the role of environmental factors such as climate and photoperiod or inherent genetic variability in determining establishment success. Using a parasitoid of tarnished plant bug that established in some regions of the U.S., but not others as the model subject, we will characterize the genetic variability of populations established in the U.S. and their relation to genetic source populations in Europe. Also using lygus parasitoids, we will test the influence of differing environmental factors such as temperature, soil moisture and photoperiod regimes on parasitoid survival in environmental growth chambers and comparative field exposures. To address objective (3) we will prepare petitions for field release of qualified candidate agents of all target pests determined to be both effective and safe, based on satisfactory results of evaluation studies.

Determine the implications of glyphosate-tolerant soybeans on biodiversity and its contributions to biological control of soybean aphids.Approach:   Sustainable pest management ultimately involves applying ecological principles for reducing insect and weed pressure on key crops. Our project couples bottom-up and top-down processes to reduce key pests (corn rootworms, soybean aphids, and weed communities) of Northern Great Plains crops in agronomically feasible ways that mimic those that regulate pest species within natural habitats. In corn, we will identify lines with natural resistance to rootworms, and will find quantitative trait loci to facilitate their use by seed companies. We also will incorporate winter cover crops into corn production systems in ways that encourage endemic predator communities and increase their impact on rootworms. Fitness-related traits that influence the evolution of rootworm resistance to Bt corn will be identified, and this information will be incorporated into insect resistance management decision-making tools in order to preserve this pest management technology. In soybean, we will discover new soybean lines that express resistance to a key pest, the soybean aphid. Simultaneously, we will determine how to manage non-crop vegetation within soybean fields to promote aphid natural enemies. Weeds are well adapted to current crop rotations, and our research will optimize crop rotations using population-centered approaches that break the weed cycle and increase the impact of insect granivores on weed seedbanks, especially within organic systems. The simultaneous development of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms for pest management are incorporated into sustainable and integrated pest management systems to provide producers with profitable pest management solutions that can be realistically implemented on their farms.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

723,"Objective(s): Objective 1: Characterize the influence of zinc and iron concentrations in edible crop tissues and crop species on the bioavailability of crop cadmium to animals (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 2: Characterize the potential transfer of soil lead, arsenic, and other trace elements by vegetable crops grown on element enriched urban and orchard soils and develop methods to prevent this transfer. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 3: Characterize genetic resources and inheritance of grain Cd to reduce cadmium in durum wheat, flax and soybean. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 4: Evaluate information about the risk from Cd in foods to support public decisions for foods of both plant and animal origin. (C1; PS 1.F). The ultimate goals of this Project Plan are to improve the science about risk of heavy metals in soils and crops in order to obtain improved regulatory limits for Cd in crops under Codex, and the information needed to provide improved advice about the risk of Pb in urban garden soils and crops. Essentially all human Cd disease from soil Cd has resulted from paddy rice grown on fields contaminated by mining or smelter emissions. Garden vegetables and other grains have not been found to induce Cd disease in highly exposed populations who grow crops on highly Cd+Zn contaminated soils. Some Europeans want to set crop Cd limits based on ôattainableö levels rather than on the basis of potential risk to consumers. Such non-risk based standards will harm U.S. growers of durum wheat, sunflower kernels, flax, soybean, and some other crops. If crops must contain lower levels of Cd to win importation by other nations, both soil treatments, selection of soil series which produce lower Cd crops, and improved cultivars which accumulate lower amounts of Cd will contribute to growers needs. Providing a clear technical basis for the bioavailability of Cd in different crops appears to be the central issue which could change the demand for lower limits for crop Cd, and protect growers from unnecessary costs to produce lower Cd crops which may have no benefit. Only animal feeding tests can provide valid information about the bioavailability of crop Cd to animals, and the concentrations fed must represent levels in foods rather than toxic levels fed in most previous research. Because Zn is usually greatly increased in crops (except rice) when Cd is increased, the presence of Zn may substantially reduce the bioavailability of crop Cd, alleviating presumed risk of crop Cd. Because commercial carrots were found with higher than normal Pb concentrations when grown on historic orchard soils, U.S.-FDA requested that ARS examine the basis for carrot Pb accumulation and to learn if agricultural amendments can reduce carrot Pb when they are grown on high Pb soils. Certain root crops have xylem elements growing through the edible storage root, so if Pb is trapped within the xylem during normal growth of the crop, it will be in the edible root. But such Pb might have much lower bioavailability than the Pb-acetate used to establish diet Pb risk; 2-10% of food Pb is absorbed, while 60-80% of soluble Pb in water is absorbed by human volunteers.  Approach: Characterize the influence of zinc and iron concentrations in edible crop tissues and crop species on the bioavailability of crop cadmium to animals.  Zinc incorporated in lettuce reduces weanling rat absorption of lettuce Cd.  Using controlled chelator-buffered nutrient solutions (similar to Kukier and Chaney, 2002), Romaine lettuce will be grown to contain basal and sub-phytotoxic concentrations of foliar Zn (25 and 450 mg kg-1 DW), and the Codex Cd limit (4 mg Cd kg-1 DW); the high Zn represents maximum Zn levels normally present if lettuce is grown in acidic soils with geogenic Cd+Zn contamination at the beginning of yield reduction due to Zn phytotoxicity. Fe concentration in lettuce is tightly controlled genetically, but lettuce can supply higher bioavailable Fe than the marginal AIN diet, and thus plant Fe can reduce Cd bioavailability. The lettuce will be fed to weanling rats following the protocol of Reeves and Chaney (2004) in which American Institute of Nutrition (AIN) purified diets with marginal or adequate Fe-Zn-Ca were fed. The basal and high Zn lettuce will be mixed with both the marginal and adequate diets and fed for 28 days without radioisotope labeling used previously. At autopsy, the liver, kidney and duodenum will be removed for analysis. Tissues and blood will be tested to establish Fe status of the test animals. The tissues will be digested in HNO3, and Cd, Zn and Fe levels measured by ICP-Atomic Emission Spectrometry or ICP-Mass Spectrometry. Eight replicate rats will be fed each diet to accommodate the natural variation in such feeding tests (Reeves and Chaney, 2001).   If the lettuce experiment shows a strong effect of crop Zn on crop Cd bioavailability, other crops may be studied using a similar approach (durum wheat; soybean).",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Enable reduced N2O emissions from fertilized cropping systems through improved understanding of controlling mechanisms, as a contributor to the ARS Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network (GRACEnet).  Approach: Field experiments will be conducted at three locations, each using 3 treatments: zero, intermediate, and full stover removal. We will measure soil organic carbon (SOC) changes and gas exchange. Research will also be conducted at the UMNÆs Rosemount Research and Outreach Center (ROC) and on private farm fields in MN. Research at Rosemount will take place in two 20 ha fields with similar soil types, one managed as a conventional corn-soybean rotation; the other in a corn-soybean rotation, but with winter rye cover crop seeded by helicopter in late summer. Latent and sensible heat flux and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 will be measured by eddy covariance. Yield and ancillary soil, physiological and micrometeorological variables will also be measured for 4-years. Soil sampling for SOC analysis will be conducted biennially. Data will be used to test a model of rye production and water use (RyeGro). Field research will also be conducted at Rosemount MN and Arlington WI, supplemented by greenhouse research in St. Paul. Four treatments will be evaluated using a completely randomized design with 3 replications: (i) control, (ii) biochar, (iii) biochar plus manure, and (iv) manure. Biochar will be applied at 20,000 lb ac-1. Three other biochar treatments, derived from macadamia nut, wood pellet, and lump hardwood charcoal, will also be evaluated. Biochar production temperatures will be varied according to constant heating time and thermal time equivalency tests. Experiments will be conducted to examine impact of post-processing of biochar by thermally or chemically activation. All biochars will be analyzed for elemental composition, surface area, thermal stability, and CEC. Incubations will assess the impacts of biochar amendments on GHG production. For the greenhouse studies, 5 different specialty crops will be investigated with respect to biochar impacts on germination, growth, and uptake of volatile chemicals. Lab incubation experiments will be conducted to evaluate the inhibition of ammonium and nitrite oxidation rate due to the presence of free ammonia and free nitrous acid. Three different soils used for corn production in MN, IA, and eastern Canada will be examined. The methods will be adapted from procedures used to quantify nitrification inhibition kinetics in wastewater. Parameters obtained in the lab experiments will be incorporated into previously developed nitrification and N2O emissions models that account for both steps of nitrification, N2O production pathways, microbial N2O reduction, and gaseous diffusion. Plot experiments will be conducted over two consecutive growing seasons at the UMN ROC in Rosemount, MN in long-term research plots split into subplot treatments.

Approach: Biochemical analyses will be used to distinguish between labile and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter to improve the knowledge base regarding the effects of residue management on short-term soil processes (nutrient cycling, soil structure, and crust formation) and long-term carbon sequestration. This basic knowledge will then be applied to current production problems associated with providing sustainable supplies of bioenergy feedstock and enhancing grain yields to help meet ever-increasing food and feed demands. Utilizing corn, soybean, and small grain (i.e. rice, rye, and wheat) cropping systems, soil management practices to increase corn growth and grain yield will be evaluated in multiple field experiments. Various single-pass corn stover harvest and crop management strategies, cover crops, crop rotations, and tillage intensity will provide the crop production systems within which soil quality will be measured and the chemical nature and cycling of soil organic matter fractions will be quantified using seasonal analyses of amino acids, amino sugars, carbohydrates, phenols, and fatty acids. Effects of soil aeration on the decomposition of crop residues and the subsequent quality of soil organic matter, efficiency of nitrogen (N) cycling, and crop grain yield will be quantified in these experiments. The soil biochemical measurements coupled with soil physical process measurements will be used to augment the knowledge base related to soil quality assessment at plot scales for potential extension to field scale assessments.

726,"PI: Jay Thelen (University of Missouri-Columbia)CoPIs:  Dong Xu, Dmitry Korkin (University of Missouri-Columbia)Seeds are carbon- and nitrogen-dense structures that serve as the (plant) propagule and the (human) socioeconomic foundation for modern agriculture.  Genetics and environmental conditions dictate the developmental program that ultimately determines both seed yield and composition, although the underlying regulatory proteins and mechanisms are only now beginning to be understood.  Regulation of seed development has recently focused on transcriptional and epigenetic control of both embryogenesis and maturation.  From a biochemical perspective, few regulatory processes take place within a cell without direct or indirect involvement of proteins, and protein-protein interactions.  The nucleus and cytosol are the major locations for transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation.  A quantitative inventory of the proteins involved in these processes and their interactome network, would be a valuable resource to develop testable models for regulatory control of embryo maturation.  The main focus of this project is the parallel characterization of nuclear and cytosolic protein interactomes from developing embryos of soybean and rapeseed using a combination of biochemical, proteomic, and bioinformatic approaches.  The major objectives of this project are to: 1) systematically and quantitatively analyze protein-protein interactions from cytosolic and nuclear fractions of developing embryos from soybean and rapeseed using a multi-dimensional biochemical strategy that includes protein crosslinking, co-sedimentation, and quantitative mass spectrometry; 2) perform bioinformatic and statistical analyses of potential interacting proteins using data from aim 1 for comparison between soybean and rapeseed, and develop generic protein complex identification tools for such data; and 3) disseminate software, proteomic and protein interaction data by deposition into extant databases (PRIDE, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/; Database of Interacting Proteins, DIP, http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/; Soybean Knowledge Base,  http://soykb.org) and develop a new web database.While the research project targets the protein interactome in developing soybean and rapeseed embryos, it has broader significance for studying plants (especially crops) in general.  This study will greatly enrich the data describing plant protein interactions, which is currently limited.  These data can be used as a template for studying protein interactomes of other plants.  Besides the data and their analyses, the techniques and bioinformatic tools that will be developed can also be applied to study interactomes of other species; in particular, experimental protocols and bioinformatic tools (including source code) will be made freely available to the public.  The project will provide critical interdisciplinary training in plant biology, proteomics, and bioinformatics for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars.  Current discipline-based education provides very limited training on integrating biology, biotechnology, and bioinformatics, which is often needed in large-scale biological projects.  This project provides a problem-based, interdisciplinary environment to provide training in this regard.  Students and postdocs will be mentored in scientific writing, scientific presentations, publishing, grant applications, constructive peer review, project management, time management, and personnel management in an effort to direct the next generation of scientists towards the realistic and professional expectations of modern academic or commercial research.

727,"PI: Daniel Szymanski (Purdue University) CoPIs: Mark Hall, Daisuke Kihara, Jun Xie (Purdue University) There is a strong need for systems-level data sets that enable a more efficient translation of basic knowledge into improved crop traits. Information on protein complex composition is one such example, but resources for crop plants are lacking. This project proposes a novel mass spectrometry-based method to solve endogenous protein complexes in soybean. The results will serve as hypothesis-generating machines for the reverse-genetic analysis of a major crop. The approach couples multiple chromatography separations of cytosolic extracts with quantitative label-free mass spectrometry of the column fractions. The relative abundance of the proteins across the purification scheme will be used to cluster co-purifying proteins into groups that reveal protein complex composition. Unlike other large-scale, protein interaction techniques, this new approach is simple to experimentally validate using existing mutant collections. This inexpensive technique does not require gene replacement technology, large-scale gene cloning, or targeted purification strategies. To establish the effectiveness of this method, the investigators will pursue three research objectives: 1) to predict and validate the composition of 100 endogenous protein complexes isolated from leaf cytosol; 2) to use bioinformatics and existing  omics  data sets to predict and evaluate models for protein complex composition; and 3) to determine if the compositions of cytosolic protein complexes are conserved in Glycine max.   Although mass spectrometry has been used extensively in proteomics research, to the investigators' knowledge the proposed strategy for large-scale protein complex prediction has not been done. Successful completion of this work will provide broadly useful results, databases, and reagents that will reveal the composition of endogenous protein complexes. This deep analysis of the cytosolic proteome will provide an important data set that enables crop scientists to further modify proteins and pathways with the goal to improve crop productivity. The Purdue Initiative on Plant Protein Interactions (PIPPI) will provide broad impact by reaching diverse audiences through such activities as research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows; and a website providing data on plant protein complexes for researchers. Students will gain skills collaborating in diverse university research environments, be exposed to cutting-edge research in plant proteomics, and develop leadership and organizational abilities by assisting with project management, research design, and data release.

728,"PI: Wayne Parrott (University of Georgia)CoPIs: Tom Clemente (University of Nebraska-Lincoln), Gary Stacey (University of Missouri-Columbia), and Carroll Vance and Robert Stupar (University of Minnesota-Twin Cities)Soybean is the world's largest single source of vegetable protein and edible oil and thus a key crop for meeting the nutritional needs of the increasing global population. Therefore, a thorough understanding of soybean genetics will be important for the development of new soybean varieties to meet the nutritional, environmental, and industrial requirements that soybean will fulfill over the coming decades. There are many research tools available that facilitate the genetic study of soybean. However, there has been one resource notably absent for soybean - reverse genetic tools. These tolls provide a way to identify and determine the function of soybean genes of academic, biological, or agricultural importance. Therefore, the long-term goal of this project is to build upon previous funding to develop and distribute the resources to needed to investigate the function of soybean genes, especially those involved in soybean quality and yield. The primary objective of the project is to provide novel mutant plants for soybean functional genomics research. This goal will be accomplished by building and cataloguing a collection of soybean insertional and gene activation mutants derived by engineering soybeans with a transposable element from rice which naturally moves around the genome and inserts itself into other genes. When the transposable element inserts itself into soybean genes, it prevents the gene from functioning which in turn can alter the appearance of the plant, or can be detected in the laboratory. Fast neutrons will also be used to derive additional mutations, as fast neutrons delete genes altogether, also changing the plant's appearance. The change in appearance that results from disrupting or deleting a gene is a direct indication of that gene's function.All of the genetic stocks developed by this work will be made available to the soybean research and breeding communities upon request. To aid in identifying and distributing mutant plants, interested researchers will attend workshops where they will search for mutants that are relevant to their research programs. Besides the basic research community, soybean breeders also will benefit directly, by gaining the ability to make informed decisions about which genes to select for in order to more easily develop higher-yielding, disease and stress resistant soybean varieties.

These chemical defenses include well-studied molecules like caffeine in coffee and capsaicin in hot peppers. However, less than 10% of the metabolites in any given plant species have been identified. Many defense-related compounds are absent in non-stressed plants, but accumulate locally to very high levels following attack. The targeted identification of these small molecules, which accumulate in response to infection or herbivory, will result in the discovery previously unknown plant defenses. In the current project, defense-induced metabolites will be identified in four well-studied plant species, maize, soybean, rice and Arabidopsis. By focusing on these key species, it will be possible to make use of well-developed genetic tools and an extensive body of prior research to speed the discovery genes and pathways that are required for the synthesis of previously unknown plant metabolites. The defensive functions of the newly identified plant genes and metabolites will be confirmed with insect and pathogen bioassays.Broader Impacts: Analysis of induced defenses in plants will lead to the identification of previously unknown molecules that have practical applications in the control of pests and diseases. A mechanistic understanding of natural plant defenses will enable targeted trait improvements that reduce energy inputs and the use of agricultural chemicals, which are required when cultivating plants for food, animal feed, and biofuel production. Interactions between American and Japanese scientists will be enhanced through this highly collaborative research project. Samples for analysis will be exchanged between research teams, scientists from the US will receive training in Japan, and undergraduate students from Japan will participate in a well-established undergraduate research program at the Boyce Thompson Institute.

However, genetic improvement of soybean is beset by a lack of genetic diversity leaving soybean open to threats of pests, pathogens and abiotic stresses. This project will develop a set of tools that will allow investigators to leverage the recently released draft soybean genome sequence to exploit genetic diversity in the genus Glycine and to begin to understand the nature of species/genome diversification in the genus. Important in this process is an understanding of the cycle of polyploidization followed by diploidization found in this set of species. The specific objectives are to: 1) overlay diversity maps onto the soybean genome sequence using genomic clones from a set of phylogenetically informative Glycine species; 2) explore genome evolution in the genus Glycine at the chromosomal/sequence level to understand the polyploidy/diploidization cycle; 3) sequence targeted orthologous regions across the Glycine species in order to understand levels of linkage disequilibrium and genetic diversity that can be exploited for genetics and breeding; and 4) integrate data with other legumes which is necessary to extend its usefulness to other so-called  orphan  legumes such as common bean. The broader impacts of this project will be the development of an infrastructure that will be generally accessible by the broader legume community to exploit diversity and understand genome evolution in this economically important genus. The project will continue and expand a successful outreach program targeted toward Native American and Hispanic undergraduate institutions in the Southwest (primarily New Mexico and Arizona) to provide summer research training opportunities and further develop interactions with these faculty and students.

731,"The primary goal of this project is to increase in-class research using data that have local/global relevance, utilize modern technologies and computational approaches, and integrate molecular and organismal biology. Data on the soil bacterial communities present in corn and soy (industrial and organic) agroecosystems are collected using next generation sequencing technology. These data are then used to develop full courses and modules for courses ranging from introductory/core courses (that also serve non-majors) to upper-level electives. In each course, while the hypotheses addressed and the tools used to address them differ in content, they are complementary to each other and illustrate the power of using an interdisciplinary approach to science. For example, students in one course examine community differences in species composition while in another they look at how the communities differ in terms of metabolic pathways. Knowledge surveys are used at the beginning and end of each course. Comparisons within and between courses evaluate changes in student perceptions and learning over the short and long-term. Each module also includes a summative assessment in the form of an analysis of students formal papers or presentations and an evaluation of the students' abilities to use the tools involved and to interpret the results they generate.  Intellectual merit: Students exposed to this project have a fresh appreciation of the complexity of the soil biome, especially as they pass through the midwestern landscape dominated by corn and soy. They gain first-hand knowledge of bacterial prevalence, diversity, and importance. They use real DNA sequences to identify organisms, to find out what biological processes are occurring in the soil, and throughout use computer programs to organize, query, and analyze the data. Faculty and students collaborate to write results for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The data are helping to answer such questions as: How do different crops and different agricultural practices influence soil bacterial communities? Are some potentially harmful bacteria facilitated or are important nutrient pathways absent depending on the agroecosystem?Broader Impacts: The team includes a broad array of faculty, institutions and students so the project acts as a test site for the strength of such breadth. The faculty team for this project includes evolutionary ecologists, molecular biologists, a biochemist, and a computer scientist spread across two institutions, only four miles apart, that have different missions and serve different populations of students. One institution is a residential liberal arts college (Earlham College) and the other a branch of a state university (Indiana University East). The students and faculty at both institutions interact in course preparation, research, and the sharing of results. These interactions expose students to a greater range of faculty and faculty to a greater range of students, as both institutions work together to transform their curricula.  The project also increases the ways by which underrepresented groups can participate in research; IU East enrolls a high proportion (~40%) of first-generation college students and the McNair program at Earlham College promotes the involvement of underrepresented groups in research.  In addition, most of the course materials are organized as modules that can easily be adopted without a major change in the structure of established courses.  The data and modules developed are being made freely available and actively disseminated, via new and already established repositories for teaching resources, and also through presentations at research and teaching workshops and national meetings.This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

The proposed innovation is a microbially-based process to economically produce HQSPC by converting soybean carbohydrates into protein, yielding the exopolysaccharide for pellet binding and the immunoprophylactic for enhanced health. Our preliminary data indicates that the proposed microbe will metabolize individual carbohydrates in soybeans. To demonstrate technical and commercial feasibility, extrusion and enzymatic saccharification will be used to solubilize carbohydrates in soybean white flake, followed by incubation with the gum-producing microbe and recovery of solids for use in yellow perch feeding trials.The broader commercial impacts of this research include the development of a plant-based protein source to replace fishmeal in aquaculture production systems. Increased demand for fish protein and reduced wild-captured fish has facilitated rapid growth of the aquaculture industry. This growth has dramatically increased the demand for fish meal, the primary component in aquaculture feeds, causing overexploitation of this resource and rapidly escalating prices up to $1,800/ton. There is a considerable market opportunity for a high quality, economical plant derived protein concentrate to completely replace fish meal in aquaculture feeds, thus providing broad impact.

734,"Cyst nematodes are parasitic roundworms of plant roots that cause severe yield and quality loss in many agricultural systems.  In the US, the soybean cyst nematode is the most serious pathogen problem in soybean production.  Only very limited control options for these plant pathogens exist and further research into their biology is needed to uncover novel control targets.  In order for cyst nematodes to be successful, they need to be able to completely change their host plant at the cellular and physiological level.  At the heart of these changes are massive alterations of plant gene expression patterns under the control of the nematode, i.e., these plant parasites are able to reprogram plant cells for their own benefit.  It is unknown how cyst nematodes are able to do this, but the investigators will use the model plant Arabidopsis and the beet cyst nematode to explore a new mechanism that they have shown to be involved in cyst nematode parasitism, namely the effects of plant microRNAs (miRNAs), which are powerful regulators of gene expression.  The investigators will characterize four miRNAs that they have shown to be active at the site of nematode infection and they will identify additional regulatory RNAs.  As a result, the scientific community will gain understanding of cyst nematode parasitism and, more importantly, this project will identify potential avenues to interfere with cyst nematode parasitism with the goal to engineer crop plants that are resistant, which would eliminate billions of dollars in yield loss world-wide.  Broader impacts are the training of young scientists as well as an involvement of high school teachers who will produce a training video module on cyst nematodes, which will be an eye-opening teaching tool for students of all backgrounds.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
735,"Improving crop plants can be accomplished by creating hybrids.  Some hybrids, like mules, are sterile, because the parents have different chromosome numbers.  In plants, some sterile hybrids can become fertile when their chromosome number is doubled, a process called polyploidy. Many important crop plants, such as alfalfa, cotton, potato, and wheat are recent polyploids while others, such as maize, soybean, and cabbage, retain the vestiges of ancient polyploid events.  This project will investigate how polyploidy can give rise to novel traits, such as the resistance to insects, in the order Brassicales (broccoli, mustards, capers, papaya, and relatives).  The investigators of this project have developed new phylogenomics methods that allow one to understand the evolutionary history of how species are related while simultaneously determining whether or not they are polyploid.At a time when rapid global changes are placing unprecedented pressure on plants in agricultural and natural landscapes, it is imperative that scientists think beyond a single discipline. Phylogenomics has emerged as an interdisciplinary approach in the biological sciences; however, there are few opportunities to learn the genomic and bioinformatics tools becoming required in biology.  To address this gap, this project will develop modules for undergraduate courses; create an interdisciplinary research environment that uses computational methods; and engage in outreach to systematic biologists by annual workshops.

736,"PI: Whitehead, TimProposal Number: 1236120Institution: Michigan State UniversityTitle: Solving a Sticky Problem: Understanding Enzyme Binding to Lignocellulosic Biomass during Biofuel ProductionBiological-mediated conversion of cellulosic biomass to useful fuels and chemicals is a promising avenue towards energy sustainability. A critical impediment for this avenue is the cost of the cellulase enzymes needed to deconstruct biomass to fermentable sugars. At the current cellulase-to-substrate loading the cost per gallon of fuel produced from lignocellulose would still be at least an order of magnitude higher than the enzymes required to degrade starch, even if the enzymes could be produced as cheaply as soy protein. One strategy to reduce enzyme requirements is to recycle the cellulases in a continuous process, but enzyme inactivation during biomass saccharification severely limits this approach. PI?s recent findings show that enzyme inactivation occurs through non-productive interactions with residual lignin (i.e. the cellulases adsorb to hydrophobic lignin surfaces hastening their denaturation) for most pretreatment chemistries and biomass sources.The PI hypothesizes that minimizing the potential of mean force between the cellulases and lignin polymer will reduce surface adsorption between the two, hence minimizing enzyme inactivation. Thus, the primary objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that selective variation of cellulase surface chemistry can decrease lignin-mediated inactivation due to reduced protein surface adsorption to lignin. The hypothesis will be tested by using computational protein design to identify mutations that result in different enzyme surface potentials predicted to minimize enzyme-lignin adsorption, and then genetically program these mutations in two representative cellulases from the workhorse microbe Trichoderma reesei. A large number (ca. 1000) of cellulase variants will be recombinantly expressed and screened for solubility and activity on cellulosic substrates. Surviving variants will be tested for retention of structure, solubility, and stability. Adsorption isotherms will be recorded for the variants for natural and synthetic lignin of varying surface chemistry and microstructure. The PI will test this hypothesis for cellulase catalytic domains, carbohydrate binding modules, and the full-length cellulases.The project will provide fundamental quantitative understanding of protein-surface adsorption effects with significant implications for commercial-scale bioenergy production using lignocellulosic biomass. More generally, this work will supply datasets for identifying critical parameters governing enzyme-surface interactions crucial for disparate applications such as separations of single wall carbon nanotubes, laundry detergents, biomaterials for medical uses and immobilized biocatalysts.This project will engage students from K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels from various interdisciplinary programs and under-represented groups to broaden their understanding of the role of industrial biotechnology in mitigating bioenergy related problems in an environmentally sustainable manner.

737,"PI: C. Robin Buell (Michigan State University) Co-PIs: Yuehua Cui and David Douches (Michigan State University), Jiming Jiang (University of Wisconsin-Madison), and Richard Veilleux (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University)Potato is the third most important food crop in the world following rice and wheat and is cultivated for its tuber, a below-ground storage organ. Potato is distinct from many other major crops in that it is asexually propagated, has four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid), and all cultivars are highly heterozygous. As a consequence, potato has a greater probability of retaining deleterious gene mutations than sexually propagated diploids such as rice, maize, and soybean. These three characteristics make genetic improvement of potato slow and unpredictable due to a lack of understanding of the interaction of genetic elements in a complex background. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge regarding the molecular nature of heterozygosity and allelic composition in the potato genome and how these correlate with phenotype. The objectives of this project are to understand the contribution of genes/alleles, transcripts, copy number variation and epigenomic features to a complex of phenotypic traits associated with fitness in potato. Data to be generated from this project will include characterization of the genome, transcriptome and epigenome from multiple potato populations with differential degrees of chromosome number and heterozygosity and statistical analyses to identify genes and alleles associated with a set of phenotypes associated with vigor. These data will also facilitate modeling genomic features into phenotype. Many of the genetic and genomic questions associated with potato cannot be readily addressed by using diploid model plants. Project efforts to probe the genetic complexities of potato will serve as a model genomics system for other vegetatively propagated, highly heterozygous crops with similarly intractable breeding systems, including alfalfa, banana, cassava, grape, strawberry, sugarcane, sweet potato, yam and scores of minor horticultural crops, thereby improving the understanding of the genetic machinery underlying phenotypic diversity. Through outreach activities in this project, the public will gain knowledge of plant biology, specifically in the uses of potato and its unique biology, through a suite of activities with the Michigan State University Children's and Horticulture Garden involving all age groups. Through engagement of high school and under-represented groups, this project will provide opportunities for students to see science as a viable career opportunity and increase the representation of women in computer-related science/technology disciplines.

In particular, the two groups of bacteria within the species Xanthomonas oryzae are the causal agents of bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak diseases of rice. The bacteria cause disease, in part, modulating host gene expression utilizing a remarkable repertoire of transcription activation-like (TAL) effectors. TAL effectors are proteins synthesized in bacteria and transferred to plant cells during the infection process. The host transcriptional responses to TAL effector attack are complex, and unraveling of the transcriptional  shock  due to the large repertoire of TAL effectors injected into the host cells behooves a more detailed understanding of host gene response to individual TAL effectors. At the same time, other disease complexes that involve large repertoires of TAL effectors in the respective pathogen, and additional disease complexes will be profiled. This project will characterize the host gene expression responses to infection by Xanthomonas pathogens of rice, wheat, cotton, soybeans, and alfalfa using high through-put nucleic acid sequencing technologies. The role played by select host genes whose expression is found to be highly up-regulated in response to specific TAL effectors will be analyzed using advanced gene targeting technologies. TAL effectors function by binding to sequences in the host genome that direct the expression of individual genes, which are known as promoters. The project will also develop refined bioinformatic tools derived from shared features of promoters that are targeted by specific TAL effectors. This information will improve our insight into the vulnerabilities of plants to transcriptional shock and greatly further our ability to predict TAL effector target sites in a genome and to effectively design custom TAL effectors for targeted gene manipulation. This project will elucidate the processes in rice susceptibility and resistance to bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak, and establish important, broadly relevant concepts of plant-pathogen interactions and TAL effector biotechnology. The results will provide insight into strategies for achieving durable and broad resistance against disease, which, in itself, can have wide-reaching impacts on the environment and quality of life.

In initial dissertation work, the Co-PI found that flour beetles adapt to soy flour within eleven generations and hybridization between beetle populations increases adaptation. While increased adaptation in hybrids can be caused by recombination of parental genomes (the standard explanation), increased performance might also be caused by recombination of symbiotic bacteria from parental populations. This proposition will be tested by comparing symbiotic bacteria of soy-adapted and wheat-adapted beetles. Bacteria will be identified by high-throughput DNA technology. Antibiotics will be used to remove symbiotic bacteria to determine whether bacteria are responsible for differences in performance.This project will produce data relevant to agriculture, conservation, and education.

This hypothesis will be tested by synthesizing fatty acids that are slightly longer than linoleic acid and determining whether these new substrates show enhanced activity with site-directed mutants in which phe-557 is replaced with smaller amino acids.  It has also been proposed that replacing phe-557 with smaller amino acids alters the regiochemistry of the reaction by allowing substrates to bind in a reverse manner.  This hypothesis will be tested using synthetic substrates, stereochemical studies, and additional mutagenesis.Lipoxygenases catalyze a useful reaction, the incorporation of oxygen into polyunsaturated fatty acids, that chemists cannot carry out in a controlled way without enzymes.  Understanding the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes provides an opportunity to learn useful chemistry from nature.  Soybean lipoxygenase-1 is the most extensively studied lipoxygenase, but our mechanistic insight is limited by uncertainty about how substrates bind. The proposed work is designed to address this deficiency.  Better understanding of how lipoxygenases bind substrates could lead to the rational design of mutant lipoxygenases that would catalyze transformations that cannot be achieved with the natural enzymes.

744,"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is proposing to produce polyols from soymeal for use in the manufacturing of rigid polyurethanes foams. The proposed process follows the ?Green Chemistry? guidelines and consists of hydrolyzing the protein to amino acids and converting them to hydroxyl terminated monomers. Polymerization of these polyols will yield poly(amide-urethane)s, which can be used as foams, coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. However, the focus of this proposal will be on introducing this technology to the rigid polyurethane foams market. The structure and the presence of amide linkages in these polyols should provide better dimensional stability, higher rigidity and better chemical resistance foams then current polyurethane foams that contain esters or ethers linkages. Key elements of the current program will be to prepare and characterize the polyol monomers and then evaluate them in rigid polyurethanes foams. Model compounds derived from commonly available amino acids will also be used to optimize the process and characterize the products. The data will be used to articulate the scientific basis and develop appropriate process and products. Assessing potential commercial feasibility, preliminary economic evaluation, identifying potential market segments and customers who are interested in this technology will also be examined.The broader impact/commercial potential of this project provides an opportunity to produce a desirable bio-based alternative to environmentally un-friendly and increasingly expensive petroleum-based rigid polyurethane foams. Recently, much activity has been directed to utilize the oil from soybean to produce biodiesel, however, most of the leftover protein biomass is being used for poultry, swine and cattle feed or in aquaculture feed. Only a small portion of this biomass is refined for human consumption and even a smaller amount (only 0.5%) is currently being used for industrial applications (primarily in adhesives). The relatively low cost and stable supply of this valuable raw material makes the protein biomass an economically attractive source for value-added products such as its use in the production of polyurethanes. Furthermore, the proposed manufacturing process offers distinct advantages over the production of current polyols.

745,"This Partnership in International Research and Education (PIRE) project addresses the question: How will biofuel development impact socio-ecological systems and associated ecosystem services, and how can those impacts best be measured, modeled, and mitigated? Society faces difficult challenges in preventing climate change and reducing dependence on foreign energy supplies that can come from political unstable regions.  In response, the US, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina have moved toward encouraging the development of new energy forms that can be domestically produced in a less environmentally negative fashion than traditional energy from petroleum, coal, or natural gas.  The team, led by Michigan Technological University scientists, includes 33 scientists at nine US, three Brazilian, four Mexican, and two Argentine universities and public and private research labs. Bioenergy is energy formed from plants.  Many are familiar with bioenergy in the form of firewood used for a campfire or woodstove.  Bioenergy can be used to heat buildings, create electricity, or create automotive fuels, including diesel and ethanol.  One of the major policy goals of the US, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina is to promote the development of bioenergy in the forms of both biodiesel and ethanol, generally called biofuel.  These fuels will be created from many types of plants, including trees, corn, sugarcane, soybeans, and palm tree nuts. As these countries work toward achieving this goal, it is important to understand whether and what types of these fuels are most likely to allow us to create new energy forms that maximize benefits while minimizing costs, including negative societal and environmental impacts.  This research team of scientists from the US, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina has the goal of increasing understanding of the societal and environmental impacts of different types of biofuels in these four countries.  The team focuses on the production of these biofuels in forested regions, areas where the biofuel is being produced from forests or impacting forests through their conversion to agricultural crops, like soybeans.  This international team of social, natural, and engineering scientists will work together to collect data about these impacts.  But it will also translate findings into new ways to measure and reduce those impacts, while increasing understanding of how public policies can help maximize biofuel benefits while minimizing biofuel costs.  Project work will advance understanding of sustainability science while training new generations of students and scientists to work more effectively in teams that include many different types of scientific professionals.

746,"Intellectual Merit: Heterotrimeric G-proteins consisting of Galpha, Gbeta and Ggamma subunits regulate some of the most important signaling pathways in eukaryotes. In metazoans, evolutionary diversification has led to the presence of a large number of G-proteins and associated components that regulate a multitude of signaling pathways with a high degree of specificity.  In contrast, plants have a very limited number of G-proteins that integrate a plethora of signaling pathways to modulate overall growth and development. This observation has led to the hypothesis that the plant G-proteins have evolved differently from the metazoan G-proteins in accordance with the sedentary lifestyle of plants. Detailed studies of the structure/function attributes of plant G-proteins is currently mostly limited to Arabidopsis which restricts the knowledge of why and when during evolution the plant G-proteins emerged as modulators of multiple signals. It is also not known if the G-proteins have evolved to play critical roles in biological processes that are unique to specific plant lineages. Furthermore, the presence of certain unconventional G-protein components in plants suggests their role(s) in regulating novel, as yet unexplored G-proteins signaling mechanisms. The availability of fully sequenced genomes from a number of plant species at important evolutionary nodes and the PIs extensive experience working with G-protein signaling using complementary approaches including biochemical, molecular-genetics and genome/proteome-scale analyses, puts her in an excellent position to address some of the key questions related to the plant G-protein signaling. Towards this, important preliminary data have been generated related to G-proteins components and their activity from Arabidopsis, rice, soybean, Physcomitrella, Selaginella, Brachypodium and Aquilegia. This research has been developed with the overall objective to understand the functional evolution of the G-protein core components and their interaction in plants, and to infer the conventional and novel signaling mechanisms and their role in regulating signaling pathways involved in plant adaptation and yield. To accomplish this objective, following specific aims will be pursued:      Aim 1. Biochemical characterization of the enzymatically active proteins of the G-protein complex in the context of their evolutionary diversification      Aim 2. Evaluation of the role of G-proteins from across different taxa in regulating the signaling pathways important in the context of land plant evolution The material and intellectual resources generated from this research will be made publicly available through the Arabidopsis stock center and through our website. The long term benefits of the research include comprehensive knowledge of the evolution of G-protein components and signaling mechanisms in plants and their roles in regulating pathways controlling agronomically important traits. Broader Impact: This research addresses the fundamental aspects of plant signaling and evolution. Given the involvement of G-protein in regulating important agronomic traits such as seed development and physiology, abiotic stress tolerance and water use efficiency, the knowledge gained from this research will be useful for engineering important agricultural traits to the benefit of society. Moreover, the research specifically incorporates training for high-school students and teachers through the STARS program and undergraduate students through the REU program. The PI is actively involved in recruiting, mentoring and training of undergraduate students as a co-director of the Danforth Center REU program; and graduate students through her participation in Washington University plant biology recruitment, thesis committees and teaching. The proposed research offers multidisciplinary training to the post-docs in various aspects of modern plant biology. The PI is strongly committed to provide training and mentoring opportunities to post-docs to help them establish their independent careers.

747,"Intellectual MeritPlants use the sun's energy to convert carbon dioxide gas into the organic materials required for life. Key to this primary productivity is the axial extension of plant stems into the atmosphere where leaves can capture sunlight and exchange gases.  The same axial growth process drives roots into the soil to find water, nutrients and a stable footing for the organism.  This project is focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which seed plants execute this axial growth plan at a cellular level.  Seed plants have taken one of the major polymer systems found in all eukaryotic cells, the microtubules, and repurposed them as patterning agents.  The plant cell creates specific patterns of microtubules just underneath the cell's membrane that act as templates for the construction of the fibrous walls created on the outside of the cell.  It is the cell wall that ultimately gives the plant its structure and rigidity.  The finely detailed nanofabrication of the plant cell wall underlies the ability of all seed plants to extend axially up into the sunlight or down into the soil.  This work employs modern molecular genetic techniques and advanced cell biological methods in the Arabidopsis model system with the aim of discovering what genes are specifically required for organizing the microtubule arrays for axial cell growth.Broader impactsThe basic science being performed impacts several areas of practical and commercial interest.  Crop plant plot density is directly dependent upon the axial growth habit (e.g. corn or soybean fields). This work will further elucidate the genes involved in mechanical extension of the hypocotyl during seed germination, a critical period in crop plant development.  This work provides valuable information about plant microtubule dynamics, a common herbicide target, and the patterning of cellulose polymers in the cell wall, the major biofuels feedstock.  This project provides advanced training for a post-doctoral fellow and two (sequential) graduate students.  The training will include exposure to leading-edge imaging technologies and integrated mathematical modeling.  At least 2 undergraduate students will be working on this project as part of their undergraduate honors thesis requirements.

748,"CBET 1160053SabatiniThe vegetable oil extraction industry is the primary contributor of volatile organic compound emissions in the food industry. The annual hexane loss in the soybean oil extraction process alone in the US could be as high as 210 - 430 million liters. There are growing health concerns and increased environmental regulations regarding the use of hexane in vegetable oil extraction. Exposure to hexane at 15 ppm/day for three months has been shown to cause peripheral nerve damage, and hexane is also a potential hazardous explosive material. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established regulations on hexane emission due to growing environmental concerns. There is a pressing need for more sustainable extraction method as an alternative to hexane. The overall goal of this research is to identify the fundamental processes that will allow us to develop a robust surfactant-based bio-oil extraction process, including a fundamentally-based model for design of microemulsion extraction processes for a range of bio-oils. The work proposed here would, for the first time, provide a quantitative understanding of fundamental processes influencing the bio-oil extraction by the aqueous surfactant-based method, and further would provide a new quantitative model which can be used for making a priori predictions of extraction performance under realistic conditions. The resulting model could be used to design surfactant-based extraction systems for a wide range of plants and oilseeds, which is not available at present. The results of this work have the potential to be transformative, in that they will significantly advance the way in which bio-oils are extracted, resulting in an industry-wide replacement of environmentally-hazardous solvent-based methods with more environmentally-benign aqueous surfactant-based methods. Aqueous processing of oilseed extraction is preferred over hexane because it is environmentally friendly, safe and produces oil with superior quality. While enzyme-based extraction of soybean oil can achieve greater than 90% oil extraction efficiency, the enzyme-assisted extraction process requires long incubation time, high temperature and produces stable emulsions, which are not desirable in industrial scale. To address these challenges, this project will utilize bio-compatible extended-surfactant systems to achieve high oil extraction efficiency while avoiding stable emulsion formation. The work will then be extended to test micro-algae oil extraction to validate the versatility of the surfactant-assisted aqueous extraction method and process model. This project will study the mixture of a branched surfactant with a novel extendedsurfactant (surfactants with an intermediate polarity groups inserted between the head and the tail of the surfactant molecule). Extended-surfactants consistently showed ultralow interfacial tension with a wide range of vegetable oils, but they require very high salt concentration to achieve optimum performance. By mixing extended-surfactants with a hydrophobic and branched surfactant, the requires salinity will be reduced while the branching will decrease the surfactant tail-tail interaction, allowing better oil penetration, thereby improving the extraction efficiency. The results of this innovative research potentially benefit to the society, as well as education initiatives designed to enhance the learning experience of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Oklahoma. The new application of surfactant in oilseed extraction and understanding the fundamental science of this approach will be integrated into a colloids and surface science course at the University of Oklahoma, which has attracted a number of undergraduate and graduate students from multi engineering disciplines (i.e. chemical engineer, chemistry, environmental engineer and science). In addition, the developed aqueous surfactantbased oil extraction prediction model resulting from this research will be submitted to the K-Gray Engineering Pathway Digital Library, allowing course shareware among universities. The developed model will provide an interactive educational module where students can explore the fundamental mechanisms involved in oilseed extraction as well as applying the model in advanced chemical process design.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
749,"Plants capture the energy of the sun in the process of photosynthesis, but this is an inefficient process that limits their growth potential. Some bacteria have specialized structures (called carboxysomes) that increase their efficiency of photosynthesis, and if carboxysomes can be introduced into crop plants such as rice, wheat and soybeans it is anticipated that this would improve their growth and yield. The smaller the number of proteins that are needed to reconstitute functional carboxysomes, the easier it will be to succeed. The goal of this project is to combine the roles of two carboxysome proteins into one; in other words, one protein will play two essential roles by combining structural and enzymatic functions.  It is proposed to develop two types of bi-functional carboxysome proteins:  one that will help deliver carbon dioxide to the interior of the carboxysome, where it will be available to RUBISCO, a key enzyme of photosynthesis; the second will detoxify a molecule (2-phosphoglycolate) that is formed as an unwanted by-product of chemical reactions that compete with photosynthesis.Broader Impacts: This project will provide interdisciplinary training in biochemistry, protein chemistry and synthetic biology to a postdoctoral fellow and to undergraduate students. In addition it will explore innovative approaches to the engineering of structures such as the carboxysome and has the potential to improve crop yields for both food and biofuel.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
750,"0933249LandisBiofuels are currently derived from corn and soybeans in the US to make ethanol and biodiesel, respectively. While energy and greenhouse gas savings are realized, several significant tradeoffs have arisen including a) increase in food prices and b) a shift in environmental burden to impacts manifesting as eutrophication and hypoxia (i.e. the Dead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico). Cultivating biofuels on marginal lands may alleviate these problems and may serve to contribute additional environmental benefits in the form of soil remediation.The goal of the proposed research is to quantify the benefits of growing bioenergy crops on marginal lands. Throughout this project they will: (i) quantify on-site phytoremediation of biofuel crops, (ii) evaluate runoff related to biofuel crops, and (iii) compare the life cycle environmental impacts of biofuels grown on marginal lands to petroleum fuels and traditional biofuels (i.e. soy biodiesel, corn ethanol).The PIs at the University of Pittsburgh will partner with Alcoa Corp and a local nonprofit, GTECH Strategies, to form a unique collaboration. Alcoa Corp is involved in a mine reclamation demonstration at the Mather Mine site in PA. Alcoa is aiding in the evaluation of the use of alkaline clay to assist in reclamation. GTECH Strategies cultivates biofuel crops on vacant urban lands; their mission is to foster community growth in underserved communities through the creation of  egreen collar  jobs.This project is unique not only for Pennsylvania, but for the water resources, water quality, and biofuels research community at large. The findings of the proposed research will inform the research community about the life cycle environmental benefits of alternative uses for marginal and vacant lands, and will also contribute to the literature and understanding of phytoremediation. The findings of the life cycle assessment will also contribute to the ever growing and highly debated body of LCA research on biofuels.The proposed activities will have broad reaching impacts that serve the purpose of energy production, storm water management, nutrient management, water conservation, reclamation, and job creation in underserved communities.  The impacts of the proposed research extend from contribution to the scientific study of biofuel crops to community engagement and empowerment through the collaboration with GTECH Strategies. The proposed project will directly aid in the increase of job opportunities in environmental justice communities through GTECHs green job corps program and will foster the growth of GTECH as a sustainable nonprofit. Clearly, the development of new strategies for sustainable biofuel production will aid in addressing national security issues and help the nation meet national 2010 fuel standards. In addition to the outreach inherent in the collaboration with GTECH, they also propose to continue to include a diverse set of students (REU, grad, and high school, via GTECH's green job corps) in the proposed research.

751,"Project SummaryLarge scale events like the Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig Explosion of 2010 and infant formula being purposelyfortified with melamine in China cause great concern and heighten the level of awareness among Americans.Local, state, and national response mechanisms are in place to quickly respond to these situations and helpmitigate unforeseen consequences while protecting public and environmental health. Unfortunately, responseassets at every level can quickly become overwhelmed and may require surge or redundant capacity. The Foodand Drug Administration Food Emergency Response Program (FDA FERN) is one system in place that iscomprised of both federal and state laboratories that bring personnel, supplies, equipment, and expertisetogether to enable food and food product analyses during these situations. Many laboratories are volunteerlaboratories, but 14 member laboratories have entered cooperative agreements and are now referred to as FERNCAP Laboratories. The Arkansas Department of Health-Arkansas Public Health Laboratory (ADH-PHL)became a FERN CAP Laboratory in 2009 and has been working over the past 1.5 years to provide the necessaryfoundation for launching the Arkansas FERN Chemistry Laboratory. This newly formed laboratory is part of rdthe 3 generation of CAP laboratories.ADH-PHL provides a solid laboratory environment for maintaining the Arkansas FERN Chemistry Laboratory.Dedicated laboratory space, quality management systems, and additional surge staff, instrument, and space areavailable when needs arise. Laboratory systems are accredited through several internationally recognizedaccrediting authorities, and the entire laboratory staff brings great experience in the four key project areas ofGC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, and ELISA. ADH-PHL also partners with other federal response networks managedby the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency, namely the Laboratory ResponseNetwork (LRN) and the Environmental Laboratory Response Network (ELRN), respectively. This internalcollaboration brings together a mix of diverse skill sets along with varying degrees of expertise and experiencein a way that promotes interaction and program development. These relationships are crucial for mitigatinglarge scale crises where human and environmental health is threatened.The Arkansas FERN Chemistry Laboratory has met 100% of the goals identified in the first 2 year cooperativeagreement. The laboratory is fully staffed, has obtained, installed and trained on FERN instrumentation, hasworked with FERN partners to successfully validate FERN testing methods focusing on GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, and ELISA, has participated and passed all proficiency tests provided by FDA, has exercised its responsecapabilities, and participates in technical and programmatic meetings, which include conference calls. Thislaboratory continuously focuses to improve emergency response and preparedness efforts and is working withFDA to find ways to enhance and expand FERN response initiatives. FERN analysts are actively evaluatingdiverse food matrix assignments provided by the FDA. These matrices include powdered milk, freeze-driedtuna, spinach, mandarin oranges, pineapple juice, chocolate syrup, soy-based baby formula, snack cakes, energydrinks, drinkable yogurt, balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing, catfish, and spirits.The project plan for this cooperative agreement continues to bolster emergency response and preparednessinitiatives by assessing analytical capacity, cross-training staff to provide additional surge support, proficiencytesting and exercising methodologies, and participating in various training forums including meetings andconference calls reviewing programmatic and technical information. Training sessions provided by FDA andother FERN partners will also be used to help stay abreast of the newest technology being used by FERN. Theproject plan also includes provisions to help expand and enhance FERN response initiatives. Matrix evaluationsand analyte extension studies will continue as staff cross-train with and exercise validated methods.Quantitative capabilities and technology evaluations are being explored as a way to help prepare the FERNprogram for future responses and requests. To help streamline reporting of data, unique data management andprocessing tools are being developed to help expedite final reporting.

752,"Bio-based materials, suitably tuned to meet the requirements of final-product performance, cost and environmental benefits, are sought-after industrial commodities due to the rapidly emerging demand for  green  materials and technologies, across the markets. The 2008 Farm Bill expanded the existing preferred purchasing program for the federal sector and reauthorized the voluntary labeling program for the broad-scale consumer marketing of bio-based products. Besides the BioPreferredR program, many businesses are seeking eco-labeling or other voluntary labeling programs to offer environmentally friendlier products. Thus, there is a significant market demand and potential for the development of soy-based coating materials. The U.S. soy crops have historically outpaced demand and hence a steady availability of soybean oil is anticipated. Only 17% of U.S. soybean is used for human consumption, making available a large pool of soybeans for developing value-added industrial products. The proposed research is aimed at developing value-added soy-derived building blocks that can replace currently used petro-based products in contemporary and emerging coating systems -WB, HS, and UV-cure. Offering customized soy-products amenable to these key technologies, and demonstration of their performance, cost, and environmental benefits, through systematic assessment in collaboration with industrial partners and experts is the essence of this research program. We have collaborated with three industries, representing resin manufacture and coating formulators for different markets that will help us in in evaluating products for their commercialization potential. Building on our research groups inventions and achievements, we have proposed to develop very novel coating materials that outperform many conventional systems. Among the most noteworthy examples are hyper-branched soy-polyols and a number of downstream products, and soy-based UV-curable organic-inorganic hybrid nano-composite coatings with remarkable properties for a number of end-use applications. We have filed patent/provisional patent applications on these two inventions. Upon successful completion of this project, we will have developed coating materials based on novel soy-based building blocks. By working with industry partners we will assess suitability of these products for commercialization. Life-Cycle Assessment, a methodology which is primarily used to assess and compare sustainability of products, will be conducted by working with LCA experts on our team. This will provide meaningful information about the sustainability benefits of the soy-based product , which can effectively be communicated to the stakeholders. We believe that, upon successful completion of this project, the value-added, soy-based, low-cost sustainable materials will replace conventional materials, without changing manufacturing, application, and curing processes, giving the stakeholders substantial incentives and great commercialization potential.

The technology has enabled dramatic improvements in agronomic performance of major food crops grown on millions of acres around the world. Common bean - a most important source of dietary protein for human consumption globally - cannot be transformed routinely using current approaches. Coupled with the genome sequence, an efficient transformation system will accelerate genomic approaches to improve this important crop. Our goal is to establish a reproducible transformation protocol for common bean using Agrobacterium-mediated method. Our hypothesis is that half seeds or cotyledonary nodes of common bean can be used as target explants for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and organogenesis for regeneration. We will focus our efforts on Agrobacterium-mediated method as transgenic events generated by this method usually provide low transgene insertion in the genome, which is more desirable for researchers. Iowa State University's Center for Plant Transformation has extensive experience providing genetic transformation services (corn, soybean, rice and Brachypodium) to public researchers around the world.

758,"Simplified agroecosystems have diminished habitats for beneficial insects throughout the Midwest and Northern Great Plains. Beneficial insects include pollinators and natural enemies of crops pests, and both rely heavily on floral resources and habitat diversity to maintain healthy populations. Recent national emphasis on increasing biofuel production affords producers the opportunity to reintegrate critical resources for beneficial insects into landscapes that were homogenized by modern corn-soybean rotations. Several flower-rich and pollinator-friendly oilseed crops comprise this opportunity. However, balancing constraints of profitable farm production against practices that maximize benefits of integrating oilseed crops into traditional rotations is challenging. Our proposed research will design and test best management practices for economically and agriculturally rational biofuel crop rotations appropriate for northern states. Management practices will be optimized based on their effects on profitability and beneficial insects. This project will diversify the range of biofuel crops available for producers and simultaneously enhance environmental quality for beneficial insects.

759,"Biofuels like biodiesel are important for the U.S. energy portfolio and Renewable Fuels Standard-2 because they have the potential to enhance national security by reducing dependence on foreign oil, improve social and economic well-being of rural communities, and improve environmental quality. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that gasoline and diesel prices will continue to rise into the future, making it necessary to seek out other alternatives for production. The nation's agricultural power combined with high-tech industry can be leveraged to provide this type of stability. Agriculturally-produced biodiesel is an important component of the Renewable Fuels Standard-2 and can fall into both the biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel categories, requiring a total of at least 22 billion gallons annually by 2022. Agriculturally-produced biodiesels can come from oilseed crops like soybean, canola, sunflower, and mustard. Little research has been published related to farmer interest in growing crops for biodiesel production. A study at the University of Tennessee tried to identify soybean producer interest in growing soybeans for biodiesel. Though the response rate from smaller farms (<100 acres) was lower, 97% indicated that they would be willing to sell some, or their entire crop to a biodiesel production plant. In 2007, a group of 20 public- and private-sector scientists and educators was created to establish guidelines for providing 25% of U.S. energy needs from U.S. farms, ranches, and forests by 2025. Among the three educational needs identified, Extension education was one that was recommended for every renewable energy area. Among priority areas with Extension programming, were education on the costs and benefits to society of renewable energy, biomass production and handling, and biomass conversion technologies. A recent survey of Tennessee Extension agents, conducted by Dr. de Koff (PD) in February/March 2012, identified that over one-third of respondents indicated interest in programming for oilseed production for bioenergy. This indicates that there is more education needed in this area which can build capacity for Tennessee State University (TSU) as well as the state of Tennessee. The development and implementation of regional workshops centered around a mobile biodiesel production platform (MBPP) and focused on different aspects of biodiesel and biodiesel crop production will build capacity at TSU by creating a program that can be used to train producers and Extension agents and to educate students (K-12, undergraduate, graduate), consumers, and policy-makers. Other universities, like Texas A&M, Michigan State University and Auburn University, have MBPPs that are utilized for Extension purposes and this tool will give TSU the opportunity to attract stakeholders and students.

Biodiesel production from vegetable oil is a promising option for reducing fossil fuel dependence and mitigating atmospheric pollution. However, the cultivation of agricultural plants for bioenergy has raised concerns because of the competition with food production. Large areas in the U.S. are heavily contaminated by industrial and agricultural wastes and are considered improper to residential or agricultural uses.

In this application, we propose (1) to test the tolerance of an important energy crop, soybean, to various organic pollutants, (2) to determine the impact of organic contaminants on the soybean lipid content and composition, including the potential accumulation of contaminants in the lipid fraction, and (3) to evaluate the positive effect of soybean on land remediation. The project will integrate research and education by involving graduate and undergraduate students into research and by developing an afterschool program with a nearby high school attended by high-performing disadvantaged students. This seed project is expected to provide the bases for full-proposal applications and further research to implement the technology and make it attractive to government, state, and corporate stakeholders. This project will contribute to the sustainability of U.S. agriculture by promoting biofuel production and enhancing environmental quality without competing with food demand.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

The Nutrasorb technology enables manufacture of a new generation of science-based, efficacious, shelf-stable, and tasty anti-diabetic / anti-obesity functional foods; specifically, natural, nutritious, low-sugar functional snacks from RCG juice. This agriculturally-related technology answers the biggest challenge for the plant-based health/functional foods industry, i.e. to deliver an effective daily dose of beneficial phytonutrients in a few servings, while reducing unhealthy compounds, such as sugars, and associated calories. This Phase II SBIR project directly addresses two major nutritional needs of the US and the developed world - the growing epidemic of childhood obesity and metabolic syndrome. It is designed to initiate a paradigm and technology shift in the functional food industry that targets children and their diets. This proposal will 1) further advance Nutrasorb technology for the manufacture of a new generation of science-based, efficacious, shelf-stable, and tasty functional food ingredients, specifically, a natural, nutritious, low-sugar functional ingredient made from red Concord grapes (RCG) and soy protein isolate (SPI), and 2) take this technology to the threshold of full commercialization with already identified commercial partners.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
762,"The soybean aphid is undoubtedly the most important insect pest of soybean in the North Central region, causing estimated yield losses of at least $2.4 billion annually (Tilmon et al. 2011). Infestations can number in the thousands per plant, and can negatively impact seed quality and size, pod number, plant height (Ostlie 2001; Hill et al. 2004), plant physiological processes (Macedo et al. 2003), and yield (Wang et al. 1994; Ostlie 2001). Notably, because the presence of adapted biotypes was discovered from resistant soybean cultivars not yet commercially introduced in US field populations, biotypes could not have adapted in response to Rag genes, but more likely are a result of naturally occurring genetic variation. Therefore, the success of an IRM strategy in the presence of varying biotype frequencies is dependent on understanding the fitness of virulent biotypes, the competitive interactions among biotypes (i.e. whether virulent biotypes have lower reproductive output than avirulent biotypes in a refuge), how quickly populations lose susceptibility (the increase in virulent biotypes), and the role of natural enemies. The answers to these questions are critical to 1) validate models of HPR durability, 2) provide data to communicate with industry on insect resistance management strategies, and 3) integrate soybean aphid HPR as a successful and sustainable IPM tactic. The results of this proposal will allow improvement of predictive modeling for durability and help develop mitigation strategies that delay the breakdown of crop resistance and increase the sustainability of these environmentally friendly tools.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Most crop protection products (fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators and biopesticides), necessary tools in the integrated  war  against destructive pests, are developed for large markets on major crops such as corn, soybean and cotton where the cost of discovery, development, registration and production can be offset by significant sales of the product. Due to the expensive process of bringing a new chemical crop protection product to market (in the US, the cost is in excess of $50 million dollars), the agriculture chemical industry often does not register their products on specialty crops (most vegetables, fruits, nuts, herbs, nursery and flower crops) - the cost of required data is greater than potential return on investment.

764,"Fish consumption has increased dramatically over the last 20 years. Unfortunately, this increase in demand for fish has resulted in an alarming depletion of the natural fisheries. With the closure of many marine fisheries due to over-harvesting and the increased domestic demand for fish it is evident that alternatives to harvesting fish from the wild need to be developed. Aquaculture is a rapidly growing alternative to harvesting wild fish. The increase in aquaculture has required an increase in the production of manufactured feeds. The main ingredients in traditional aquafeeds include fish meal and fish oil. Several kilograms of wild fish are required to produce each kilogram of farm-raised fish, which accounts for 40% and 60% of the global fish meal and oil production, respectively. In marine aquaculture, the importance of dietary omega long chain fatty acids is well-known. High value, marine carnivores require the omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) as essential fatty acids (EFA) that are major constituents of marine fish oils. Alternative sources are needed to replace the fish oil used in aquafeeds if aquaculture is to remain competitive and sustainable. An alternative source of fish oils in aquafeed may be algae. Algae are high in HUFA, and provide a high quality source of dietary lipids. A limitation to their widespread use in feeds is economic: the cultivation, harvesting and processing of algae is very expensive. The goal of this USDA SBIR Phase 1 Grant is to develop a continuous system for extracting lipids from algae directly into soybean oil using ultrasonics. The soy-algal oil product, including the remnant biomass, will be directly added with other ingredients during the manufacturing of the feed. We believe that this process will result in lower cost of supplementing feeds with algal oils due to higher bioavailability of algal oils in diets and reduced algal processing steps. This extraction and processing methods developed in this proposal are components of an integrated algal production system designed to further reduce the cost of the algal product.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
765,"In 2007, wild captured fish accounted for about 15.7% of the animal protein consumed by humans on a global basis, and per capita consumption of fish and shellfish products is increasing, parallel with the global human population. Unfortunately, harvest rates of wild fish have decreased by ~0.7 mmt per year over the past 20 years, and the FAO recently reported that 53% of the world's wild fish stocks are now fully exploited and 32% are over exploited. As a consequence of greater fish demand and the increasing trend of over exploited and depleted stocks, aquaculture production has increased by 9% annually over the last decade. Similar trends of greater demand for and lower wild harvest of fish meal protein have led to a rapid escalation in price of this product. In 2005, 2.7 mmt of fish meal was used in aquaculture feeds, while an estimated 6.7 mmt will be required by 2012. This rate of growth is unsustainable and is reflected in current fish meal prices which are already hampering the economic production of fish and shellfish products for human consumption. Lower cost, more sustainable plant-derived sources of protein have been increasing tested to partially replace fish meal in aquaculture diets. Soybean meal (SBM) has been used to replace up to 20% of total protein in diets for several species, while soy protein concentrate (SPC) has been tested successfully at higher total protein replacement levels. These soybean products provide high protein and relative good amino acid profiles, but are still deficient in some critical amino acids required by carnivorous fishes. SPC can be used at higher levels than SBM, primarily because the solvent extraction process and heat treatment used to produce SPC removes or inactivates undesirable factors. The primary limitations of the current solvent extraction process are its cost, the lack of use for the undesirable components removed in the process, and quality issues that frequently limit inclusion to 50% of total protein in the diet. Corn DDGS has been evaluated in diets at fish meal replacement levels of up to 20%. DDGS has lower protein (28-32%) and more fiber than soy products, but is typically priced at ~50% the value of defatted SBM. Some ethanol plants have incorporated a dry fractionation process to remove part of the fiber and oil prior to the conversion process, resulting in a dry-frac DDGS of up to 42% protein. While this product has been used to replace 20-40% of fish meal in aquaculture feeds, there is considerable market opportunity for an even higher protein DDGS. Prairie AquaTech proposes to convert the fibers and other carbohydrates in DDGS into additional protein using microbial conversion. An constituent byproduct will also facilitate extruded feed pellet formation, may provide an immunostimulant activity to activate innate defense mechanisms that protect fish, and increase corn protein digestibility and absorption during metabolism, providing higher feed efficiency and yields. We anticipate this microbial treatment process will provide a valuable, sustainable aquaculture feed that is less expensive on a protein basis than SBM, SPC, and fish meal.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
766,"Nematodes cause $8 billion in damage to U.S. crops and $80 billion worldwide. Anthurium, a cutflower and potted plant specialty crop, is very susceptible to nematodes, necessitating continued grower reliance on toxic chemical controls that face the threat of being taken off the market at any time. Without controls, field flower production is reduced 50% and plants eventually die. More economical and sustainable controls, such as host plant resistance, are needed. Anthuriums were transformed with RNA interference (silencing) genes for nematode resistance. Silencing a homologous gene in soybean cyst nematodes resulted in 85% reduction of nematode eggs on transgenic soybeans compared to controls. We propose to confirm gene transfer, regenerate plants, and develop a quick, 4-week tissue culture bioassay to screen transgenic lines. The quick bioassay will replace the traditional, expensive 3- to 4-month potted plant bioassay. In this Phase I project, the most resistant lines will be validated by pot tests and prepared for Phase II field tests. Phase II will include completion of pot tests and collection of molecular and field data for federal deregulation, patenting, and intellectual property licensing. In Phase III, the most resistant lines will be advanced toward commercialization by deregulation, intellectual property licensing from the owners of the technologies used, and patenting of the lines. The plants developed will be property of the company and will be licensed for use by growers.

767,"The general problem: In the United States today, the health consequences associated with childhood and adolescent obesity are projected to produce the first decline in life expectancy since the Great Depression. More than 23 million children and adolescents are overweight or obese. The role of fat in the diet: Low-fat diets have been advocated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and have been enforced in most calorie-reducing regimens. However, researchers have reevaluated this guidance in recent years on several grounds: 1) Low-fat diets can lead to vitamin deficiency because fat-soluble vitamins, particularly vitamin D, are found only in the fatty (or oily) part of food. 2) Moderate amounts of saturated fat are needed to increase the bio-availability of fat-soluble nutrients. 3) Dietary fat promotes satiation, slowing digestion by triggering the release of the satiety hormone cholecystokinin and controlling the metabolism of carbohydrates. For children, dietary fat is required to support physical and psychological changes during growth and maturation. While too much fat in the diet increases dietary energy density and may compromise weight loss, too little fat results in nutritional deficiencies and feelings of hunger that can lead to overeating. In summary, moderate amounts of carefully balanced dietary fat are critical for healthy, sustainable weight loss in obese children. Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and oil blends containing MCFAs have received considerable attention for their ability to increase energy expenditure and for their potential application in reducing abdominal obesity. At 6 to 12 carbons long, MCFAs are readily oxidized in the liver, which leads to greater energy expenditure (EE) via enhanced thermogenesis. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are obtained from food sources (e.g., coconut oil) and are typically concentrated forms of caprylic and capric MCFAs through lipid fractionation. The potential for MCT blends to increase energy expenditure (EE) has been noted among adult subjects with effective dosages as low as 5 g. However, no studies have investigated potentially effective dosage levels for obese children. This study is for producing an organic baking fat that will increase EE in obese children and 1) assist with weight management; 2) reduce risk of metabolic syndrome in obese children and adolescents; 3) resist oxidation; 4) is appropriate for baking and one-time sauteing ; 5) offer at least 225mg of n-3 PUFAs per serving; and 6) provide oxidative stability and radical scavenging activity without using synthetic fats or preservatives. The results of this study will be used to develop a unique non-butter baking stick based on Rich & Creamy Melt Organic, a commercially available product in the U.S. (www.meltbutteryspread.com). A cooking version of Melt fills an unaddressed need in the marketplace. All non-butter cooking sticks (but one) contain partially hydrogenated oils. The exception is a cooking stick manufactured by Earth Balance, whose dominant ingredients are soybean and canola oils, which are highly unstable in heat and thus are inappropriate for baking and sauteing.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
768,"Obesity and osteoporosis are major public health concerns due to their prevalence in our increasingly sedentary and aging society. In the U.S. today, an estimated 55% of people 50 and older are at risk for developing osteoporosis. Because as much as 20% of bone mass can be lost in the first five to seven years following menopause, osteoporosis is a major health issue for aging women. In 2005, osteoporosis-related fractures were responsible for an estimated $19 billion in costs. By 2025, these costs are predicted to rise to approximately $25.3 billion, and over the next 50 years, the national cost may be as high as $240 billion. These studies indicate the tremendous financial and personal burden of increased postmenopausal adiposity and bone loss in elderly women. The relationship between bone and fat is not completely understood. In fact, adult obesity was thought to protect against bone loss at various skeletal sites and body weight has previously been used as a positive predictor of bone mineral density. However, more recent studies reveal that obesity does not protect against decreases in bone mass; instead, increased adiposity contributes to the reduction in bone mass. Further, several studies investigating the contribution of lean mass versus fat mass have reported fat mass to negatively correlate with bone density, while lean tissue mass is positively correlated. The effect of weight loss on bone density may be difficult to predict and will likely depend on diet composition, changes in metabolic status and relative proportions of lean vs. fat tissue loss. Some studies have shown decreased bone mineral density with weight loss, while others have shown no bone loss. Improvement in metabolic status is likely to improve bone health over the long term, since metabolic disorder is associated with bone loss. With the recognition that traditional hormone replacement therapy can be associated with increased risk of breast cancer, heart disease and stroke, more women than ever are turning to alternative methods of managing menopause symptoms and associated physiological changes. Although many nutritional supplements are marketed, with the exception of soy, few botanical products have been tested clinically for efficacy in preventing bone loss or weight gain after menopause. Research sponsored by AptoTec, Inc. has demonstrated the synergistic enhancement of activity with combinations of specific natural compounds and vitamin D, which we believe will lead to a new strategy for preventing the increase in bone loss and adiposity that occurs with the onset of menopause.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Corn is a major ingredient of turkey feed and high corn prices as observed in 2008 and 2010 may become status quo. Poor flock performance has been characterized as less than optimal flock weight at market and poor uniformity of body weight. While numerous causes maybe responsible for this condition, enteric health of the young bird is an area which needs further study. Nutrition and management can play a key role in solving the challenges facing the turkey producer. A corn by-product of ethanol production is distillers dried grains with solubles which can be used as a feed ingredient to lower feed price but it is currently used at low inclusion levels in the feed as some of its properties such variable nutrient content and poorly digestible protein and fiber. Likewise, while soybean meal is an excellent protein source, it also contains some complex carbohydrates that are indigestible. These characteristics could lower the energy value of both products and have negative effects on the gut environment.

Variations in genome structure consist of chromosomal rearrangements (inversions and translocations), segmental and gene duplications, and copy number variations (CNVs) in the form of deletions, duplications, and insertions. There is more interest in understanding the role of variations in genome structure in plant phenotypes. These variations may account for those not captured by DNA marker-based genetic studies. In several studies, it has been shown that variations in genome structure contribute extensively to genetic variability influencing phenotypic variation in plants, livestock, and humans. This proposed project will contribute to our fundamental understanding of the domestication of apple along its historical and evolutionary paths by profiling the genomic structure of the apple. By uncovering structural genomic variations, such as those CNVs in wild and cultivated apples, this will shed some light on the impact of selection and domestication on CNVs. Knowledge of sequence-based polymorphisms will reveal genome-wide LD patterns. SNPs in candidate genes will display LD patterns in genes of economic interest. Sequence-based polymorphism and candidate gene based SNPs will also reveal those signatures of selective sweeps in genes and genomic regions of apples, respectively. It is anticipated that candidate genes as well as genome-wide association mapping will identify genes involved in fruit quality traits. The abundance of genomics resources, including SNPs and CNVs, that will be generated in this study will also have a significant impact on U.S. and world-wide apple breeding programs.

771,"It is important to devise effective methods of prevention of food contamination by pathogens. In order to design synthetic antimicrobial peptides that are more effective in deactivation of pathogens with improved selectivity, it is necessary to quantify their role in pore formation of cell membranes. The effectiveness of synthetic peptides in pore formation is governed by the conformation of molecule when interacting with cell membrane. Computer simulation will be employed to determine this for different amino acid sequence of peptides to help in their design. Pore formation will be quantified by monitoring leakage of a flourscent dye from the cell. Mathematical models will be developed to (i) elucidate the mechanism of pore formation and (ii) the relationship between the peptide structure and nucleation rate of pores in cell membranes.

772,"Crop and forage production in the Southern Great Plains continues to be challenged by abiotic and biotic stresses that limit yield and profitability. Although commodity prices have risen substantially in recent years, input costs have also climbed and profitability has not improved. Growers need to have more crop options, particularly genotypes of alternative, vegetable, or specialty crops, in order to optimize profitability. Possible alternatives include the vegetable crops that have a higher per acre return. Another alternative is to refine the production of dual-purpose crops so that growers can make in-season decisions that optimize profitability. Although research comparing performance of varieties among the major crops such as soybean, corn, and wheat are prevalent, there are much fewer data that compare vegetable varieties for yield and quality in the Southern Great Plains. Potential vegetable crops for the southern Great Plains include seed legumes, specialty oilseed grains, root-type crops, and leafy greens. Because fertilizer nitrogen applications are costly and have environmental consequences, seed legumes, such as pigeonpea and edamame (vegetable soybean for the fresh market), offer an obvious solution. Secondly, winter grain alternatives for winter wheat in the southern Great Plains are also needed and safflower has recently shown promise but most the data are from elsewhere. Root-type crops offer a third alternative, especially for the winter season. The fourth cropping category with promise in the Southern Great Plains is leafy greens. For edamame, a mechanical one-row harvester was introduced to improve pod harvest in the early 1990s and later, a stationary pod stripper was introduced used to eliminate pod removal by hand for situations where a mechanical harvester is unavailable.

This research is linked to food safety and therefore has direct relevance to the mission of the AgBioResearch. While about 175 different types of foods have been documented to trigger an allergic reaction in sensitized subjects, 90% of food allergies are due to 8 major food types: Chicken egg, cow's milk, soybean, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, fish and shellfish. Notably, as reviewed recently, improved methods for predicting allergenicity of food proteins are critically needed. A promising approach is to test if a dietary protein might induce allergic reactions in a validated food allergy mouse model. However, a validated mouse model of food allergy is not available at present to evaluate allergenicity of novel foods. Consequently, development and validation of mouse models for assessment of allergenic potential of novel foods was identified as a critical need by experts.

The objectives 1 and 2 of the proposed research, further advances this critical area of research. Besides direct application for assessment of allergenic potential of food, an animal model would have several other critical applications. First, a food allergy model should help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of allergic responses to food-derived proteins that are poorly understood at present. Second, development of effective therapeutic and preventive methods is also critically dependent on the availability of an in vivo disease model. Third, the role of environmental toxicants/dietary factors in induction/exacerbation/prevention of food allergy can be investigated using this model. Finally, this model can also be used to evaluate the impact of food processing on food allergenicity, focus of objective 3 of this proposal.

Exhaustible resources include crude oil, natural gas, coal, and numerous minerals such as bauxite, copper, iron, lead, nickel, phosphate, tin, zinc, gold and silver. Renewable resources include forested land, harvestable fish stocks, and distributable supplies of fresh water. Natural resources are utilized by most sectors of an economy, and comprise a significant share of foreign trade. In this regard, the agricultural-food sector competes with the rest of the economy for natural resources. For example, residential water demand competes with agricultural production in California. Another example is where global soybean demand contributes to deforestation in Brazil, which in turn increases Brazilian soybean production place downward pressure on prices received by U.S. soy producers, affecting their ability to compete for capital and labor. Given the interplay between natural resource availability and its final and derived demands is an economy wide phenomenon, understanding the effects of increasing natural resource scarcity on the agricultural-food sector require an analysis with macroeconomic foundations. Certainly, much attention has been given to problems associated with natural resource exploitation, especially as it relates to the effects of economy wide levels of fossil fuel consumption on global warming.

In order to ensure a healthy and plentiful food supply, it is critical that we understand the natural means which plants use to protect themselves and thereby ultimately produce food and fiber for humans to use. This project is designed to identify some of the natural genetic and biochemical mechanisms that are important for plant defense. We will measure how the expression patterns of some genes change after plants are exposed to stresses, such as high salt, high temperature, and insect pests. This information should aid us in developing molecular markers, based on DNA sequences, that will be useful for plant breeders who are actively developing improved crop varieties. We will use sensitive techniques for measuring the levels of specific plant compounds, which have been suggested as perhaps important in defense against pests. In addition to these DNA-based molecular techniques, and the analytical chemistry techniques, we will take advantage of the spectrum of genetic diversity among plants by screening multiple varieties of plants for their growth performance when they are subjected various stresses. Much of our work on environmental stress will focus on crops that are important throughout the U.S., such as soybean and rice. Our project on defensive compounds will be centered on a legume plant called Medicago truncatula. This plant species is useful because it has a broad genetic background, it is a legume that requires very little nitrogen for growth, and because it produces a broad array of complex anti-microbial and anti-insect compounds. Our ultimate goals in this work are to be able to apply the information gained to use the naturally occurring plant-defense mechanisms to produce improved crop varieties.

778,"Plant parasitic nematodes are devastating pathogens of all agricultural crop plants. The use of pathogens to suppress nematode growth in theory represents a sustainable, self-renewing nematode control strategy. New microbial pathogens of plant nematodes may play important roles in nematode suppression, particularly in agricultural systems where soil disturbance is minimized. Viruses have not been utilized as nematode biological control agents because nematodes were thought to be immune to viruses. This idea was proven incorrect by the recent discovery of four viruses in the soybean cyst nematode (SCN). Nematode viruses may have novel properties that will make them more effective than other biocontrol agents. For example, viruses can be very stable and persist in the soil, they do not need to form complicated infection structures, they can be grown at commercial scales, and they have relatively simple genomes that can be manipulated to alter their pathogenicity. They can of course replicate and spread in nematode populations and some, like the SCN viruses, are able to decrease the viability of nematode eggs. The potential to reduce the viability of nematode eggs is a novel aspect of this project since the reduction of egg viability is particularly important for the control of many plant parasitic nematodes where the viable eggs in the soil enables the pathogen to persist for years. Nematode viruses have the ability to control nematodes in all stages of their life cycle making them a potentially effective, ecologically-based control strategy.

Interest in cover crops has increased but these do complicate N management. Soil acidity management is important and technology for site specific lime application needs to be improved. Research by diverse inter-disciplinary teams will be needed to fully achieve opportunities while solving emerging and potential problems. Applied and adaptive research is proposed. 1) Criteria will be developed for site-specific lime application approaches. 2) Prediction of the occurrence of iron deficiency induced chlorosis, and site specific management options will be developed using various data layers including yield maps, aerial photos and soil pH maps developed from on-the-go sensing. 3) The zone where skip-row planting of grain sorghum is preferable to conventional planting will be determined. 4) Manure N management will be improved for greater N use efficiency, less nitrous oxide emission, and less ammonia volatilization and other N losses. 5) Decisions on use of N fertilizer enhancement products depend on the level of N loss risk and we intend to develop a decision tool for N management that considers the probability of N loss for a field and management system and enables testing of alternative practices. 6) The problem of yield loss associated with cover crops appears to be an issue of N availability that we propose to address with sensor technology. Research of these topics is feasible and each has good potential of making significant impact on crop production in Nebraska and the Midwest. The potential annual impacts at the farm-gate have been conservatively estimated for: a mean 2 bu increase in soybean yield by overcoming iron deficiency induced chlorosis in northeast Nebraska with a benefit cost ratio of 4-6; site-specific lime application ($3,600,000); skip-row planting of sorghum ($6,500,000); partial factor productivity of fertilizer N applied to corn in Nebraska is about 60 lb grain per lb N but a mean value of >90 achieve with N applied to maximize net returns to fertilizer in 32 high yield trials (Wortmann et al., 2010), more efficient use of the 75,000 t/yr of manure organic N applied in Nebraska is feasible, and improved productivity and NUE in cover crop fields.

781,"There is limited incentive in the private sector to create and distribute information publicly about crop management because of the necessity to control proprietary information. The generation of novel and timely crop management information therefore remains a critical outcome for publicly-funded agronomic research. Increasing yield of corn and soybeans, while sustaining the natural resource base and increasing resource use efficiency, impacts the current and future economic returns from more than 20 million acres of farmland in Iowa alone. Maximizing producer profit margins is a critical goal in an increasingly competitive world market. Sustaining the high level and quality of food and fiber production in U.S. agriculture requires novel approaches to reduce risk to producers, while protecting the natural resource base for society. Risks to producers result largely from weather- and pest-related stresses that constrain crop development and decrease yield and quality. While numerous genotypes and management options are available to soybean growers in Iowa, specific genotypic characteristics may be suited best to maximize production efficiency and minimize production risks for a given set of soil and climatic conditions. Linking categories of genotypes to appropriate management strategies is facilitated by a fundamental understanding of physiological mechanisms that control environmental effects on plant development. The studies described in this proposal include constraints on soybean production such as weeds, insects, pathogens, or weather. It is important to recognize that increasing yield is a function of both improved plant genetics through breeding and a modification of the growing environment through agronomic decisions, and improved placement of varieties in those environments. As such, all three need to be optimized to improve farmer profitability. The focus on maximum corn yield is driven by the need to meet the ever-increasing demand for corn in Iowa in the next four to five decades. Some forecasters eying population growth and increased consumption patterns suggest that we'll need to double food production by 2050. Two immediate avenues exist to obtain enough corn to meet demand; either we increase acreage dedicated to corn production, or dramatically increase corn yield per acre. Currently, Iowa corn yields increase about 2.5 bushels per acre per year while that of the U.S. ranges around 2.0 bushels per acre per year. To double current yields from the 2012 prospective of 14.6 million acres of corn would require average production of over 344 bushels per acre. At current trends, Iowa yields may reach 300 bu/acre in 2061. Research on increasing corn yield potential is critical to meet the impending demand for corn.

782,"Bioactive Food Components for Optimal Health remains one of the USDA NIFA programs requesting proposals that focus on bioavailability, function and efficacy of bioactive dietary components. Among the food constituents that is gaining much interest are bioactive peptides and phytochemicals, namely soy isoflavones. Research on bioactive peptides from soy protein origin is still in its infancy stage, but has a great potential for growth. One of our current goals is to develop economical enzymatic systems that are capable of releasing bioactive peptides from soy protein. However, one of the major drawbacks for the expanded use of soy proteins is their allergenicity. In the United States (US), soybean is recognized by the FDA as one of the big eight food allergens. Therefore, another major focus is the reduction of soy protein allergenicity following controlled enzymatic hydrolysis and induced Maillard conjugation. Soy isoflavones, on the other hand, have gained substantial interest in the past two decades. However, bioavailability, bioactivity and structural fate of isoflavones have been the subject of controversial research. Specifically, literature reports conflicting results with regard to isoflavone loss during processing, their content and profile in different matrices, and their bioavailabilty. Disregarding the effect of structural differences and the association with the protein moiety on the stability and bioavailability of isoflavones, will certainly lead to conflicting results. Additionally, inconsistency in isoflavone research can be attributed to the inadequate profiling of isoflavones, lack of standardization of the source of isoflavones (different soy matrices and supplements), and lack of standard analytical methods for quantifying isoflavones present in different soy matrices (NIH Scientific Workshop, July 2009). We are convinced that these inconsistencies are due to differences in the bioavailability of the different isoflavone forms consumed. Studies often neglect profiling of ingested isoflavone forms, making it impossible to determine whether these inconsistencies are largely due to differences in bioavailability. Since isoflavones in soy foods differ in their forms large differences may exist in their bioavailability. Therefore, it is crucial to adequately profile the administered isoflavones and study the effect of their conjugation and isomerization on their bioavailability. Therefore, our goal is to study the chemical conversions and bioavailability of isoflavones as affected by chemical structure and protein association, following novel analytical techniques. Results of the proposed work will lead to the chemical characterization and identification of dietary bioactive components, namely soy isoflavone derivatives and bioactive peptides. And also this work will provide ways to utilize soy protein ingredients safely with optimum contribution to health.

784,"Since the inception of the State of ND in 1889, agriculture has been the foundation of the state's economy. Data collected by the author (Shaik, S 2007a) from historical census of agriculture and the National Agricultural Statistical Services reveals that the number of farms in North Dakota has declined from 74,400 in 1910 to 30,300 in 2006. The corresponding acreage amount of farms in North Dakota increased from 28,427 thousand acres to 39,400 thousand acres leading to an increase in farm size from 382 acres to 1,300 acres. A century ago, North Dakota was overwhelmingly a wheat state; today the leading crops are oil crops. According to North Dakota Agricultural Statistical Service publication, the state ranks first in the production of barley, durum wheat, spring wheat, all dry edible beans, pinto beans, navy beans, sunflower, canola, flaxseed, oats, dry edible peas. It ranks second in all wheat, lentils and honey, third in sugar beets and rye; fourth in potatoes, and tenth in soybeans. The farm receipts increased from 0.257 billion nominal dollars in 1924 to 3.98 billion nominal dollars in 2006. During the same time period, the crop and livestock receipts increased from 0.197 and 0.60 billion nominal dollars to 3.089 and 0.897 billion nominal dollars respectively. These changes in North Dakota due to technological improvements, farm programs, farm crop insurance programs and public investments will be quantified for the fourteen (including the 2008 farm bill) major farm bills since 1933.

785,"Justification: 1. Iron deficiency chlorosis is the most significant soil-related constraint to soybean production on poorly-drained soils of North Dakota. Soybeans often grow poorly on soils with CaCO3 in the topsoil, due to the inability of the plants to acquire iron from the soil, and related problems associated with inefficient transport of iron within the plant. It has been estimated that this disorder causes soybean yield losses valued $120,000,000 per year in the North Central USA. The anticipated practical outcome of this objective is the identification of cultural practices that help farmers reduce the severity of chlorosis on their fields. 2. Nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies are the most common nutrient deficiencies affecting wheat in North Dakota. We have observed significant variation in the phosphorus requirements of different wheat varieties. We believe that we have developed accurate greenhouse screening procedures for this trait. Even small savings would add up. North Dakota farmers apply an average of 35-40 lb/A of P2O5 equivalent to wheat, according to USDA statistics. If this value could be reduced by even 10 lb P2O5/A per year, the savings to North Dakota farmers would be significant. More importantly, if more phosphorus-efficient varieties were developed, the variation of yield due to inherent phosphorus variability across a field would be reduced. Also, with less phosphorus being applied, less phosphorus would be reach surface waters, providing an environmental benefit. 3. West of the Red River Valley, problems associated with poorly-drained soils, such as iron deficiency chlorosis, are much less common. Drought stress is the most common soil-related constraint to soybean production. A whole-season evapotranspiration of about 18 inches is possible with a vigorous, well-watered soybean crop. However, the supply of water, growing season precipitation plus stored soil water at the beginning of the growing season, usually falls short of that amount on well-drained soils. One cultural practice that has not been evaluated in this region is the use of antitranspirants, compounds that induce the plant to use less water. Reducing water use earlier in the season, in order to preserve stored soil water for later in the season, could help with the production of soybeans in central North Dakota. The use of antitranspirants has not been widely studied in the USA, but has been shown to increase yield of other crops in other countries under water-limiting conditions. A comprehensive screening of established antitranspirants in the greenhouse would be an inexpensive first step in the evaluation of this technology. It is likely that cultural practices for the mitigation of the effects of drought will be of intense interest in the next 10 years. The major biotech seed companies (Monsanto, Pioneer, etc.) are beginning to promise huge gains in drought resistance in corn, and this will likely lead to a broader interest in all aspects of this topic.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
786,"Soybeans are one of the primary crops in the US, with critical importance for biofuel, oil production, feed, and export. The US production value in 2011 was almost $40 billion nationwide, and $1.7 billion in South Dakota. Insect pests can substantially impact soybean production, and thus negatively affect our agricultural economy. An example of such a pest is the soybean aphid, an invasive species which has caused serious harm to soybean production in Midwestern states. Other existing and emerging soybean pests such as spider mites, bean leaf beetles, grasshoppers, Japanese beetles, and stink bugs also impact production. This project directly supports the agricultural industry of the state and region by providing unbiased, science-based information to inform the pest management activities and decisions of agricultural producers and the other ag professionals who support them. The research focus of this project is on the biology, ecology, integrated pest management (IPM), and biological control of soybean insect pests. The ultimate goal is more sustainable and profitable soybean production systems. This will involve experimentation and data collection to better-understand management approaches such as biological control (i.e., beneficial insects that prey upon pests), resistant varieties, and techniques to minimize pesticide use, and how to make these approaches work together. Another important aspect of this project is that the research will be integrated with information delivery via Cooperative Extension, to improve transmission to intended audiences. This information transfer is more efficient because the project director has responsibilities for both research and Extension. The intended audiences of this work are farmers, crop consultants, and commodity groups, Extension personnel, other scientists working in this area, students and postdoctoral trainees. The expected outputs of this project are: (Activities) conducting and analyzing experiments, training students and/or postdoctoral trainees, facilitating collaborations among other soybean professionals in the USDA and Land Grant universities; (Events) demonstration sites for producers, college and departmental field day tours, and symposia at professional meetings; (Service) assisting with ID of insect specimens submitted to the pest diagnostic lab at South Dakota State University; (Products) data sets, scientific publications and presentations, collaborations fostered by the project, information for soybean producers and fellow scientists, and information to integrate into Extension programming. Outputs will be evaluated for impact through the Cooperative Extension side of this program, which includes pre/post surveys, metrics to assess information access, and metrics to assess points-of-contact.

788,"Bioenergy production forecasts call for the use of marginal lands for biomass production in order to avoid competition with food crops. Marginal croplands that unable to support economic returns typically have intrinsic factors that limit production. In these Northeast US these factors are commonly seasonal wetness and/or limited rooting depth. Second generation bioenergy crops such as perennial grasses are generally thought to be more tolerant of adverse soil characteristics than are first generation annual energy crops (corn, soybeans), but their adaptation, performance and environmental impacts on marginal soils of NY are still poorly defined. The core of a sustainable bioenergy system is healthy soil and thus it is important to understand how soil quality is maintained or enhanced and how efficiently nutrients are conserved on marginal soils, in addition to ensuring economically viable yields. It is also desirable to understand the underlying mechanisms that can enhance efficient nutrient cycling and soil enrichment in order to optimize both yields and sustainability. This proposed research takes synergistic advantage of new large-scale long-term bioenergy field sites being developed under another grant (hereinafter referred to as the core grant) in order to answer important questions about nutrient dynamics, soil quality trends and carbon sequestration mechanisms on marginal soils. This proposed work is beyond the scope of the original core project but takes full advantage of the robust experimental system being developed. Our intended impact is to encourage development of sustainable bioenergy crop production on marginal lands that are vulnerable under conventional crop production. Bioenergy crops are anticipated to provide rural development benefits by diversifying farm crops, creating an alternative source of income for landowners, and circulating energy dollars through local economies. Growers and energy consumers will benefit from locally-produced renewable energy resources. An early outcome will be the development of an expanded large-scale experimental system which will enable synergistic multidisciplinary research. In this context we will be able to cross-correlate and understand trends in crop yields, nutrient dynamics/losses, soil health and carbon accumulation, all in the context of marginal soils that are the primary bioenergy land resource base for NY. Given NY's abundant water resources, large marginal land resource base and a large population base that can benefit from energy products, a sustainable bioenergy system will produce benefits and thus beneficiaries on multiple scales. Immediate economic benefits accrue to feedstock producers, employees, processors and distribution channels.

We will conduct six feeding experiments to test to test effects of various levels of defatted algal meal from biofuel production on growth performance, biochemical response, nutritional and health values of meats and eggs, and potential toxicity in corn-soybean meal based diets for broiler chickens, laying hens, and weanling pigs. This project helps address two major real-world issues/problems. The first is about the steady supply and now sources of feed protein for the animal production. Feed accounts for 75% of the total expense of animal production and protein represents the second most expensive feed ingredient. The most commonly-used feed protein supplement is soybean meal that is added at 20 to 30% in diets for swine and poultry. In the US, 6 million metric tons of soybean meal is used for only pig feeding per year. With an increasing demand for human consumption due to the population expansion, the continuous use of soybean meal as the major feed protein will become more expensive and less steady. Many algal species contain 45 to 55% of protein. Although the amino acid profile and the nutritional quality of the algal proteins are only slightly inferior to the high-quality proteins, there has been no systematic nutritional assessment of algal proteins or any attempt to improve their quality as a feed supplement. The second issue is that the biofuel production is still less affordable than fossil sources of energy in terms of efficiency. Using co-products as high-quality animal feed protein will add cash values to make this industry competitive.

792,"If Hawai`i desires to become self-sufficient, increase local production of food, reduce dependency on imports and diversify its economy, there needs to be a sustainable agricultural industry that is vertically integrated in Hawai`i. One of the inherent problems of producing and selling more fruits and vegetables is the concomitant increase in a larger volume of off-grade or cull fruits and vegetables. Lower grade fruits and vegetables have some blemish, are disfigured and can be too large, too small, too green (picked too early) or too ripe. These lower grades of produce do not command as high a price as a better quality product, and often cannot even be sold when brought to market. Similarly, local food processors often produce large quantities of by-products when manufacturing the main product (i.e. large quantities of okara are produced as by-product during the manufacture of tofu). If these cull fruits and vegetables and processing by-products can be converted into value-added items, farmers (and food processors) can recoup some of the cost of previously discarded fruits and vegetables (and by-products) by having them processed into value-added items. The proposed project fulfills CTAHR/USDA Goals 1 and 2 by utilizing the mature or immature off-grade fruits and vegetables and processing by-products as starting material and converting them into value-added commodities.

There is an urgent need to improve and integrate management tactics for control of this widespread, persistent, yield-decreasing soybean pest. It is our aim to conduct region-wide coordinated research directed toward reducing losses due to SCN. The most recent loss estimates for corn-parasitic nematodes suggest an average loss of 1% across the NCR. This is considerably lower than loss estimates across the region from a decade earlier, likely reflecting reduced emphasis on corn-parasitic nematodes among NCR nematologists. Recently, however, there has been a renewed focus on nematodes that parasitize corn because of concerns about unforeseen impacts on nematode pest populations resulting from changing corn production management practices, such as an increased focus on conservation tillage and a reduced reliance on traditional soil-applied insecticide-nematicides, and due to the development of new seed treatments for nematode protection and control. In contrast to the situation in soybean, there are several types of plant-parasitic nematodes that occur commonly, and often jointly, in corn production fields across the region and that have been implicated in crop damage. Principal among these are the root-lesion nematodes (RLN), with at least six distinct species encountered in NCR corn fields. Although damage relationships are well documented for several RLN species, the risk of damage from other commonly occurring nematode genera and species or from complexes of multiple nematode species remains largely unknown for corn in the NCR. Furthermore, as management options are more limited for corn-parasitic nematodes compared to those for SCN, the need to improve and integrate management tactics is particularly urgent.

794,"Our current ignorance of most of the mechanisms involved in plant iron homeostasis is a major obstacle in devising approaches for biofortification of staple foods with iron. Biofortification refers to the genetic engineering of staple crops to accumulate additional bioavailable iron in edible parts, and is widely regarded as a sustainable means of improving the iron nutrition of the 2-3 billion people worldwide (World Health Organization; http://www.who.int/nut/ida.htm) whose inadequate diet causes iron deficiency anemia. Understanding these transport mechanisms is the key to allowing enhanced seed iron accumulation through either engineering or through marker assisted breeding efforts. Improving our understanding of plant iron homeostatic mechanisms is also critical if we wish to improve growth of crops in marginal soils, where iron deficiency frequently limits crop growth. This problem is of particular concern for growth of upland rice (i.e., non-paddy rice), which is an increasingly important crop in Asia as water resources become more limited. It is also a growing problem in the North American soybean crop, as soy production moves into less favorable northern latitudes. Plant's efficient use of iron within tissues is a promising target to address these issues, provided that additional information about such mechanisms becomes available. By carefully characterizing the Yellow Stripe-Like (YSL) transporter family in corn, we will gain much needed insight into the molecular mechanisms that this important crop species uses to maintain proper iron homeostasis. Even more importantly, the detailed molecular information that will be obtained will suggest strategies that can be used to alter the pattern of iron distribution in corn, and will thus aid in the development of novel strategies to achieve iron biofortification.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The primary rationale for project results from there being no single coordinated source of parasitic nematode information currently available for the NCR farmers. Incorporating information into both a website and a smart phone application that can be used as a decision support tool will place comprehensive information in the hands and literally at the fingertips of farmers anytime they need it. We plan to assemble a dynamic web-based database including corn and soybean variety evaluations related to nematode resistance, information on the distribution of virulence phenotypes for SCN populations, information for nematode management and new commercial seed treatments, and threshold for each major corn-parasitic nematode in the NCR. This information will be used to develop a smart-phone based decision support tool.

With this increased interest, it is expected that farmers can benefit from a new application focused on assisting with farm management and production decisions. Leveraging NCR farmers interest in new applications, a smart phone application can add something useful and exciting to the business of farm management. Simply reproducing the website on a mobile device does not have the utility potential, whereas a smartphone application that is a decision support tool may have practical and applied value for the user.

These bradyrhizobia are very diverse and can differ greatly in how effectively they supply soybean with nitrogen. One mechanism contributing to bacterial diversity in general is infection by certain viruses which become part of the bacterial DNA. These viruses are called temperate viruses. I have evidence that soybean bradyrhizobia can contain temperate phages, and it is possible that these viruses are partly responsible for bradyrhizobial diversity, including traits important in determining soybean host growth.

800,"Millions of children in the United States and throughout the world suffer from food allergies. The phenomenal increase in atopic diseases, such as asthma and respiratory disorders in children, in recent years necessitates doubling our efforts on food protein-related allergy prevention strategies in infants. Cow&#39;s milk protein allergy alone affects about 2.5% of children under the age of three. A significant number of infants who are allergic to cow&#39;s milk protein also concomitantly develop soy protein allergy. The allergic reactions manifest in the form of skin irritation, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. In severe cases, it leads to life threatening anaphylactic reactions. The allergenicity of milk, egg, wheat, and soy proteins in children is attributed mainly to the IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Using physical, chemical, and biochemical modifications, it is possible to eliminate the immune-reactive epitopes of milk proteins and develop food products that are suitable for feeding children with severe milk protein allergy. In this respect, while thermal denaturation could decrease and/or eliminate the allergenicity of conformational epitopes of protein allergens, it alone cannot eliminate the allergy caused by sequence-specific linear epitopes. Systematic studies are needed on physical, chemical, and enzymatic modification, and/or combination thereof of food proteins to produce novel protein products with non-native structures, branched-chain structures, and sequence-disrupted epitopes, so that they contain no or reduced allergic properties but possess the molecular characteristics necessary for imparting sensory and functional properties in food matrices. In the proposed research, milk proteins will be first hydrolyzed using novel proteases and the protein hydrolysate will be subsequently polymerized using transglutaminase to produce epitope-disrupted branched neo-polypeptides with potentially low allergenicity.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
801,"Apomixis is succinctly defined as clonal reproduction through seeds. Its introduction into major crops would allow the development of true-breeding hybrids. Three points in ovule development are altered in apomicts. 1) Meiosis either aborts while neighboring nuclear cells enlarge to form aposporous initials or is never initiated when the megaspore mother cell divides mitotically (diplospory). 2) The chromosomally unreduced egg in aposporous or diplosporous embryo sacs develops in the absence of fertilization (parthenogenesis). 3) Endosperm is initiated as in sexual reproduction (pseudogamous) or in the absence of fertilization (autonomous). Progeny of an apomictic plant are genetically identical to the seed parent. This method of clonal propagation has distinct advantages over vegetative propagation in terms of size and longevity of propagules. A better understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the trait is necessary before apomixis can be manipulated in crop plants. Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is a globally significant legume crop with economic importance for the southern US and particularly Georgia. Peanut breeding in conducted almost exclusively in the public sector with no major corporate programs existing. Peanut is biologically unusual in that it flowers above ground but fruits underground (geocarpic). The underground fruiting habit places special cultural constraints on the crop for pest and disease control and seed development.

Therefore, cultural and crop management systems research is essential for profitability in a changing technology environment. Replicated field studies with appropriate experimental designs and analyses will be conducted to evaluate: pest management strategies; bed height and longevity; crop residue management; poultry litter management; seeding rates; and new seed traits for improved row crop production efficiencies and whole farm profitability. The studies will be conducted in a manner such that the research components being evaluated are able to express their fullest potential. In the bed height and longevity study, we expect no-till production to be successful without yield losses on old beds (initial height of 8 to 9 inches) for 3 to 5 years. We also expect corn to show more yield sensitivity to shallow (less than 3 inches) bed heights than soybeans. In the poultry litter management study, we expect the rotation of crops with different nutrient requirements in combination with poultry litter and rotation with inorganic fertilizer to supply crop nutrient needs and avoid the buildup of phosphorus in the soil. In the crop residue and tillage system effect on soil quality, yield, and net returns study, we expect the no-burning of crop residues in combination with crop rotation and one-pass tillage systems to improve soil organic matter, soil aggregate stability, and maintain yield in comparison to burning crop residue and additional tillage. In the weed management strategies studies, we expect the use of selected preemergence herbicides to be more effective than continuous use of glyphosate in reducing the potential for the development of new resistant biotype weeds.

Incorporation of hydrolyzed protein blends possesses the potential key to solving the problems found with proteins inhibiting expansion by forming highly ordered matrices. From the findings from this proposed study, we will be able to determine the relationship between the degree of hydrolysis of the proteins in the formulation and the physical and sensory characteristics of the resulting high protein snack product, which will further demonstrate the potential for commercialization of high protein extruded snacks and increase utilization of whey and soy protein ingredients in a novel product concept.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
806,"The well established procedures of conventional breeding and selection for important agronomic traits will be implemented in this project. The critical strategy for achieving the breeding objective is to combine the best traits from different varieties and/or lines. The breeding scheme can be summarized in three basic steps: 1) selection of parents with desired characteristics and intercrossing them, 2) growing resulting populations for 4-5 generations to allow genetic segregation/recombination and then reach genetic homozygosity (true-breeding), and 3) selecting and evaluating pure lines from each cross. Each year we will make 150-200 different crosses between UA-developed high yielding lines and other southern varieties/lines with different maturities or disease resistant germplasm. The plant populations at early generations will be advanced using a bulk pod descent method, and 6000 to 8000 F4:5 families will be evaluated for adaptation and agronomic performance. Selection for RR will start early in the breeding process using the combination of bulk pod descent and mass selection methods. Off-season nursery facilities will be used to speed up the breeding process. For the preliminary yield trial, we will test 800 to 1200 new lines (mostly MG 4 and 5 along with some 3s and 6s). Approximately 100-120 lines will be selected and evaluated in advanced trials in AR and the southern region. Typically, selected lines will be tested at 3 locations with 3 replications and further evaluated at 5 locations to ensure the stability and adaptability in AR.

Likewise, the selection of the right variety to plant in a given environment is important and has a direct impact on profitability, so there is the need for unbiased comparison of the varieties available to producers in any locality since cotton and soybean varieties have been found to significantly differ in their adaptation to the environment.

810,"The steady increased consumption of livestock products observed since 1950 is expected to keep growing until at least 2030, adding more pressure to an already stressed environment. Promoting a higher consumption of plant-based proteins could alleviate the environmental impact, possibly by increasing consumption of soybean, one of the crops having the highest protein content. Soybean is also the second largest food-crop in the US with a total acreage of over 75 million and a crop value of over $19 billion in 2006. In Virginia, soybean is the largest acreage crop with a production of 21 million bushels in 2009 and a crop value of $200 million to local agricultural economies. While improving soybean seed protein and oil content has been the aim of decades of research, the identity of the genes controlling these traits is still elusive. An alternative to conventional breeding would involve increasing of the flux of amino acids, the precursors of proteins, from leaves to seeds. These flux were shown to be correlated to seed protein content. Such a change in amino acid flux can be achieved by genetic manipulation of genes involved in the control of the amino acid transport. Unfortunately, many of the genes responsible for amino acid transport remain unknown. This gap in our knowledge impairs our understanding of amino acid transport in plants and is a serious bottleneck for biotechnology approaches. The first part of the proposed project aims at identifying amino acid exporters and understanding their role in the plant. We want to know how many genes are responsible for amino acid export in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and how they are involved in the transfer of amino acids from the leaves to the seeds. The second part of the project aims at understanding how amino acid transport is controlled at the cellular level and identifying which genes are involved in this control. This approach will lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms used by the plant to control the activity of amino acid transporters and the amino acid flux they mediate between the different organs. The various genes isolated by this project could be used as genetic tools to engineer plants with enhanced amino acid transport towards the seeds or the roots. Change in amino acid transport is also expected to lead to changes in nitrogen absorption from the soil and utilization by the plant. Beyond the creation of crops with higher seed protein content, providing an abundant source of proteins for human consumption, the engineered plants could display a more efficient nitrogen use, reducing nitrogen run-off and pollution.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
811,"The biorefinery is an emerging technology in which biomass, instead of crude oil, serves as the feedstock for the productions of biofuels and biochemicals. The high demand for fuel ethanol has driven academia and industry to investigate ethanol production using the most abundant nonfood plant resource - lignocellulosic biomass. While scientists and engineers are still searching for viable methods to convert all the biomass components to value-added fuels, they also realize that, as in a refinery, the co-products can add significant value to the primary products (fuels) being produced from the biomass. Lignin takes up to 30% of the mass of lignincellulosics and has not found viable value-added applications. In addition, some natural chemicals from biorefinery processes have the potential for value-added high performance polymer products but are currently underutilized. For example, the tall oil, a byproduct from the Kraft pulp process, mainly consists of rosin and fatty acids and both are important feedstock chemicals. Capturing the values of co-products of biorefinery and maximizing their industrial utilizations will greatly enhance the economic competiveness of lignocellulosic biomass-to-ethanol conversion. Some agricultural residues which are polymer or polymer mixtures in nature, for example, soy meal and sugar beet pulp, could be valuable feedstocks for polymer materials but are currently underutilized. We anticipate that the proposed research will promote the following outcomes: (1) developing technologies using biorefinery coproducts and agricultural residues for new biobased polymers and polymer materials; (2) identifying and implementing renewable feedstock chemicals for polymer applications; (3) increasing penetration of biobased polymer materials into the coating industry, engineering polymers and home products.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) floral trial garden will continue to help green industry professionals determine which flowering plants look great, last the longest, and deliver the greatest yield. The trial garden has greatly benefited the seed companies that participated in the previous trials and has proven to be a valuable resource for the local green industry on the Delmarva Peninsula. Through the continuation of the university floral trials, we will be able to continue to provide information and services to stakeholders and the green industry professionals to enhance the profitability of the lower shore region's green industry. The new project will evaluate plants longer into the fall/winter season. Evaluations will continue until the plants have completely died. This information will be of interest to the stakeholders because they will have evaluation data on plants that may thrive well after their recommended growing season. Beneficial Microorganisms Research: Many greenhouse and nursery production operations use a combination of fertilizers, growth regulators, fungicides, and insecticides to mass-produce ornamental plants in high volumes on small acreages. Non-point sources of pollutants are having a negative impact on the quality of water in watersheds and aquifers throughout the United States. The use of biofertilizers containing beneficial microorganisms instead of synthetic chemicals has been known to improve plant growth through the supply of plant nutrients and may help to sustain environmental health and soil productivity. Beneficial microorganisms, such as mychorrizal fungi, are recognized for their benefits to plant growth and development and improved water relations. The variation in mycorrhizal responsiveness to a specific fungus by cultivars of the same host has been reported for field-grown crops, such as peanuts, basil, onions, alfalfa, cowpea, peas, tomatoes, soybean, corn barley, and rice. However, there has been little research conducted in the United States documenting responsiveness to mycorrhizal inoculation of greenhouse or other ornamental plants where extensive breeding has occurred, and where there are multitudes of cultivars and varieties selected for their aesthetic or landscape traits. Therefore, evaluating the responsiveness to microbial inoculation with isolates of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza fungal species on different cultivars of popular annual and bedding plants can greatly influence the economic and production practice of Maryland's green industry while reducing the negative environmental impacts of chemical fertilizers.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

814,"Full-season soybean and double-cropped small grain-soybean are common cropping systems in the Mid-Atlantic USA. Full-season soybean is usually planted in May and is the only crop grown during that calendar year. The small grain-soybean double-cropping system includes planting winter barley or wheat in October through November, harvesting that crop in June, and planting soybean immediately following small grain harvest. Full-season soybean yields more than soybean double-cropped after wheat, but double-cropped small grain-soybean systems as a whole were more profitable than full-season soybean in Kansas and Virginia. In addition to greater profitability, double-cropping systems provide additional environmental benefits by providing winter cover that reduces offsite soil and nutrient movement and by utilizing nutrients that were unused by the previous summer crop, which could otherwise leach into groundwater. Finally, double cropping soybean after small grain production allows for more total grain production in a time when global demand is increasing.Although benefits of double-cropping are clear, it is necessary to continue annual yield improvement with this system. Several issues put double-cropped soybean at a disadvantage over full-season systems. Global warming or stresses resulting from increasing temperatures may put double-cropped soybean at a disadvantage, as most of this crop's early-season growth will occur during the warmest times of the season. Pest management practices for double-cropped soybean may need re-evaluation since this crop will mature later in the year when incidence of insect pests and disease is greater. Breeders may have unknowingly selected for traits (related or unrelated to environmental changes) that favor full-season production systems. If so, such physiological traits must be identified and better understood. Finally, new ideas to increase crop growth rate in the vegetative stages and extend the seed filling period (recognized as a problem in double-cropping systems) are needed to ensure adequate leaf area development and light capture. In 2011, Mid-Atlantic (PA, DE, MD, VA, NC, SC) producers planted over 780,000 hectares of small grain, most of which will be double-cropped with soybean and valued at over $700 million. Yearly increases in soybean yield must be maintained if double-cropping systems are to remain productive and profitable. To maintain a yield trend similar to the national average, a 30 kg ha-1 yield increase per year for double-cropped soybean is needed.

815,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer cases and cancer deaths in U.S. men. Epidemiological evidence has identified several dietary trends with reduced risk or severity of PCa. In the 2007 AICR/WCRF report, foods containing lycopene were listed as probable and pulses/legumes were listed as limited-suggestive in their ability to reduce the risk of PCa. Broccoli consumption has also been associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer. While whole foods are identified as protective, many mechanistic studies have taken a pharmacologic approach by testing single bioactives at high doses from these foods, making it difficult to extrapolate findings to the efficacy of the whole food. Our laboratory was the first to show that tomato powder was more effective than lycopene alone in reducing PCa development and progression. We have also found that the combination of tomato powder with broccoli powder was more effective than either alone in suppressing growth of prostate tumors. Recent in vitro evidence suggests that whole soy extract was more effective than individual isoflavones and that tomato paste was more effective than lycopene alone in inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PCa cells. In order to better clarify and support the epidemiological evidence, future research should utilize foods rather than isolated bioactives to identify the anti-carcinogenic potential of the whole food. Illinois is one of the primary producers of soybeans. If it can be shown that soy reduces prostate carcinogenesis, this may increase sales of soy products. Moreover, the citizens of Illinois, like those in other states, would benefit from reduced mortality or morbidity from PCa if tomato, broccoli and/or soy consumption could be shown to reduce the appearance and growth of prostate tumors or to slow PCa metastasis to other tissues.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
816,"The ecological/environmental risk assessment (ERA) for genetically engineered (GE) crops has developed in a manner consistent with established frameworks and processes that have been used within the risk assessment community for nearly three decades. Despite this consistency in approach, there has been a tendency for GE ERA to develop in isolation of the ERA process as broadly applied to both biotic and abiotic stressors of natural and man made origin. To date the ERA for GE crops has proven robust and has provided reasonable evidence for no harm for currently deployed GE crops, but has tended to stress local field effects from single toxins. None the less, concerns continue to arise regarding the adequacy of current ERA approaches for addressing risk within an ecological context. This is especially so given the increasingly complex and diverse nature of GE events which are released to the environment and their increasing spatial and temporal dominance in agricultural landscapes. Tension between the traditional toxicologically-based principles of ERA and the recognized scale and complexity of ecosystems have been long-standing and are not restricted solely to considerations of GE crops. Logical progression in ERA as applied to GE crops will address the need to better assess population and community level ecology; integrate with principles of ERA as broadly applied to a range of biotic and abiotic stressors; consider multiple toxins occurring both within fields and across landscapes; and reaffirm the critical importance of comparative risk as a procedural paradigm. This project addresses the need to improve ERA for GE crops at scales extending beyond single stressors affecting individuals at the field scale to encompass populations within regions where multi-stressor GE crops occur in a spatially and temporally dynamic landscape. Special emphasis will be given to modeling approaches that address risk to populations, communities and guilds from multiple toxins within a spatial-temporal mosaic with dynamic fluctuations in exposure. Existing data describing Bt toxins originating from stacked and in-bag mixes of corn varieties planted into corn-soybean dominated watersheds within the upper Midwest will be synthesized to gain an understanding of variance and uncertainties in risk to non-target arthropod populations, communities and guilds. The approach recognizes that many of the individual pieces to advance ERA methodology for GE crops are in place, so analysis will consider integration of current state of these methodological approaches to advance a more holistic analysis of GE crop impacts at watershed and regional scales.

818,"The Integrated Aerobiology Modeling System (IAMS), developed by Isard et al (2005), has been employed during the past 6 years to forecast the seasonal geographic spread of soybean rust (SBR) in North America. Estimates of savings to U.S. soybean growers that have resulted from activities associated with the soybean rust component of the PIPE vary greatly (e.g., Roberts et al 2006, Dorrance et al. 2007) and include a conservative calculation of approximately $200 million per year (Giesler and Hershman 2007). In anticipation of the possible incursion of new wheat stem rust races (Ug99) into North America and recent concern over the regional spread of southern corn rust, the IAMS has been expanded to forecast the aerial transport of these diseases in North America (Russo and Isard 2011, USDA 2011). Information on aphid transmission of soybean dwarf virus and adaptation to soybean crops will be useful in determining the risk of SbDV populations moving from widespread indigenous clover hosts into soybean crops on an epidemic scale. This information will be useful for disease risk analysis and development of epidemiological models of virus spread. Integration of host defense response in plants together with the use of environmentally friendly compounds represents the most sustainable method for controlling plant diseases rather than relying totally on fungicides. Information about the host defense response in perennial ryegrass would be useful in developing an integrated disease management strategy using novel compounds as well as compounds that are already known to elicit immune response in other plants. The epidemiological study of gray leaf spot of perennial ryegrass turf implies a deeper understanding of the relationship of environmental factors with gray leaf spot epidemics (Uddin et al. 2003). The results of the research will provide insights into disease forecasting model and integration of novel cultural practices, which will reduce the heavy reliance of fungicide application of gray leaf spot. Molecular tools are not currently widely used in the turfgrass industry. Therefore, the implementation of a molecular technique to accurately quantify dollar spot DNA and predict disease epidemics will provide turfgrass managers with a new resource to combat dollar spot, as more money is spent annually for the control of this disease on high input turfgrass than any other disease (Viji et al., 2004; Vargas, 1994).

Because of the widespread pest status of stink bugs across multiple crops in the United States, particularly in the southeast, it is imperative that alternative management strategies be developed to reduce yield loss and the use of broad spectrum pyrethroid or organophosphate insecticides. The use of jasmonic acid to increase the natural control of stink bugs will be investigated as an alternative. Improving our understanding of insect dispersal (stink bugs, kudzu bugs, cereal leaf beetles) among crop and non-crop habitats will help to develop environmentally friendly management practices. Every corn field in South Carolina suffers from insect associated yield loss. Transgenic Bt. corn hybrids can help to reduce insect injury and have been widely adopted in the U.S. Recent trends in the corn industry are to stack multiple transgenic Bt traits for insect control by cross-licensing traits among the companies. With such a diversity of available Bt hybrids in corn, it is necessary to not only assess the efficacy of these products for growers, but also to determine the impact of these traits on the biology of target pests. Resistance management to Bt corn is a hot topic right now in the US, with corn rootworms now resistant to a Bt trait in parts of the midwest. Life history studies will be conducted to help identify changes in susceptibility of key pests to Bt toxins produced in transgenic corn in South Carolina. The exotic plataspid, Megacopta cribraria, commonly known as the kudzu bug, is now causing significant yield loss to soybean in South Carolina, with an average of 21% yield loss in untreated soybean plots and a maximum of 49% based on trials in South Carolina and Georgia. To reduce economic yield losses, growers currently rely on the application of broad spectrum insecticides. For correct decision making, growers and scouts need to use effective sampling procedures and use adequate numbers of samples per field. No research has been conducted on soybean to optimize sampling plans for this invasive pest. Precise sampling plans will help in managing this new pest. Research on the ecology of this new invasive pest will help to develop environmentally friendly control strategies.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
822,"Soybean is an economically important crop in the US and in Ohio. Ohio growers have specific needs in soybean genetics which include disease resistance and specialty traits. The proposed research aims to develop soybean varieties with and/or genetically characterize and determine the chromosomal location of genes conferring traits of interest. These traits include (a) yield, (b) resistance to Ohio important diseases (e.g. Phytotpthora sojae, SCN, and soybean aphid), and (c) added-value composition traits desirable in industrial products as well as soy-food, animal feed, and oil. Genetic analysis of these traits will allow for efficient stacking and selection of traits. Germplasm and Ohio-adapted varieties with these added value traits will subsequently be developed and released. When available, previously identified molecular markers for disease resistance and oil traits will be used to screen early generation materials (F2 individuals) for specific combinations of homozygous loci. Frequently, markers identified from wide-cross bi-parental populations are not informative (monomorphic) in breeding populations. Many loci for protein and oil and slightly fewer for carbohydrate composition have been previously identified; however, by analyzing these traits in the OARDC-OSU breeding material, we ensure that the genetic knowledge can be directly applied to the breeding program. Genetic analyses of certain traits specific to tofu, natto, and/or soy sprout production are limited. Although genetic variation has been reported on, the heritability of the water weight increase ratio, seed coat cracking ratio of steamed beans, and texture of steamed beans or produced tofu has not been determined. The data acquired from this research will help to characterize the level of genetic variability for these traits as well as their heritability and genetic locations. Outcomes from the proposed research include germplasm with combinations of added-value traits may be released for use by private breeders. In addition, future high yielding materials with superior added-value traits will be released as public or branded varieties for direct use by growers. Novel traits will be genetically characterized and materials will be released along with breeder friendly molecular markers suitable for selecting the traits of interest. This will enable all released material to be easily integrated into private breeding programs; thereby, ultimately making the genetics widely available to Ohio farmers.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
823,"Abdominal obesity also known as visceral fat has been established as one of the main contributory factors in the development of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Tissues in abdominal fat generate inflammation which in turn reduces insulin sensitivity and as a result a long list of opportunistic chronic diseases can invade the body. Obesity is an epidemic disease in the US and worldwide. The major change to get obesity and overweight under control in the US and around the world is prevention rather than treatment. Prevention involves changes in lifestyle, decrease food intake and adopting a healthy diet, and adopting more physical activity. Recent studies indicate that bioactive compounds in food can help prevent the development of obesity. However, studies on the potential effect of dietary bioactive compounds on obesity are still in its infancy. Although ginger, berries, soybean, or tomato have been suggested to inhibit inflammation, there are scanty reports on the anti-adipogenic and anti-inflammatory effects of soybean, tomato, or algae. Recent studies in our laboratory have shown that berry anthocyanins can inhibit the biomarkers of inflammation in human subcutaneous adipocytes. Recent studies in our laboratory have also shown that ginger extracts inhibit several biomarkers of inflammation. We have previously shown that resveratrol can enhance cell to cell communication by inducing connexin 43 in retinal pigment epithelial cells. The soybean Bowman-Birk inhibitor is an anti-inflammatory protein that has shown ability to inhibit inflammation biomarkers in chronic degenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis and cancer. Tomato is a good source of carotenoids lycopene and &beta;-carotene. There are reports showing inverse relation of obesity and levels of plasma carotenoids; however, the mechanisms of the relationship need to be identified. Algae are good sources of carotenoids other than lycopene and carotene and the potential inverse relationship between algal bioactive compounds and visceral inflammation needs investigation. The rationale of this study is as follows: Americans eat berries, lots of tomatoes or tomato products, soybean products, ginger, corn, and corn products because they understand that these foods provide health benefits. However, most people may not know the optimal levels that may help reduce obesity if any. The study of adipose tissue is central to the understanding of the metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity development. Our preliminary studies show that berries inhibit inflammatory biomarkers in subcutaneous fat. Recent studies in our lab also show that ginger oil at a concentration that is physiologically attainable inhibit several biomarkers of inflammation. This project is written in response to USDA to find solutions to the obesity crisis that is increasing in the US and all over the world. Because the US is a major producer of tomato, berries, soybean, and corn, successful completion of the project will have a major impact on long-range improvement and sustainability of the health of American populations and US agriculture and food systems.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
824,"Due to high soil spatial variability and different weather conditions, there is a need to examine the N management on corn in South Carolina. Part of this project will help to increase nitrogen efficiency, develop and refine algorithms for site-specific N application in corn using optical sensing technologies under irrigated and dryland conditions, respectively, and decrease the input cost of nitrogen. Generally, this research will help to increase crop profitability by providing the procedures for a site-specific nitrogen (N) application in corn with a goal of increasing the farm profit while minimizing the effect of over-fertilization on the environment. The interseeeding study will evaluate the effects of interseeding on soil properties (bulk density, organic matter and nutrient content, cation exchange capacity, etc.) plant growth indices and growth stage development, yields, and quality to improve sustainability through earlier planting and increase yield potential. The planting date and seeding rate interaction will evaluate the effect of seeding rate on maturity groups (MG) VII and VIII soybean planted in mid- and late-June in South Carolina. This part of the project will evaluate vegetative growth indices, growth stages, yields, and grain quality of MG VII and VIII soybean planted at different seeding rates in mid- and late-June under low yield environments. This research will improve profitability, because more precise seeding rate recommendations will be developed for soybeans planted from June 5 through June 15 and from June 16 through June 29. The findings from this research will be disseminated through training workshops and meetings, and also through printed materials.

825,"Dryland cropping systems in western Nebraska are vital to the economy of Nebraska; however, they are very different from much of the Corn Belt. The studies outlined in this project are intended to make cropping systems in the Corn Belt and in particular in western Nebraska more productive and efficient. The first set of experiments are designed around understanding short-term approaches to maximizing yields in western Nebraska, the second second of experiments are designed around long-term crop ratation effects on yields in western Nebraska and the third set of experiments are designed around understanding pesticide application technology in any environment where pesticides are utilized in crop production. The anticipated Outcomes and Impacts are as follows: Outcomes - Presentations at professional meetings; Peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals; Extension publications; Proceedings at professional and extension meetings; A series of videos depicting different application practices will be made available with corresponding spray droplet analyses; Training of graduate students. Projected Impacts - Identification of potential yield limiting barriers in rainfed and irrigated corn production systems, Knowledge gained about interactions of production decisions will enable the ability to make recommendations to growers which will lead to more efficient production systems allowing growers to utilize practices which lead to synergistic relationships while avoiding practices which are antagonistic. Understanding of these interactions could lead to the savings of ineffective input decisions which can cost as much as $60/acre in some cases. Studying on-farm production systems will allow us to more precisely define the optimal characteristics of high output production systems. It will also allow us to determine how important different management decisions are to different geographical and climatic regions within the state of Nebraska. Understanding of these relationships could lead to yield increases and more efficient use of resource inputs such as water and fertilizer. Long-term rotational studies will allow us to make recommendations based on the benefits and/or disadvantages of crop rotation versus using a single crop year after year. Cost-benefit relationships are not clearly defined for crop rotations in rainfed and irrigated crops in western Nebraska, but advantages could be numerous. One example of an added benefit to a corn/soybean rotation to a continuous corn system would be reduced nitrogen which could save as much as $25/acre. Education that leads to the reduction of drift can lead to less lost pesticides in a particular system and increased efficacy from the application of the intended application rate. In fields where $60/acre herbicide applications are made with 10% drift, the increased savings to the person purchasing the pesticide can be as much as $6.00/acre. This has the potential to impact any pesticide applicator and not just those in agricultural fields and the data will be applicable to any pesticide applicator in Nebraska and around the world.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
826,"In the southeastern US, a number of insects are poised to pose significant problems for producers of cotton and soybeans in the region. Specifically, a complex of true bugs will be responsible for most of the tribulations in both crops. In cotton in South Carolina alone, stink bugs cause millions of dollars in crop injury and losses annually, resulting in producers spending additional millions in control costs for the damaging species. Many of the same species of stink bugs are also problematic in soybeans in the state, causing millions of dollars in losses and control costs in that crop as well. Invasive species of true bugs have recently added to those insect issues and will add significantly to the losses and control costs if research programs to not address them quickly and efficiently. One of those new species - the kudzu bug - already is an enormous dilemma for soybean producers in South Carolina and a growing proportion of the Southeast. Other species, such as the brown marmorated stink bug, could potentially present additional risks and challenges for agricultural communities in the South. When all of these species of true bugs are added to the already large list of perennial pests such as bollworm, thrips, and others, there is ample opportunity for research and improvement on pest management programs.

828,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) caused by plant pathogens; those that have increased in geographic range, incidence, or pathogenicity or those that have been recently discovered, are on the rise. In 2008, Louisiana faced the destructive insect-vectored plant pathogen, citrus greening which is transmitted by Asian citrus psyllid. Finding of citrus greening resulted in a quarantine of citrus stock sales in two Louisiana parishes (Orleans and Washington). This disease can affect yield, leading to decline and eventual tree death. If citrus greening reaches Plaquemines parish, the leading citrus-producing parish in Louisiana, a total loss of gross farm value would be $4.1 million. In addition, potential new insect vectored plant disease threats exist for Louisiana, such as laurel wilt a fungus pathogen transmitted by the redbay ambrosia beetle. Without an IPM strategy for insect vectored plant pathogens, losses to Louisiana agriculture could be immense. Of EIDs, plant viruses compromise the largest group (47%). Plant viruses can adversely affect agricultural production, being costly to both grower and consumer by limiting yield and impacting quality. For example, the two most important virus pathogens affecting potato production are Potato virus Y (PVY) and Potato leafroll virus (PLRV). These aphid transmitted viruses can reduce yields by as much as 80% with a net loss of $2 billion per year. In sweetpotato, aphid transmitted viruses reduced yields by 30 to 40%. For Louisiana sweetpotato, this could be a potential loss of $16 million. Interactions with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (whitefly transmitted) and Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (aphid transmitted) can cause up to 90% loss. Barley yellow dwarf virus and Cereal yellow dwarf virus, two luteovirues infecting wheat, can reduce yields by 20% in the Midwest. For Louisiana, this could result in $5.2 million. One of the main reasons plant viruses are on the rise is due to changes in vector populations. Of the 531 known vectors of plant viruses, 85% are transmitted by insects and of those, 37% are transmitted by aphids. In North America, the single biggest change in vector populations has been the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura. This has had a profound impact on seed potato production in the Midwest. Current environmental conditions and global climate change favor aphid population growth and thus, favor increased virus transmission. Clearly, viruses and virus vectors can have an incredible impact on U.S. agriculture. To effectively manage insect-vectored pathogens, knowledge of the interactions between the susceptible hosts, viable virus inoculum, favorable environment and insect vector are needed. For most agricultural production systems, these interactions are poorly understood.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
829,"Grain sorghum may be a better option than corn in rotations with cotton, soybean or peanuts. It typically sustains higher yields in extreme heat or drought than corn. The host status of grain sorghum for most nematode species is unclear. Some varieties of grain sorghum may be excellent hosts of M. incognita and may be better hosts than corn for lesion, ring, sting, stubby root and stunt nematodes. Grain sorghum can be used successfully to suppress soybean cyst and reniform nematode populations. However, the host status of grain sorghum to lance nematodes is unknown. This work will determine whether grain sorghum can be used to reduce Columbia lance nematode population densities. H. galeatus occurs commonly in this region. Information on the ability of H. galeatus to infect and reproduce on grain sorghum is minimal. Recent work in has shown that some populations of lance nematode that were previously identified as H. galeatus are likely H. stephanus instead. We have no information on the host range of H. stephanus or the level of damage it may cause on row crops. Nematode management for row crops in the Southeast has relied heavily upon the use of aldicarb, which was discontinued in 2011. Telone II (1,3-dichloropropene) is available but the supply is limited. Research has demonstrated that a combination of zone management and site-specific application can maintain yields while reducing pesticide applications up to 50% in many fields. More comprehensive data is needed relative to the effects of soil texture and other biological and edaphic factors on the distribution of reniform and Columbia lance nematodes in typical South Carolina fields. Clemson University is uniquely suited to conduct research on this proposal. It is a leader in the utilization of site-specific variable-rate applications of nematicides. Greenhouse space is available for all culturing of nematodes and screening of varieties for host suitability. Reference cultures and the materials needed for molecular speciation along with the expertise of Dr. Agudelo are available on campus. Recent survey work by Dr. Mueller and Dr. Agudelo will provide many of the nematode populations needed for Objectives 1 and 3. This research is vital to continued successful management of plant-parasitic nematodes in row crops in the Southeast. If nematode control measures are not developed to offset the loss of aldicarb and the continued limited supplies of 1,3-dichloropropene, yield losses on cotton and soybean will likely increase. In South Carolina soybeans alone, growers could lose $25 an acre, or over $6,250,000. Cotton losses would be similar and could be as much as $60 per acre or over $15,000,000 for the state. Previous work on site-specific variable-rate placement of nematicides has shown reductions of 50 to 66% in nematicide applied to fields infested with Columbia lance and root-knot nematode. We need to develop the knowledge base on the in-field distribution of reniform nematodes so that we can expand this precision ag program to reniform nematode-infested fields.

830,"Plant micropropagation has been a commercial biotechnology for 40 years, with annual US production estimated between 100-150 M units annually. Micropropagation delivers quality plantlets on time without propagating their diseases and insects. The inadvertent spread of agricultural pest by intercontinental and international commerce of planting stock is best controlled by avoidance. Most tissue-cultured plantlets are sold as rooted liners (as opposed to unrooted microcuttings). The rooted liner is a fragile, bulky commodity with the potential of carrying pests from bark-based media constantly saturated on the mist-bed. We will expand the value of tissue culture by better integrating laboratory cleanliness with subsequent growth, to maximize value in the end-users nursery. The most immediate application is in perennial, ornamental plants. These plants have among the highest unit value per propagule. Tens of millions of tissue-cultured plants are finished to saleable containers in the Southeastern US every year. Production nurseries, and their retail partners, benefit with profitability, cleanliness, reduced pesticides and reduced risks of product loss. A more advanced technology for micropropagation, somatic embryogenesis and the resulting emblings are currently poised to increase the size of micropropagation nurseries. Clonal plantation and forest crops are joining micropropagated ornamental plants as commercially propagated commodities. Enabling technologies for efficient transition of in vitro somatic emblings to vigorous ex vitro nursery stock requires integration of laboratory and greenhouse systems. In the opinion of this author, this is a bottleneck in the current state of the art. Loosening the bottleneck benefits the propagation laboratories, and associated tree nurseries in this region, their expanding workforce, and landowners that make use of these advanced forest tree products. Genetic engineering and transgenic breeding of the large agronomic crops (i.e. maize, soy, cotton, rice) requires millions of unique emblings per year. The agri-biotechnology industry is also a potential beneficiary projects to streamline delivery of microplants to nursery. Rootstocks of peach trees are currently produced as seedlings in North America. In Asia and Europe, micropropagated rootstocks of Prunus, Malus, and Pyrus are commercially preferred due to higher levels of resistance and uniformity in clonal selections. In North America, large-scale micropropagation of clonal apple rootstocks has begun. Clonal rootstocks of peach, like clonal forest trees, will benefit nursery propagator and orchard fruit producer alike. We believe both mineral nutrition and specialized handling of rooted microcuttings will greatly enhance the plant quality. North America has much non-domesticated flora with unrealized potential as sources of medicinal compounds. Wild-collecting native species will decimate populations of native, medicinal plants (or in some cases, already has).

831,"Soybean, one of the world's most valuable oil-seed crops, is also a major source of protein for animal feed and human diets. The U.S. is the world leader in soybean production. In 2010, the total U.S. soybean crop value was over $38.9 billion. It is estimated that the soybean crop would have been 14.4% higher if there were no incidence of diseases. Soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS) is a major disease; and in 2010, it caused crop loss valued $820M. This loss will be exacerbated if SDS continues to spread or if climate extremes create soil conditions conducive to the SDS pathogen, Fusarium virguliforme. There are no effective management tools to control SDS. SDS resistance of soybean lines is partial and governed by many quantitative trait loci. Genes encoding complete SDS resistance are yet to be discovered. Therefore, the need for alternative, complementary SDS resistance encoded by transgenes is crucial to protect this crop. In this project, we will evaluate the feasibility of several genetic approaches to create stable transgenic soybean lines with enhanced resistance to this major disease. These include: (i) suppress the pathogen's growth by expressing synthetic genes in soybeans; (ii) induce SDS resistance by expressing genes from Arabidopsis and maize in soybean; (iii) express synthetic plant antibodies to nullify toxins in soybean; and (iv) express a gene of the SDS pathogen in soybean to promote SDS resistance. SDS resistant lines will then be evaluated against selected SDS pathogen isolates representing five geographical regions, viz., Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Argentina and Brazil. Selected transgene(s) for enhanced SDS resistance will be incorporated into elite soybean lines. To accomplish these objectives, relevant cutting-edge technologies including a micro-fluidic RNAi assay to identify vital F. virguliforme genes, phase display to identify synthetic plant antibody genes, HiSeq 2000 sequencing of 175 pathogen-isolates, and optical biosensors to identify the strongest toxin-interacting peptides will be applied. Outcomes/impacts: Gains in knowledge are: Our investigation is expected to identify gene(s) of F. virguliforme that are vital for infection and disease development and reveal if suppression of the expression of these genes in the pathogen is feasible by expressing relevant transgenes in soybean. If demonstrated, we would develop an innovative approach to manage SDS. In addition, sequence analyses of 175 SDS pathogen isolates will reveal the molecular complexity of the pathogen. Expected actions are: Incorporation of one or more of the selected transgenes will result in elite soybean lines with enhanced SDS resistance and consequently increased profitability for soybean growers who chose to use this transgenic technology to manage the SDS. Expected changes in conditions are: Our project is expected to result in reduced soybean yield losses from SDS; improved farm economy from growing elite transgenic soybean lines with enhanced SDS resistance; development of a new generation of teachers, educators and scientists, who will contribute towards enhanced crop production for sustainable food security.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
832,"States in the Northeast Region of the National Plant Diagnostic Network host about six percent of the nation's farms on less than three percent of the country's total farm acreage. However, with increased interest in various crops as sources of biofuels, some marginal lands are being returned to cultivation and the region's contribution to the nation's economy in this area is increasing. Furthermore, states in the region are also home to some of the most active ports in the U.S., including those in Wilmington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark, New York, and Boston. Millions of tons of foreign agricultural goods and hundreds of thousands of people enter the U.S. through those ports each year. Unfortunately, history has taught us that not all transcontinental movement of plants and animals is beneficial or benign. In fact, some can have dramatic and historic consequences. Recent introductions of boxwood blight, the spotted wing drosophila, the emerald ash borer, Sirex woodwasp, soybean aphid, and soybean rust coupled with historic catastrophes resulting from introductions of gypsy moths, Dutch elm disease, and chestnut blight are vivid testimony to the destructive power of plant pests and diseases carelessly transported across natural boundaries to new ecosystems. Recent intelligence reports suggest that there is good reason to think that sooner or later the nation's agricultural infrastructure will become a target for terrorist attack, perhaps via introduction of economically debilitating plant pests or pathogens. And one or more major ports is likely to be the route of entry. In 2003, the U.S.Congress directed the USDA-CSREES (now, USDA-NIFA) to create national plant and animal health diagnostic networks to facilitate the rapid identification of unusual plant pests and pathogens and to ensure seamless communication of new discoveries to other diagnostic facilities and to regulatory authorities throughout the U.S. The National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN), now completing its 10th year of training and support to surveillance crews and preparing for the eleventh, was an outgrowth of that mandate.

I)  Evaluation of near-surface geophysical methods to locate/assess subsurface drainage system infrastructure. II)  Capability assessment of near-surface geophysical methods to provide valuable information needed for drainage system design.

Subobjective 2b - Identify the critical levels of microelement toxicity in soybeans and characterize the association of tolerance of microelement toxicity and tolerance of flooding in soybeans.  Characterize soybean germplasm tolerant to flooding and element toxicities associated with intermittently wet soils.  Approach: 1a: Two separate field research studies. Based on similarity of subsurface drainage system infrastructure characteristics, there are a total of four replicated pairs of subplots. 1b:Ground penetrating radar (GPR) will be integrated with real-time kinematic (RTK) Global Positioning System (GPS) roving receivers and a continuously operated GPS reference station network to effectively and efficiently map buried drainage pipe networks on both small and large scales. 1c: Replicated transient, unsaturated horizontal column experiments have been used to quantify the effects on soil NO3- anion adsorption/exclusion due to clay mineralogy, soil solution ionic strength, and the type of dominant exchangeable cation present. Additional replicated transient unsaturated horizontal column experiments, approximately 20 in total, will be conducted on a typical Midwest U.S. soil to evaluate soil water content impacts on NO3- anion exclusion. 1d: Further laboratory investigation will be carried out to evaluate contaminant removal abilities for improved formulations of these porous iron-based materials, especially in regard to a wider range of pesticides (alachlor, atrazine, and 2,4-D).  (Note:  Laboratory determination of porous iron-based filter material effectiveness and efficiency will be established though the ability to maintain a sufficiently high hydraulic conductivity, the percent/amount of contaminant removal, and the longevity with respect to contaminant removal.) 2a: We will conduct field experiments at two locations in Ohio (Columbus and Piketon) to test the efficacy of no-tillage with (1) cover crops (cereal rye grass and oil seed radish in rotation) versus no cover crops.  Oilseed radish (2 kg/ha), Alaskan winter pea (25 kg/ha), and cereal rye (13 kg/ha) will be planted as cover crops immediately after harvesting soybean; and (2) mined gypsum versus FGD gypsum and no gypsum on the tolerance of soybeans to flooding. 2b: To assess soybean tolerance to microelement toxicity, an experiment will be conducted in the growth chamber using the growth-pouch technique.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

838,"Objective(s): This project plan describes the hypothesis-based research to be conducted for two root rot diseases of soybean, PRR and SDS. The aim of this project is to mitigate the impact of these diseases on yield by improving our understanding of pathogen biology, disease development, and host-pathogen interactions. To this end, we propose:  Objective 1: Evaluate the outcrossing and diversity of Phytophthora sojae populations and host plant interactions. In this objective, this research group will look into the role of outcrossing in diversifying populations of P. sojae, which may be contributing to the rapid adaptation of this pathogen to deployed R-genes (resistance genes). The research group will also screen for race-specific and partial resistance, which minimizes colonization as well as symptom development, to P. sojae in germplasm with resistance to other root-infecting pathogens.    Objective 2: Evaluate the population dynamics of Fusarium virguliforme, sudden death syndrome disease cycle, and host plant interactions. For this objective, the research group will study the effect of the isolate of F. virguliforme on SDS foliar and/or root rot resistance to determine if known quantitative trait loci (QTL) are isolate-specific. In addition, the research group will also examine the early stages of the disease cycle to determine the cause, timing, and mechanism of initial infection by F. virguliforme.   Objective 3: Organize, manage, and conduct the Northern Uniform Soybean Tests. The goal of this non-hypothesis based component of the project is to provide public breeders with information needed to determine if a breeding line is to be released as a new variety.  Although the aim of Objective 3 differs from that of Objectives 1 and 2, the Uniform Soybean Tests (USTs) serve a key role in advancing soybean production in the U.S.  Approach: Established cultural techniques and markers linked to known avir genes will be used to evaluate the role of outcrossing in diversifying populations of Phytophthora sojae. Soybean germplasm will be evaluated for race-specific (hypocotyl test) and partial (percent root rot-layer test and colonization-qPCR) resistance to P. sojae. QTLs for resistance to SDS will be evaluated for isolate specificity using multiple RIL and NIL populations and isolates of Fusarium virguliforme that are genetically (DNA fingerprinting) and geographically diverse. Soybean hairy roots and a GFP-expressing isolate of F. virguliforme will be used to study the infection process and to assess morphological differences between SDS-resistant and susceptible varieties.

Determine whether multiple virus resistance in maize inbred lines is the result of pleiotropic or closely linked genes, and develop and release virus-resistant germplasm to breeders. a) Determine whether resistance to potyviruses is pleiotropic in Pa405. b) Mapping multiple virus resistance in Oh1VI. c) Develop and release virus resistant germplasm.  3. Develop genetic and genomic information on two insect vectors, including the molecular response to feeding on virus-infected plants.  4. Identify virus components important for pathogenesis, insect transmission, and host interactions, and develop virus systems for gene discovery and functional analysis in maize. a) Assess viral protein complements, expression strategies, and functions in maize. b) Develop maize virus-based forward and reverse genetics systems. c) Characterize virus and insect factors needed for virus transmission, and develop methods to study these processes.  Approach: 1. A sequence-independent approach (SIA) for amplification of viral genome sequences will be used for initial identification of viruses in suspected, symptomatic plants. Mollicutes will be identified using PCR with genus-specific ribosomal DNA (rDNA) primers. The identity of known pathogens will be confirmed with a combination of microscopic, serological and molecular assays. New viruses will be cultured in susceptible plants and characterized.  As possible under permit conditions, we will test known vectors of maize and soybean diseases for their ability to transmit pathogens. Mechanical or vector transmission of pathogens will be used to screen maize or soybean germplasm for resistant genotypes. 2. To determine whether the Wsm1 and Wsm2 genes for WSMV resistance confer resistance to multiple potyviruses, to isolate or fine map these two genes in Pa405, and to develop germplasm to fine map or isolate Wsm3. The putative insertional mutants Wsm1µ and Wsm2µ plants identified in the current project will be tested for chromosomal deletions on chr. 6 and 3, respectively, prior to testing for pleiotropic gain of susceptibility to potyviruses. We will clone sequences flanking the insertion sites to identify candidate genes. Genes and cDNAs encoding Wsm1 and Wsm2 will be cloned, and sequences will be used in loss and gain of function assays to confirm gene identity. Because of the risk associated with identifying insertional mutations in Wsm1 and Wsm2, we will continue efforts to develop a fine map Wsm1 and Wsm2, using available recombinant plants and populations. Additional markers will be identified in SNP and microarray analyses. We will develop germplasm to identify mutator insertions and fine map Wsm3.  3. Use second-generation sequence analysis to build and analyze EST libraries for two important vectors of soybean and maize viruses: A. glycines and G. nigrifrons. The vectors will be fed on plants infected with viruses that are transmitted in a non-persistg differential equations can be extended to handle integro-difference equations.   Adjoint-based local methods have been extensively used in many data-intensive application areas including weather and climate.  Therefore, it is very unlikely that these methods will not perform well for large-scale epidemiological problems that are strongly driven by environmental factors (e.g., aerially dispersed cereal rusts).  In contrast, the sloppy modeling approach has not been extensively tested for very large problems.  It is possible that this method will lead to very long execution for models with many state variables (e.g., modeling large outbreaks ent (SMV), semi-persistent (MCDV), persistent-circulative (SbDV) or persistent-replicative (MFSV) manner. EST libraries will be made with RNA from: 1) A. glycines biotypes 1 and 2 fed on healthy, and SMV or SbDV-infected soybean, and 2) G. nigrifrons fed on healthy, and MCDV- and MFSV-infected maize. Libraries will be sequenced, assembled and annotated. Differential EST expression between different treatments will be verified with quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), and sequences from A. glycines and G. nigrifrons will be compared with those of other vector genomes. 4. An in vivo protease assay will be used to determine MCDV polyprotein cleavage sites by co-expressing active viral protease with epitope-tagged MCDV polyprotein regions and determining sizes of cleavage products. Antibodies made against predicted small ORF-encoded proteins will be used to test for protein expression in infected plants. MCDV proteins will be tested for subcellular localization and virus protein-protein interactions, and MCDV and MFSV proteins will be tested for their ability to suppress gene silencing in N. benthamiana.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

In this project, epigenetic factors, e.g. non-Mendelian, will be examined to determine how these factors respond to interaction with soil microbes and during maturation of the nitrogen fixing organs in the plant.  Data generated will include transcriptomes during and after microbe infection as well as epigenomes including DNA methylation and DNA histone modifications that may be induced or responsive to infection.In addition to a more fundamental understanding of the process of developing organs for nitrogen fixation in legumes, undergraduate students from colleges in New Mexico will be included in summer research internships and collaborative research during the academic year.

846,"The goal of this work is to investigate in plants the function and evolution of a novel class of regulatory small RNAs. Prior work demonstrated that plant genes like those known to confer resistance to pathogens are the targets of a set of  microRNAs --suppressive regulatory RNAs just 22 nucleotides in length. These microRNAs are believed to function as master regulators of a very large family of protein coding disease-resistance genes, and part of their activity is to trigger the production of additional small RNAs (21 nucleotides in length) that have an unusual, regularly spaced pattern, or  phasing  of biogenesis. The regulation of this gene family, and several others targeted by microRNAs in the same way, is a new paradigm for microRNA function. The investigators have identified these small RNAs as conserved in many crop plants, including soybean, an alfalfa relative, tomato and potato. The aim of this project is to investigate this novel gene regulatory circuit to understand its function in plants, its role in plant defenses or beneficial microbial interactions, and whether it can ultimately be developed as a tool for improving plants or altering plant-microbe interactions to reduce disease or improve beneficial interactions. The project will utilize methods that include plant genomics, plant cell biology, plant-microbial interactions, and RNA analysis. The expected result is the dissection and understanding of a novel and complex gene regulatory mechanism.

847,"This project is about understanding the interactions between land-use policies, agricultural rural development and land use change in tropical landscapes, and how these changes affect the resilience of and relationships between human populations and the natural ecosystems present in these landscapes. Millions of hectares of tropical forests have been converted to agriculture leaving behind patches of remnant natural forest embedded in an agricultural matrix. Historically, this agricultural matrix was dominated by subsistence crops and pasture, but in some areas this land is rapidly being replaced with intensive plantation agriculture for soybean, banana, and pineapple production. In contrast with more traditional land uses, these crops require higher inputs of labor, money, agrochemicals, and infrastructure. The impacts of this new land conversion trend are not well understood, but preliminary studies suggest that intensive plantation agriculture may drive dramatic demographic and economic changes in local communities and have profound effects on ecological systems. Ultimately, these impacts will change the ability of these human and ecological communities to maintain resilience to future change. Thus, a better understanding is needed of the relationships among land-use policies, ecosystem structure and function, and the decisions and actions of local communities and land managers that ultimately determine where and how fast intensive plantation agriculture will spread. This project will evaluate these relationships in the model system of the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor in Costa Rica. Specifically, this research will address a variety of research questions, such as: What national policies led to the establishment and spread of intensive non-traditional plantation crops? For three focal regions, what is the status of the social and ecological indicators of resilience? How will current and alternative policy scenarios affect future land use patterns, and how will these affect ecological resilience? How does future scenario modeling of projected land use changes influence the perceptions of community members and land managers about their future social and ecological resilience? This effort incorporates stakeholder input at every step of the research; implements two new ecological approaches, functional traits analysis and landscape genetics; and explicitly measures both social and ecological resilience in the same system and at multiple spatial and temporal scales.Findings from this research will advance understanding of how human communities and ecosystems respond to agricultural intensification, and will therefore help scientists and managers better understand how to manage for resilience in the face of global change. At the local scale, findings will be shared through stakeholder workshops with community leaders and regional land managers; these workshops will provide participants with information to make informed land use decisions, and develop community capacity to adapt to change. At the global scale, findings from this research will be disseminated through presentations at the participating universities, at professional conferences, and through publication of peer-reviewed papers in scientific journals.

849,"CBET 1336199 Howard Weinberg The University of North Carolina at Chapel HillWith population growth and recurrent drought conditions in much of the United States and across the world, new uses for reclaimed wastewater must be considered to preserve freshwater quality. Terrestrial application of treated wastewater such as for crop irrigation could simultaneously protect drinking water source quality, by diverting treated waste effluents from sensitive aquatic ecosystems while reducing demand for drinking water. This project will optimize green infrastructure designs including aerobic vegetated sand filtration (VSF) in combination with subsurface flow (SSF) constructed wetlands for removal of chemicals of anthropogenic origin in wastewater and investigate the extent to which residual chemicals in the reclaimed water accumulate in the edible portions of crops irrigated with this type of water. The project will systematically evaluate how changes to the operation of VSF and SSF can optimize trace organic contaminant and pathogen removal to minimize measureable differences between crops irrigated with such reclaimed water and those irrigated with tap water. This will be achieved through two approaches; a laboratory column study that simulates the treatment designs will investigate the combination of different processes and filter substrates for this optimization using a characterized domestic effluent, and the treated water will then be used in a greenhouse to irrigate a variety of crops including potatoes, soybeans, and leafy vegetables selected because of differences in known properties of chemical uptake or rejection alongside controls conventionally grown with tap water. Specifically, we will determine whether crops irrigated with such waters reject the pollutants making them viable for consumption or if the crops uptake the pollutants and, if so, might they be used as an additional remediation tool for wastewater treatment. Changes to the operation of the green infrastructure design process determined from the laboratory study will then be transferred to full-scale operation and the viability of the optimized process towards crop growth evaluated onsite. The project will, therefore, demonstrate whether more widespread use of similar designs and the use of reclaimed water in this manner could be part of a managed approach to pollutant remediation and crop irrigation, thereby saving freshwater for more critical needs. The project will provide a better understanding of how vegetation and crops respond to the presence of wastewater constituents in their environment. Most wastewater treatment systems are not specifically designed to remove man-made chemicals from the influent waste and so by evaluating the fundamental treatment processes in a laboratory-controlled environment, design can be better optimized to improve treated water quality. Moreover,  the project results will show whether wastewater constituents are taken up by the crops (in which case such a process has implications for a remediation technology) or whether the crops are resistant to uptake (in which case a more widespread use of recycled wastewater in crop irrigation can be considered). The use of green infrastructure design for the effective removal of wastewater contaminants at the site of their entry into wastewater has broader impacts on the disbursal of these contaminants throughout the wider environment as is typical in wastewater discharges from centralized wastewater treatment plants. Upgrading such plants to target individual contaminants and prevent their disbursal will likely prove expensive whereas with on-site treatment, cost can be staged and treatment more effectively targeted to individual pollutants. The project will also provide policymakers with valuable information to assist with determining safe operating practices and will help to improve public perception regarding the safe use of reclaimed water.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

851,"Nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient for plant growth. While chemically synthesized inorganic nitrogen fertilizers are effective in increasing crop yields, they are costly and also have a negative impact on the environment, especially on aquatic ecosystems. In contrast, sustainable agriculture relies on biological nitrogen fixation as an economically attractive and ecologically viable source of new nitrogen. The conversion of molecular nitrogen into ammonia is performed by bacteria (Rhizobia) that live in symbiosis with leguminous plants such as peas, soy beans, and alfalfa. The research will be carried out using the symbiotic model system, the nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti (S. meliloti). The process of chemotaxis enables motile rhizobia to preferentially move in the soil towards host plant roots and supports efficient interaction between symbiosis partners. Many motile bacteria are propelled by means of rotating flagella, driven by a powerful, self-assembling nanomachine. The unique flagellar motor and the specially adapted chemotaxis system of S. meliloti make cells more efficient at maneuvering in the viscous soil environment, leading to better survival and optimal interaction with their host plant alfalfa. Previous research uncovered several novel molecular mechanisms governing chemotactic responses and motility in S. meliloti, thereby setting the stage for an in-depth analysis of the underlying molecular events. The overarching goal of this project is to analyze the specific adaptations that occurred in S. meliloti motility and chemotaxis due to the soil habitat and communication with its plant host. The first objective of the research analyzes the roles of two novel proteins in the response of S. meliloti to quickly changing environmental signals, which is essential for bacterial survival. The second objective determines the cellular concentrations and enzymatic activities of key chemotaxis components, allowing prediction of bacterial behavior in the interaction with alfalfa crop. The third objective will identify the function of newly discovered flagellar motor components in facilitating effective movement of S. meliloti in the soil and towards symbiosis partners. This research will lead to the discovery of significant bacterial properties and impact current understanding of how bacterial symbionts respond to plant signals and efficiently move through soil.Broader Impacts     The project directly benefits future agricultural and environmental issues for society. By enhancing understanding of the cues that bacterial symbionts use to efficiently interact with their host crop, the research will impact biological nitrogen fixation and thus crop yields and reduce the use of detrimental synthetic fertilizers. The project will also vertically integrate research activities with educational activities through the development of an undergraduate classroom exercise addressing currently open research questions, which will transform into scientific discoveries in the research laboratory. The existing, successful outreach program of the Microbiology Club of Virginia Tech will be expanded to rural, underdeveloped communities of Appalachia. Outreach activities in the form of interactive lectures and hands-on activities will promote scientific awareness across the educational spectrum, including a local 4-H Agricultural Club and rural elementary schools. Studies of motility and chemotaxis can be demonstrated easily and will allow the development of innovative, inquiry-based microbiology lessons with High School science teachers, a valuable strategy for effective learning. Collaboration with Novozymes? BioAgricultural Group will give Virginia Tech students the opportunity not only to experience basic research approaches at the university and applied research in industry through merged collaborative training programs, but also to increase their chances for recruitment into professional careers. Overall, this project integrates research and education through the fusion of classroom and laboratory research, hands-on outreach activities in rural communities, and internships in industry, which will promote student engagement and transform student learning and will permanently stimulate student''s interest in science.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
852,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to increase yield in wheat by using TILLING, a reverse genetics tool, to identify novel alleles of candidate wheat yield genes in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. In crops such as wheat with more complex genome structures and less advanced genomic tools, the major genes underlying many aspects of plant architecture are yet to be identified. However, due to functional conservation, genes regulating traits in rice (and other crops) are likely to play similar roles in wheat. Once new alleles of these genes have been identified they will be subsequently evaluated for the ability to alter wheat architecture and improve yield in the greenhouse and in the field. As a non-GM technology, products from TILLING can rapidly advance to commercialization and do not face market or regulatory restrictions. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the economic impact of improved wheat yields. The U.S. is the largest wheat exporter globally, yet the competitiveness of U.S. wheat, both globally and domestically, is declining significantly. Planted acreage is down thirty percent since the 1980s, in large part due to competition from other crops with higher returns.  Net returns to farmers from wheat are consistently half or less than that from corn and soy. With a conservative 5% increase in yield resulting from this project, the yearly value creation to the U.S. farmer is estimated at over $30/hectare. In addition, the value of higher yielding wheat varieties to a seed company arising from this research in the U.S. alone is more than $40 million annually. By incorporating favorable alleles of plant architecture genes into a commercial wheat breeding program, it is believed that this project will make a significant contribution to improving the competitiveness of U.S. wheat.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
853,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a multi-modal sensor platform for robust detection and classification of insect pests for automated monitoring of insect populations.  More specifically, the project will investigate the feasibility of extracting meaningful features of insect pests using a set of low-cost, low-power sensors?namely ultrasound, infrared light and bio-impedance sensors?and develop multi-modal sensor fusion algorithms for robust detection and classification of multiple target insect species against any non-target organisms that may enter the trapping device.  Measurement signals generated by the sensors will be analyzed to determine a set of distinct features that can be computed on an embedded platform for real-time processing.  The critical requirements of employing low-cost, low-power sensors with real-time processing capability make this research unique and challenging.  Different sensor fusion strategies based on these features will be investigated and the performance of each fusion algorithm will be evaluated.  Successful conclusion of Phase I and II of this project will result in fully automated, wireless insect traps capable of providing accurate, real-time populations of multiple pest species. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the proposed system could revolutionize pest management practices in agriculture and drastically reduce the amount of pesticide applications.  The proposed system not only eliminates one of the most laborious and dreaded activities of manually inspecting insect traps, but also provides unprecedented access to accurate, real-time insect population information to make more effective pest management decisions.  This leads to reduced, spatially-restricted pesticide applications, better understanding of insect pest behaviors, and enhanced biological control.  The potential market for the proposed technology is quite broad.  In fact, the technology can benefit any industry that requires regular monitoring of insect populations such as tree fruits (e.g., apple, grape, citrus, pear, etc.), row crops (e.g., corn, soy bean, sugar cane, etc.), vegetables, nuts, coffee, ornamental trees, stored food, etc.  Furthermore, the proposed technology could be used for various state and federal pest monitoring programs?such as the Slow the Spread (STS) Project administered by USDA to monitor gypsy moths?that requires placing and managing up to a few hundreds of thousands of pheromone traps annually.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

The project title is  Genetically Modified Food in Japan: the Intersection of Science, Policy and Consumer Perceptions.  The host scientist is James Farrer.This study examines science, policy and consumer perceptions related to genetically modified food in Japan. Data is being collected and analyzed from scientific reports, government documents, interviews and surveys. The working question is  What governmental frameworks regulate genetically modified food in Japan?  This question is answered using interviews with ministry officials, professors, consumer groups, consumers and biotech advocates. Policy documents from the United States Department of Agriculture, Japanese ministries, legislative documents and popular media are also consulted. Science and consumer perceptions are contextualized within these governmental frameworks. Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, outcomes of the research project have implications for U.S.-Japan trade, as agricultural biotechnology is an important factor in trade relations and Japan is the largest importer of U.S. soybeans and corn of which most are genetically modified.

855,"The Brazilian Amazon, long viewed as vital to the maintenance of global environmental balances, has now also become one of the world''s most rapidly growing agricultural frontiers. Since 1990, broad-acre agricultural systems, led by favorable conditions for soybean production, have expanded by more than 80,000km² in the emerging production frontiers in Brazil''s Center-West and Northern regions. The growth of soybean production in these areas has come with both economic benefits and environmental costs; and this region is poised to continue growing as a production center. Where and to what extent this expansion takes place will have enormous consequences not only for broader scale questions of environmental sustainability and food supplies, but also locally, as rapidly developing agricultural counties attempt to balance the potential returns from agriculture with maintaining a healthy and sustainable environment. Intellectual Merit:This research considers a key aspect of Brazil''s agricultural transformation. The focus is on the role of capital generation and credit scarcity in constraining and shaping the location and extent of Brazil''s agricultural growth. Specifically, how people and capital are redistributed from sources of capital generation to capital scarce, marginal regions and how land managers'' investments are constrained to self-financing on past returns or peer to peer exchanges based on agricultural futures. The question how land managers choose between multiple investment pathways as capital becomes available or, specifically, whether they seek to (1) intensify on already productive parcels through double (or even triple) cropping systems, or (2)seek out and convert existing pastures or forests in new locations to cropland is also addressed. The work is approached by conceptualizing the issue at hand within an interdisciplinary model built on theories from geography, economics, and migration studies. The research plan includes the collection of quantifiable survey data and qualitative interviews conducted in three, strategically-located study agricultural frontier regions. Whereas the survey work aims at establishing quantitative, population-level relationships, the qualitative work attempts to gather more specific information on the processes that underlie this relationship. To set the responses with a spatial and physical structure, the projects links field information to location-specific data through a GIS. In summary, the main intellectual merits of this work include (1) an innovative, interdisciplinary conceptual approach to understanding the movement of people and their resources, and (2) the integration of socioeconomic survey of broad-acre farmers with MODIS satellite image based data products indicating land use intensity with GIS data.Broader Impacts: The BROADER IMPACTS of this proposal comprise (1) a policy oriented evaluation of area specific constraints on land intensification across three critical agricultural frontiers; (2) Professional growth of the Fellow (Richards), which includes administering and developing the research project and new training in migration studies and survey methods; and (3) the continued development of a research network that that includes scientists at multiple US and Brazilian institutions.This project is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
856,"The genomes (total cellular DNA) of flowering plants, including all crop species, have undergone multiple rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD, polyploidy). The availability of duplicated genes, combined with extensive genome remodeling that follows WGD events, gives rise to a wide range of novel traits. It is clear that gene expression mediates many of these responses, and selection on gene dosage may drive gene family and network evolution. Yet surprisingly little is known about how genome duplication affects individual gene expression or the entire transcriptome (the combined expression of all genes in the genome in a given tissue). This project will use a suite of novel approaches to estimate whole transcriptome size and to assay expression changes of genes across the genome in response to WGD. Several synthetic and recently formed natural polyploids and their diploid progenitors will be studied in order to determine both the immediate and longer-term effects of genome duplication on gene expression. This project is of broad significance and impact because quantifying dosage responses on a genomic scale will clarify our understanding of how selection on gene dosage has shaped plant evolution, leading to important traits in species of agricultural importance, such as soybean, whose close relatives are the targets of this project. In addition, the project funds opportunities for undergraduates to participate in the research, and facilitates scientific collaboration between a major research university (Cornell) and an undergraduate-only institution (Reed College).",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
857,"Plants that harbor nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as alfalfa and soybean, are an important natural source of soil fertility. The bacteria also increase the growth of their host plants, and some wild plants with N-fixing bacteria become highly invasive; they spread and crowd out other species when introduced by humans to a new region. This project will test the hypothesis that the invasiveness of these introduced plants is determined by their ability to form relationships with the N-fixing bacteria in their new habitats, or by whether their own N-fixing bacteria have been introduced along with them. Researchers will compare the species of trees and shrubs in the genus Acacia that have been introduced to California from Australia. Some of these species have spread widely, while others have not become invasive.  The project will use molecular genetic techniques to distinguish native, Californian, N-fixing bacteria from introduced, Australian bacteria, and test whether the more invasive species are more able to harbor Californian bacteria, have more Australian bacteria, or depend less upon N-fixing bacteria for their own growth.Australian Acacias have become invasive in the U.S. and around the world, threatening agricultural lands and areas of conservation concern, and reducing water supplies. Results from this project will help managers control the spread of these trees and of other N-fixing, invasive plants.

858,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop a novel computer vision based plant identification system for commercialization in agricultural weed control. This system will provide a cost competitive alternative to chemical herbicides, a global $20B market. Existing computer vision based approaches can segment a ''splotch'' of green vegetation from a brown background but are unable to provide the selectivity and precision necessary for mechanized, automated weeding. This project''s objective is to create software algorithms that match the capability of the human eye and brain to quickly and reliably classify plants into crops and weeds in real-time. The project team will build a computer vision algorithm based on a hierarchical classifier. This classifier will utilize a field customized support vector machine (SVM) that uses point-of-interest rather than shape-based methods, a novel approach to visual object identification. The result of this research will be the creation of an algorithm integrated into an automated weeding system.The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant, as the development of an alternative to chemical intensive agricultural weed control will impact technological understanding, create commercial opportunity, and positively impact society. Technologically, the project will advance the fields of computer vision and machine learning through development of a real-time, automated plant identification system based on point-of-interest and SVMs. Commercially, the system will offer conventional farmers an effective and chemical-free method to eliminate weeds, and it will offer organic farmers the first truly precise organic weed control method. The addressable market for weed control in food production is estimated to be $4B in the U.S. The system''s ability to eliminate the use of chemical herbicides has a profound societal effect. U.S. farmers apply over 250M pounds of herbicide annually on corn and soybeans alone, with many unintended and detrimental side effects. Chemical concentrations in rivers, lakes and groundwater are rising, and the prevalence of herbicide resistant weeds is growing exponentially.

859,"Plants face an onslaught of potential invaders.  In order to mount successful defenses, plants specifically recognize the threat (microbe vs. herbivore) and mount the proper defense.  As effective counterploys, herbivores may detoxify the chemical defenses of plants or even avoid these plants. The central hypothesis is that as a counterploy, some herbivores present themselves in  disguise  and thus avoid detection by plants.  The investigators will study herbivores that exploit their gut bacteria by releasing them in their oral secretions on plants, and thus be  mistakenly  recognized as microbes.  Consequently, plants turn on the incorrect defenses that are largely ineffective against these intruders.  The hypothesis will be tested using biochemical and molecular approaches to identify specific oral bacteria responsible for suppressing plant defenses.  The experimental system will include leaf-feeding beetles and caterpillars and several crop species (corn, soybeans, tomato) and wild plant species (wild Solanum, poplar, and Arabidopsis).  The bacterial community of the oral secretions of the herbivores will be altered by dietary antibiotics and then tested for activity in suppressing plant defenses.  Specific bacteria responsible for suppression will be identified and fully characterized at the molecular level.  Thus the research work is transformative in expanding the understanding of how herbivores exploit their host plants. Because the study system involves key agricultural crops/pests, the knowledge gained from these studies may have far-reaching impact on informing sustainable pest management.  The role of the gut microflora of pest insects has largely been ignored, but could offer new targets that for pest management.

860,"This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the social and environmental implications of smallholder displacement by mechanized soy farming for an important agricultural frontier in the central Amazon Basin.  Mechanized soybean farming has recently crept towards the Amazon Basin, and there is growing concern about the consequences of this expansion on the rainforest.  Past research generally has focused on environmental impacts, namely deforestation via direct encroachments and indirect land-use change at a regional scale. As a result, less is known about the welfare impacts of soybean expansion or about more localized and nuanced land-change outcomes, particularly those associated with smallholder displacement.  The doctoral student will focus on social and environmental processes stemming from such displacements in the central Amazon near the city of Santarem.  He will conduct research that seeks to describe the circumstances under which such displacements occurred, such as whether land was sold at fair market value or was transferred without adequate compensation via coercion.  The student also will address land changes associated with soybean expansion in the central basin.  To this end, he will study the conversion of primary and secondary rainforests on properties transferred from smallholders to soybean interests, and he will examine the deforestation occurring in new frontiers created by the in-migration of smallholders from areas of soybean consolidation.  Research methods will include a survey of smallholders in order to describe the process of land transfer and to ascertain their destination choices upon land transfer to soybean interests as well as analyses of remotely sensed imagery to determine land-change impacts.This project will address social processes and complex interactions involving multiple agents and their subsequent impacts on the Amazon landscape.  The project will contribute to development of land-change science, which has been long dominated by a paradigm focused on land managers acting in isolation.  This project will help expand this paradigm by showing how multiple land-change outcomes occurring on properties sold and on newly acquired holdings can result from a single land sale, and it can describe how land change occurs as a result of multiple agents and social processes impacted by power relations.  Project results should have policy implications, because little is known about the welfare effects of soybean mechanization, particularly with respect to smallholders.  Information generated by this project should contribute to policy debates regarding ways to balance development and the environment in the Amazon.

861,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a process to produce high quality soy protein concentrate (HQSPC) as a fish meal replacer in aquaculture feeds, while providing a binding agent for extrusion and an immunoprophylactic for disease control. Increased demand for fish protein and reduced wild captured fish has facilitated rapid growth of aquaculture (9% per year). This has dramatically increased demand for fish meal (the primary component in aquaculture feeds), causing overexploitation of this resource and rapidly escalating prices. There is considerable market opportunity for a high quality, economical plant protein concentrate to completely replace fish meal in aquaculture feeds, thus providing broad impact. The proposed innovation is a microbially-based process to economically produce HQSPC by converting soybean carbohydrates into protein, yield an exopolysaccharide for pellet binding, and provide an immunoprophylactic. Phase II objectives include generating sufficient quantities of HQSPC for feeding trials with yellow perch to assess technical and economic feasibility. The HQSPC is anticipated to have >70% protein to replace fish meal, while providing desirable growth rates and conversion efficiencies. Bench-scale production costs should be less than current SPC ($0.30/lb), but with an intrinsic value closer to that of soy protein isolate ($1.50/lb). The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to improve the nation?s second largest trade deficit for natural resources, fish protein, by providing a complete fish meal replacement.  Soybean meal or soy protein concentrates (SPC) have been used to partially replace fish meal, however the solvent extraction process used to produce SPC is expensive, the separated oligosaccharides do not have a valuable use, and the quality of SPC (65% protein) is insufficient to permit complete replacement of fish meal. Soy protein isolate (90% protein) requires a more costly protein extraction method. The proposed microbial process converts soybean carbohydrates into additional protein, along with sufficient gum to serve as a binding agent, and a probiotic to induce an immunostimulant effect. Preliminary data shows the proposed microbe will metabolize the individual carbohydrates in soybeans, which will enhance scientific and technological understanding of this mechanism. To demonstrate technical and commercial feasibility, extrusion and enzymatic saccharification will be used to solubilize carbohydrates in soybean white flake, followed by incubation with the gum producing microbe, and recovery of solids for use in yellow perch feeding trials. International aquaculture feed manufacturers would be prospective customers for the HQSPC or the conversion process itself.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Parasites vary in their transmission rate, which influences how quickly they can spread; and in their virulence, a measure of how strongly they worsen the health of their hosts.  Recent research now shows that other organisms in the environment can influence the transmission and virulence of parasites.  For example, antibiotics in milkweed plants that are eaten by monarch butterflies can protect the butterflies from parasites, and female monarchs that are already infected with parasites show a preference for laying their eggs on plants containing high concentrations of the antibiotics.  But what makes one milkweed plant contain more or less antibiotic than another?

Nitrogen is the element that most strongly limits plant growth on land, so one ecological consequence is likely to be a rise in the total productivity of plants.  A more surprising and opposite consequence could be a fall in a major, natural source of nitrogen for plants, the association between species of plants in the Pea Family, known as legumes; and root-dwelling bacteria, known as rhizobia, which convert nitrogen gas in the air into ammonium, a form of nitrogen that plants use to make proteins and other molecules essential for life.  Legumes that can get more nitrogen directly from the soil tend less to associate with rhizobia, which demand carbohydrates from the plants.  Over time, global change in nitrogen is thus predicted to reduce the abundance of rhizobia and drive the evolution of less cooperative rhizobia that make less nitrogen available to the plants.  This could in turn increase reliance on synthetic fertilizers, and feedback upon the global nitrogen cycle.

866,"PI: C. Donovan Bailey (New Mexico State University - Las Cruces)Senior Collaborator - Colin Hughes (Zurich Botanical Garden)The extensive application of next generation sequencing in agricultural research has focused on yield improvements in the most important global food crops (e.g., corn, wheat, rice, and soybean).  However, lesser-known crops in tropical systems are also of tremendous significance; yet these receive comparatively little research attention. Several such plant groups are broadly known as  multipurpose crops , often representing key elements in sustainable agriculture that are fundamental to production gains in mainstream crops grown in impoverished regions. One such lesser-known system includes members of the genus Leucaena, which comprises 24 nitrogen-fixing species of small trees and shrubs. The unusually high leaf protein content of Leucaena (particularly L. leucocephala) helped to garner the titles  miracle tree  and  alfalfa of the tropics  and resulted in small- and large-scale plantings reaching 5 million lowland tropical hectares by the late 1980s. These introduced plantations provide: 1) unique protein-rich leaves for animal feed in livestock production systems, 2) green manure used as nitrogen-rich fertilizer for crops and for soil stabilization in alley-cropping systems, and 3) rapidly renewable woody biomass for construction, fuelwood, and even biofuels through lignocellulosic precursors.  The goal of this project is to investigate how plant transcriptomes change through time and in association with diversification of species.  Specifically, a cost- effective and phylogenetically informed approach will be used to sequence, assemble, and compare sets of expressed genes (transcriptomes) from all species of Leucaena. Insect feeding trials will be used to identify genes and broad metabolic pathways associated with psyllid insect resistance and susceptibility among different species of Leucaena.  In addition, the project will use the data generated to investigate broad patterns of transcriptome size variation and identify some of the specific changes that have been associated with speciation through geographic isolation in comparison to hybrid speciation associated with genome duplication (allopolyploidy).  Finally the data generated will be used to develop molecular markers for plant breeding and other studies.Newly developed breeding tools for tropical woody species are critical for future widespread use as contributors to sustainable agriculture in poor tropical regions of the world.

Proximal sensing tools and GPS referencing will be integrated to develop mobile platforms that are low-cost, flexible, robust, and amenable for a range of species.

Thus, a second objective is to develop novel algorithms for analyzing HTP data to quantitatively estimate phenotypes expressed in field environments. The newly developed sensor systems, indexes, and algorithms will be applied in test cases that examine multiple quantitative traits in wheat, soybean and cotton. The development of HTP platforms will complement the explosion of genomic information currently being collected and will enable field level experimental biology on a scale that has not been previously possible. Because the focus of this project is on field-based assessment of economically important crop species that represent different plant types and production systems, the platform and analytic methods developed in this project are expected to have broad application to a range of target environments and species and allow scalability for larger studies. The tools and methods developed will be transferred to the scientific community through hands-on training workshops. Training materials, equipment designs and software will be publicly available through a project website. This project will provide training for graduate and postgraduate scholars while hosting multiple internships for undergraduate engineering and plant science students in the field of HTP.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
868,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to produce microbes capable of cost-effective production of amino acids used as animal feed supplements.  Technical research herein will test the feasibility of applying cutting edge synthetic biology and metabolic engineering techniques to develop engineered strains capable of sustainable and cost-effective production of purified animal feed supplements.The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a reliable, sustainable and safe source of animal feed supplements using biotechnology. Many plant-based animals feeds, such as those based on maize, are deficient in key nutrients needed for growth. To improve feed efficiency and animal growth rates, these deficiencies have been historically overcome with supplementation with animal waste or protein-rich plant products including soy. Recent BSE (Mad Cow Disease) outbreaks combined with dioxine toxicity (from supplementation with fish products) however, have discouraged the use of animal products. Further, supplementation with soy supplies excess, unnecessary amino acids that the animals excrete as nitrogen-rich waste, a significant environmental pollutant. Feed supplementation using purified amino acids produced via biotechnology offers a superior approach from a safety and environmental sustainability perspective.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
869,"Project SummaryLarge scale events like the Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig Explosion of 2010 and infant formula being purposelyfortified with melamine in China cause great concern and heighten the level of awareness among Americans.Local, state, and national response mechanisms are in place to quickly respond to these situations and helpmitigate unforeseen consequences while protecting public and environmental health. Unfortunately, responseassets at every level can quickly become overwhelmed and may require surge or redundant capacity. The Foodand Drug Administration Food Emergency Response Program (FDA FERN) is one system in place that iscomprised of both federal and state laboratories that bring personnel, supplies, equipment, and expertisetogether to enable food and food product analyses during these situations. Many laboratories are volunteerlaboratories, but 14 member laboratories have entered cooperative agreements and are now referred to as FERNCAP Laboratories. The Arkansas Department of Health-Arkansas Public Health Laboratory (ADH-PHL)became a FERN CAP Laboratory in 2009 and has been working over the past 1.5 years to provide the necessaryfoundation for launching the Arkansas FERN Chemistry Laboratory. This newly formed laboratory is part of rdthe 3 generation of CAP laboratories.ADH-PHL provides a solid laboratory environment for maintaining the Arkansas FERN Chemistry Laboratory.Dedicated laboratory space, quality management systems, and additional surge staff, instrument, and space areavailable when needs arise. Laboratory systems are accredited through several internationally recognizedaccrediting authorities, and the entire laboratory staff brings great experience in the four key project areas ofGC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, and ELISA. ADH-PHL also partners with other federal response networks managedby the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency, namely the Laboratory ResponseNetwork (LRN) and the Environmental Laboratory Response Network (ELRN), respectively. This internalcollaboration brings together a mix of diverse skill sets along with varying degrees of expertise and experiencein a way that promotes interaction and program development. These relationships are crucial for mitigatinglarge scale crises where human and environmental health is threatened.The Arkansas FERN Chemistry Laboratory has met 100% of the goals identified in the first 2 year cooperativeagreement. The laboratory is fully staffed, has obtained, installed and trained on FERN instrumentation, hasworked with FERN partners to successfully validate FERN testing methods focusing on GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, and ELISA, has participated and passed all proficiency tests provided by FDA, has exercised its responsecapabilities, and participates in technical and programmatic meetings, which include conference calls. Thislaboratory continuously focuses to improve emergency response and preparedness efforts and is working withFDA to find ways to enhance and expand FERN response initiatives. FERN analysts are actively evaluatingdiverse food matrix assignments provided by the FDA. These matrices include powdered milk, freeze-driedtuna, spinach, mandarin oranges, pineapple juice, chocolate syrup, soy-based baby formula, snack cakes, energydrinks, drinkable yogurt, balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing, catfish, and spirits.The project plan for this cooperative agreement continues to bolster emergency response and preparednessinitiatives by assessing analytical capacity, cross-training staff to provide additional surge support, proficiencytesting and exercising methodologies, and participating in various training forums including meetings andconference calls reviewing programmatic and technical information. Training sessions provided by FDA andother FERN partners will also be used to help stay abreast of the newest technology being used by FERN. Theproject plan also includes provisions to help expand and enhance FERN response initiatives. Matrix evaluationsand analyte extension studies will continue as staff cross-train with and exercise validated methods.Quantitative capabilities and technology evaluations are being explored as a way to help prepare the FERNprogram for future responses and requests. To help streamline reporting of data, unique data management andprocessing tools are being developed to help expedite final reporting.

870,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Work funded under the PI's previous VA Merit award has contributed directly to a novel and now widely accepted life-saving treatment for local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) resuscitation has also been used in many instances to rapidly reverse acute cardiac and neurological symptoms of toxicity caused by a wide range of lipophilic (fat soluble) medications. In many published case reports involving LAST or other overdoses, ILE was effective even after standard resuscitation measures had failed. ILE is now a principle element in treatment guidelines published by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia, the Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, the Resuscitation Council (UK) and was added to the most recent American Heart Association ACLS guidelines for treating LAST. Drug overdose is the second leading cause of accidental death in the United States contributing to 36,000 fatalities in 2007 placing it ahead of gunshot wounds and just behind motor vehicle accidents. Moreover, veterans are at particular risk given the prevalence of both illicit drug abuse and the difficulty for a geriatric population to adhere to instructions for such prescription drugs as long acting calcium channel blockers that can be potentially fatal in overdose. Notably, ILE has been used effectively in treating overdose of many common prescription medications (e.g. beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants or calcium channel blockers) that can be highly resistant to standard resuscitation measures. Identifying the precise mechanism(s) underlying ILE holds the promise of improving its efficacy and providing an effective, generic antidotal treatment for a range of life-threatening toxic drug overdoses. However, the precise mechanisms of ILE are not well understood. The conventional explanation involves partitioning of the offending toxin into the newly created lipemic plasma phase, or 'lipid sink'. However, even this mechanism has not been tested rigorously in vivo. Moreover, we have observed that key aspects of ILE cannot be explained by the sink alone, indicating that other, less well-understood, mechanisms are also at play. We believe that ILE also directly benefits cardiovascular function and have confirmed in preliminary experiments that the infusion of lipid emulsion in the intact rat exerts positive effecs on cardiac contractility and aortic blood flow. We hypothesize that this results in part from direc, positive effects of fatty acid metabolism on cardiac function. Moreover, it is well-established tha tissue ischemia can cause intercellular endothelial gaps to expand, thereby allowing liposomes to migrate into the myocardial interstitium. Such passive targeting of lipid particles, essentiallynano-medicine, will bypass the normal tissue barriers to diffusion of drug away from cells and diminish the response time to lipid signal effectors. We hypothesize that extravascular migration of lipid particles contributes to the overall efficacy of ILE in reversing cardiac drug toxicity. W propose studies to test the metabolic effects of ILE and transendothelial migration of lipid particles. Finally, we seek to improve the translation of ILE to cocaine-related toxicity and longer-lasting overdoses such as calcium channel blocker toxicity. Improved patient safety and outcomes from drug toxicity are the over-arching goals of this project.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

875,"Surface waters within watersheds of the Midwest dominated by corn-soybean production contain some of the highest loads of nonpoint source nitrate in the nation. These nitrate loads have potentially widespread impacts on both public health and ecosystem function. Public regulatory agencies are responding to resulting issues such as hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico by requesting that states develop strategies to reduce nutrient flux to receiving waters and establish nutrient criteria to protect local aquatic life. Many studies in areas of the Midwest dominated by corn-soybean production indicate that the primary pathway for nitrate entering the surface waters is through the discharge from artificial subsurface drains (popularly called  tiles ). Riparian buffers are a proven conservation technology for reducing the movement of sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen into surface waters. However, in the 17.4 million ha of artificially drained land in the Midwest, much of the nitrate-laden water leaching from row crop fields is routed directly through the buffers in drainage pipe and discharged directly into surface waters. Thus, riparian buffers in tile drained landscapes do not remove much nitrate because they are no longer hydraulically connected to the row crop area above the buffer and most of the nitrate passes through them in pipes. One approach to address this issue is to intercept the field tile outlet where it crosses a riparian buffer and divert a fraction of the flow as shallow groundwater within the buffer (hereinafter termed a saturated buffer). The infiltrated water would potentially raise the water table within the buffer into organic rich soil layers and provide an opportunity for the nitrate contained in the field tile drainage water to be removed by denitrification before entering the adjacent stream. To test the efficacy of this practice, two saturated buffer sites were established within small watersheds in North-Central Iowa. This project will quantify nitrate loss within these saturated buffers established under a range of conditions; determine the mechanisms by which nitrate is processed within saturated buffers; and inform the development of criteria under which saturated buffers would be implemented as a conservation practice. The impact of our findings will lead to better designs of saturated buffers as an effective conservation practice. Wide use of saturated buffers may result in measureable reductions of nitrate in surface waters and improved local water quality and reduced hypoxic zones in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

A dramatic increase in fungicide applications to row crops in Iowa in recent years is cause for environmental, human health, and economic concern. Fungicides are marketed not only for disease management, but also for plant health benefits including protection from yield losses caused by environmental stresses such as hail. After a hail event in corn and soybean, farmers and agronomists question whether or not a fungicide application would be beneficial. The goal of this project is to determine the effect of fungicide applications to corn and soybean plants damaged by artificial hail events. This information will equip farmers and agronomists to make more informed decisions about fungicide application at a critical time in crop production: after a major abiotic stress event. This could reduce unjustified pesticide applications and save farmers money during an already difficult growing situation. This will be achieved by setting up two field plot locations in Iowa. At each location, a variety of fungicide and insecticide products will be applied to corn and soybean plants damaged by simulated hail at different timings. Foliar disease levels, yield, and other information will be measured. An economic analysis of results will help to determine any economic benefit to fungicide and insecticide applied after hail. We will develop new extension materials using information from this research to help Extension experts deliver unbiased, research-based information to stakeholders.

878,"Soybean and corn systems dominate the United States Midwest (the Corn Belt) accounting for about 60 million ha of the land surface--an area greater than the entire State of California. These systems produce important goods and services in terms of food, fiber, and fuel and have a major impact on the US economy. Their influence on nitrogen (N) cycling is of particular concern because of the large N inputs that are used to maximize ecosystem productivity. Approximately 5 Tg (1 Tg = 1012 g) of synthetic N is applied to the Corn Belt each year (Griffis et al., 2013). It is well documented that large synthetic N inputs to agricultural systems on a global scale are resulting in a profound increase in atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O) (Crutzen et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2012). In this project we aim to understand how agricultural management practices, climate, and finescale hydrological features across the landscape influence N2O emissions. We will use atmospheric measurement techniques and geostatistical approaches to help constrain the N2O budget and to help identify N2O hotspots across the corn belt. The main goals are to: 1) quantify the distribution of drainage networks and N2O emission hot spots; 2) evaluate indirect emissions on the regional N2O budget using tall tower observations and a novel inverse modeling approach; and 3) forecast how changing precipitation patterns in the Upper Midwest may impact regional N2O emissions. Our work addresses a critical environmental issue in one of the most intensively managed agricultural regions of the world where there is increasing demand on production and a need for sustainable practices. By placing better constraints on the indirect and direct N2O emissions, we believe that new management practices could be developed to help mitigate N2O emissions while maintaining high productivity.

881,"Rationale The need to control manure-derived nutrient pollution is straining the confined animal production industry. California is the top milk producing state and has some of the strictest nutrient regulations. But in the San Joaquin Valley, many dairies do not have affordable access to more land for manure application. A highly productive crop is needed that will convert manure nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P) into feed but in smaller land areas than crops such as corn. Algae are a candidate feed with annual yields typically 7-13 times greater than soy or corn. Beyond 40-50% protein, algae also contain fatty acids, amino acids, pigments, and vitamins that are valuable in animal feeds, especially for adding value to milk. Advances in molecular biology allow us to gather needed information on the risks and benefits of algae-based animal feeds. Overall goal Benefit animal agriculture and the environment by introducing microalgae as a fast-growing livestock feed crop. Aim 1 Cultivate algae in dairy freestall barn flush water, treating this wastewater, while producing algae feedstock at a high annual rate, at least 10-times greater than corn. Algae will be cultivated in 30-cm deep raceway ponds at the 300-head Cal Poly campus dairy farm where extensive manure management research already occurs under USDA and USEPA sponsorship. Aim 2 Produce algae with favorable nutritional characteristics (high digestibility, valuable fatty and amino acid profiles, balanced protein and carbohydrate concentration, etc.) by adjusting the treated-water recycling into the ponds to optimize the N concentration in the growth medium. Aim 3 Test pathogen survival in algae feeds prepared by pasteurization and/or drying and heating. A trend in municipal wastewater treatment is pasteurization of treated effluent using waste heat from natural gas electrical generator. Large dairies with digesters will have waste heat available for pasteurization and drying. High-protein algae will be pelletized with high carbohydrate feeds to create a balanced feed. The heat of pelletization also contributes to pasteurization. Cal Poly has a research feed mill for producing such blended feeds. Aim 4 Monitor contamination by cyanobacteria and any cyanobacterial toxins. Approach Removal of N, P, and other constituents will be optimized in influent and effluent of identical ponds. Algal biomass (harvested by bioflocculation+settling) will be analyzed for N, P, protein, carbohydrates, and profiles of fatty and amino acids. Pathogen and algal communities extant in raw and feed-processed algal biomass will be analyzed using metagenomics and pyrosequencing. Potential toxicity of algal biomass will be studied using toxicity evaluation of cell-free extracts on cultured mammalian cells. A TC 20 Cell counter (BioRad Laboratories) will be used to monitor toxicity events on treated cells using trypan blue staining. Cytotoxic positive samples will be tested for both presence and concentration of known cyanobacterial toxins. The researchers have decades&#39; experience in algae production, wastewater treatment, and food safety. Expected outcomes Starting with dairy, the project will lead the way towards an algae feed industry based on advanced nutritional features to enhance agricultural products (e.g., milk protein, poultry pigment) while assisting farmers to meet manure management challenges. We will address topics rarely covered in the algae field: potential toxicity and zoonotic pathogens.

Biorefineries using corn and cellulosic biomass are becoming well established, but using soybeans to replace petroleum has not moved beyond producing biodiesel using hazardous hexane-extraction of oil.

Much concern has recently been expressed about  food versus fuel,  and one potential benefit of this project is to help break this dogma by producing both food and fuel from soybeans and corn.

884,"Megacopta cribraria, commonly known in the US as the kudzu bug, is a newly arrived invasive pest that is an economically limiting pest of soybean production. Since initial discovery in northeastern Georgia in October 2009, credible surveys confirm the species in 357 southeastern US counties located in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. In response to very large infestations in commercial soybean fields, research and extension entomologists at southeastern land grant institutions determined that M. cribraria feeding in soybean reduced yields in untreated fields from 0-60%, with an average loss of 20%. Furthermore, research conducted on research plots suggested that several treatment thresholds may be appropriate and a single well timed insecticide application could mitigate yield losses. While long term management will likely require classical biological control and host plant resistance, growers urgently need short term solutions to manage this pest. Objectives of the proposed project are: 1) verify the insecticide threshold for treatment of M. cribraria in commercial soybean production using whole field or border spray tactics; 2) examine the edge association of M. cribraria and field edges; and 3) extend best management practices to soybean stakeholders. All experiments will be conducted in grower-owned fields replicated in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

This coordination allows IR-4 to successfully accomplish its mission to facilitate the regulatory approval of safe and effect PPP for specialty crops (fruits, vegetables, ornamentals) and other minor uses, including management of arthropod pests that transmit diseases to humans. The IR-4 Project is needed because registrants of PPPs focus their development effort in major crops (eg corn, soybeans). IR-4 fills the niche by developing the required data to extend these PPP registrations to specialty crops/minor uses. IR-4 Headquarters coordinates all activities with collaborators and researchers including commodity/grower groups, the PPP industry, State Agricultural Experiment Stations, EPA, USDA and cooperating foreign governments. IR-4 continues to provide significant deliverables with positive impacts to stakeholders. Impacts include new registrations for key pests, extending the value of data to include similar crops through crop grouping and extrapolation and assisting in the harmonization of international Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) standards to remove pesticides as a trade barrier. Benefits to society are achieved because IR-4 focuses its efforts on registration of PPP deemed lower risk for humans and the environment while giving the specialty crop producers technology to better manage diseases, pests and weeds in a sustainable and environmentally manner.

888,"In November 2011 the worlds human population reached 7 billion. Concurrent role shifts in world economies (e.g., competition for seafood products with China) make it necessary for aquaculture to grow at a pace much faster than previously estimated. In addition, the American seafood trade deficit now exceeds $10 billion per year. Clearly, we are at a point when new technologies are desperately needed to aquaculture food production. It is clear that future aquaculture expansion cannot rely on resources which are static at best - if not declining - as is the case of fishmeal. Soybean meal (SBM) is an excellent source of dietary protein. However, possible SBM inclusion levels in fish/shrimp feeds are limited due to the presence of both heat-resistant and thermo-labile anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) in SBM. While solvent-extracting and cooking significantly reduce the biological activity of protease inhibitors, this processing also renders protein less available for absorption at the intestinal level. Likewise, the preparation of soy protein concentrates (SPC) uses ethanol (or acid) percolation to displace soluble/indigestible carbohydrates (oligosaccharides) but, in doing so it also drives out minerals and vitamins of which SBM is considered a rich source. Moreover, the use of heated alcohol further denatures protein reducing solubility/dispersibility values (indicative of a diminished protein bioavailability). Recent advances in soy breeding have allowed for the development of non-genetically modified cultivars with enhanced nutritional characteristics. Reduced trypsin inhibitors, reduced oligosaccharides and high protein are traits that have been achieved with more improvements being constantly developed. Building on progress to date we have tested several unconventional, not-thermal (energy-saving), nutrient-preserving treatments to process aquafeed-oriented soybean cultivars into novelty meals. The proposed work will quantify - in Atlantic salmon, hybrid striped bass, tilapia and Pacific white shrimp - the effects of using these novel ingredients on waste generation and water quality of recirculating culture systems. Measurable quantities of waste materials generated by fish fed diets based on conventional SBM, SPC and/or fismeal will be contrasted with those produced by fish fed the test ingredients. Apparent digestibility coefficients, fish performance indicators, gut histology and changes in enteric populations of bacteria will be evaluated as well. We envision that the synergy between enhanced soybean cultivars processed under unconventional non-thermal methods will allow for higher inclusion rates in fish/shrimp feed formulations resulting in increased sales of American soy products worldwide. The production of alternative, soy-based aquafeeds will have a significant and positive impact in American aquaculture as well as on American seafood supply and availability.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
889,"The increasing frequency of very heavy rainfall is one of the most prominent changes in climate of the central U.S. over the past fifty years. This study will examine whether the observed shift toward heavier events has been produced not only by global climate changes but also by regional land use change. Agriculture and crop patterns have changed over large areas of the region, including replacement of grain crops with soybean over much of the region as well as overall intensification of agriculture such as increases in planting density. These changes are likely to affect the water cycle through changes in evapotranspiration and the surface energy balance. We will use available data bases of agricultural statistics to document historical regional changes in land use over the central United States on a decade-by-decade basis from 1940 to 2010. The resulting land use compilations will then used as input for a high-resolution regional climate model. Comparing simulations that include these land use changes to corresponding simulations with constant land use will allow us to separate the influence of agricultural land use from the influence of global climate change. Scenarios will also be generated for precipitation changes through 2030, informed by policy considerations such as emphasis either on intensive production or sustainability.

890,"Auxin plays an essential role in crop production in regulation of reproduction, shoot and root growth and response to biotic (pathogens) and abiotic (drought, temperature, salt) stress. Moreover, application of auxin is indispensable for horticulture and tissue culture and auxinic herbicides have long been important in weed control. Although much of the basic research on auxin is being conducted in Arabidopsis, this research is on processes of importance to crop productivity. For example, in the root, auxin controls primary root elongation and lateral root initiation, in the shoot, auxin controls branching and during reproductive development, auxin controls anther fertility, carpel structure and fruit development. Auxin plays a critical role in seedling establishment due to its control of the response to light, gravity and shade. Auxin is also a key player in the response to abiotic stress. Auxin levels increase with increasing temperature and auxin is also involved in the response to drought and salt stress. There is a significant amount of auxin research being conducted in crop plants, such as maize, soybean, rice, tomato and grape, which will also be represented at the meeting. For example, auxin regulates fruit development in tomato, nodulation in soybeans, tuber formation in potato and ear development in corn . Research on auxin is also relevant to the biofuels industry as auxin controls vascular development and plays a significant role in wood formation in trees Therefore, research on auxin is highly relevant to crop productivity and sustainability in the US. These research areas will be discussed at the meeting as invited talks, posters, and talks chosen from submitted. The purpose of this meeting is to bring together researchers from the US, Asia, Australia and Europe to dissect the mechanism of action of this critical plant hormone.

The trade aspects of work in this project are a logical extension of previous work but offer a number of new dimensions and avenues of exploration. They focus specifically on international dimensions of comparative advantage in food, feed and biofuel production, as well as the international challenges of obesity. In the area of environment, I will expand my previous work on sustainability issues to include more specific attention to biofuels and their environmental impacts, especially the excessive reliance on row crops such as corn and soybeans as the primary feedstocks to the U.S. ethanol and biofuels industries. I will also examine how the biofuels sector is evolving in developing countries, and the potential role of non-food materials and sugar as inputs to production. Third, in science and technology, I will examine the policy challenges posed by obesity at an international level, opportunities to break out of the food-fuel dilemma posed by biofuels and advancing food security goals in a global context. In all of the three areas of trade, environment and science and technology, I will maintain a global perspective informed by my view that the institutional requirements of the 20th century will require a more mature regime of international rules informed less by rights to exclude others from a stream of benefits, and emphasizing the common rights of individuals, groups and nations to be included in a healthy environment.

894,"Larger producers of specialty crops in Oklahoma have traditionally earned their livelihood in diverse operations that not only include vegetable and fruit crops, but also traditional agronomic crops such as wheat, soybeans, grain sorghum, corn, peanuts, and cotton. Within this group of producers, a modest number have begun to incorporate some reduced tillage practices into their farming operations, particularly when those practices have a direct affect upon crop success. Reduced tillage practices have been examined and found to be beneficial by many agronomic crop producers within the state of Oklahoma. In a survey of farms within the state it was found that approximately one-third of farmers are utilizing some form of reduced tillage in their operation (Wright et al. 2010). Farms that produce specialty crops exclusively may or may not be using reduced tillage practices. Traditionally, few specialty crop producers report the use of reduced tillage practices. Although these practices have many benefits including reducing soil erosion from wind and water and improving soil condition, their use is dependent upon crop type and harvesting technology. Not all specialty crops are compatible within a reduced tillage system. Crops such as leafy greens require clean tillage to prevent crop debris and insects from being harvested along with the crop. That said, there are many specialty crops that may lend themselves to a reduced tillage approach to farming. Fruiting vegetable crops, cucurbits, legumes and other groups of vegetables may work well within this system. There are several benefits that may result from further examination of reduced tillage practices in specialty crops. Obvious benefits would include verification of reduced operational costs, reducing soil erosion, conservation of moisture and fuel savings. Less tangible issues that need examining might include impacts on soil organic matter and quality, stand establishment, and pest management effects between conventional and reduced tillage systems.

The efforts of this project are focused on: 1) developing an understanding of the role of cultural and management practices as factors influencing the ecology and epidemiology of soybean diseases, 2)manipulating cultural and management practices to limit soybean disease, and 3) identifying sources of resistance that can be incorporated into soybean cultivars adapted to Minnesota.. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to limit yield loss to soybean diseases to assure yield stability and higher soybean yields for Minnesota soybean growers. In Minnesota soybeans are planted on approximately 7 million acres and are Minnesota?s second most valuable cash crop. In 2009 Minnesota farmers produced 285 million bushels of soybeans. Soybean diseases cause yield losses estimated at 2 to 8 percent of soybean yields. Our research into management of soybean diseases leads to effective methods of limiting soybean yield losses to disease and increasing the profitability of soybean production for Minnesota farmers.

897,"Ruminants have the ability to convert cellulosic biomass to usable products like milk and meat. The ability of the ruminant to utilize cellulose resides in the enzymatic breakdown of fiber by microbes inhabiting the rumen. This is a unique albeit inefficient aspect of ruminant metabolism. Much of the inefficiency lies in the rumen fermentation. Optimizing rumen fermentation will reduce inefficiency, maximize animal performance and nutrient utilization and minimize waste. With current corn and soybean feed prices, improving nutrient use in the rumen will improve economic impact on the viability of the dairy operations. Feed costs are the single largest expense in dairy production. Feed costs and feed efficiency affect feasibility and profitability of dairy operations. Bacteria in the rumen ferment feed into short chain fatty acids (SCFA) to extract energy in the form of ATP to use for metabolic functions, nutrient use and to sustain microbial growth. These SCFA are used by the animal as a major source of metabolizable energy and microbes are in turn used as a major source of metabolizable amino acids. The efficiency with which ruminants convert feed nutrients into milk or meat is not high and appears to vary significantly with different dietary conditions. Most of this variability occurs in the rumen and seems to be related to diet and rumen environment. A better understanding of microbial fermentation will allow us to find ways to improve efficiency of dietary nutrient utilization. Heat stress is a major factor affecting nutrient use by cows. Lower intake and increased heat of fermentation cause animals to produce less and experience reproductive problems. Supplemental fat reduces some of the heat associated stress and has been implicated in having a beneficial role in enhancing reproductive performance of dairy cows.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Soybean meal is produced from soybeans by an involved process which includes harvest, transport, oil extraction, roasting and grinding. This adds considerable costs to the soybean meal. The meal (or beans) must be heat treated to destroy enzyme inhibitors in the bean. Novel beans are now being developed with improved digestibility and low enzyme inhibitors.

This project will test the hypothesis that early life exposure to endocrine disruptors, either naturally occurring or man made, impact sex specific brain development and complex behaviors including anxiety, aggression and responses to social stress. For this project we will use rats and three compounds known to be endocrine disruptors: genistein, a phytoestrogen found in soy; bisphenol A, a chemical found in plastics and food containers, and FM 550, a newly developed flame retardant found in furniture foam. We anticipate that exposure to these compounds, at levels considered relevant to humans, during critical stages of development will result in structural changes within the brain and behavioral changes including elevated anxiety and reduced activity. We further predict that they will have different mechanisms of action, and thus reveal different pathways by which chemicals can impact the developing brain. These compounds are of particular interest because they accumulate in the built and wild environment. Thus they are a risk not only to humans, but also companion animals, farm animals and wildlife species. It is already established that exposure to endocrine disruptors, like the now banned pesticide DDT, can impair reproductive function thus contributing to population declines in numerous species including the bald eagle, alligators, turtles, and numerous species of fish.

901,"Bacterial blight is a common soybean disease significantly threatening the soybean industry worldwide. The bacterial pathogen that causes this disease injects virulence proteins, called effectors, directly into the soybean cells to subvert plant immunity and promote bacterial infection. Although plants have evolved resistant (R) genes to recognize effectors, rapid evolution of these effectors has allowed the pathogens to successful defeat the R-mediated plant defense. This has resulted in the  boom-and-bust  phenomenon of using crop varieties carrying R genes in agricultural practice. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand the dynamic arms race between pathogen effectors and plant defense mechanisms in order to design novel disease intervention methods in a sustainable manner. This project is designed to address this important, yet largely uncharacterized problem. One of the key effectors produced by the causal agent of soybean bacterial blight is called HopZ1. We have identified two forms of HopZ1: HopZ1a can be recognized by a soybean R gene and triggers defense response; HopZ1b was evolved from a HopZ1a-like ancestor but can evade soybean recognition. Therefore, these HopZ1 variants serve as an excellent model system to understand pathogen effector evolution during the arms race with soybean. In this project, we will investigate how HopZ1 facilitates bacterial infection by attacking specific soybean proteins and how HopZ1b, co-evolved with soybean defense system, avoid recognition. A combination of genetics, genomics, biochemistry and cell biology approaches, especially the cutting edge genome-scale analysis including next generation DNA sequencing, will be employed to answer these questions. Findings from this research will significantly benefit the soybean industry by providing guidance and insights into the development of novel management strategies for bacterial blight.

Sales of these crops are more than 67 billion dollars and make up approximately 40 percent of the total value of all U.S. crops. Growers of these minor crops, such as fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices lack the availability of pesticides that are available to growers of major crops because the chemical registrants do not have the economic incentive to obtain the data necessary to register the pesticides on small acreage crops. Registrants are also concerned about product liability and will not register a use or will eliminate uses where liability is an issue. The USDA, with state agricultural experiment stations (SAES), recognized this problem in 1963 when they organized the Interregional Research Project Number 4 (IR-4) to assist specialty crop producers obtain EPA tolerances and new registered uses for pest control products. The IR-4 Project is the only publicly-funded program that conducts research and submits petitions to EPA to establish new tolerances and labeled uses for specialty crop growers. Growers are gradually losing many of the pest management tools they previously had because of regulatory issues such as the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) and other environmental concerns.

First, we will continue to provide our plant genetic transformation expertise and services (maize, soybean, rice, and Brachypodium distachyon) to the public researchers in plant science community nationally and internationally for their efforts in functional studies of plant genes. Our transformation services as a public research infrastructure and the efforts in improving the transformation efficiencies will further enhance public research productivities in plant sciences. Second, we will produce corn and soybean seeds that can accumulate reasonable levels of double stranded small RNAs (dsRNA) that can be used as vaccine for cultured shrimps. The seed-based dsRNA vaccination system is attractive, because it can potentially produce large quantities of dsRNA in materials that is a key component of shrimp feed. Currently there is no report on plant-based dsRNA vaccine. This research, if successful, would represent a significant advance in plant expression capacity for non-protein molecule as vaccines for a variety of veterinary and human pharmaceutical applications. Third, we will explore novel technologies that can be used for effective genome editing and engineering for plants.

905,"Federal mandates require growth of the U.S. ethanol industry to meet prescribed ethanol production targets. Corn is the predominant feedstock used to produce ethanol and the resulting primary by-product (distillers dried grains with soluble - DDGS), along with emerging fractionated by-products, which can be used to partially replace some of the corn, soybean meal, and inorganic phosphate in swine feeds. Although significant research has been conducted to determine the nutritional characteristics and feeding value of DDGS for swine, additional research is needed to explore ways to enhance the energy value and protein digestibility of these ingredients, and evaluate new fractionated corn by-products being produced. Furthermore, the causes of negative and inconsistent growth performance results from some studies, but not in others need to be identified to ensure optimal pig health and performance when distillers by-products are fed to swine. Because of the high corn oil content in many of these by-products, there are pork fat quality concerns when including them in growing-finishing swine diets at high levels. Preliminary results suggest that linoleic acid present in corn oil is easily oxidized during by-product production and storage, potentially creating adverse growth performance, health, dietary nutrient utilization, and pork quality. Therefore, nutritional intervention strategies are needed to prevent this occurance and need to be evaluated. Finally, limited information exists related to the role that ethanol by-products play in manure production, nutrient content, and gas emissions. Results from this project will provide the pork, feed, and ethanol industries essential information to optimize the use of these by-products in swine feeds, minimize feed costs, and provide wholesome pork products to consumers in an environmentally sustainable way.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
906,"Animal agriculture in North Dakota is dominated by cow-calf production. As of January 1, 2011, North Dakota had 880,000 beef cows and 60,000 cattle in feedlots. Cow-calf production is the top ranked animal sector in North Dakota, and sale of cattle and calves ranked number four (behind wheat, soybeans, and corn) in farm receipts with a value of $596,094,000 in 2009. The area of production most critical in beef cow-calf operations is the ability of a cow to give birth and raise a healthy calf until weaning. Reproductive performance is variable among herds (Larson et al., 2006; Dahlen et al., 2010) and estimates indicate the beef industry loses $1.06 billion in revenue as a result of infertility (Lamb et al., 2008). Identifying reproductive techniques or management practices that enhance reproductive performance could provide North Dakota producers opportunities to recapture some of the $65.8 million lost annually to infertility. The area of cost control most critical to beef cow-calf operations is feed cost. Feed costs account for over 60% of annual cow costs (Miller et al., 2001). In 2010, North Dakota producers enrolled in the Farm Business management program spent $190.67 per cow on purchased or grown feeds (NDCTE, 2011). Based on these estimates, it would take $167.8 million to feed the 880,000 cows in North Dakota during the winter of 2011-2012 alone. Identifying methods to improve the utilization of feed resources and achieving producer adoption of these methods would have a significant economic impact. The objectives of this project focus on the cow/calf resource base and explore strategies for producers to optimize the management of their cows along with the calves they produce. The project objectives will be met with research projects that determine the impact of incorporating artificial insemination in commercial operations and with projects that evaluate nutritional strategies to optimize performance, production, and profit potential for producers. Issues addressed in this project are paramount to the continued sustainability of the North Dakota beef industry. Projects that focus on improving fertility are geared toward retaining a portion of the $65.8 million lost annually to infertility in North Dakota.

907,"One of the coordinated activities of NC 1197 is to determine the risk of crop loss due to nematode pests of corn. The Wisconsin contribution to this multistate project will be to determine the pathogenicity of Pratylenchus penetrans to corn in Wisconsin, and characterize the relationship between Pythium ultimum and P. penetrans infecting corn. Corn is the highest value crop grown in Wisconsin and is essential to global food security. Pratylenchus spp. is the most common nematode pest in the North Central Region. We will model the relationship between population densities of P. penetrans and corn for inclusion into a corn risk matrix model being developed for the region. Our work will help define standards for sampling fields for P. penetrans and other species and interpreting assay results. Pythium ultimum is a common soil organism attacking corn. Many people assume diseases caused by P. ultimum and P. penetrans are not independent because both pathogens infect roots, but the interaction has not been studied. Determining if nematodes contribute to increased fungal diseases will help producers manage their crops profitably and use pesticides more effectively.

909,"The vast majority of Illinois acres devoted to production of corn and soybean production are treated with herbicides one or more times each growing season. Even with the occurrence of herbicide-resistant weed populations, herbicides continue to be important and widely utilized weed management tools. The development of herbicide resistance in weed populations can result in significant economic losses for growers. Growers, however, frequently continue to use a successful herbicide program until it fails instead of proactively implementing herbicide resistance management strategies. The greatest economic loss a farmer faces due to selection of herbicide-resistant biotypes likely occurs during the first year of a large-scale weed control failure; the farmer assumes the herbicide product used in the past will control weeds during the current season only to discover the level of control is unacceptable due to the presence of resistant plants. The long-term economic consequences of herbicide resistance include loss of herbicide performance and shifts in weed populations. It has been argued that preventing the selection of herbicide-resistant weed biotypes can often cost a producer significantly less than the costs incurred dealing with resistance once it has developed.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Both chronic (e.g., corn blights and ear rots, wheat scab, white mold and brown spot of soybean) and emerging plant diseases (e.g., gray leaf spot of corn; soybean rust and soybean vein necrosis virus; brown root rot of alfalfa; new rust races on cereals and grasses; smut and anthracnose of switchgrass) are a continual threat to every New York field crop and can reduce the profit margin for field crop producers. This project addresses the most critical and timely crop disease management issues and supports extension education initiatives aimed at sustaining profitable and ecologically sound food, feed, and biofuel production systems. Methods employed include farm survey, laboratory diagnosis, experimental field plot assessment of cultivars, biological control agents, and cultural practices; controlled environment experiments; molecular genetic evaluation of pathogen populations. Research efforts in the next three years will be focussed on assessment of the value in foliar fungicide application to field crops, the biology and management of mycotoxin-producing fungi in corn and wheat, resistant varieties and seed treatments for control of fungal diseases in switchgrass for biofuel production, and further characterization of the fungus that causes brown root rot of alfalfa. The impact of this research and resulting educational programs will be a more profitable and sustainable field crops production sector in New York as well as more profitable animal, food processing, and biofuel production industries in the state.

911,"Soybean is classified as a legume and has been cultivated for more than 3,000 years in Asia. It is a major part of the Asian diet and gaining popularity in other parts of the world. Its popularity is associated with its health-promoting properties including promotion of cardiovascular health and reduction of cancer risk. These health benefits are due to the presence of biologically active compounds in soybean including isoflavones, saponins and bioactive peptides and proteins. Soybean is a high protein, nutrient dense food that possesses biologically active peptides such as lunasin and others. The Food and Drug Administration approved the claim that 25 g of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled studies on the effect of soy protein consumption on risk factors for CVD found a median intake of 30 g/d significantly improved serum lipoprotein. Although chronic inflammation has been implicated as a major contributor to the progression of atherosclerosis, further research into the molecular effect of soy protein would provide potential implications to health. It is extremely important to understand the role of peptides on the health benefits to animals and humans. This will increase the demand for soybeans and thus will benefit U.S. growers. Scientific knowledge will be advanced since the results of this research will be published in scientific journals, will be presented in scientific meetings, and also will be presented to consumers in short non-technical communications.

913,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus has increased by about 33% over the past decade in the U.S., generating immense health care costs, and is related to obesity. Women undergoing menopause gain belly fat and have a tendency to develop diabetes. We have shown that a daily soy supplement containing phytoestrogens (weak estrogen-like chemicals) reduces the amount of belly fat in women after menopause compared to a milk shake placebo. Most fat reduction is superficial, but there is also some reduction of deeper belly fat located near abdominal organs. This deeper belly fat is most closely related to diabetes and heart disease risk. In this new study, we propose to obtain both superficial and deep belly fat from women undergoing benign gynecologic procedures. Women with diabetes and cancer will be excluded. We will expose fat cells in the lab to various concentrations of the phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein to determine if these phytoestrogens found in soy cause genes to be expressed that indicate that the fat cells are more sensitive to sugar and insulin, while increasing removal and breakdown of fat. We are currently conducting a trial to look at ways that a daily soy supplement reduces belly fat compared to a milk shake placebo. We have recruited 11 women in menopause and assigned them to drink a daily soy shake or a milk shake placebo. We have done biopsies of fat located under the skin in healthy menopausal volunteers before the study begins and after drinking the shakes for 2 months.

The general strategy for this is to clearly define the traits that contribute to yield through careful study of phenotypes, characterize the genes molecularly, and then use the molecular information to find new forms of the genes in diverse germplasm.

916,"Prosperous Virginia agribusinesses have experienced economic turmoil as a result of the 2005 mandate to end the federal tobacco price support program. Tobacco is no longer a viable alternative for many small acreage farmers. Vegetable soybean or Edamame as a cash crop is an ideal substitute because Edamame can be grown as a commodity crop similar to grain-type soybean but is marketed as a high value vegetable if harvested fresh. Because studies over the years on soybean and human health indicated that eating Edamame reduces cancer risks and lowers total and bad cholesterol, domestic demand has been increased with rising consumer awareness, which makes Edamame a potentially profitable crop. Most Edamame on the U.S. market relies on frozen product imported from China and Taiwan. However, the quality of frozen Edamame quickly drops in storage. Fresh Edameme is preferred by consumers, but fresh Edamame supply lasts only a few days every year as a result of short harvest window. Little information of extending Edamame harvest window is available for optimal conjunction of yield and profit. The objectives of this project are to build up an off-season Edamame production system in Virginia in order to extend Edamame harvest window from a few days up to half a year; and to identify optimum Edamame varieties in multiple growing seasons. The field research will be mainly conducted at Randolph farm of Virginia State University, Petersburg, VA from 2013 to 2015. Four released Edamame varieties with maturity groups (MG) from III to VI, GardenSoy 31 (MG III), GardenSoy 41 (MG IV), Moon Cake (MG V), and Randolph (MG VI), will be sowed in greenhouses and transplanted into high tunnels and the field for spring and early summer harvest, and will be successively, directly planted in the field and high tunnels for summer and fall production. Total marketable yield and seed quality traits including moisture and the content of protein, oil, and sucrose of each cultivar will be measured after each harvest to determine whether the production system is feasible and profitable.

917,"Colon cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in the United States. Poor prognosis makes it one of the deadliest cancers. Dietary factors are closely associated with colon carcinogenesis. Higher intake of soy products containing bioactive components such as genistein has been linked to lower incidence of colon cancer development. However, the mechanisms by which soy products and soy bioactive components exert anticancer effects remain unknown. Because of the lack of scientific evidence on the mechanisms of the cancer prevention potentials of soy products, there are no nutritional recommendations made to Americans. In gut, multiple signaling pathways intertwine and delicately balance the rapid growth-maturation-sloughing off cycle of intestinal epithelium. Among them, WNT signaling pathway is critical to the growth of epithelial layer. And because of that, the abnormal activation of WNT signaling has been shown to be associated with 90% of colorectal cancer. Moreover, gene-specific epigenetic modification is closely associated with aberrant WNT signaling in colon cancer. Previous studies from my laboratory have established that: 1) Dietary genistein exposure reduces colon preneoplasia; 2) Genistein prevents carcinogen-induced abnormal activation of WNT signaling; 3) Genistein regulates WNT signaling pathway through specific WNT genes; and 4) Genistein-induced gene regulations in colon cancer cells involve epigenetic modifications. Based on current knowledge of colon cancer development and beneficial actions of soy products, the present study is designed to test the hypothesis that dietary genistein modulates colon cancer development through epigenetic modifications on WNT signaling related genes. Using a rat model for colon cancer development, we will be able to examine how genistein modifies the epigenetic codes so that the WNT signaling is maintained at normal level when induced by a carcinogen and therefore chance of colon cancer development is greatly reduced. Moreover, we will compare the effects of dietary genistein at different stages of life to identify the best timing of exposure for achieving the maximal protection against colon cancer development. Findings from this project will improve our understandings on the mechanisms of soy products at reducing colon cancer risk and facilitate the identification of molecular markers, especially epigenetic markers, associated with colon cancer development.

919,"The cotton industry remains a significant economic force in US agriculture, but rising input costs associated with energy, fertilizer, seed, irrigation and crop protection have affected on-farm profitability and threaten the economic sustainability of American cotton. Despite success with boll weevil eradication programs, and adoption of transgenic cultivars with insecticidal traits, cotton insect pests including tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois)), continue to have economically important effects across the Midsouth cotton producing states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee). The elevated pest status of Lygus is thought to have arisen from the reduced overall foliar insecticide use in cotton that has resulted from boll weevil eradication and from adoption of transgenic cultivars with insecticidal traits that act to control caterpillar pests. Other suggested reasons are associated with the increased crop diversity in the region with expanded corn and soybean acreage as well as the concomitant widespread adoption of conservation tillage and modified weed management practices associated use of herbicide tolerant, transgenic crop cultivars. In low-till systems, host plants of Lygus may be present in fallow fields through the winter and remain through planting. Survival and/or movement from wild plant hosts to cotton will be dependent on weather and timing and type of field operations in preparation for planting. Adoption of soil and water conservation systems incorporating cover crops can influence arthropod pest problems and subsequent control costs either positively or negatively depending on cover crop selection and management. Cover crops can impact natural enemy spectrum and population density affecting biological control, as well as affect susceptibility and recovery potential of the crop following pest induced injury. Perhaps the most challenging aspect of implementing IPM in the 21st century is to educate and demonstrate to farmers and their crop advisors how to use decision aids to avoid making unneeded insecticide applications. Farmers need evidence from real-time data that shows their crop is doing well even without protective sprays. The system must be a workable method of information synthesis that can be used for rapid communication among growers and their support groups. Research in Arkansas and other states has been directed at developing and expanding such a system - COTMAN. It includes monitoring responses of the cotton plant to injury occurring at different stages of plant development, and it is capable of integrating crop, soil, and pest management tactics. Precision agriculture approaches using site specific management have potential to reduce unnecessary costs and optimize the deployment of seed, fertilizer, growth regulators, and pesticides needed for profitable production.

Elevated ozone has been estimated to amount to a loss of agricultural productivity of as much as 3 billion dollars yearly in the US and Canada. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O3) are increasing steadily in the atmosphere and are expected to double from its pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century. Elevations of CO2 and O3 have been associated with multiple negative impacts on plants. Ozone is considered one of the most toxic pollutants in the troposphere and soybeans are one of the most sensitive plants to O3 damage. Responses of soybean plants to elevated CO2 and O3 include increased photosynthesis (as a result of elevated CO2) and thus enhanced yield, balanced by decreased yield caused by elevated O3. The University of Illinois has the perfect opportunity to investigate the impact of elevated CO2 and O3 on soybeans, the largest single source f protein meal and vegetable oil in the human diet. We have the only free air gas concentration environment (FACE) facility in the world that has been established to study the impact of altered CO2 and O3 on the soybean crop (SOYFACE facility). Soybeans serve as a significant source of biologically important compounds, the alteration of which could have significant impacts on product quality and human health.

The growth of high-lipid algal biomass in ponds, raceways, or reactors is by some estimates one of the most effective means to produce biodiesel on per area basis. Key to the economic success of algae-derived biofuel is the development of co-products that can be sold in addition to the biofuel. One major co-product that is currently being studied is the use of residual algae protein as a partial substitute for soy and corn meal in animal and fish feed. In this project we will develop the means to introduce a high value enzyme into the algal protein mix. Specifically, we will incorporate the enzyme phytase, an enzyme that helps non-ruminant animals such as pigs and poultry to create bioavailable phosphorous from phytate, the dominant form of phosphorous in soy and cornmeal. We will determine which DNA regulatory elements are the most important regulators of protein expression and accumulation in the well-studied algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and we will test chloroplast transformation of algae species closely related to the organism being used in animal feed trials here on campus. In particular we will test combinations of several downstream box regions that we have shown to be very important with respect to protein expression in tobacco, together with the gene that codes for phytase.

923,"This project is designed to characterize interactions among soilborne pathogens and soil edaphic factors that impact losses from soilborne pathogens on major row crops in Arkansas. The soilborne pathogens that affect major row crops in Arkansas have wide host ranges and thus are common to many crops. Within these pathogen groups, there is a large diversity of species or subgroups that may affect the disease observed as a result of their aggressiveness and interactions within other members of the genus or with other pathogens that form disease complexes. A number of these soilborne pathogens cause diseases in the seedling stage on cotton, soybean, and rice reducing plant stands and delaying early-season plant growth. Soilborne diseases also may develop later in the season resulting in significant losses. One of the most important diseases on soybean and rice in Arkansas is aerial blight and sheath blight, respectively, caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA. The environment is an important component of disease development for soilborne pathogens. Among abiotic factors that are important are soil temperature, water and texture. Control approaches differ depending on the crop and pathogen. The proposed research emphasizes soilborne diseases of row crops because these diseases are a major constraint to initial stand establishment and crop productivity. Aspects of soilborne diseases which need to be examined include the diversity and interactions among soil populations of these pathogens and the role of soil physical, chemical, and biological factors and cultural practices. The objectives of the project include: 1) characterize the community structure of selected soilborne plant pathogens as it relates to cropping practices and soil edaphic factors; 2) elucidate the role of soil edaphic factors, including soil texture, temperature, salinity, and water, and cultural practices on pathogen survival and disease development; 3) examine interactions among sub-specific groups and different genera of plant pathogens on plant disease development; and 4) quantify the spatial relationship and movement of selected pathogens within fields. Understanding the importance of soil factors and cultural practices influencing pathogen populations and disease development will aid in targeting fields or portions of fields that are most likely to suffer disease losses and thus when additional control strategies need to be applied. Understanding these associations also may allow the more effective use and precision application of fungicides. Other benefits of this project include the characterization of populations of the pathogen that may interact to increase disease or moderate the severity of disease and the adoption of cultural practices or other strategies that take advantage of these associations.

924,"Cotton acreage in Arkansas has decreased 44% since 2005, while in the same period of time corn acreage has almost tripled, grain sorghum acreage has increased twofold, and soybean acreage has increased about 10%. Because new crops are being grown where cotton has been historically monocultured, the presence and number of plant-parasitic nematodes will likely change. Very little data is available on the economic importance of root-knot, reniform, or lesion nematodes in soybean, peanut, grain sorghum, watermelons, potatoes, or sweet potatoes in Arkansas, but changing cropping systems will alter the nematode communities throughout the state. These changes, will likely create new concerns in some crops, but will also provide an opportunity to manage certain nematodes via crop rotation in areas where diverse cropping systems did not exist. This project will evaluate the current situation regarding the incidence and distribution of known economic nematodes that exist in the state, including a thorough survey of species of root-knot nematodes that are present. Field experience will be obtained through small-plot and microplot studies with various cropping sequences that are either already being practiced by growers or are being seriously considered for economic reasons.

We focus on inferences of 3-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins encoded in thousands of genomes and their associated molecular functions. The analysis encompasses the proteomes of many cellular organisms of crucial significance to agriculture, including model plant systems such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula, plants of economic importance such as soybean, sorghum and Populus, and photosynthesizing microbes such as Chlorella sp. and Chamydomonas reinhardii that are of potential interest for biofuel production. Analysis also includes organisms that exhibit symbiotic and pathogenic lifestyles and represent important beneficial agents and pests that affect crop production. Examples include nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Bradyrhizobium sp. and Sinorhizobium meliloti, symbiotic basidiomycete fungi such as Laccaria bicolor, or deadly plant pathogens such as Phytophthora ramorum or Phytophthora sojae. The genomic sequences of plant pathogens for example provide important information that can help us better understand plant disease and evolution of pathogenicity. Oomycetes and fungi for example have evolved biotrophy on plant hosts several times independently. We need to understand the underlying causes of these episodes of convergent evolution so that we can combat and prevent the rise of plant diseases caused by rusts and mildews (e.g. Puccinia graminis, Ustilago maydis, Tuber melanosporum). These organisms are probably the world's most serious plant disease agents. In particular, soybean rust caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi impacts global soybean production and its genetic structure and diversity was explored using molecular markers. However, genomic information and functional annotations are expected to extend knowledge of the diversity and evolution of this important pathogen. Proteomic analysis of cellular organisms will be also extended to plant viruses, including important model systems such as tobacco and cauliflower mosaic viruses (TMV and CaMV) and viruses that cause important plant diseases. Collectively, viruses such as TMV and many others from 49 viral families impact world agriculture and cause annual losses in crop yields of the order of $60 billion. Some plant viruses not only affect agriculture but also human health, such as the pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), which also causes diseases in humans.

926,"Soybean loss due to pest and pathogen attack is a serious problem worldwide. Soybean producers have few if any options to manage diseases caused by generalist pathogens where major genes for resistance have not been discovered. The purpose of our studies is to strengthen the innate defense of soybean plants to limit colonization of such pathogens and pests with concomitant reduction of yield loss. Plants are constantly attacked by many pathogens and respond by the induction of various metabolic activities needed to provide plant basal disease resistance including cell-wall reinforcement and synthesis of antimicrobial compounds named phytoalexins. Upon biotic stresses, plants of the Leguminosae family produce phytoalexins that are toxic or inhibitory to pathogens belonging mainly to the various derivatives of isoflavonoids. The native phytoalexin in soybean is glyceollin. Success of soybean pathogens largely depends on their capacity to produce enzymes that can destroy or detoxify compounds invoked in the plant defense response. Non-native phytoalexins such as reveratrol from grape or peanut may enhance soybean broad-spectrum resistance, since soybean pathogens may be unable to degrade them. Lignin is another important component of soybean basic resistance to fungal invasion by providing a non-degradable barrier for many pathogens preventing or inhibiting colonization by pathogens. Modification of lignin composition and increasing the concentration in soybean plants could significantly improve basic resistance to soybean pathogens by forcing them to expend further resources towards defeating the lignin defense barrier.

Strategies involving the induction of intrinsic defense responses, or recognition of pathogen-specific elicitors, offer viable alternatives and have the potential to protect against broad spectrum of pathogens. Developing sustainable crop protection approaches such as these requires a fair knowledge of the signaling mechanisms involved in defense. Thus, the elucidation of signal transduction pathway(s) following pathogen recognition could eventually aid the targeted manipulation of defense responses without affecting crop yield. The proposed research aims to understand how plants perceive pathogens and how primary metabolic pathways interface with defense signaling. The long-term goal is to identify factors that can induce broad-spectrum resistance, without significantly affecting plant growth, development, and ultimately yields. This work will ultimately benefit the United States agricultural economy because it is directly relevant to the second largest crop produced in the United States, soybean, and could be applicable to other crops as well. Understanding how plants respond to microbes could also be used for promoting interactions with beneficial organisms.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
929,"A better understanding of how the soybean seed regulates the synthesis of high quality proteins and oils during seed development is also one of the main factors in yield. Unraveling the regulation of the flavonoid pathway may enhance our understanding of plant disease resistance or the modification of flavonoid products in the seed for improved nutritional and health value. Soybean products are of immense value to U.S. agriculture (rivaled only by maize), annually contributing over $17 billion in unprocessed crop value. Soybean has high protein (40%) and moderate oil (20%) content and is the main source of vegetable protein and oil in world markets. In Objective 1, we continue investigations of the gene expression networks involved in setting seed development and early seedling growth. Soybean has a wealth of naturally-occurring mutations that affect other pigmentation properties and morphological types in addition to the seed coat pigmentations described above. Several are also mutable alleles that may harbor transposable elements. As detailed in Objective 2, we will use the latest methods of high throughput sequencing of the mRNA and small RNAs transcriptomes to search for expression differences in some of these mutations in an effort to identify the genes and understand their roles in plant growth and development. In objective 3, we concentrate on verifying the transcriptome data and seek to conclusively identify the genes encoded by the mutant alleles. This research will benefit the biotechnology industry and soybean producers and consumers by providing basic information on gene regulation in soybean, specifically of the flavonoid pathway and other seed compositional traits including protein quality and content. Transcription factors active during seed development and germination will also be a focus. In addition, we will focus on several important developmental pathways including the formation of cell walls, leaves, and trichomes.

The U.S. is the largest producer of soybean internationally with a production of over 90 million metric tons in 2011. The demand for soybean is expected to grow and the U.S. must continue to improve its soybean production efficiency to compete in the global market. These improvements include both increasing the yield potential and pest resistance of cultivars. Although research efforts in soybean breeding and genetics are in progress in many states, these efforts are needed in Illinois because each state has its own unique production environments and pest problems.

931,"Costs of grain and various feed ingredients have increased dramatically in recent years. In addition, the availability of certain commodities has become scarce in certain parts of the country. The result is that rations fed to livestock and in particular, lactating dairy cows, have risen dramatically in cost. The current cost to produce a hundred kg of milk is below the current milk price and therefore, the profitability of the dairy industry is negative, and producers are again losing equity. In the past, commodities and/or by-products have been used to reduce ration costs and improve profitability of the dairy operation. However, even these commodities are increasing in cost due to value and availability relative to corn and soybean meal. Therefore, new ways must be found to reduce feed costs to regain profitability and sustainability of the dairy industry to compete on a world market. Feed efficiency is one way to improve the profitability and sustainability of the dairy operation. Feed efficiency is defined as the unit of milk produced per unit of dry matter intake. The energy content of the ration is the greatest factor affecting the feed efficiency of the lactating dairy cow. The greatest factor(s) affecting the energy density of the diet are the digestibilities of the forages in the ration. Forages are the cheapest and most economical sources of nutrients on the farm when compared to grains, proteins, and various commodities sources. Therefore, increasing forage nutrient availability will increase their economic value relative to other commodities or by-products. The use of highly digestible forages may allow one to increase the amount used in the ration to meet the nutrient requirements of high producing dairy cows. In addition, meeting the nutrient requirements of dairy cows in later lactation may also be advantageous in order to reduce feed cost to improve profitability.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
932,"Oomycete plant pathogens cause devastating plant diseases. For example, Soybean losses to Phytophthora sojae are estimated at $2 billion per year, and other Phytophthora species together cause additional $10's of billions of dollars in losses on a global scale. Downy mildews affect many crops and account for ~25% of the $5 billion dollar global fungicide market. The proposed research is focused on fundamental aspects of oomycete-plant interactions. Specifically, the experiments are designed to uncover the functions of effector proteins that oommycete pathogens secrete to the inside of plant cells. The objectives of this project are to understand where these proteins are localized inside plant cells, and to identify the plant proteins that they sabotage. We expect to gain new, broadly applicable knowledge of how disease-causing pathogens manipulate plants to suppress their potent immune systems. Our long-term vision is that foundational knowledge on molecular aspects of these interactions will inspire new control strategies, perhaps based on suppression of effector function.

933,"On initiation of the NCERA 200 committee, little was known about the incidence or impact of soybean-infecting viruses in the North Central (NC) region. Since then, research coordinated by this project has revealed that viruses cause recurring disease problems with significant impacts on soybean production in the NC region, the principal soybean producing area of the United States. In multiple years, soybean virus diseases were found at near epidemic levels in NC states causing significant yield reductions, decreased pod and seed set, reductions in oil content of seeds, and seed discoloration. Disease outbreaks were paralleled by abundant insect vector populations associated with these viruses. For example, mild winters allowed bean leaf beetles, which efficiently transmit Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV), to overwinter and immigrate into soybean fields at unprecedented levels, which resulted in very high incidences of BPMV early in the growing season when soybean plants are most sensitive. The spatial and temporal distributions of populations of the introduced soybean aphid, which transmits Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) and several other viruses, also varied greatly from year to year. Emergence of unsuspected viruses in NC soybean fields, such as Soybean dwarf virus, Tobacco streak virus (TSV) and newly discovered viruses like Soybean vein necrosis virus and Soybean yellow mottle mosaic virus have also added complications to this situation. While single-gene resistance has been identified for at least some strains of AMV, SMV, and TSV, effective control options for the other viruses remain to be elaborated. This project will coordinate research on soybean-infecting viruses among concerned scientists with the goal of identifying management options that reduce losses to soybean producers.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

There are currently few recommendations for irrigation management of cotton and soybeans grown in humid regions. The installation of irrigation systems in humid regions of the United States is on the rise due to an increased frequency of recent droughts. Without accurate and robust irrigation recommendations for these regions that specifically targets the crop's changing demand throughout the season, producers are likely to under- or over-irrigate. This may reduce yields and over-irrigating may leave the soil with little capacity to store natural rainfall, resulting in an inefficient use of natural resources and increased runoff, nutrient loss, and erosion.

935,"The problems addressed by this proposed research are assignable to one of two categories: assessing new technologies, including determination of optimal input rates where appropriate; and assessing the effects of various stresses on crop yield and quality. Achieving and maintaining high crop yields is at the heart of competitiveness of Illinois agriculture in the nation and the world. With outstanding soil and human resources, Illinois is well-positioned to maintain its preeminence among crop-producing states. But in order to accomplish this, management practices must constantly be adjusted to reflect changes in cultivars, markets, and available technology. One practice that has gained widespread acceptance in recent years is the use of foliar fungicides on corn (and to a lesser extent on soybean), not only to manage developing fungal diseases, but also to maintain  plant health  (a euphemism for physiological effects) and thereby increase yield, particularly when the crop is under stress. Our preliminary work on this has produced mixed results, with no consistent increase in yield when disease pressure is low or absent. We simply must have better answers to guide the use of a costly practice that counters the IPM approach to management. This project will help provide solid answers to real questions that farmers continue to face as they adjust to new demands and opportunities in grain crop production. New options must be evaluated, and optimum practices determined in order to prevent deterioration in the state's competitive advantage in grain crop production efficiency. Public welfare is directly increased when farmers, informed about technological options, can make decisions that increase efficiency, stabilize production, and lower food costs. This project will produce information needed to bring this about.

936,"While farm policy in theory provides for considerable cropping flexibility for Illinois producers, the mandate to produce fuel ethanol to blend with gasoline has meant an increase in effective demand and higher prices for corn. This price signal has increased the amount of corn at the expense of soybean area in Illinois; in 2001, farmers in Illinois produced 10,850,000 acres of corn and 10,700,000 acres of soybean, while in 2012 corn was planted on 13,000,000 acres and soybean on 8,860,000 acres. With limited acreage of other crops, the high proportion of corn means that corn follows corn on some 20% of corn acres. In recent years, we have found that corn following corn has lower yields than corn following soybean, especially when there is stress during the growing season. This has lowered corn profitability, and has producers considering a return to more soybean acres, or trying to find another rotation that increases corn yields. The rotation studies we have in place are one of very few sources of information to help make such choices.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
937,"Eating patterns and nutritional status are closely related to health. In the recent decades, the growing prevalence of overweight and obesity at early stage of childhood is a serious concern (Hill and Trowbridge, 1998). Obesity is the third most dominant risk factor for noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease in high-income countries (Lopez, Mathers, Ezzati, Jamison, & Murray, 2006). According to the data published by National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (Ogden et al., 2012), in the year 2009-2010, the obesity rate was 16.9 percent among children and adolescents in the United States. Due to the steep increase of overweight and obesity rate and its related health risks, childhood obesity has become one of the most pressing public health concerns in the country (Koplan et al., 2005). Diet is one of the important factors considered as causes of childhood obesity (Ebbeling et al., 2002). Important epidemiological evidence support the concept that diets rich in fiber are associated with lower body weight or weight gain (Lairon, 2007). High fiber diets are important in the prevention and management of obesity and chronic diseases, including type2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer (Kendall et al., 2010). Dietary guidance universally recommends diets higher in fiber for improved health benefits (Slavin, 2005). Current recommendations from the United States National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, suggest that adults should consume 20-35 grams of dietary fiber per day, but the average American's daily intake of dietary fiber is only 12-18 grams. Similarly, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) also recommends a minimum of 20-35 g/day for a healthy adult. The recommended amount for children is the age plus 5 g/day (e.g., a 4 year old should consume 9 g/day). There are emerging needs for food products with higher dietary content which are readily available to consumers especially at younger ages. However, incorporation of fiber ingredients to food products is challenging due to the adverse effect on texture and sensory quality of the products. In this project, fractions of dietary fiber obtained from soybeans will be added into bread at various concentrations. In vitro and in vivo studies will be carried out to evaluate physiological effects of different fractions vs. concentration. Starch digestion rate and glucose releasing rate will be compared among treatments. Sensory evaluation on breads will be conducted for consumer acceptance.

938,"Populations of annual weed seed in the soil typically exceed economic thresholds many-fold; thus making effective weed management essential for crop production. Since the 1950s herbicides have progressively replaced mechanical weed control because herbicides are more cost effective (Gianessi and Reigner, 2007). But, weed management with herbicides requires plant-plant selectivity. Because most crop-selective herbicides control only some weed species, selective weed management typically has consisted of pre-emergence and post emergence treatments that collectively controlled a range of emerging weed species. Treatments were timed to arrest weed growth while the weeds were still small and before they could adversely affect crop growth. Since it is more efficient to transform a cultivar to resist a broad-spectrum herbicide, transgenic, herbicide-resistant crops tend to utilize genes conferring resistance to broad-spectrum herbicides. Thus the use of transgenic herbicide-resistance cultivars tends to reduce the diversity of herbicides used within a crop. Transgenic herbicide-resistant crops were commercially introduced in the U. S. in 1996 when glyphosate-resistant (Roundup Ready) soybeans were released. Use of the very broad-spectrum herbicide, glyphosate (N-phosphono-methyl glycine), provided outstanding weed control (Dill, 2005; Dill et al. 2008). The most recent data indicates that the percent of the total acres of each of the following crops planted with glyphosate-resistant cultivars is soybeans 91%, canola 91%, cotton 71%, and corn 68% (Brookes and Barfoot, 2009). The genus Amaranthus comprises 70 species distributed worldwide; many of them are weeds (Mosyakin and Robertson, 2003). As a group the amaranths are becoming more difficult to control as evidenced by the fact that they have been the most frequently mentioned genus in the principal weed science journals, Weed Research, Weed Science, and Weed Technology in the years 2000-2007, inclusive. The amaranths are C4 plants; they are drought tolerant, grow rapidly, and copiously produce seed (Sellers et al. 2003). The amaranths are also prone to develop resistance to herbicides (Vencill et al. 2008). In 2005, the confirmation of glyphosate resistance in Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) threatened not only to reduce the effectiveness of glyphosate as a tool for weed control, but also jeopardized the use of conservation tillage in the heavily affected areas (Culpepper et al. 2006). Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth continues to spread in the South and has been identified in Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, and elsewhere (Culpepper et al. 2008; Steckel et al. 2008, Norsworthy et al. 2008a, 2008b). A second dioecious amaranth, waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) has developed glyphosate resistance in the Mid-West (Volenberg et al. 2007). Multiple-herbicide resistant Palmer amaranth is becoming more widespread reducing herbicide options for growers and increasing the need for a holistic approach to managing weeds such as Palmer amaranth.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
939,"Cotton, field corn, soybean, and grain sorghum, have traditionally represented major row crops across Northeast Louisiana agricultural ecosystems. During years of extreme pest outbreaks or emergence of a new pest, annual arthropod pest control costs can exceed these amounts by as much as 25-30%. Because of the great potential arthropod pests have for damaging Louisiana's agricultural crops, producers have historically relied heavily on insecticide use strategies to manage these pests. Pesticide use strategies have been most successful when they are combined with other cultural, biological, and plant resistance tools within an IPM system. However, there are numerous obstacles and problems associated with pesticide use strategies in row crops. Widespread use of pesticides can create severe pesticide resistance problems, elevate the pest status of formerly occasional pests, cause pest population resurgences following applications, decrease populations of beneficial insects, increase environmental contamination, resistance and increase toxic effects to non-target organisms. Dramatic changes have occurred across the agricultural landscape during the last 15 years. Specifically, advances in molecular biology have allowed scientists to genetically modify crops that express resistance to arthropod. Since genetically modified crops were introduced in 1996, their use in the United States has grown rapidly, accounting for 80-90 percent of soybean, corn, and cotton acreage in 2009. To date, crops with traits that provide resistance to some herbicides and to specific insect pests have benefited farmers by reducing crop losses to insect damage, increasing flexibility in time management, and by facilitating the use of more environmentally safe pesticides and cultural practices. However, excessive reliance on a single technology combined with a lack of diverse farming practices could undermine the economic and environmental gains from these GM crops. The proposed research project includes multiple achievable goals. Annual pesticide efficacy screening studies provide information to update Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service recommendations of products and document the performance of non-registered products that are in commercial development. This information is used to support changes in crop pest management strategies. One of the most important needs expressed by extension pest management specialists and agricultural consultants is access to recent data detailing the performance of IPM products and strategies. Annual trials are necessary because of the sporadic temporal and spatial occurrence of arthropod pest populations. All IPM and commodity production practices that directly or indirectly affect the need for and use of insecticides must be focused in a holistic manner to further reduce reliance on chemical control measures. Continued research and implementation of sustainable pesticide use strategies are necessary to ensure effective, economical and environmentally acceptable arthropod pest management for Louisiana field crops on a long-term basis.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
940,"Dry edible beans are an important food globally and a significant source of calories, protein, and vitamins. Many developing nations depend on beans for nutrition, particularly where protein from animal sources is scarce. One of the problems affecting bean yield worldwide is susceptibility to diseases. This is true for Nebraska, USA, Africa and Latin America, particular areas of emphasis of my research. Dry beans are also an important cash crop on irrigated land in western Nebraska. Bean rust is now endemic in Nebraska and the high plains. Developing plants with resistance to diseases is a management strategy that is sustainable and does not result in any cost to the grower. However, the rust pathogen is one of the most variable plant pathogens known. Thus, strategies to deploy new resistance genes such as using multiple genes in any one variety needs to be available. A similar situation exists for root rot pathogens such as Rhizoctonia solani, which has high variability and causes root and crown rot as well as web blight on common bean. White mold is a disease caused by a fungus that is not only a problem for bean growers but is also a pathogen on 400 other host species, including vegetables, forage legumes, and oilseed crops such as soybeans. Disease resistance is the most cost effective management strategy for white mold but has been difficult to identify and breed into beans/soybeans. This project will provide guidance for use of pathogen isolates to improve resistance screening by studying characteristics of pathogen isolates from all major bean and soybean production areas, searching for new sources of resistance, and collaborating with plant breeders to incorporate resistance into new germplasm and varieties. The long survival time of the fungal pathogen in soil, its wide host range of broad-leaf weeds and other plants and for high yield management of dry beans and soybeans by growers creates a favorable disease environment that ensures that it will be a soybean production risk for the foreseeable future.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
941,"Adding value to agricultural byproducts and coproducts of biofuel production and finding sustainable alternative sources for existing petroleum-based products will have a substantial and long term impact on agriculture, the economy, the environment and energy independence and security of the United States. The five major food crops (corn, wheat, soy, sorghum and rice) in the United States generate about 300 million tons of lignocellulosic crop residues as byproducts every year. These byproducts currently have limited use. These abundant and low cost ($50-$80 per ton) agricultural byproducts are renewable and sustainable without the need for additional natural resources. It has been demonstrated that lignocellulosic byproducts such as corn stover, rice and wheat straw can be used to obtain high quality fibers suitable for textile, composite and other applications (Reddy, 2005, 2006, 2007; Huda, 2008). Cellulose from these lignocellulosics can also be used to generate regenerated cellulose fibers (rayon) or it can be utilized as reinforcing agent or filler to plastics and resins. Similarly, biofuel production from cereal grains generates abundant carbohydrate and protein containing coproducts that have limited applications. For instance, more than 10 million tons of distillers dried grains (DDG) are generated every year and DDG has a selling price of less than $130 per ton, much lower than the current selling price of common thermoplastic polymers such as polypropylene and polyethylene (> $2,000 per ton). It has been demonstrated that coproducts of biofuel production such as distillers dried grains (DDG) can be used to develop thermoplastics (Hu, 2011a,b). Developing biobased products from agricultural byproducts and coproducts as well as wastes has the potential to increase income from the crops while benefits the farmers and biofuel industries economically and reduces our dependence on petroleum based resources. The new value-added products will increase income from crop production, help to establish small businesses and create new jobs leading to economic benefits. Similarly, biobased products can replace synthetic polymers based products and benefit the environment. Adding value to the coproducts of biofuel production will help to reduce the cost of biofuels and make biofuels competitive to fossil fuels and reduce our dependence on foreign sources for energy. This multi-state proposal provides an opportunity for experts in biobased products to collaborate synergistically and develop unique biobased products. Without such an effort, it may be difficult to commercialize biobased products, improve income from agriculture, reduce cost of biofuels and have a sustainable and economically competitive biobased industry. Similarly, methods to conserve energy and water and develop novel technologies to treat textile waste water will help to reduce cost of textile processing and pollution and help to make the textile industry environmentally friendly. This will give a competitive edge to the US textile industry and, in addition, will potentially save billions of cubic meters of water.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
942,"Plant diseases are major problems in plant production and there are many instances of pathogens moving to new geographic areas or even the emergence of new pathogen variants. Application of antibiotics or fungicides is the most common and effective approach to managing plant diseases. However, resistance of plant pathogens to antibiotics and fungicides has reduced disease control efficacy. Furthermore, physicians are concerned that plant pathogens pass their resistance traits on to other microbes. Therefore, development of novel antibiotics and fungicides for agriculture uses is in demand. Bacteria with antimicrobial activities can be found in suppressive soils, plant rhizosphere, or inside of plants. More than 50 bacterial isolates with broad spectra of antimicrobial activities have been obtained in Mississippi from disease suppressive niches. Some asymptomatic soybean plants can always be found in disease patches where almost all plants died of charcoal rot disease caused by the fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina. However, these plants have the same genetic makeup, grow under the same soil and weather conditions and have the same pathogen pressure.

945,"Michigan is the third most diverse agricultural production system in the U.S. Field crops are the most important commodity group in the state in terms of total crop acreage (at 6.5 million acres, 97% of the total), number of growers, and farm income, contributing over $4 billion in production value. Eight of the top ten commodities in Michigan are field crops, or dependent on field crops (livestock, egg production). Corn is the leading crop in the state in acreage (2.5 million acres) and cash value, followed by soybean (1.9 million acres). Unlike neighboring corn-belt states driven by corn and beans, Michigan grows a diversity of field crops, ranking first in several types of dry beans and fourth in sugarbeets. Other field crops include alfalfa, pasture, and other forages; small grains such as wheat, barley, oats, and rye. With the global demand for grain for direct consumption and livestock feed, as well as for biofuels, crop prices are at a high and field crop acreage is expanding in the state. Invasive species were and continue to be a major problem in the U.S. Michigan is a potential hot-spot for insect introductions, home to Great Lakes shipping ports, airports in Detroit and Chicago with non-stop flights to Asia, and a diverse crop base vulnerable to colonization by many species. Other invaders, foreign and native, are expanding in their range into Michigan. Thus producers are presented with new challenges from both foreign-invasive and native-invasive species that increase in pest status or range. Established and new insect invaders are now responsible for the majority of insect-caused yield and quality loss in Michigan field crops, influencing pest management decisions, driving insecticide use and reducing profitability. Tied in with invasive species is the issue of climate change. For some field crop insect pests, damage is getting worse and the damage period is growing longer during the season. A reality in field crop production is the use of biotechnology, specifically genetically modified crops with herbicide resistance or Bt insecticide toxin. According to the USDA Economic Research Service, 86% of the corn, and 91% of the soybean, acres in Michigan were transgenic in the 2012 planting season. Because universities have little role in the development of this technology, land grant entomologists are viewed as neutral observers and thus have an important role to play in education and making public statements. A by-product of the introduction of Bt crops is overuse. Growers plant hybrids expressing insecticides that they don't need, exposing insect populations to traits year-after-year. This is antithetical to the principles of integrated pest management, because it increases the chance for resistance. This project concentrates on understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive species, climate change and use of technology.

946,"Two primary sources of risk in agriculture are production risk and price risk. Tools available to producers and users of agricultural commodities for managing these types of risk include insurance, hedging, forward and futures contracting, etc. In addition, government support programs are available to help agricultural commodity producers managing production or price risk or both. The project would specifically emphasize the use of futures markets as a mean of managing agricultural risk. The project will also emphasize the modeling of risk related to agricultural production, in particular the risk related to the price of inputs. Increased volatility in agricultural commodity prices as well as increased linkages between agricultural and energy markets expose agricultural producers and the agribusiness industry to different types of market price risk. Increased market volatility in recent years can be attributed to various factors including reduced government stockholding, adverse weather events, and government policies. Many countries, especially in the developing world, have moved away from government stockholding. While this has tended to increase overall average prices, ceteris paribus, it has also led to increased variability in prices. Another important factor affecting agricultural commodity prices is recent developments related to biofuels and the resulting effects on demand for agricultural commodities, especially corn and soybeans. Government policy, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard, has been shown to have created strong linkages between agricultural commodity prices and energy prices. Previous research has also found evidence of volatility spillover from energy markets into agricultural markets. The increased integration of agricultural and energy markets likely also has implications for agricultural input markets as well as markets for agricultural commodities. For example, the agricultural sector appears to be importing price variability from the biofuels sector, as corn prices are increasingly tied to biofuel production given the energy policies implemented by the U.S. government. At a secondary level, corn prices influence other crop prices, such as soybeans, as they compete for acres and in other cases, such as wheat, can also act as a substitute in output markets. While many of the market relationships that create transmission of price risk across agricultural commodities are long standing, other relationships are now emerging; as are relationships between agricultural commodity markets and other international markets. Cross-commodity and cross-market correlations have likely changed affecting the efficacy of traditional price risk management strategies. Given the increased linkage of agricultural markets to other markets, it is important to investigate whether new approaches to price risk management need to be implemented by the producers of agricultural commodities. For example, it is important to investigate whether a more appropriate price risk management strategy is to simultaneously manage the price risk of the output and energy-based inputs.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
947,"Soybeans are the most important row crop to Mississippi agriculture especially in the delta region where more than 80% of the state's soybeans are produced (NASS 2012a). Mississippi planted soybean acreage, during the decade of 2001 to 2011, averaged 1.68 million acres with an average annual value of $483 million (NASS 2012b). Weeds are the most limiting factor in soybean production next to drought stress. Losses due to weeds in Mississippi soybean fields have been estimated at more than $68 million annually (Webster 1998). Herbicides are and will continue to be the primary means of weed control, especially with the continued implementation of Roundup Ready (RR) crop technology, increased adoption of conservation tillage practices and coupled with increasing fuel and labor costs. Development of new soybean herbicides has slowed dramatically since the introduction of Roundup Ready soybeans, but limited new products are under development and need to be evaluated for delta producers. Additionally, new and emerging weed control issues must be addressed as the need arises. Research conducted at the Delta Research and Extension Center in Stoneville, MS has been instrumental in defining use rates, application methods and timing, and weeds controlled for new herbicides (Barrentine 1995). Evaluating new chemistry, new uses for old chemistry, and herbicide mixtures has been an integral component of CRIS projects throughout the experiment station system over the course of the past several decades (Barrentine 1995, Defilice 1991, Shaw 1991, Snipes et al. 2000, Vidrine 1990). The immense popularity of the RR system among delta soybean producers and private industry is evident with the majority of the state's row crops being planted to the RR system. Greater than 75% of all entries in the 2012 Mississippi State University Variety Trials were RR varieties. Producers like the broad-spectrum weed control offered by the RR system and the ease of use. Unfortunately, wide-scale adoption of RR production systems for soybean, cotton, and corn has resulted in nearly complete reliance on glyphosate for weed control, especially in soybeans and cotton. Multiple applications of glyphosate throughout the growing season have put unusually high selection pressure on delta weeds. Consequently, several weeds have developed increased tolerance or resistance to glyphosate. Additionally, shifts towards annual grasses, pigweeds, prickly sida, and other weeds have occurred in the absence of residual herbicides. Weed management systems must be developed to delay the onset of glyphosate resistant weed biotypes and control the weeds that have already developed resistance to glyphosate.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

A better understanding of the intrinsic structural, chemical and biological changes in the corn kernel and soybean seed during storage and processing will lead to a general understanding of predicting the nutritional value of corn and soybeans and new food processing techniques to increase bioavailability and stability of micronutrients in fortified foods. To date, dry matter losses and compositional changes have been characterized for corn storage at temperate climates but there is a lack of engineering data and analyses to provide guidelines for storage of corn and soybeans, especially in low latitude (plus or minus 20 degree) regions, where elevated temperatures are experienced year-round. The underpinning science resulting from this research and training program also allows for better design of grain storage, handling, and processing systems to minimize postharvest losses and food shortages that could threaten global stability in many developing countries, where overall losses of cereal grains of about 10-15% are fairly common.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
949,"Soybean is a key crop in the U.S., which supplies 35% of the world's production. Soybeans are produced in 31 states and 3 provinces in the eastern, central, and southern U.S and Canada, from Quebec to Florida, and Delaware to Nebraska. Given this large acreage and wide distribution, it is not surprising that soybean continues to suffer from insect pests that impact plant growth, grain quality, and yield. As in many other production systems, invasive species are an issue of increasing importance in soybean production. The introduction of a single species can significantly and negatively impact the profitability of soybean production, and increase risks to human health and the environment. In the northern U.S. and eastern Canada, the discovery of the soybean aphid (SBA) in 2000 fundamentally changed soybean insect management. SBA feeding impacts all components of yield; under heavy aphid pressure, yield differences between treated and untreated research plots may reach 50%. On a landscape level, SBA outbreaks often correspond to potyvirus outbreaks in dry beans, snap beans, vine crops, and potato, broadening the impact of this invasive insect. From an economic standpoint, SBA infestation increases the cost of soybean production. In 1999, the year prior to discovery of SBA, the National Agricultural Statistics Service estimated that less than 1% of the soybean acres in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio were treated with insecticide (NASS 2000). In 2005, an outbreak year, estimated insecticide use in these same states ranged from 9% (IL) to 42% (MI) (NASS 2006); in 2006, when outbreaks were more sporadic, 56% of the acreage in Minnesota was treated (NASS 2007). At least 20 different foliar and seed-applied insecticides are now used for aphid control on millions of acres, adding $10-$20 per acre to production costs (Song et al. 2006). To move beyond chemical use, particularly to control SBA and other chronic pests, alternatives are critically needed. These alternatives include both biological control and host plant resistance, preventative tactics which form the foundation of IPM, and which must be integrated with therapeutic tactics such as insecticide use. Significant progress in developing resistant varieties has been made since SBA was first discovered as a pest in North America in 2000. However, the rapid progress and success in developing resistant varieties and germplasm is complicated by the identification of SBA biotypes capable of overcoming plant resistance (Kim et al. 2008; Hill et al. 2010). Three separate biotypes have been reported in peer-reviewed publications and there are unofficial reports of even more, indicating that a significant amount of aphid biotype variation already exists in natural populations. This shows the need for continued discovery of more sources of resistance, specifically tolerance and the incorporation of these resistance genes into new varieties. In addition to discovery and breeding of aphid resistance genes, we require more information on the mechanisms and physiological function of SBA resistance (specifically tolerance).",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Although data on the total sale value of their goat meat via the Internet is not available, the increase in the available vendors online and the steady growth of e-commerce both suggest that the current Internet goat market can be significant to small farmers and producers. This new system of selling is blooming, yet food safety information related to products in this emerging goat meat market is not available. Fresh edamame has been produced and marketed on a small scale in Virginia. Recent reports show that edamame appears to be a viable alternative crop for Virginia with yields similar to snap beans for the mid-Atlantic United States.

953,"The development of glyphosate-resistant weed populations in corn (Zea mays), soybean (Glycine max), and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) production has become a primary concern of applied weed scientists in the United States. The intensity of glyphosate use in these crops increased greatly over the past 15 years due to the rapid adoption of glyphosate-resistant varieties and hybrids. Many growers used glyphosate continuously and to the exclusion of other herbicide sites of action, which resulted in unprecedented selection pressure and risk of herbicide resistance. Resistance to glyphosate, which was first used commercially in the 1970's, was unknown in the United States until 1998. Since then, glyphosate resistance has been confirmed in seven summer annual weed species common to corn and soybean production, and is widespread across the Midwestern and southern United States. Ohio was not exempt from the development of weed populations resistant to glyphosate, and also many populations with multiple resistance, to glyphosate and ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Multiple-resistant populations of giant ragweed, common ragweed, horseweed, Palmer amaranth, and waterhemp occur in Ohio.

954,"This project will focus on increasing sustainability of soybean aphid management and proactively responding to the invasion of the brown marmorated stink bug. Some of the broad-spectrum insecticides are likely to continue to be important tools for suppression of soybean aphid outbreaks. However, resistance management is needed to protect these tools (i.e., ensure utility of insecticides into the future). A critical component of resistance management is quantification of pest susceptibility to currently used insecticides and monitoring for pest resistance to insecticides. This objective will provide baseline lethal concentrations (LC) (i.e., concentration of an insecticide required to kill a certain percentage of the population) of commonly used foliar insecticides, and monitor aphid populations from around Minnesota for the occurrence of resistance. A critical component of many integrated pest management programs is host plant resistance. Aphid-resistant soybean varieties are now commercially available; however, they are not widely used in Minnesota. Further work is needed to develop aphid-resistant soybean varieties better adapted to Minnesota. The soybean breeding program at the University of Minnesota has developed 50+ soybean lines with aphid resistance, including tolerance. The mechanisms of resistance and tolerance will be identified and quantified through greenhouse and field studies, to facilitate advancement of these lines toward commercial release. The brown marmorated stink bug is a new invasive pest, first detected in Minnesota in 2010. Little is known about the ecology and potential impacts of stink bugs in general Minnesota soybean, let alone the potential impacts of this new invasive species. Valid economic thresholds for soybean and other crops do not exist for stink bugs in Minnesota. A caged field study will be used to determine the yield response of Minnesota soybean varieties to feeding by various densities of stink bugs, which will facilitate development of economic thresholds to indicate when insecticidal treatments will be economically justified. Research will also be conducted to examine biotic factors that could potentially limit population growth and mitigate impacts of the brown marmorated stink bug. Understanding the role of natural enemies of stink bugs will be critical for the development of integrated pest management programs and potential future implementation of classical biological control for the brown marmorated stink bug. Stink bug natural enemies in Minnesota are poorly documented. Laboratory and field studies will be conducted to evaluate the potential impact of existing natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) on stink bug populations.

The long term goal is to identify specific genes or alleles associated with this resistance, develop markers to identify the correct allele or form of the resistance and make these available to breeders (University, Industry).

956,"Brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB) has the potential to cause severe damage to soybean if not properly managed. Indications are that it is spreading in its range and could pose a threat to most of the acreage in this state. In 2012 field scouts found BMSB in soybean fields in 44 Virginia counties, twice as many as in 2011. The first part of BMSB management is early detection; our proposed statewide monitoring program will provide this to soybean producers. Accurate sampling methods are also critical. Current thresholds are based on sweep net sampling. However, scouts have reported that BMSB tend to readily drop from the plant when they are approached or disturbed so sweep net counts may not provide the most accurate population estimates. Participation in a multi-state BMSB sampling technique project would allow us to evaluate better methods for growers. A third part to effective management is knowledge of insecticide efficacy. Field trials allow us to make product/rate recommendations to growers based on percent control. Also, because BMSB tend to be clumped along the field margins, edge-only treatments have been very economical and effective in controlling BMSB in Virginia soybean. We need to learn more about the efficacy of currently registered and developmental insecticides, and the usefulness of edge-only treatments. Kudzu bug is a recent invasive insect in the US soybean crop and is causing severe problems in southern states including Georgia, South Carolina and more recently, areas of North Carolina. Last year, we discovered kudzu bugs for the first time in Virginia soybean in 19 counties. Most were adults thought to have migrated from southern locations, but nymphs (indicating local reproduction) were found in three counties. The importance of good detection programs and extension of updated management recommendations cannot be overstated. Annually since 2003, we have subjected approximately 2,500-3,000 corn earworm (CEW) moths to pyrethroid adult vial tests. Since 2008, test results have suggested an increased risk to development of pyrethroid resistance. The mean survival of 37 percent for the 2012 season was the highest ever recorded for Virginia. Field tests are also confirming that standard rates of pyrethroids are not as effective in controlling CEW larvae as higher rates of pyrethroids, tank mixes with other chemistries, and non-pyrethroids. This program assists growers in making insecticide product choices and developing resistance management strategies for CEW. Threecornered alfalfa hopper adults and nymphs feed on plant sap by puncturing stems, branches, and petioles. Girdling occurs when feeding punctures or ovipositional sites swell into a callus around the plant tissue. Girdling restricts the flow of nutrients to the plant, and can cause plant lodging, breakage, and yield loss. Many producers had questions concerning this pest in 2012, especially after a series of strong summer storms. While foliar insecticide broadcasts may be effective against threecornered alfalfa hopper, seed treatments may be a good preventative management option.

959,"Giant Canada geese historically nested in South Dakota, but by the early 1900's, there was a rapid decline in this subspecies due to excessive hunting, habitat destruction, egg gathering, and other disturbances. In 1962, South Dakota initiated a restoration program. By 1967, a massive restoration program was in place in South Dakota through a cooperative venture between state, federal, and county agencies. These reintroductions were extremely successful in South Dakota and other states. The current management plan goal in South Dakota is 90,000 giant Canada geese. South Dakota's May breeding population estimates for Canada geese continued to increase into 2012 with a population estimate of over 250,000. Today, giant Canada geese are an important component of the waterfowl resource in South Dakota, providing significant recreational value to residents and nonresidents. Crop damage In South Dakota the primary conflict with Canada geese has been crop damage, usually on soybeans. Damage is most often caused by flightless molting adults and goslings that walk up onto adjacent uplands to feed. The molting adults may be from the local breeding population or molt migrants from other areas. South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks continues to receive complaints concerning Canada geese, despite efforts to alleviate damages through the Canada goose damage program. A primary goal for SDGFP is to decrease the number of damage complaints, while increasing landowner tolerance of geese. The SDGFP Canada goose damage program allows landowners that file a complaint free access to abatement techniques. Little research has been conducted on flightless Canada geese that cause crop damage during the brooding and molting period. Currently, we are evaluating the effectiveness of several commercial chemical goose deterrents on soybeans in northeast South Dakota. Hunting harvest Canada goose damage problems prompted SDGFP to control resident Canada geese through September Canada goose hunting seasons that occur outside the regular season framework. The first September goose hunting season was instituted in 1996, and the season has since continued annually. In 2010, SDGFP instituted an August management take of Canada geese with a limit of 8 geese daily. Analysis of band and recovery data is an essential part of waterfowl management and its use in understanding population dynamics in migratory birds has been well documented. Numerous researchers have used band-recovery data to estimate survival and recovery rates, chronology of migration and harvest, and the derivation and distribution of harvest. Knowledge of recovery and annual survival rate estimates of geese can be used in the establishment of harvest regulations.

The warm temperatures and high number of growing days combined with plenty of precipitation make many areas in Louisiana productive and suitable to grow a wide variety of crops for food, feeds, fiber, and biofuel feedstock production. Soil testing remains an important best management practice for nutrients that producers employ to attain optimum agronomic, economic, and environmental returns in crop production. The value of soil testing as a tool to understand and manage fertilizer nutrients relies on frequent verification of fertilization guidelines through field calibration studies. Field calibration trials have been continuously put up every year since 2004 for P, K, S and Zn using crops such as soybean, corn and sugarcane. Following this major field research activity, the critical P level and soil test P interpretation for Louisiana based on Mehlich-3 procedure were established. Conversely, N fertilizer recommendations in the region are based on multi-year and multi-site response trials then further refined based on variety, crop age and soil type. With this approach, the influence of spatial and temporal variability on yield level and available soil N cannot be accounted; this results in areas in the field where N is either over- or under-applied eventually leading to reduction in N fertilizer use efficiency. The increased public concern for environmental quality, and economic constraints brought about by expensive and limited nutrient inputs emphasize the need for robust and up-to-date soil fertility and nutrient management practices.

963,"Agriculture is South Dakota's 2nd leading industry (44 million acres farmland) and contributes about $8 billion a year to the state's economy. This contribution comes especially from corn, livestock production, soybean, wheat and hogs. However, there are some present challenges that impact productivity and the environment. These challenges are either due to natural calamities or improper land management and cropping systems, and include (i) soil salinity and compaction, (ii) drought problems, (iii) water quality impairment due to livestock and intensive tillage, and (iv) increased agricultural emissions due to heavy use of inorganic fertilizers, pesticides, and manure. Nutrients from mineral fertilizer are the major source of C, N, P, K and S for the crop growth. However, when available nutrient exceeds plant requirements, these can washed away with water and mix with the streams or emit as gases into the atmosphere and negatively impact the environment. Thus, innovative and holistic management practices are needed for minimizing the off-site movement of applied nutrients. The long-term goals of this project are to improve soil, air and water qualities of watersheds in South Dakota by using new practices and methodologies that can be useful at field, state, regional and national scales. Research shows that long-term benefits of conservation practices are improved soil organic carbon, reduced bulk density, better soil structural stability, improved soil hydrological properties, reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improved water quality. These practices include: (i) conservation tillage such as no-tillage and reduced tillage to improve soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, (ii) multi-purpose cover crops to facilitate biological N2 fixation, (iii) organic farming to help diversify soil biology and enhance soil health, and (iv) controlled grazing to modify soil N cycling. These alternative practices, when used appropriately, help minimize nutrient losses from agroecosystems, and benefit the environment. Models are helpful in assessing the benefits of long-term conservation practices on soils and environmental quality at different environmental conditions. Quantifying fluxes from different soils is expected to be difficult due to the heterogeneity of terrestrial ecosystems and the variability of the factors that control the fluxes. This project will provide potential outcomes as (i) better understanding of the influences of different conservation practices on soil properties; (ii) improved understanding of the biogeochemical processes affecting soil C and N losses through different pathways, (iii) mitigation strategies for reducing GHG emissions using process-based models, and (iv) watershed modeling for improving the water quality.

964,"Glyphosate tolerant soybean (GTS) technology is a valuable asset for soybean farmers because it reduces the use of other herbicides, acts as a critical weed control tool for reduced tillage systems, and is generally regarded as having low environmental impacts. However, after using this technology for 10 or more years, field observations by farmers and emerging research suggest that long-term glyphosate usage is having cumulative and non-target effects on soils and crop productivity. In recent years, farmers have observed a growing incidence of corn and soybean yield reduction in glyphosate resistant GT soybean based cropping systems in the US. Research on glyphosate suggests that the use of glyphosate causes a change in soil biology which might be affecting plant growth and health. There is still no clear consensus on exactly how glyphosate affects the soil microbial community. There are numerous papers available reporting no or slight effects of glyphosate on soil microorganisms, however, those studies were mostly done short-term. However, now that farmers have been using GT soybean for up to 10 years there is anecdotal evidences that glyphosate is affecting crops (even non-GMO corn). Currently, there is disagreement and largely speculation as to why GT crops are having lower yields. With the cummulative use over the last 10 years of glyphosate tolerant soybeans and corn, these non-target effects will likely be amplified. This project will investigate the effect of glyphosate on microbial communities and the plant pathogen, Fusarium on soils that have never received glyphosate. The objectives are: 1) a greenhouse study designed to simulate 8 years of repeated glyphosate application will evaluate the long-term changes in microbial community structure on soils that previously had never recieved glyphosate; and 2) a decomposition experiment will investigate the effect of incorporating GTS residue on soil microbial communities.

965,"Monitoring seasonal and year-to-year patterns of pest abundance provide valuable records of pest occurrence. Regular insect collections from soybean and adjacent crop fields (primarily cornfields) not only provide material to monitor established pest abundance and ecology, but can also be used to detect the local arrival of invasive species (e.g. BMSB) and to document significant changes in secondary pest abundance. Expanding pest monitoring to sample insects flying at high elevation (i.e. 10 m above fields) provides added context to the interpretation of canopy level insect abundance data. Insect flight high above the plant canopy may indicate when pest species are leaving the canopy to engage in short and/or long distance movement or migration. Empirical data on local or migratory flight by pests are lacking for most species. Systematic sampling for flying insects provides data useful to understanding when (or whether) a species engages in migration and how weather conditions, crop phenology and changes in farming practices influence these movements (e.g. increasing use of insecticide-fungicide mixes for midseason pest control in row crops and to secure dubious plant health benefits). Documenting how canopy abundance and potential dispersal/migration events are related in time will yield data that are lacking for all but a few key species. This work builds on an existing record of pest abundance (primarily beetle abundance) in soybean and cornfields going back to 1998.

In the Mid-South, up to 70% of acreage is treated for stink bugs, corn earworm, and other lepidopteran defoliators each year, with the estimated value of yield loss plus management costs of $51.76 per acre. In the Midwest, untreated economic soybean aphid infestations can further reduce production value by 3%, causing an estimated annual loss of $2.4 billion. In the short-term, loss of current highly effective management tactics due to expanding pest complexes is increasing producer costs. In the long-term, the establishment of invasive insect pests will continue to impact soybean ecosystems, including interactions with native pests and the biological control offered by various natural enemies. Invasive pest problems, such as soybean aphid (a major focus of the group over the last decade), have been and will continue to be effectively addressed by this regional project. The expansion of invasive pests of soybeans into soybean producing regions of the US (including Iowa) and the adaptation of native pests necessitates further research into insect ecology and biology. These pests include, but are not limited to the following: soybean aphid, Japanese beetle, brown marmorated stink bug, and the kudzu bug. As of December 2012, only the kudzu bug has not been found in Iowa. Along with a changing pest complex, soybean producers are faced with managing pests with new tools and technologies. Increases in commodity prices and the high-value and demand for food grade and specialty soybeans (i.e., low-linolenic acid) have shifted grower's attitudes from IPM to an  insurance-based  strategy. This shift of management tactics often results in the use of prophylactic treatments to prevent pest damage, usually without any quantification of pest numbers, or even the species present. Unnecessary insecticide use has the potential for negative effects on several levels, not the least of which is enhancing the potential for resistance. Issues related to pest management can be illustrated by the management of the soybean aphids. Varieties with soybean aphid resistance are commercially available, despite the observation of aphid populations that can overcome this plant resistance (i.e., virulent biotypes). Research is needed on characterizing virulent biotype adaptation, uncovering novel resistant genes, and developing strategies that sustain the durability of host-plant resistance, including the use of multiple toxins (or stacking of traits) within single varieties. To address these concerns, coordinated research and Extension delivery are necessary to rapidly understand native and invasive pest biology, develop best management practices, and deliver recommendations to soybean producers.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

968,"Insect pests can be a significant source of yield loss to soybeans. Managing these pest within an integrated pest management program can prevent yield loss, but requires research to determine the best combination of multiple tactics. Furthermore, not every insect in a soybean field is a pest, some are beneficial. Examples include natural enemies of insect pests, like the soybean aphid, and pollinators. Pollinators may improve soybean yields; many pollinators use soybeans as a source of nectar. Developing strategies and recommendations that prevent yield loss while also limiting the impact to these beneficial insects can have benefits to soybean production and other components of the agricultural landscape. Soybeans are not native to North America, and recently have experienced an increase in exotic species that come from its native range of Asia (soybean aphid [Aphis glycines], brown marmorated stink bug, kudzu bug, and Japanese beetle for Iowa). The need to manage these insect pests will increase into the near future. The research outlined herein is mostly focused on how to manage A. glycines beyond just using insecticides. By exploring how aphid-resistant soybeans can manage A. glycines, there is the potential to switch these practices, thus limiting the use of insecticides which can have a negative impact on the surrounding environment. Beneficial insects require resources outside of the crop fields in which they deliver services, like pollination and pest control. To what extant surrounding habitat that is comprised of plants that beneficial insects find attractive can increase their abundance in soybean fields is not known. Working with plants from prairies that are known to be attractive to beneficial insects, the potential to conserve them in soybean fields will be determined. Nested within this experiment are methodological questions that need to be addressed. Very little field work has been done to describe the pollinator community in soybean fields. The sampling methods and protocols will be developed to determine how factors influence pollinators. Soybean has been breed to be self-pollinated. It is very challenging to measure the impact of pollinators on soybean seed production. By working with soybeans that are not self-fertilized (i.e. male sterile lines) and require cross-pollination, the impact of pollinators can be estimated.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
969,"Weeds are one of three major pests that crop producers must manage in their fields, and more money is spent annually on chemicals for control of weeds (herbicides) than all other pesticides combined. Continued use of herbicides year after year will eventually result in weed populations that develop resistance, forcing crop producers to adopt other weed management practices. In recent years, herbicide manufacturers have produced fewer and fewer new chemicals. Alternatively, herbicide manufacturers have developed techniques to genetically modify corn and soybean to exhibit resistance to very effective and economic herbicides (e.g. glyphosate). Glyphosate resistance in corn and soybean has become so successful that over 90% of the soybean area and 60% of the corn area now produce glyphosate-resistant crops. Unfortunately, widespread use of this technology has resulted in the evolution of glyphosate-resistant common ragweed. The research in this proposal seeks to find alternative practices to manage glyphosate resistance, and also determine if resistance can spread to other areas through the pollen of resistant common ragweed. This can serve as a model for managing other resistant weeds that are appearing.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

972,"Composite polymer materials are an attractive option to improve bio-functionality of biomedical materials by modifying mechanical and chemical properties of a bulk polymer. Bioactivity, moduli, strength, transition temperature and degradation can all be improved by the inclusion of differing ceramic, metal or bio-polymer phases within a polymer system. Nanocomposite biomaterials have been demonstrated to possess unique size dependent mechanical and chemical properties providing further flexibility to modify polymer behavior. Among the fillers, cellulose nano crystals (CNCs) from cotton, wood and chitin are one of the strongest and stiffest organic materials, with a modulus of 145 GPa and a strength estimated at 7500 MPa. CNCs have high surface areas (~250 m2/g), are hydrophilic, and are quite amenable to surface derivatization. The use of biocompatible CNCs to reinforce biodegradable polymers such as poly-L-lactide (PLLA), soy protein, and their co-blends can lead to some unique properties. The major goal of the project is to develop fundamental technology for manufacturing cellulose nanofiber reinforced biopolymer nanocomposites. This work involves combined salient design of natural cellulose nanocrystals as reinforcing elements and biopolymer (e.g., PLLA, soy protein) as the matrix material in forming the nanocomposites through aligned nano-fiber co-electro-spinning. This technology overcomes current limitations of synthetic biomedical materials in material properties, biocompatibility, and costs. The material provides excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility, porous structure, and proper mechanical properties - a promising tissue engineering material. The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include improved energy efficiency, significant rural economic development, great environmental benefits, and enhanced educational activities in bio-based nanomaterials.

973,"Photosynthesis provides the basis for plant growth; supports production of food, animal feed, fiber, bio-energy products and sustains the natural environment. Environmental factors such as drought, chilling and excessive heat can damage or impair photosynthetic processes. Our research goal is to increase knowledge of the response of photosynthesis to environmental factors (excessive heat, cold, and drought as well as use of nitrogen and water) that limit plant productivity. Our studies will be conducted under field and controlled environment conditions, with emphasis on whole-plant responses. We will use standard techniques such as canopy temperature measurements, gas exchange instrumentation, leaf fluorescence, pollen viability, seed-set percentage, and harvest index to quantify effects of heat stress, and develop remote sensing methods for assessing stress responses in the field. We will apply these techniques to evaluate genotypes of sorghum, wheat and soybean to identify tolerance to drought or heat stress. For example, to assess drought stress, canopy conductance will be inferred from digital images which provide information about leaf photosynthetic activity. As a consequence, new methods of evaluating plant performance, under stress conditions (including remote sensing) will become available and will lead to a refinement of our understanding of the impacts of these stresses on plant growth. Genes or metabolic pathways associated with water- and nitrogen-use efficiency and tolerance to temperature extremes and drought will be identified in wheat, soybean and sorghum. New stress tolerant crop hybrids and varieties, including those with greater nitrogen- and water-use efficiency, will be developed by manipulating the genes or pathways associated with environmental limitations to photosynthesis.

974,"Agricultural production systems are constantly evolving in response to population growth and consumer demands. Our global society, economy, and political focus, as well as climate change has produced a shift in energy production priorities towards alternative, renewable energy sources. This shift is not only philosophical, but also results in physical land use changes. Agricultural producers now have new markets for conventional crops (e.g., corn, soybeans) as production of ethanol and biodiesel fuels increase. Additionally, new perennial crops (e.g., Switchgrass) are a viable option as feedstocks (i.e., raw material) for biofuel production. The Midwestern US has a distinct advantage over southern states regarding the implementation of this technology because of historical uses of these taxa for cattle forage and erosion control. In addition, because native grass species have evolved in a regional climate, they require less anthropogenic maintenance when compared to, for example, the current corn-to-ethanol production model used in the U.S. Subsequently, use of perennial grasses may not disrupt ecosystem services as does traditional domestic species monoculture farming. Thus, region-specific information is needed to eliminate knowledge gaps specific to these plant species. We propose to evaluate perennial grasses as feedstocks for production and ecosystem services, thus addressing two MAFES priority research areas: sustainable bioenergy and environmental services, stewardship, and conservation. Specifically, our objectives are (1) evaluate forage and biofuel quantity/quality of herbaceous feedstocks and (2) evaluate biodiversity in native grass forage and biofuels production landscapes in relation to grass type, composition and configuration and effects in surrounding landscapes.

976,"The demand for fuel and food continues to rise as the global population increases. The World&#39;s crude oil reserves are declining forcing the use of alternative fuel sources. Protein sources may also become increasingly scarce as the World&#39;s population continues to rise but the amount of arable land and production from the seas remains stable or decreases. Microalgae biomass can be effectively utilized to produce renewable energy and protein/lipid for inclusion into terrestrial and aquatic feeds without competing with food crops for land and water. Department of Energy (DOE) statistics suggest that the US would require about 140 billion gallons of biodiesel to satisfy its annual transportation needs. Terrestrial food crops, such as corn, soy and canola do not offer a realistic option for providing a significant portion of US biofuel needs and would make productive cropland unavailable for food production. Microalgae have growth rates which are much higher than current biofuel feedstocks significantly reducing the land area required and can be produced using waste water and/or sea water on lands not suitable for agricultural purposes. The utilization of these resources does not compete with food crops or potable water supplies as many of the current biofuel feedstocks (i.e. corn) currently do. Produced microalgal biomass can be used intact or after lipid extraction as the feedstock for many different renewable fuels (biodiesel, methane, hydrogen, etc.) or used in livestock/aquaculture feeds, as organic fertilizer, or simply burned for energy co-generation. Of major concern to the development of microalgae as a feedstock for biofuels and bio-products is biomass production costs. One potential way to reduce production costs and increase biomass is through the use of mixed microalgae cultures. This approach has the added potential to simultaneously produce mixed cultures with more optimum nutritional profiles for aquatic/terrestrial animal feed grade ingredients than their individual monoculture counter parts in a single production raceway, which increases the value of microalgae biomass for the producer. Nutrient sources and utilization must also be addressed if the microalgal industry is to grow. Unlike ammonia, phosphate is a non-renewable resource, and a peak in worldwide production is expected as early as 2030. Thus without significant technological progress to recycle these major nutrients, significant expansion of algal biofuels production can be expected to start a food versus fuel crisis. Nutrients also comprise a significant percentage of the cost needed to produce biomass for bioenergy or bio-products. Nutrient usage may be reduced through the optimization of the nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratio to achieve maximum lipid and biomass production. The overarching goal of this CRIS/AgriLife project is to conduct research to make the production of microalgae biomass for biofuel and bio-products more competitive among the current alternatives (fossil fuels and marine/terrestrial protein sources). Primary areas of research to be targeted by this project are nutrient optimization and mixed microalgae cultures which have the potential to reduce the overall production costs.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
977,"More than 90% of typical swine diets used in the US are corn and soybean meal based. Corn is the major energy source in the feed and therefore efficiency of swine production can be greatly affected by quality of corn. Quality of corn can be affected by fungal infection during the growth and during the storage period. Some fungal species can produce toxic compounds called mycotoxins. Depending on the climate of corn production, different types of mycotoxin become prevalent problems. Examples are aflatoxin, deoxynivalenol, fumonisin, zearalenon, etc. In recent years (2009-this year), high levels of deoxynivalenol, fumonisin, and aflatoxin in corn became a big problem to swine industry.The goals of this projects are to determine if the growth and health of nursery and growing-finishing pigs are affected (then how much affected) when they consume low level mycotoxins such as AF (below the FDA allowance level), deoxynivalenol (below the FDA guidance level) and fumonisin (below the FDA guidance level), and also to determine if the use of feed additives (commonly called as mycotoxin binders) can reduced any negative effects of low level mycotoxins in swine feed. A series of animal studies are proposed to achieve these goals. The completion of this project will provide practical and essential information to pork producers and feed industry related to how to expect when pigs are fed diets with even at low level mycotoxins and how to ameliorate these effects.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
978,"Common waterhemp, a member of the pigweed (or Amaranth) family, is an annual, C4 weed species with rapid growth habit and extended seedling emergence. Common waterhemp has been rated the most economically important weed in the north central USA including Nebraska. Glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp has been confirmed in 12 states over the last eight years. Suspected-resistant population of common waterhemp in Nebraska needs to be evaluated to investigate level of resistance at least for glyphosate and ALS inhibitors. Common waterhemp is a dioecious (means male and female plants are separate), obligate outcrossing species that has high genetic variability. A single female plant of waterhemp may produce up to a million seeds. Gene flow through pollen movement from glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp can provide a source of herbicide resistant alleles to susceptible populations and also to closely related species such as Palmer amaranth. Information is not available on pollen mediated gene flow from glyphosate-resistantcommon waterhempand its role in disseminating herbicide resistant traits from resistant to susceptible populations. There is no confirmed report of glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp in Nebraska yet. However, reduced susceptibility of several common waterhemp biotypes to glyphosate has been complained recently by several growers in eastern Nebraska. While phenoxy (2,4-D) and HPPD inhibiting herbicide resistant biotypes of common waterhemp have been confirmed in Nebraska, more research is required to characterize glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp in Nebraska. Information is required to know how far glyphosate-resistant trait in common waterhemp can be disseminated and in what frequency the transfer of alleles is possible under field condition? Moreover, what will be the role of wind and wind direction in pollen movement? Research is required to know the distance and rate of gene flow and will facilitate understanding of reproductive biology of common waterhemp that is threatening corn and soybean production in Nebraska. Common waterhemp seeds will be collected from selected fields in 10 counties of Nebraska with a known history of repeated glyphosate application and control failure. A dose response study will be conducted to confirm glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp in Nebraska. To determine pollen-mediated gene flow, field experiments will be conducted using a source/receptor experimental design that has been used previously. The greenhouse grown glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp will be transplanted into an area of 20 m x 20 m in the center of a field.The male waterhemp plants capable of producing pollen will be identified and female plants will be removed from pollination block. Glyphosate susceptible common waterhemp plants will be transplanted into a strip plot of3.8 m wide starting from 0.1 m distance from the pollen source to 0.5, 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 45, and 50 m from the glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp (source population) in the eight directions (four cardinal directions i.e. N, S, E, and W and four ordinal directions i.e. NE, SE, SW, and NW). Seeds from the female plants (receptor population) will be harvested and the glyphosate resistant trait will be used as a selective marker to evaluate the movement of pollen between the source and receptor population using shikimate and molecular methods. Common waterhemp emergence is throughout the growing season (starting from end of April until August). Peak emergence occurs in early June and a higher percentage of plants emerge later in the season than most other summer annual weeds. Furthermore, several biotypes of common waterhemp have evolved resistance to several groups of herbicides. Therefore, management of common waterhemp throughout the growing season is a greatest challenge for corn and soybean producers in the north central USA including Nebraska. Later-emerging waterhemp usually does not affect crop yields if infestation is not significant; however, seeds from uncontrolled plants can contribute significantly to the soil seedbank. So it is expected that the herbicides with high relative soil persistence followed by post-emergence herbicides will control common waterhemp at certain extent, but common waterhemp plants that emerges after post-emergence application have no any control option. Several residual herbicides have been registered in soybean that can be applied in a tank mix with post-emergence herbicides later in the season and generally they have a good crop safety. A split application of residual herbicides such as acetochlor, alachlor, metolachlor, and pyroxasulfone may provide late season control of common waterhemp. Field experiments will be conducted to scree several herbicides for control of glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp. At the end of this project, at least four peer reviewed papers will be published in Weed Technology and /or Weed Science and three extension bulletins will be published as NebGuide/ EC articles. Several Crop Watch articles will be written based on information collected from this project such as control of glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp and role of gene flow in disseminating resistant traits. The results will be disseminated to corn and soybean producers through presentations in Crop Production Clinics, Weed Management Field Days at the South Central Agricultural Lab,and Weed Resistance Management Field Days in Nebraska to disseminate information to growers, crop consultants, extension educatorsand stakeholders.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
979,"Background:  There is a need within the military community for drug treatment for second-degree burn injury that can be applied quickly to both relieve pain and promote healing.  Currently used drugs for chronic pain have substantial side effects that limit their usefulness.  These include opioids and their addictive potential, gabapentin and its sedation, and coxibs with their risk of cardiovascular failure.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are potent analgesics and provide relief from burn pain, but their use is limited due to side effects related to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in susceptible patients.Objective/Hypothesis:  The goal of this project is to develop a treatment for second-degree burn injury to alleviate pain and promote healing using a new class of NSAIDs that can be administered as a sterile topical alone or in combination with the drug also administered parenterally.  We propose that our treatment, which pertains to the use of NSAIDs (Indomethacin and Ibuprofen) that are complexed with the soy surfactant phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), will attenuate spontaneous/evoked pain in response to second-degree burn injury and promote wound healing without causing GI bleeding or clotting disorders.Specific Aims:  (1) Compare the efficacy of topical Indomethacin-PC and Ibuprofen-PC (vs. the respective unmodified NSAID and vehicle) in rodent models of second-degree burn injury, and determine any additional benefit of combined topical and parenteral administrations.  (2) Evaluate the GI side effects of PC-NSAID treatment in the burn model and the effect of our test drugs on clotting time.  (3) Determine the mechanism of action of PC-NSAIDs in the treatment of burn pain/healing.Study Design:  This proposal will utilize two rodent models of burn injury in which animals are subjected to a controlled second-degree burn injury under general anesthetic, and the pain response and the rate of healing can be followed using an array of tests including: behavior tests for spontaneous/evoked pain, surface analysis, analysis of wound healing macroscopically, microscopically, biochemically (COX/MPO activity), and neutrophilic imaging.  In addition, we will assess the effects of our treatment on GI injury/bleeding and clotting time.  The two PC-associated NSAIDs, which will be administered either as a sterile topical or parenteral, are Ibuprofen-PC and Indomethacin-PC, both of which have been shown in preclinical studies to possess equivalent or greater anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity in comparison to the parent NSAIDs and to be safer for the GI tract, which are important improvements over unmodified NSAIDs.Relevance:  The successful development of PC-NSAIDs as a novel topical/parenteral treatment to promote the acute relief of burn pain and wound healing with minimal side effects will have significant implications in the Army's medical management of wounded warriors on the battlefield that are victims of burn injury and should also have broad applications to the management of burns in the civilian population.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
980,"One in two men and women will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime.  Cancer is defined as uncontrolled cell growth influenced by both environmental and genetic factors.  While therapies for established cancers have existed for a while and are heavily researched, substances that prevent cancer have not received as much attention.  A variety of different agents exist that may prevent or slow disease progression.  We propose to investigate two of these, Lactoferrin (LF) and soy, and their relevance in chemoprevention of prostate cancer (PCa).  LF is a protein that is naturally found in secretory fluids such as milk, saliva, and tears.  Although its mode of action is not completely understood, it has been found to have both anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties.  Soybean, or soy, is a legume that is a universally important crop that is grown in the vast majority of agricultural populations.  Animal models are the closest surrogate to human cancers that we currently use.  A genetically driven mouse model that we developed that incorporates two important genes associated with human PCa, MYC and Pten, accurately resembles all of the phenotypic stages of human disease.  There are two specific aims for the proposed work.  The first aim is to test the chemopreventative effects that LF and soy have when added to the diet of this mouse model.  In the second aim, genetic analysis will reveal important changes associated with disease progression and the changes associated with dietary addition of LF.  The proposed work may provide insight into the clinical use of LF or soy in the chemoprevention of human PCa and contribute towards my success as a postdoctoral fellow and prostate cancer researcher.I recently started my Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in the Department of Pathology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine under the direction of Dr. Karen Sfanos, mentor, and Dr. Angelo De Marzo, co-mentor.  My goal is to complete 3-4 years of postdoctoral research and then apply for a full-time, tenure-track position at a research hospital or university.  The guidance and support that will be provided to me from Dr. Sfanos and Dr. De Marzo will be instrumental in making the proposed research and my postdoctoral fellowship a success.  In addition, the collaborative support from Dr. Charles Bieberich at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Dr. Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine will provide excellent resources that will allow me to expand my knowledge about prostate cancer and develop new skills to make me a better researcher.The proposed research can have an immediate impact on patients without and with prostate cancer.  If the addition of LF or soy to the diet prevents cancer altogether, then a diet supplemented with one of these natural substances can be initiated early in the life of high-risk individuals to prevent disease.  If it is shown to slow cancer progression, then individuals diagnosed with early stage disease can add one of the substances to their diet to prevent metastatic spread.  Lastly, if it is shown that the addition LF or soy to the diet prolongs survival, then individuals at any stage of disease may benefit from these substances.  Natural substances have been used to treat a variety of different human disorders.  Both LF and soy are known to be non-toxic in humans; therefore, the relative risk is extremely low, but the benefits could be substantial.  The proposed research may provide valuable insight into the use of these chemopreventative substances in all aspects of prostate cancer prevention and treatment.The benefits of the proposed study to use natural substances to prevent or treat prostate cancer in a mouse model that closely mimics all of the stages of human prostate cancer may be substantial and would certainly represent a paradigm shift in the field.

Academically diverse students from Iowa State University have been designing and evaluating the new product, half scale vest, developed from the composites having good tensile strength and relatively low moisture regain. This project is consistent with P3 benefits including a cleaner community environment, reduction in energy use, reduction of fiber processing and fabric production costs, reduction of material waste, and development of a textile that has potential for production beyond an experimental prototype.Recent developments with sustainable biopolymers have the potential to be combined with the cellulose fibers to produce composite textiles with the cellulose fiber mats.

The purpose of the proposed project was to identify a method of growing and combining the cellulose fibers from bacteria and yeast in fermented tea with sustainable biopolymers obtained from agricultural plant products such as corn or soy, to reduce moisture regain and to increase strength of the cellulose fiber. New products developed from the composites would have good tensile strength and relatively low moisture regain which are the key parameters for regular daily wear.The challenge would be the limitations of chemical compatibility with the cellulose molecule and the necessity to have all aspects of the product and processes sustainable. Development of a method to treat the cellulose fiber mat that provides a sustainable product includes treating the mat with a sustainable biopolymer that reduces moisture regain and increases tensile strength.Two methods were proposed: 1) renewable cellulose fibers would be incorporated into biopolymer composites and 2) biopolymer nanoparticles dispersed in water would be added to bacteria and yeast in fermented tea during growing the cellulose fibers.

983,"Agricultural insect pests are subject to many forms of stress, including human imposed stress resulting from use of management tactics that employ both chemical and biological control. Developing sustainable management practices requires a fundamental understanding of the response of insect pests to stress induced by common control methods. Bacterial endosymbionts have been shown to enhance insect host survival under stress, however their role in response to pest control practices is largely unknown. Furthermore, the potential for bacterial endosymbionts to enable adaptation to control methods via mechanisms that generate genetic diversity under stress is unexplored. The proposed research will investigate insect-symbiont dynamics under stress imposed by insecticides and resistant plant varieties in the major insect pest of soybeans in North America, the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines). The first research objective is to determine whether infection by the facultative symbiont Arsenophonus provides fitness benefits to aphids exposed to two classes of insecticide (pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and soybean varieties with major resistance genes (Rag2 and stacked Rag1Rag2). The second research objective is to investigate whether molecular mechanisms involved in stress-induced mutagenesis are up-regulated and increase genetic diversity within Arsenophonus populations when aphids are subjected to chronic stress imposed by insecticides and resistant plants. This research will advance our understanding of insect symbioses under agriculturally relevant stresses. Knowledge of interactions between crop plants, insect pests, and microbes can be exploited to develop effective pest management programs and minimize the risk of evolved resistance to various control practices.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
984,"Alternatives to petroleum based fuels, chemicals and other products, has been stimulated by environmental concerns, increased costs of fossil fuels, as well as diminishing petroleum resources. Reliance on fossil fuels exposes the U.S. to a range of fluctuations, such as the changing price of crude oil and problems with supply and demand. Sustainable biofuels are an attractive alternative due to the abundant domestic biomass supply and the potential to reduce the carbon footprint by up to 80%. This project will focus on two common arid lands plants, Gindelia squarrosa (curtly top gumweed), and Ericameria nauseosa (rabbitbrush). Both plants are prevalent in the intermountain west on lands that are not generally suitable for food and feed crops, and both have potential as biofuel sources, but also for higher value industrial and consumer products. Rabbitbrush produces rubber, and gumweed produces a chemical, grindelic acid, which has properties similar to the industrial product, abietic acid. Thus, this investigation, by engineers, chemists and agronomists will examine a variety of avenues to produce fuels and biomaterials on lands that will not compete with food crops. Extensive arid lands exist in the western US, which are not suitable for growing food crops, but which might contribute significantly to biofuels production, particularly for plants that have relatively low water requirements. Gumweed (Grindelia squarrosa) is a hardy and versatile plant, indigenous throughout the Great Basin of Nevada, which has been successfully cultivated in an experimental setting. A biocrude oil is extracted from gumweed at about 70-85 gal/acre on an annualized basis in amounts comparable to that of soy beans, except that gumweed needs much less water. To utilize marginal arid land, which is unprofitable for food crop cultivation, for growing the dedicated energy crop can be truly valuable. It is estimated that if even 10% of sagebrush lands of Nevada are used to grow gumweed for aviation biofuels, 400-600 million gallons per year of jet biofuels could be produced, which can supply up to 20% the single largest fuel customer, the US military (jet fuel consumption was ~3.0 billion gallons in FY2008 (Andrews, 2009)). These considerations make gumweed a local solution in Nevada (as well as much of the intermountain west) to a national initiative. Cultivated gumweed contains 12-14% extractable hydrocarbons on a dry plant weight basis, and is composed of 60-75% grindelic acid. Grindelic acid is an excellent biomass feedstock source for jet fuel. Besides grindelic acid, the gumweed biocrude contains other terpenes, which, together with grindelic acid, are prone to forming coke at elevated temperatures. While both biodiesel and aviation fuel potential will be examined, the higher valued aviation fuel will receive the primary focus.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
985,"Myriad factors are likely to impact food security in the future. Of particular concern is that impact of global climate and atmospheric change. Research spanning the last efw decades has focused exclusively on understanding the responses of key crops to major global changes, including rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and warming air temperatures. This research builds upon the previous research by testing two possible strategies that are predicted to maximize crop yields in light of global change. The first strategy is to increase a key enzyme involved in photosynthesis that is currently predicted to limit productivity and will likely have a larger role in limiting yields in the future. The second strategy is to replace a key photosynthetic enzyme that is known the be very sensitive to heat with a new enzyme that carries the same function but is heat tolerant. This project uses state-of-the-art in-field experimentation techniques to grow crops using standard agronomic practices but in an atmosphere that mimics the conditionspredicted for mid-way through this century. We will genetically modify soybean to either increase the abundance of one enzyme, to express the heat tolerant version of a second enzyme, or both. These soybean lines will then be grown in the open-air experiment subjected to warmer temperature and increased carbon dioxide. This research will provide direct evidence for two strategies to maximize productivity, and upon its completion, will provide evidence for whether the theoretical bases for these two strategies to improve yields will be realized.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
986,"The emerging advanced biofuel industry and the production of energy crops for it offer potential new opportunities for small and medium-sized farms to produce high valued crops and enhance the economic viability of agriculture and rural communities. Energy crop production involves substantial upfront investments in establishment and a long-term commitment of land to the crop in the presence of liquidity and credit constraints, yield, price and demand uncertainty. We propose to develop an integrated project that will contribute to priorities (ii), (iii) and (vi) of the Agricultural Economics and Rural Communities program of increasing farm profitability, providing new decision tools for farm and market systems and new approaches to rural development. Specifically, we will quantify the risks associated with the production of two promising bioenergy crops (miscanthus and switchgrass) and compare them with those of corn and soybeans by estimating location-specific yield distributions and determine the optimal portfolio of crops depending on location, risk and time preferences of farmers. We will also analyse the types of contracts for biomass production that optimally share yield and price risks between farmers and biorefineries and examine their implications for farm income. This framework will be used to investigate the design of a potential crop insurance program for energy crops and to compare the cost-effective mix of crop insurance subsidies, Biomass Crop Assistance Program, and a cellulosic biofuel tax credit in improving the competitiveness of energy crop production.

Soybean Vein Necrosis Associated Virus is a new Tospovirus that was first discovered in soybean fields in Tennessee in 2008. Currently the disease has been detected in fifteen states in the North central region including Indiana. The disease has caused significant damage in soybean fields in some states such as Arkansas. Because SVNaV is newly described, there is no information about the biology and ecology of the insect vector species. Hence, the objective of this proposal is to identify potential thrips vectors of this virus and determine the effects of the virus on the vector.

988,"Corn and soybean production in the U.S. has become dominated by the use of genetically engineered (GE) seed with plant-incorporate-protectant and herbicide tolerance traits. Research shows that these GE crops have resulted in substantial economic and environmental benefits, but pest resistance is now threatening the sustainability of GE crop production and the benefits it provides. Concentration in the U.S. corn and soybean seed industry and non-price competition for increased market share has accompanied the rise to dominance of GE crop varieties. Some facets of this non-price competition can potentially mitigate the threat of pest resistance, while others facets can potentially exacerbate the threat. The objectives of this project are to (i) estimate how concentration in the U.S. corn and soybean seed industry and non-price competition are affecting farmers&#39; pest management decisions and (ii) assess how these pest management decisions are affecting the threat of pest resistance and sustainability of GE production. To accomplish objective (i), publically available USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey and Risk Management Agency data, and privately available GfK Kynetec data will be used to estimate how farmers&#39; pest management decisions have changed over time in response changes in regulatory policy, federal crop insurance programs, and the availability of different GE crop varieties driven by non-price competition.

989,"Phytophthora are responsible for many devastating diseases on important crops including potato, tomato, melon, and soybean. The potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans triggered the Irish Famine in the 19th century and remains a serious problem worldwide; and Phytophthora sojae is the second most destructive pathogen of soybean that causes an average of 200 million dollars annual loss in the U.S. To date, battling Phytophthora diseases is challenged by a lack of understanding of pathogenesis. A broad range of parasites, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, protozoa, insects and nematodes, subvert host immunity through the functions of effectors. These virulence proteins can enter host cells and directly manipulate specific physiological/signaling pathways in the hosts for the benefit of pathogen infection. Genome sequence analysis revealed an extraordinarily large arsenal of effectors produced by Phytophthora spp., however, the functions of the vast majority of Phytophthora effectors remain unknown. Recently, we identified two Phytophthora effectors that suppress RNA silencing in plant hosts (Qiao et al., 2013, Nature Genetics). RNA silencing is a universal gene regulation mechanism in eukaryotes through the activity of 20-30 nucleotide (nt) small RNAs. Remarkably, these Phytophthora Suppressors of RNA silencing (PSRs) significantly promote infection, suggesting that inhibiting host RNA silencing pathways is an essential virulence strategy of Phytophthora. These findings revealed a new perspective in Phytophthora-plant interactions that involves small RNAs as integral players in the regulation of plant immunity. Understanding the molecular basis of PSR functions will enable us to design novel and efficient control strategies against the severe Phytophthora diseases.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Each trial will evaluate AME of De-oiled Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DO-DDGS) at three different ages in broilers; 7 and 21 (Trial 1) and 49 (Trial 2) days of age. For each trial, two rooms will be used and each room will have 32 battery cages for a total of 64 cages. The same facility will be used in each trial. All trials will evaluate the same four dietary treatments with incremental amounts of DO-DDGS added to the basal diet. In each room, the four experimental diets will be fed to broilers in 8 replicate cages. The dimensions of each cage are 0.61 meters × 0.66 meters bird density will consist of 18 chicks from 0 to 10 days of age, 14 chicks per cage from 14 to 21 days of age for 21 day determination, and 8 chicks per cage from 42 to 49 days for AME determination. One feeder and nipple drinker will be provided for each cage. For Trial 1, day-old male broiler chicks will be obtained from a commercial hatchery and will be weighed into groups and randomly allocated to the battery cages will be fed experimental diets until day 7. On day 7, excreta pans will be cleaned and 72 hour collection period will be started. Upon completion of the experimental period at 10 days of age, birds will be placed into floor pens and fed a common diet until the start of the adaptation period for 21 day AME determination. On days 14 and 42, birds will be weighed into groups and randomly allocated to the battery cages. On days 18 and 46, after a four day adaptation period, excreta pans will be cleaned to ensure that all previous diets will be voided and excreta will then be collected over a 72 hour period. For all trials, birds will be allowed ad libitum feed consumption of the experimental diets throughout the entire adaptation and experimental period. Upon completion of the experimental period, birds will be returned to floor pens until the next age period. An inert dietary marker, titanium dioxide, will be added to the experimental diets and used to calculate AME of the feedstuffs. Measurements collected during experimentation will consist of feed consumption, body weight, gross energy of feed and excreta, titanium dioxide content in the feed and the excreta, and fat content. The AME of the feedstuff will be determined using the following formulas: Apparent metabolizable energy= 1-(GEexcreta ÷ TiO2 excreta) – (GEfeed ÷ TiO2 feed).

Alfalfa silage, corn silage, corn grain and roasted soybeans will be 15N (Nitrogen) enriched in the field and fed separately as part of a standard ration. Urine and feces will be collected from lactating cows on these rations and used in laboratory studies to estimate ammonia emissions from barn floors and soil N transformations after manure application as influenced by each feed. Urine and feces will be collected from various lactating cow trials having treatments of different forage types and supplementation strategies to understand their effects on ammonia emission from the manure and subsequent soil N transformations after manure application. The effects of limit feeding and monensin on ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions from replacement dairy heifers will be studied in emission chambers. Feeding options for raising dairy replacement heifers in confinement and grazing settings will also be evaluated.   Objective 2. The ruminal-gastrointestinal digestibility of alfalfa proteins treated with chemically defined condensed and hydrolysable tannin fractions will be determined by in vitro incubation followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. Fractions from a commercial quebracho-chestnut tannin extract responsible for urease inhibition in dairy feces will be identified. Tannin extracts will be fed to lactating dairy cows at 0 to 3% of dietary dry matter, and effects on in-barn emissions of ammonia and methane will be measured.

992,"Objective(s): The long-term objective is to develop soybean with resistance to pests and pathogens. Soybean is the second largest crop in the United States with a farm value of $30 billion in 2009.  A number of diseases affect soybean yield, but by far the greatest loss is due to soybean cyst nematode(SCN), Heterodera glycines. While nematodes are a long-standing problem, the greatest emerging threat to the US soybean crop is soybean rust (SBR), a disease caused by the fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi.  Gene expression will be examined in the SCN-induced syncytium (multinucleated cell) to determine if gene expression and protein targeting is asymmetric across the length of the syncytium (i.e., polarized).  New candidate genes responsible for susceptibility and resistance to SCN and SBR will be identified and their functions investigated.  Transgenic and mutagenized soybean plants will be examined to determine if there are unintended changes in the proteome.  The specific objectives of the proposal are: Objective 1:  Discover and characterize plant and pathogen genes and molecular signals important for resistance or pathogenicity at the molecular level with emphasis on soybean interactions with soybean rust and soybean cyst nematode.  Objective 2:  Identify genes expressed during interactions of soybean with nematodes and fungi at various intervals on resistant and susceptible plants, and develop transformed plants with over-expressed and silenced genes to improve resistance to nematodes and fungi.

Objective 3:  Determine the collateral variation in seed comp  Approach: Plant hormonal signal pathways (e.g. ethylene, auxin, IDA), will be examined to determine how they contribute to growth of the feeding structure (syncytium) for SCN.  Fluorescent markers will be used to identify expression patterns for genes and proteins involved in auxin, ethylene and IDA synthesis, transport and signaling to determine their interactive roles in the asymmetric growth of the syncytium.  A novel IDA-like gene discovered in root-knot nematodes will be assayed for its role in nematode growth within the plant by overexpression of the nematode IDA in the plant roots and suppression of the IDA in the nematode by RNAi gene silencing.  Fifteen proteins that accumulate in the nucleus at a higher level and 52 proteins that accumulate at a lower level in Rpp1 plants resistant to SBR will be examined.  Using virus-induced gene silencing and virus-induced over-expression, it will be tested whether altered levels of these proteins contribute to Rpp1 resistance and whether these genes can be used to improve resistance.  Roots infected with SCN will be examined using Illumina RNA-seq.  DNA constructs representing genes of interest will be transformed into soybean roots and challenged with SCN to determine if they contribute to resistance or susceptibility.

Objective 2, the improvement of seed composition, will focus on raising oleic acid content of soy oil, reducing phytate in the protein meal, identifying allergenic epitopes in soybean seed storage proteins and determining the impact of altered seed composition on vulnerability to disease. Objective 3, the improvement of stress tolerances will identify QTL in exotic germplasm for tolerance to drought and ozone. All of these objectives focus on increasing the profitability of the U.S. crop.   A common factor in the three objectives is the placement of novel alleles and traits in high-yielding publicly-available genetic backgrounds. Because more than 90% of the U.S. soybean acreage is grown in private varieties, industry rather than the public sector will be the most immediate user of this USDA-ARS-developed germplasm as novel breeding stock. However, our products are non-GMO and, thus, are also being used directly in the small- but fast-growing- organic market. To ensure the successful transfer of USDA products to the farm (directly to organic or indirectly as breeding stock for the larger industry) it is essential that our USDA-ARS germplasm releases be ‘user friendly’.

To utilize the systems model to determining the step(s) that are limiting oil production and accumulation, and provide a basis for increasing oil levels without decreasing proteins levels, as well as decreasing levels of anti-nutritional compounds and increasing protein quality. The model will also provide insight into the system response to perturbation. This will help with the design of potential changes that will likely require a coordinated multi-level approach.  To improve the nutritional quality of soybean seed meal. A two-pronged approach, including metabolic engineering of S assimilatory pathway genes plus expression of genes encoding S-rich proteins will be used to design soybean with elevated S amino acid content. Additionally, elimination of Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (KTI), an anti-nutritional component of soybean meal, will be accomplished using a RNA interference (RNAi) approach.   To develop soybean germplasm with improved oil and meal quality traits a combination of reverse-genetics, forward genetics, genomics, and breeding, will be employed. The main focus is on development of reverse genetic resources for improving oil and meal quality by discovery of candidates for modification of oil quality including alleles, from both induced and natural sources, encoding proteins involved in FA biosynthesis, TAG biosynthesis, and TAG packaging/storage in oil bodies.   To develop and characterize value-added soybean germplasm with improved seed quality and enhanced germination efficiency will be approached by screening plant introduction lines with tolerance to supra-optimal temperatures during seed development and used to determine the underlying genetic bases. Similarly, lines with enhanced germination at sub-optimal soil temperatures will be identified by screening of germplasm resources.

We have predicted a large number of transcription factor genes and microRNA genes potentially controlling oil quality traits in soybean seeds, and modeled their underlying gene regulatory networks. In this plan, we will select a minimum of two transcription factor genes and microRNA genes, and validate their functions in Sub-Objective 1A and 1B respectively through altering their activities in soybean transgenic seeds. It is time consuming to evaluate gene functions using a transgenic approach in soybean so we have decided to use a bioinformatics approach to improve the prediction of gene function in the proposed research. This approach will entail a genomic and evolutionary based comparison of expression profiles of protein coding sequences and miRNAs in soybean and Arabidopsis seeds over the course of seed maturation in Sub-Objective 1C.

Approach: To determine the function of transcription factor genes and regulatory networks in soybean oil production a bioinformatic approach will be used to refine a selection of previously identified target genes. The resultant candidate genes will be functionally characterized in situ using an RNAi approach to impair the natural expression of the native gene in transgenic soybean lines. Functionality will be assessed by assessment of the seed oil composition in the transgenic lines.  MicroRNA species that regulate oil production pathways in soybean seeds will be validated bioinformatically and by direct testing using standard molecular technologies. Transgenic approaches will be used to determine the functions of the miRNAs in regulating oil content and composition in seeds and their underlying gene regulatory networks by overexpressing or suppressing activity of the selected miRNAs in soybean.  The functions of selected soybean genes in the control of oil composition and content will be explored by comparative bioinformatics approaches using Arabidopsis as a model seed. The soybean/Arabidopsis orthologous genes encoding candidate seed specific transcription factors will be preferentially selected for functional validation. The functional significance and equivalence of the paired Arabidopsis and soybean genes will be validated by selecting a minimum of two pairs of Arabidopsis/soybean genes, examine the oil and transcriptomic phenotypes of mutants that can be identified in Arabidopsis, use complementation transgenic strategies to determine if the soybean genes can functionally complement the phenotypes of the Arabidopsis mutants. The soybean genes that exhibit functions in oil composition and content will then be directly tested in soybean transgenic plants.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

1001,"Objective(s): Our overall objective is to understand the molecular genetic control of plant architecture so that it can be manipulated to improve agriculture. We study the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), the growing tip of the plant. Evidence indicates that cell to cell communication mediated by small secreted signaling molecules is crucial to balance stem cell function with organ formation at the shoot tip, yet very little is known about the expression or function of small signaling molecules in these critical biological processes. We have previously shown that the small signaling gene CLV3 plays a critical role in communicating stem cell fate information in the SAM and developing flower meristems. This project describes a functional genomics approach designed to identify roles in Arabidopsis SAM growth and/or organ formation for four CLV3-related genes, which are members of the CLE (CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED) family of signaling molecules. We will utilize a combination of genetic and molecular approaches to analyze the expression and regulation of the CLE10, CLE16, CLE17 and CLE27 genes in the SAM and initiating organs, and to determine their functions in regulating stem cell activity and/or organ early organ formation. We will also take advantage of the high degree of molecular and functional conservation between different plant species to develop and test hypotheses regarding how knowledge of architectural genes in Arabidopsis can be applied to crop plants to aid in the improvement of agriculturally important traits.  The specific objectives of this project plan are: Objective 1. Analyze the expression and regulation of signaling genes in plant shoots.

Hypothesis: Additional CLE genes are expressed in specific patterns in the SAM and/or organ primordia during the Arabidopsis life cycle, and these CLE genes will be regulated by known pathways acting in the SAM or organ primordia. Experimental Design: Analyze CLE10, CLE16, CLE17 and CLE27 gene expression in Arabidopsis SAM tissue. Use in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR to analyze CLE16 and CLE17 expression in plants carrying mutations in major SAM regulatory pathway components. Analyze the expression of all four CLE genes in plants that display defects in leaf organ patterning.  Contingencies: If in situ hybridization fails to detect CLE gene expression, then CLE promoter:GUS reporter construct analysis will be conducted. Objective 2. Hypothesis: The CLE16 and CLE17 genes function to control aspects of Arabidopsis SAM activity. Experimental Design: Generate CLE16 and CLE17 loss-of-function lines using insertion mutants and artificial microRNA constructs. Characterize their SAM and lateral organ phenotypes via light and electron microscopy, and histological sectioning. Perform in situ hybridization and GUS staining in the mutants to examine the expression of genes that mark SAM functional domains.  Contingencies: If CLE16/17 loss-of-function phenotypes are not detected in the mutant lines, their over-expression phenotypes will be analyzed using the same methologies. Objective 3. Hypothesis: The CLE10, CLE16, CLE17 and CLE27 genes have overlapping functions in regulating Arabidopsis organ formation. Experimental Design: Generate null mutants and/or amiRNA lines for each of the four CLE genes. Cross these lines to produce triple and quadruple mutant combinations. Analyze their leaf morphogenesis events and growth parameters using computational methods. Analyze their leaf patterning defects using electron microscopy, histological sectioning and quantitative measurements. Perform in situ hybridization, RT-qPCR and GUS staining to examine the expression of genes that mark various leaf domains and regulate different aspects of leaf formation. Contingencies: If phenotypes are not observed in the quadruple mutants, cross them to amiR-CLE5/6 lines to eliminate all CLE gene activity in initiating organs.  Objective 4. Hypothesis: Arabidopsis CLE sequences are conserved in crop species, and crop CLE genes with highly similar expression patterns to those of Arabidopsis CLE genes can be identified via computational methods. Experimental Design: Perform computational sequence analysis to identify CLE sequences in the rice, maize and soybean genomes, and generate a phylogenetic tree. Use in silico gene expression data to compare the expression patterns of Arabidopsis CLE genes with their rice and grass counterparts. Combine the phylogenetic and expression data to determine which rice and grass CLE genes are most similar and thus most likely to share biological functions.

Genetic engineering of floral crops for pest and pathogen resistance contributes to sustainable production.  There has been little research done on migratory nematodes such as Pratylenchus, and this project addresses the use of transgenes that may be effective in controlling Pratylenchus.  Viruses are always a problem for propagated plants, particularly flower bulb crops that are propagated from the same bulb for many years.

Approach: Goal 1.1.A: Identify genes controlling elemental accumulation in many different environments. Goal 1.1.B: Identify elemental signatures of plant responses to stressful environments.  The ionome is a highly sensitive probe of the processes that allow plants to adapt to the soil environment. The mechanisms that plants use to adapt to different soil environments will affect how they take up elements and different mechanisms will have different effects on the ionome.  By identifying the genes responsible for elemental accumulation, we will also be identifying the genes responsible for adapting to the environment. Additionally, it may be possible to identify elemental signatures of different mechanisms of adaptation to the environment.  Goal 1.2.: Identify and test candidate genes in soybeans and the oilseed model Camelina.  The results from Approach 1 will give us a large number of genomic regions that control ionomic traits. For most of these regions, we will not be able to identify the causative loci directly in soybean. Instead, we will need to employ a variety of computational methods to identify candidate genes.  The most powerful methods are likely to be comparative genomics efforts leveraging the large amount of ionomic data from other organisms to identify candidates that can then be addressed directly in soybean.  Goal 2.1.A: Determine the contribution of glutamine carbon to the production of pyruvate-derived amino and fatty acids through the use of malic enzyme. Goal 2.1 B: Determine the carbon sources for citrate biosynthesis in seeds and its subsequent use for oil and or protein amino acid production.

These data will facilitate a comparative sequence analysis to identify genome regions containing genes associated with domestication and unique genomic regions/genes from the wild soybean.  Genetic markers to introgress the wild soybean-derived genes into cultivated soybean will be identified.   The available WGS of common bean and wheat will be analyzed to identify SSR DNA markers.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets flanking the SSRs will be designed and used to establish SSR marker databases for common bean and wheat.  To evaluate the utility of the databases, a set of SSRs will be selected to amplify DNA from a set of genotypes and the amplicons visualized for locus specificity and polymorphism.  In the case of wheat, additional WGS analyses using the HiSeq 2000 DNA sequencer will be performed on a small set of hexaploid wheats to provide additional data for SSR identification.

1010,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Work funded under the PI's previous VA Merit award has contributed directly to a novel and now widely accepted life-saving treatment for local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) resuscitation has also been used in many instances to rapidly reverse acute cardiac and neurological symptoms of toxicity caused by a wide range of lipophilic (fat soluble) medications. In many published case reports involving LAST or other overdoses, ILE was effective even after standard resuscitation measures had failed. ILE is now a principle element in treatment guidelines published by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia, the Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, the Resuscitation Council (UK) and was added to the most recent American Heart Association ACLS guidelines for treating LAST. Drug overdose is the second leading cause of accidental death in the United States contributing to 36,000 fatalities in 2007 placing it ahead of gunshot wounds and just behind motor vehicle accidents. Moreover, veterans are at particular risk given the prevalence of both illicit drug abuse and the difficulty for a geriatric population to adhere to instructions for such prescription drugs as long acting calcium channel blockers that can be potentially fatal in overdose. Notably, ILE has been used effectively in treating overdose of many common prescription medications (e.g. beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants or calcium channel blockers) that can be highly resistant to standard resuscitation measures. Identifying the precise mechanism(s) underlying ILE holds the promise of improving its efficacy and providing an effective, generic antidotal treatment for a range of life-threatening toxic drug overdoses. However, the precise mechanisms of ILE are not well understood. The conventional explanation involves partitioning of the offending toxin into the newly created lipemic plasma phase, or 'lipid sink'. However, even this mechanism has not been tested rigorously in vivo. Moreover, we have observed that key aspects of ILE cannot be explained by the sink alone, indicating that other, less well-understood, mechanisms are also at play. We believe that ILE also directly benefits cardiovascular function and have confirmed in preliminary experiments that the infusion of lipid emulsion in the intact rat exerts positive effecs on cardiac contractility and aortic blood flow. We hypothesize that this results in part from direc, positive effects of fatty acid metabolism on cardiac function. Moreover, it is well-established tha tissue ischemia can cause intercellular endothelial gaps to expand, thereby allowing liposomes to migrate into the myocardial interstitium. Such passive targeting of lipid particles, essentiallynano-medicine, will bypass the normal tissue barriers to diffusion of drug away from cells and diminish the response time to lipid signal effectors. We hypothesize that extravascular migration of lipid particles contributes to the overall efficacy of ILE in reversing cardiac drug toxicity. W propose studies to test the metabolic effects of ILE and transendothelial migration of lipid particles. Finally, we seek to improve the translation of ILE to cocaine-related toxicity and longer-lasting overdoses such as calcium channel blocker toxicity. Improved patient safety and outcomes from drug toxicity are the over-arching goals of this project.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1011,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Widely used to promote cardiovascular health, grape seed extract (GSE) contains high levels of proanthocyanidins with strong antioxidant properties. In preliminary in vitro studies, we identifie a variety of GSE-mediated anti-neoplastic mechanisms, including induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation via down-regulation of specific microRNA (miRNA). We now aim to translate these in vitro findings and set the stage for future clinical trial. A standardized GSE preparation complexed with soy phospholipids into phytosomes to improve bioavailability (Leucoselect) is available over the counter. Leucoselect has been shown to improve the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and reduce LDL susceptibility to oxidative stress in heavy smokers, but the potential of Leucoselect against lung cancer has never been evaluated. We therefore hypothesize that oral administration of Leucoselect will exert antineoplastic effects andfavorably modulate mechanisms associated with lung cancer. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim #1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK)/ pharmacodynamics (PD), and anti-cancer effects of Leucoselect in mouse models. A dose range finding study with leucoselect will be conducted in nude mice given varying doses via oral gavage. Blood and lung samples will be obtained to determine PK of grape seed procyanidin (GSP) and metabolites as surrogate markers of bioavailability of GSE (systemically and in the lungs), and to establish the MTD over 2 weeks treatment duration. Aim #1.1: To determine the bioactivity of oral Leucoselect at the targeted organ site using a novel co-culture system of snap frozen mouse lung sections with human lung neoplastic cells. Bioactivity in the lungs will be assessed by comparing lung tissue sections from control vs. Leucoselect treated mice co-cultured with the human nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, A549, and the bronchial premaligant cell line, 1198. The effects of varying GSE doses on proliferation and apoptosis in co-cultured A549 and 1198 cells will be correlated to GSP and metabolites levels. Aim #2: To determine the anti-caner effects of Leucoselect on lung cancer xenograft models. Varying doses of Leucoselect based on MTD will be administered via oral gavage to mice bearing subcutaneous NSCLC xenografts for up to 8 weeks, with serial collections of plasma, lung tissues and tumor xenografts from each treatment group. The anticancer effects will be determined by tumor growth delay or time to reach maximum tumor volume, proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptotic (cleaved caspase 3) indices, and correlated to GSP levels in plasma, lung tissue, and xenograft tumor samples. Aim #2.1: To further characterize and correlate the mechanistic effects of Leucoselect against lung cancer in xenograft models. The mechanistic effects of GSE will be measured by modulations of: 1) COX-2 expression and PGE2 production, and 2) Additional markers of inflammations: 15(S)-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and 3) mir-19a, -19b and -106b levels, 4) cancer relevant, pathway specific gene expression profiles (GEP), 5) microRNA expression, and 6) common biomarkers of cancerization such as p53, p27, p21 and p16, in various sample types. Aim #3: To validate and characterize the roles of mir-19a, mir-19b, and mir-106b in mediating the anti- neoplastic effects of Leucoselect and examine the potential of plasma mir-19a, mir-19b, mir-106b as SEBM for therapeutic monitoring. In our preliminary in vitro studies, we have identified significant down-regulation of 3 oncomirs: mir-19a, mir-19b, and mir-106b in NSCLC and 1198 cell lines by GSE. These miRNAs are among the major plasma miRNAs identified to be predictors of lung cancer development. Therefore, we will measure these miRNA levels in plasma obtained from xenograft models to determine their utility as surrogate endpoint biomarkers (SEBM). IMPACT: Findings from the study will provide important insights into the feasibility and mechanistic effects of GSE against lung cancer, help identify SEBM and pave the way for clinical trials in the near future. The potential gain for the management and prevention oflung cancer is enormous.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Unfortunately, responseassets at every level can quickly become overwhelmed and may require surge or redundant capacity. The Foodand Drug Administration Food Emergency Response Program (FDA FERN) is one system in place that iscomprised of both federal and state laboratories that bring personnel, supplies, equipment, and expertisetogether to enable food and food product analyses during these situations. Many laboratories are volunteerlaboratories, but 14 member laboratories have entered cooperative agreements and are now referred to as FERNCAP Laboratories. The Arkansas Department of Health-Arkansas Public Health Laboratory (ADH-PHL)became a FERN CAP Laboratory in 2009 and has been working over the past 1.5 years to provide the necessaryfoundation for launching the Arkansas FERN Chemistry Laboratory. This newly formed laboratory is part of rdthe 3 generation of CAP laboratories.ADH-PHL provides a solid laboratory environment for maintaining the Arkansas FERN Chemistry Laboratory.Dedicated laboratory space, quality management systems, and additional surge staff, instrument, and space areavailable when needs arise. Laboratory systems are accredited through several internationally recognizedaccrediting authorities, and the entire laboratory staff brings great experience in the four key project areas ofGC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, and ELISA. ADH-PHL also partners with other federal response networks managedby the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency, namely the Laboratory ResponseNetwork (LRN) and the Environmental Laboratory Response Network (ELRN), respectively. This internalcollaboration brings together a mix of diverse skill sets along with varying degrees of expertise and experiencein a way that promotes interaction and program development. These relationships are crucial for mitigatinglarge scale crises where human and environmental health is threatened.The Arkansas FERN Chemistry Laboratory has met 100% of the goals identified in the first 2 year cooperativeagreement. The laboratory is fully staffed, has obtained, installed and trained on FERN instrumentation, hasworked with FERN partners to successfully validate FERN testing methods focusing on GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, and ELISA, has participated and passed all proficiency tests provided by FDA, has exercised its responsecapabilities, and participates in technical and programmatic meetings, which include conference calls. Thislaboratory continuously focuses to improve emergency response and preparedness efforts and is working withFDA to find ways to enhance and expand FERN response initiatives. FERN analysts are actively evaluatingdiverse food matrix assignments provided by the FDA. These matrices include powdered milk, freeze-driedtuna, spinach, mandarin oranges, pineapple juice, chocolate syrup, soy-based baby formula, snack cakes, energydrinks, drinkable yogurt, balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing, catfish, and spirits.The project plan for this cooperative agreement continues to bolster emergency response and preparednessinitiatives by assessing analytical capacity, cross-training staff to provide additional surge support, proficiencytesting and exercising methodologies, and participating in various training forums including meetings andconference calls reviewing programmatic and technical information. Training sessions provided by FDA andother FERN partners will also be used to help stay abreast of the newest technology being used by FERN. Theproject plan also includes provisions to help expand and enhance FERN response initiatives. Matrix evaluationsand analyte extension studies will continue as staff cross-train with and exercise validated methods.Quantitative capabilities and technology evaluations are being explored as a way to help prepare the FERNprogram for future responses and requests. To help streamline reporting of data, unique data management andprocessing tools are being developed to help expedite final reporting.

1014,"1438612GaunschInvestigating the Role of Genetically Modified Crop Transgenes in Antibiotic Resistance in the Environment In 2013, approximately 90 % of the US corn crop was genetically modified. As part of the genetic modification process, selectable marker genes including antibiotic resistance genes are inserted into genetically modified crops. The fate of these genes is important to quantify, especially in the context of wastewater sewage sludge (biosolids). The land application of biosolids makes it critical that the fate of these genetically modified crop transgenes be investigated. The data generated will be useful to industry as well as legislators who control the future of genetically modified crops both domestically and internationally. The overall goal of this project is to determine if genetically modified crops are a significant source of antibiotic resistance genes. We hypothesize that genetically modified crop transgenes are an important contributor to bacterial antibiotic resistance development mainly because of the smaller size of the genetically modified crop plasmids relative to naturally occurring antibiotic resistant plasmids. This hypothesis will be tested in three tasks; 1) Genetically modified corn and soybean transgenes will be quantified in various wastewater treatment facilities. 2) The persistence of antibiotic resistance genes originating from plasmids used in genetically modified corn and soybean crops will be compared to naturally occurring plasmids during a simulated wastewater treatment and biosolids land application event. 3) Antibiotic resistance genes horizontal transfer rates will be compared between small plasmids (representative of genetically modified crop plasmids) and large plasmids (representative of naturally occurring plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes). The expected results from this research consist of identifying whether: 1) genetically modified crops are an important contributor of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment and; 2) biosolids land application promotes the proliferation of genetically modified crop associated antibiotic resistance genes. The success of the research work plan will be measured by our ability to quantify genetically modified crop derived antibiotic resistance genes and to determine their role in global antibiotic resistance development. A successful outcome of this project will lead to a better understanding of the long term implications of utilizing antibiotic resistance genes as selectable marker genes in genetically modified crop engineering.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
1015,"Global nitrogen needs are likely to be met through a combination of chemical fertilizers and cultivation-induced biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). The majority of cultivation-induced BNF occurs in symbiotic nodules of legumes such as soybean. Understanding the development of symbiotic nodules and enhancing biological nitrogen fixation would help reduce chemical fertilizer usage, and provide a sustainable supply of clean water, fertile land and a benefiting habitat for future generations, an immense benefit to the society. This project will provide research training for three graduate students and multiple undergraduate students in plant biology. Undergraduate and graduate exercises in bioinformatics will be developed using data from the project and disseminated for use by other educators. Results from the project will be disseminated through a project website, public databases, and relevant biological repositories.  Rhizodive , a statewide integrated research and training pipeline involving high school students, teachers, and university students to examine rhizobial diversity using trap legumes will be executed (with targeted recruitment of schools with significant minority enrollment). These activities will cultivate and promote scientific interest among the younger generation, promote participation of minorities in STEM areas, help develop a competitive STEM workforce, and enhance STEM curriculum and educators. This project will utilize novel genomics-empowered approaches to discover molecular signaling mechanisms that regulate legume nodule development. Based on evidence from gene expression, microRNA sensor and suppression assays, one emerging hypothesis is that microRNAs are one of the crucial determinants of the development of different nodule zones. The project will test this hypothesis utilizing a combination of genetic, molecular and micro-imaging approaches. Specifically the results from the project will help identify early signaling pathways that cause distinct development of different nodule zones. This knowledge in combination with other advances in plant breeding and biotechnology will enable the optimization of BNF (or possibly transfer it to non-legume crops) thus helping to meet global N needs in a sustainable manner. This is especially relevant in the context of a growing world population (expected to reach 8-11 billion by 2050), reduction in cultivable area due to urbanization, and the essential nature of nitrogen in maintaining plant productivity.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Yau (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)Successful completion of this project to study the photothermal flowering gene regulatory network in soybean will provide a systematic understanding of genetic networks associated with a plant's response to environmental signals, and ultimately allow plant improvement towards enhanced adaptation to fluctuating environments while improving yield. This work will provide novel algorithmic methods and bioinformatics pipelines for network inference and enhance development of fundamental knowledge in plant biology and bioinformatics. Finally, mathematical network models obtained through this work will lay the foundation for development of in silico systems to examine and predict plant performance under various environments. This project enhances integration of two very different fields of research in Crop Sciences and Engineering, and provides outstanding training opportunities for postdoctoral researchers and graduate, undergraduate and high school students in interdisciplinary research involving molecular genetic, biochemical, systems biology, and modeling approaches. Undergraduate students will be recruited from underrepresented groups and routinely involve in lab activities. The project will also organize and hold a summer camp for local high school students who will have the opportunity to conduct a summer research project on crop genetics and improvement. A growing concern in the world is the changes in crop performance associated with global climate change. In soybean, flowering transition is regulated by the interaction between photoperiods and temperature, known as photothermal effects. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of photothermal flowering in soybean, the project will employ  interdisciplinary approaches including: 1) elucidation of global gene expression patterns underlying photothermal flowering of soybean, 2) identification of key transcription factor-target interactions and protein-protein interactions of more than 20 transcription factors in the photothermal flowering gene network, 3) reverse engineering of the photothermal flowering gene network using transcriptome and interactome data as well as other biological side information by developing algorithmic methods and pipelines for network inference, and 4) mathematical modeling of the photothermal flowering gene network to provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms accounting for the genetic interactions and their functions, and biological relevance of genetic interactions implemented in the photothermal flowering gene network.

1017,"Biodiesel is a renewable energy source that can be used as a drop-in fuel supplement and replacement for petroleum diesel.  Though many biodiesel production facilities have been constructed, increases in the cost of the feedstock oil (such as soy oil), from which some biodiesel is made, have created a significant market need for a low-cost oil alternative that is suitable for biodiesel production. This team plans to meet this need by using oil extracted from algae. Algae are small photosynthetic microorganisms which convert sunlight into oil and other high-value products. Algae can produce more oil per acre than any other conventional biodiesel feedstock and does not compete with food production. Though others have looked into producing algae oil on a large scale, their efforts were largely unsuccessful due to processing costs when extracting oil from algae. This team has developed a technology to extract oil from algae at a low cost.The proposed innovation is a novel technique to rupture and extract oil from algae cells that has widespread application to the dairy/food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. The technology uses knowledge about the biomechanical response of algae cells which is input into an in-house computational framework that optimizes the design of our system to extract oil from algae. The oil will then be used as a feedstock for biodiesel production. The technology can also be used as a low-energy homogenization device which can serve the dairy/food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries.

1018,"Identifying genetic variation underlying complex phenotypes aids the understanding of their biology. Complex phenotypes characterized by a variety of features are often associated with substantial phenotypic variation. Current statistical methods are ineffective to address this phenotypic heterogeneity, and hence lack of power to associate genetic variants with the phenotype. This project aims to design new algorithms that differentiate homogenous subtypes of a complex phenotype that are most informative in genetic analysis, and identify genetic variants that are associated with the subtypes but cannot be detected by the non-differentiated phenotype. The validity of the subtypes will be proved in multiple scales including the evidence from genomic structure and phenotypic features. The new algorithms will be validated in the areas of genetic selection for complex traits of agriculturally-important animals and plants. This project serves a vehicle to train graduate students in the multidisciplinary methods involving computer science and biology, and allow them to apply the methods in a variety of biological fields. A new course in the bioinformatics field will be developed for senior undergraduate students. High school educational materials will also be developed to educate high school students about how to mathematically model biological data so it solves biological problems.This project will derive novel analytics based on quantitative genetics theory and machine learning theory to refine complex phenotypes for enhanced discovery of genotype-phenotype correlations. Using empirical and statistically rigorous methods, this project will derive composite traits, as functions of multiple phenotypic features, that are optimized with respect to narrow-sense heritability, and that map readily to specific genomic regions. Two statistical models for estimating narrow-sense heritability will be considered: one based on sample pedigrees, and the other directly uses the whole-genome markers. To identify multi-scale evidence of a subtype that is characterized by a composite trait, a new machine learning framework will be derived to jointly analyze genotypes and phenotypes. By testing the algorithms in the analysis of large-scale biological databases, the new algorithms will derive highly heritable composite traits for feed efficiency of dairy cattle and adaptive traits of soybean to improve their genetic selection. The algorithms developed in this project will also advance the machine learning field by defining and addressing new research problems, such as the joint model inference using data from multiple sources, probabilistic clustering based on matrix decomposition, and quadratic optimization for heritability estimation.

Trick (Kansas State University), and Hairong Wei (Michigan Technological University, Houghton) Key Collaborator: Kan Wang (Iowa State University) Small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), play central roles in growth and development, epigenetics, genome integrity, defense against pathogen infection, and responses to environmental changes in plants. miRNAs are especially important in controlling plant development, productivity, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses by negatively regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Hundreds to thousands of miRNAs have been identified from dozens of plant species. However, their roles in plant development and response against various pathogens and other stresses are largely unknown.  This project will integrate the most recent cutting-edge genomics technology into the study of miRNAs in crop plants.  Students at all levels of education will be engaged in a variety of activities including teaching, training, learning workshops, and technology-extension. The project will provide research training in small tandem target mimic (STTM) technology, rice transformation, and functional studies of miRNAs for postdoctoral associates, graduate and undergraduate students.  Underrepresented minorities and women, as well as students from the Upper Peninsula region of Great Lakes, will be targeted and recruited. The project will also organize and hold a training workshop in STTM construction.  The knowledge provided by this project will be disseminated to the public at large through informal talks at appropriate community venues.

What are their functional conservation and diversification in different plant lineages? This project will develop miRNA  knockdown  populations in selected agriculturally important crops as a pilot project using the recently developed STTM technology. These mutant populations will be further used to investigate the functional conservation and diversification of six highly conserved families of plant miRNAs, and to study the regulatory role of miRNAs in plant-microbe interactions.

1020,"PI: Peter L. Morrell (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities)CoPIs: Kevin P. Smith (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities) and Justin C. Fay (Washington University)Through examination of the prevalence of deleterious mutations, the project will address a longstanding issue of both theoretical and practical importance. Important crops such as barley, rice, soybeans, and wheat are inbreeding and deleterious mutations could be of greater consequence on yield in these crops, as the mutations will more frequently occur in the homozygous state in inbreds than in hybrid cultivars. Once identified, deleterious mutations can be eliminated through marker-assisted selection using genomics tools that are independent of the cost and inaccuracy of phenotyping to increase yield and reduce disease prevalence in crop plants. The barley system to be used in this study is ideally suited to translate our understanding of the nature and importance of deleterious mutations to application within a nationally organized and primarily public sector plant breeding community. USDA regional genotyping laboratories serve barley and wheat breeding programs across the country, using contemporary genotyping platforms to perform selection with informative SNPs. Several large collaborative research projects in barley are developing next generation mapping populations, a centralized trait and genotype database and analysis tools, and other resources that can be employed to further explore the role of deleterious mutations in barley. The public nature of the national barley breeding community will make application of this research in commercially relevant breeding lines broadly visible to the agricultural research community. This provides a uniquely open research system where results can serve as a model for other plant species that are used for food, fuel, and other natural products. Finally, the project will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and an undergraduate in crop genomics, evolutionary genetics, and computational biology. Through involvement with outreach programs at both universities, the project will engage students from populations underrepresented in the sciences.The research aims to characterize the potentially conflicting effects of self-fertilization and strong selection on the proportion of deleterious mutations harbored in individual plant genomes. Using resequencing of barley exomes from wild accessions, landraces (local cultivars), and modern elite (high yielding) inbred lines, the project will determine the extent to which selection for yield has affected the proportion of deleterious mutations present across genomes. Given sufficient population sizes, active selection of progeny that are more productive than either parent clearly has the potential to reduce the proportion of deleterious mutations present in elite lines. Nevertheless, strong selection for alleles that improve inbred lines or adaptation to agronomic environments may also increase the frequency of linked deleterious mutations. Genome-level comparisons will permit the identification of loci subject to artificial selection and estimation of the degree to which barley breeding programs have eliminated deleterious mutations across the genome while simultaneously contaminating the genome with deleterious mutations through hitchhiking at agriculturally important loci. All data generated in this project will be accessible through long-term repositories such as the NCBI SRA, GrainGenes and the Triticeae Toolbox (T3) database.

1021,"Plant defense variation studies typically focus on single large effect genes within a host or specialist pathogen that interact only with each other. However, resistance to most generalist pathogens is quantitative and cannot be investigated using few genotypically distinct individuals. This project will begin one of the first direct surveys of how genomic diversity within and across core plant lineages may be shaped by genomic diversity in a broad spectrum generalist fungus that can infect most if not all plants. This will lead to the development of novel biological and statistical methods to handle genomic diversity across phylogenetic lineages and provide a unique multi-plant species dataset that is currently only feasible with Botrytis cincerea.  All data and analysis protocols will be publicly available and microbial isolates will be available upon request pending the acquisition of the appropriate permits.  With regard to training, the project will provide research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. These students will be trained in modern quantitative genetics of complex traits to prepare them for future careers in industry or academics. As this is the one of the first instances of attempting to do quantitative genetics in two interacting species, this will place them at the forefront of the field in both theory and computational applications. Undergraduates will develop and devise their own projects within the frame of this project. Any publication resulting from this research will likely include at least one undergraduate student as a co-author who was integral in designing and interpreting the experiments. In addition, the principal investigator will be involved in teaching, both in a university classroom setting and in ongoing outreach efforts to educate community members about plant metabolism, plant defense evolution, and quantitative genomics. Plant/pathogen interactions determine plants fitness/yield. Most research on plant/pathogen interactions focuses on epidemic diseases from pathogens that infect only one or a few species similar to the human flu. However, this has led to a paucity of research on pathogens that are endemic, like Botrytis cinerea or the common cold, which can infect most host genotypes but only cause a low level of economic loss. These generalist pathogens place evolutionary pressure across plant lineages, yet this cross-lineage pressure is rarely systematically addressed. For example, it is currently not known if there is a common plant defense network against these generalist pathogens that can function in all plants. To test this question, this project aims to: 1) measure lesion development with a high-throughput platform across six plant species that have independently undergone domestication (lettuce, tomato, grape, soy and Brassicas) with 100 genome sequenced isolates of the pathogen, Botrytis cinerea; 2) use the genome wide association mapping dataset to identify pathogenicity networks within the pathogen that allow it to infect these diverse hosts; 3) identify and validate plant gene targets of these networks using a new co-species co-expression network approach to test if the pathogen targets defense mechanisms that are conserved or variant across plants and if these defense mechanisms have been affected by human driven domestication; and 4) conduct transcriptome profiling across these plant/pathogen combinations to identify conserved or variant transcriptional responses across the eudicot lineages. By including domestic and wild genotypes in each plant species this project will provide a common reference frame in which to study how domestication may or may not consistently influence plant defenses. In the longer term, this information will provide for a better understanding of how selection pressures drive the evolution of defenses within eudicot lineages towards generalist pathogens.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Niederhuth is  Epigenomic Engineering in Soybeans to Unlock Cryptic Genetic Variation  The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Georgia and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Robert J. Schmitz.Genomes possess an additional layer of information found not in the underlying DNA sequence, but in the modification of cytosine residues by methylation. As DNA methylation is a mechanism of regulating gene expression, it sits at the boundary between genotype and phenotype. Variants in the methylation status, or epialleles, not only affect the phenotype, but can also be heritable, being stably inherited across multiple generations without alteration to the underlying DNA sequence. Together with the proteins that make up chromatin structure, DNA methylation is part of a code that has come to be called the epigenome. Unlocking the nature of this code and finding mechanisms to manipulate it will add additional tools for breeders to translate discovery to application towards improving plant health and production.  Training objectives include plant genetics, DNA methylation, epigenomics, bioinformatics, and quantitative genetics. Broader impacts include the mentoring and training of students, including outreach programs to underrepresented groups. This will include local outreach and aiding in the development of new courses.This research proposes to uncover the links between methylation and phenotypes by using a multipronged approach to disrupt DNA methylation in soybeans followed by identification of methylation variants through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. As part of this work, novel experimental populations of soybean for mapping epigenetic quantitative trait loci associated with phenotypic variation will be developed. In addition, new methods of targeted epigenome engineering will be used to confirm these associations and enable the use of the epigenome for plant improvement.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1023,"Proposal Number: 1402896 P.I.: DiRusso, Concetta  Institution: University of Nebraska-LincolnTitle: Activators to Maximize Algal Oil Production  Petroleum fossil fuels are an essential, but limited source of energy.  In the search for sustainable renewable fossil fuel source replacement, the microalgae have garnered much interest.  Algae are attractive due to rapid growth and ability to accumulate lipid to 20-40% dry weight, potentially yielding 100-fold more oil per acre than soybeans or other oil-seed bearing plants.  Additionally, various algal species grow well in poor quality water and under a large variety of environmental conditions. During photosynthesis algae fix CO2 into biomass thus addressing concerns due to carbon emissions.  In addition to biofuels, algae can be used to produce a wide range of other byproducts.  However, at the present time algal oils are not ready for commercialization due to high costs in producing and processing sufficient biomass given the primitive state of knowledge of algal biology and biotechnology. Current methods of inducing algal lipid production and storage requires conditions that stresses the cells and stops growth; this limits the total yield of biomass and oil.  In preliminary studies the PI's identified 3 families of small synthetic chemicals that induce oil storage in algae without affecting growth.  The proposed studies will investigate the 3 best hits from each family to provide: [1] important information on basic algal biology and biochemistry leading to lipid storage, [2] insight on maximizing both algal oil and biomass production, and [3] products (the lipid inducers) useful for commercial production of algal biofuels.  The knowledge base generated will advance our understanding of algal biochemistry and molecular biology.  This information will be useful in the fields of stress biology, biofuel production and in the production of other high value co-products. The lipid activators will also be useful products that will find a market in the biofuels industry and in the research community as experimental tools.  Additionally, the proposed experiments will provide workforce enhancement by training undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-doctoral fellows.  The scientific team will bring their findings and expertise to the lay public by offering a short course in biofuels for sustainable energy production.Global energy demand continues to increase and fossil fuel sources will likely become limited within the century. One attractive sustainable alternative is oil derived from algal sources. However, knowledge of the biochemistry and molecular biology of the microalgae is incomplete and there are no known methods to induce oil storage in algae without inducing a stress response that stops growth as occurs when cells are starved of essential nutrients. Therefore, there is a pressing need to experimentally define components and mechanisms that lead to lipid synthesis and storage without stress induction if these organisms are to be employed as commercially viable sources of bioenergy. In preliminary work, the investigators conducted a screen of 44,000 synthetic chemicals for those that would increase lipid production without stopping cellular growth and subset of 360 were identified with these properties.  This set was rescreened and final hits were further divided into three groups based on structural similarities. From each group the compound with the highest activity was selected as a hit lead. The goal of the present proposal is to characterize these 3 selected hit compounds as activators of lipid production. The research objectives are to: [1] further assess the potency and specificity of the hit compounds to induce lipid synthesis and storage without inducing a global stress response or limiting the photosynthetic capacity in C. reinhardtii and additional algal species; [2] assess alterations in the metabolome, of cells treated with one hit compound from each structural group to define the metabolic shifts and impacted pathways that contribute to lipid accumulation upon compound treatment; and [3] assess alterations in the proteome of cells treated with hit compounds to define the proteins and biochemical pathways that contribute to lipid accumulation upon compound treatment. The expected outcomes include:  [1] important information on basic algal biology and biochemistry leading to lipid storage, [2] insight on maximizing both algal oil and biomass production, and [3] products (the lipid inducers) useful for commercial production of algal biofuels. This information will be useful in the fields of stress biology, biofuel production and in the production of other high value co-products. The lipid activators will also be useful products that will find a market in the biofuels industry and in the research community as experimental probes.This award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Biomass Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1024,"The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to investigate biorenewable thermosetting polymers derived from vegetable oils and to explore the use of microencapsulated liquid healing agents in these bio-based polymers as multifunctional composites with the ability to heal damage autonomically (i.e. self-healing bio-based polymers).  These biorenewable polymers will be synthesized from the ring-opening metathesis polymerization of modified castor, soybean, and linseed oils to maximize the thermal and mechanical properties of the resin for structural composite materials.  The research approach then examines whether viable and compatible self-repair mechanisms can be incorporated into these systems to mitigate damage, similar to those developed for synthetic epoxy systems.  If successful, the results of this research will provide biorenewable alternatives to petroleum-based resins.  These bio-based thermosets employ substantial amounts of renewable resources which are substantially cheaper than the petroleum-based feedstocks used in conventional composites, suggesting that this technology should have a huge impact economically and environmentally.  In addition, polymeric structural materials are prone to microcracks and the ability to heal them will enable structures with longer lifetimes and less maintenance.  Though the potential benefits are quite high, there are several practical limitations (such as crack healing kinetics, manufacturing limitations, and stability of the healing agent system to environmental conditions) that need to be overcome in order for the benefits to be realized in society.  This research program is a first step in transitioning this technology to biorenewable polymers and overcoming the limitations that plague the current state-of-the-art in self-healing materials. The goals of the project will be realized by actively involving both undergraduate and graduate students in the research process and in the development of an immersive educational video game about bio-renewable and multifunctional polymers, broadening the type of resources currently utilized in polymer science outreach.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1025,"This project investigates the development of a natural antioxidant to be used as a food preservative. Natural antioxidants currently available on the market are usually obtained from plant sources, via extraction or a similar procedure. For instance, natural tocopherols (vitamin E) are refined from vegetable oils such as soybean oil. Other common natural antioxidants used in food industry such as rosemary oil extract are also isolated from plant sources. Extraction and purification procedures for these processes are time consuming and expensive, leading to high price of natural antioxidants. Much less attention has been paid thus far to natural antioxidants extracted from animal tissues. Animal or poultry blood could be of special interest as a potential source of natural antioxidants because of its low cost and broad availability. In addition, erythrocytes present in blood are equipped with an extremely efficient antioxidant  machinery  to protect the cell from continuous exposure to high levels of oxygen. Availability of potent antioxidant activity in erythrocytes prompted us to look into feasibility of commercially viable isolation of antioxidants from these cells. This project has the potential to further advance methods of extraction and characterization of antioxidants from animal/poultry blood and provide better insight on their safety and susceptibility to bacterial contamination. This could also advance knowledge about performance and stability of antioxidants extracted in partially purified form, in a mixture with other blood components.Application of antioxidants increases the shelf life of food products and helps to maintain their healthiness, taste and nutritional value, whether it is used for preservation of animal or human food. The antioxidant developed through this project is a  green  product and responsive to society's demand for naturally derived products and will provide a cost-efficient way to address this demand. Even more broadly, this antioxidant can be used in any products where lipid oxidation has a negative effect on the product quality (e.g., as a preservative human food, and as antioxidant in varnishes, latexes, oil paints, etc.), which can provide markets for this product and further stimulate economic development.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

1028,"Ruminant livestock account for 15 to 33% of world methane production, which contributes 20% of the irradiative force of greenhouse gases causing climate change and global warming.Hence, the long-term goal is to develop practical and sustainable means of minimizing methane emission by ruminant livestock.Previous research with goats at Langston University has shown considerable promise in decreasing ruminal methane emission by feeding the leguminous forage lespedeza and its condensed tannins.But, factors not previously addressed that will receive attention in this project are potential adaptation to tannins and a lessening of methane emission-inhibition with advancing time; effects with sheep than can better serve as a model for cattle; and simultaneous feeding of tannins and other substances that can further decrease ruminal methane emission, namely ionophores and fat sources high in medium chain fatty acids (i.e., coconut oil) and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (i.e., soybean oil). Moreover, the potential of forage tannins to manipulate the rumen microbiome to lessen loss of forage nitrogen into the environment will be evaluated.Experiments with goats and sheep will quantify effects of singular dietary inclusion of lespedeza, an ionophore, and the different fatty acid sources, with variables of ruminal methane emission, forage intake and digestion, and characteristics of ruminal microbes such as in vitro methane production and numbers protozoa and total, cellulolytic, and hyper ammonia producing bacteria.A third study will test mixtures of lespedeza, an ionophore, and fat sources.This research will lead to development of practical and sustainable means of minimizing methane emission by ruminant livestock and marketing of specific feedstuff products targeting particular production settings.Research capacity will be enhanced through upgrading the calorimetry system used to quantify methane emission and characterize energy utilization and improved laboratory capability and training in rumen microbiological techniques for future research in this and related areas.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1029,"As a consequence of climate change, it is predicted that periods of agriculturally significant environmental stress conditions due to high temperatures will occur more frequently by the end of the century. These conditions are expected to pose a significant threat to global agricultural productivity and food security. In the U.S., according to a recent analysis published by the USDA-ERS [21], the widely publicized U.S. drought of 2012, with its associated high temperatures, resulted in heavy agricultural losses with respect to the corn and soybean crops. As a result of drought and high heat, the US maize harvest was nearly 13% smaller in 2012 than in 2011, in sharp contrast with an average 4.8% year-over-year increase in maize harvest size since 1983 [13]. The decreased 2012 maize harvest was blamed for food shortages and increased food prices worldwide; maize varieties with improved heat and drought tolerance will help to minimize such food shortages and price spikes. This complex environmental challenge to agriculture occurs against a background of rising global population and increased demand for the products of high intensity agriculture such as meat and dairy products. To address the current and future challenges to US agriculture, novel technology approaches are needed. Agricultural biotechnology enables the development and deployment of trait solutions in a much shorter time frame than is possible by conventional breeding approaches and is also able to access a much greater amount of genetic diversity than would be otherwise be available for crop improvement.Over the last two decades, first generation biotech traits have helped increase grain yields by protecting crops from insect pests and weeds. Benson Hill Biosystems is focusing on genetic modifications of crops designed to enhance yield potential and contribute to overall yield gains in combination with first generation traits. Environmental stress tolerance traits such as drought tolerance and heat tolerance belong to this trait category. The goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate the expression and efficacy of a heat-tolerance trait in maize resulting in improved yield following high-temperature stress. Maize will be used as the target crop for the project because it represents perhaps the greatest opportunity for the deployment of commercial heat-tolerance traits. Many of the 97 million acres planted with this crop in the US are grown ingeographies that are expected to be adversely impacted by the predicted trend toward higher average temperatures. This project will generate maize lines that will provide improved corn yields in areas where plants are subjected to elevated temperatures, thereby improving the food supply.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

1031,"This is a collaborative project between researchers in Minnesota and Illinois to genetically improve the agronomic traits of Field Pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.; pennycress) for its use as a new winter annual oilseed/meal/cover crop in the Upper Midwest. Pennycress can be double cropped on the same land during the time between the traditional corn harvest and subsequent planting of soybeans the following spring. Pennycress has only recently been isolated from its natural environments throughout the Midwest. Field trials with current isolates have demonstrated that pennycress can be seeded in upper Midwest cornfields in the late summer and fall, at which time the plants begin to grow then overwinter, producing mature seed in the spring that can be harvested without disrupting soybean planting or yields. 2,200 kg/hectare seeds can be produced by wild pennycress varieties, which at 33% by weight oils content, yields 840 liters/hectare oils for biofuels and 1,470 kg/hectare press-cake to be used as a high-protein/high-energy animal feed meal. It has been estimated that pennycress can add approximately $100.00 per acre to a farmer&#39;s income. While pennycress holds much agronomic promise, improved domesticated varieties remain to be developed. Wild pennycress varieties are hampered by inconsistent germination and stand establishment, un-optimized maturity for a given growth zone, suboptimal oils quality for biodiesel production, high seed glucosinolate content, and significant harvest loss due to pod shatter. Domestication of many weeds that are now crops often involved the unintended selection of naturally occurring mutants with improved agronomic characteristics. We will use modern mutation-based breeding strategies to identify lines of pennycress that harbor superior agronomic traits. The lines will be incorporated into our ongoing traditional breeding programs.This research will aid in the generation of elite pennycress varieties having consistent stand establishment, higher yields, and other superior traits, allowing for widespread adoption of pennycress as a winter oilseed/meal/cover crop integrated within corn-soybean rotations throughout the Midwest. Elite pennycress varieties will positively impact the profitability of production agriculture and enhance livestock sector returns. The adoption of pennycress will provided additional ecological benefits such as decreased soil erosion and nutrient runoff, reduced herbicide use for weed control, reduced carbon emissions by replacing fossil fuels with biofuels. Finally, pennycress can increase energy security by diversifying the nation&#39;s energy portfolio, and contribute to the economic health of rural communities.",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Using insights from long-term organic cropping systems experiments, we will establish a new transition-to-organic field experiment at research stations in New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland to test advanced cover crop-based management systems. We will compare cover crop interseeding and rotational no-till strategies to standard organic crop production practices to quantify differences in profitability and ecosystem services including crop performance, soil health, greenhouse gas emissions, weed seed predation, and nectar provisioning for pollinator conservation. Our previous and on-going research suggests that interseeding grass-legume cover crop mixtures into corn and soybean can improve soil health. Moreover, grass-legume cover crop mixtures can self-regulate based on soil nitrogen levels and have potential to reduce nitrous oxide emissions compared to standard cover cropping practices. While it has broader implications for addressing problems with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water quality, this project is organic farmer-focused and builds on stakeholder interest in diverse cover crop mixtures and interseeding cover crops using aerial applicators and spinner spreaders at layby cultivation.

1037,"Aquaculture is the fastest growing segment in U.S. food production, and in 2011 NOAA estimated that the U.S. aquaculture industry was worth $1.2 billion. The FAO estimates that aquaculture will soon overtake captured fisheries as a source of food fish. The rapid global expansion of aquaculture has led to a corresponding increase in demand for fish meal protein, the primary ingredient in aquaculture feeds. Meanwhile, the harvest of species used to produce fish meal has been on a steady decline over the last decade due to the same over-exploitation that has impacted fish/shellfish production. These trends are unsustainable, as aquaculture will soon consume the entire fish meal resource. This is reflected in the rapid escalation of fish meal prices (exceeding $2,000/MT in some cases) which are already affecting the profitability of aquaculture operations. Adding to this problem are competing uses for fish meal in other livestock and companion animal feeds. Consequently, there is a significant market opportunity for a high quality, economical plant protein concentrate to replace fish meal in aquaculture and other feed markets.Distillers&#39; dried grains with solubles (DDGS) has been tested as a partial replacement for fish meal, however the relatively low protein content and less than desirable amino acid profile have limited inclusion rates to low levels. In our Phase I study, Prairie AquaTech showed that our High Protein DDGS (HP-DDGS) performed substantially better in relative growth performance compared to unconverted DDG. Recent modifications to our microbial conversion process resulted in enhanced HP-DDGS protein levels that we expect will result in growth performance metrics more comparable to fish meal. This Phase II project will further develop and commercialize this innovative process through the following objectives:&bull; Optimize the HP-DDGS production process, and scale-up to the pilot scale level;&bull; Test the resultant HP-DDGS as a replacement for fish meal in grower diets;&bull; Validate process costs and energy requirements for the pilot scale system; and&bull; Complete initial steps for commercial scale-up and deployment.This will involve the coordinated efforts of our experienced team of scientists, engineers, and business development specialists whose comparable work to develop a high protein soybean meal replacement for fish meal (PisciZyme&trade;) has already received national awards and is transitioning through an NSF SBIR Phase II award into commercialization.Commercial deployment of the proposed HP-DDGS product will further increase the availability of plant-based proteins as direct replacements for animal-based proteins, which are costly, over-exploited, and generally unsustainable. This technology will also bring more value to and higher use of the chief by-product of U.S. corn ethanol production, of which one third is currently exported. This innovation will increase U.S. food supply security by providing domestic aquaculture producers with a lower cost and more sustainable replacement for imported fishmeal, while increasing their economic competitiveness.

1046,"The United States, led by the USDA (as well as the Department of Energy) has taken major initiatives to develop renewable energy sources. Development of these renewable energy sources is desirable based on (1) reduced production of greenhouse gases and (2) reduced dependence on the volatile supply of oil from abroad. One of the cornerstones of renewable energy is biofuels and more specifically biodiesel. While the concept of using high quality feedstocks such as vegetable oil as feeds for manufacture of biodiesel is interesting, there have been significant problems. These problems include the relatively high cost of quality feedstocks such as soybean oil, and independently relatively low prices for petroleum based diesel. Low-quality feedstocks such as waste greases and inedible tallow are available at much lower price compared to that of high quality feedstocks. Also, newly developed potentially low cost algae oil typically has higher levels of free fatty acid. However, because of their higher free fatty acid content, low-quality feedstocks are less suitable for biodiesel production.Compact Membrane Systems, Inc. (CMS) has identified a novel membrane separation process to reduce the feed fatty acid content of low-quality feedstocks. This novel membrane separation process will be extremely energy and capital cost efficient compared to other low-quality feedstock pre-treatment technologies. These cost savings offer significant improvement in overall economics of biodiesel production. Because of these improved economics, biodiesel will likely be competitive with the fossil fuels.In the current program, CMS will demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of reducing the free fatty acid content of low-quality feedstocks. Influence of various operating parameters on the membrane separation performance will be studied. Chemical stability and anti-fouling tendency of the proposed membranes will also be studied to demonstrate the long-term performance.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

1049,"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a microbial process to economically upgrade distillers&#39; dried grains with solubles (DDGS) into an omega-3 enhanced DDGS (Omega-3 DDGS) to replace essential fatty acids found in fish oil commonly used in aquaculture diets. This Omega-3 DDGS will also provide highly digestible microbial and plant proteins. The aquaculture industry has grown at a 9% rate for the past decade due to increased demand for fish protein and reduced capture of wild fish. Both fish oil and fish meal are key ingredients in aquaculture feeds, but unfortunately their production from wild-caught fishes cannot meet worldwide feedstuff demand. The limited availability and high prices of fish oil and meal have increased aquaculture feed costs, reduced profitability, and thus limited expansion of the U.S. aquaculture industry. There is a significant market opportunity for more sustainable replacements for fish oil and meal. Through prior NSF SBIR funding, Prairie AquaTech has developed a micro-fungal process to convert soybean meal (SBM) into a high protein product (marketed as PisciZyme) that is successfully replacing fish meal in pilot and commercial scale trials. A USDA SBIR grant to convert DDGS into a fish meal replacement is underway.To replace fish oil Prairie AquaTech proposes to convert 1) sugars and glycerol in distillers&#39; grains to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and protein using Schizochytrium limacinum, and 2) sugars, organic acids, and glycerol in condensed corn solubles to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and protein using Pythium irregulare. Phase I objectives will include generating sufficient quantities of Omega-3 DDGS for digestibility and feeding trials with yellow perch (Perca flavescens) to assess technical and economic feasibility. The first generation Omega-3 DDGS is anticipated to have &gt;1.5% of both DHA and EPA, and &gt;45% protein, while providing desirable fish growth rates and conversion efficiencies at &gt;30% fish oil replacement levels. Phase II will further optimize the Omega-3 DDGS production process, targeting &gt;3% of both DHA and EPA, and &gt;50% protein. Pending Phase I results we will also test the Omega-3 DDGS product in other commercially important food fishes, validate process costs and energy requirements, and complete initial steps for scale-up and commercialization (including AAFCO approvals).The Prairie AquaTech value proposition is that our microbial technologies will generate low cost, highly digestible aquaculture feeds from sustainable plant-based coproducts. Preliminary work has documented that DDGS fractions can be efficiently converted into DHA and EPA. This Phase I proposal will demonstrate commercial feasibility. Omega-3 DDGS production costs are estimated at $400-450/ton, compared to fish oil at $1,760-2,440/ton. Existing technologies cannot offer a DHA, EPA, and protein enhanced feedstuff at this price. Fish oil alternatives, such as flax oil (lacks DHA and EPA) and photosynthetic algal oil (high production and recovery costs), have proven impractical. Our primary target audience will be aquaculture producers (eg. Bell Aquaculture and Clear Springs), feed manufacturers (eg. Purina, Zeigler, Skretting), and corn processors. Each will benefit from the conversion of low-value corn ethanol coproducts into high value aquaculture feedstuffs. Prairie AquaTech&#39;s economical and sustainable source of DHA, EPA, and protein will encourage growth of domestic aquaculture operations to help meet USDA&#39;s strategic goals related to agricultural development and food security.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

Considerable variation of phenotypes is observed in both transgenically modified and mutagenized crops. We propose to investigate the effects on soybean seed composition and gene expression encountered by these two methods. Specifically, the level of expression of an inserted cassette, GFP-HDEL, will be assessed across 100 independently produced transgenic soybean lines and related to copy number, genome insertion site as well as the protein/ oil content. In parallel, a stable GFP-HDEL transgenic soybean line will be subjected to chemical mutagenesis generating 100 mutagenized lines showing altered GFP expression subsequently analyzed for protein/oil content. Overall the lines generated by either approach will be compared for GFP expression and collateral phenotypic alterations in protein/ oil seed content by NMR analysis. Lines from either treatment deemed to have the most altered protein/oil content by NMR will be further investigated by extensive proteomic analysis (2D gels) and oil compositional analysis (lipidomics profiling). Through these parallel approaches we will test the range of seed phenotypic variation that can be produced from transgenics or mutagenesis that will yield data to establish the comparative improvement potential in soybean using these approaches.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

We will study weed management in organic row crop systems utilizing crop rotation, no-till practices, cover crops, and mechanical and thermal between-row control. The novel weed control methods of between-row mowing and mechanical weed pulling will be investigated.

Outcomes of this research include identification of alternative practices for weed control that will eliminate or reduce soil tillage in organic grain crop systems. Outreach will be through field days, grower meetings, conferences, and written materials.

1054,"Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) can cause drastic yield reductions in soybeans in Indiana and the rest of the North Central region of the U.S. SCN is known to occur in many Indiana properties, representing at least 88 counties, on both light and heavy soils. Yield losses to SCN in Indiana for any given year are influenced by environmental stresses, but losses of 50% are not uncommon.The use of resistant varieties for all areas of Indiana is the most economical and environmentally safe way to manage this serious pest.An ongoing project is to monitor changes in the Hg-types of SCN in fields where soybean varieties with the predominant SCN resistance source (PI88788) has been grown to see whether correlations exist between numbers of SCN field populations that can overcome PI88788 resistance and the length of time these resistant varieties have been used. The relationships among soybean resistance type, SCN, and the plant disease Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS) are also in need of further study. We are placing increasing emphasis on study of plant parasitic corn nematodes in different locations in Indiana, mainly on seed treatments for management of plant parasitic nematodes on both corn. We continue our molecular study of plant parasitic cyst nematodes, with a goal of determining whether mtCO1 molecular barcode data can be obtained that will mirror the evolutionary relationships we have determined using ribosomal DNA data for the economically important plant parasitic cyst nematodes. We are also involved in molecular barcode investigations of insects, particularly Coleoptera in the hardwood forests of Indiana where relationships exist between forest productivity and pest and benign woodborer beetles in the family Cerambycidae; and where potential harmful effects of newly introduced species may be predicted by evolutionary relationships revealed by our molecular data.

1056,"Innovation activity is a critical element of business conduct affecting the competitiveness of firms, technological progress, productivity growth, and social welfare. The development of genetically-modified (GM) products and their subsequent introduction into the food system about a decade ago, represents one of the most significant innovations in the agri-food system. It has also been a highly controversial one. While agricultural producers have responded to the agronomic benefits associated with the producer-oriented, first generation of GM products and have been adopting GM crops in increasing numbers, consumers around the world have expressed an aversion to food products containing GM ingredients. Consumer opposition to GM products varies significantly both between and within countries and is founded on health, environmental, ethical and/or philosophical concerns about agricultural biotechnology. Similarly diverse have been the countriesAE regulatory responses to GMproducts with the issue of labeling being a focal point in policy forums around the world. For instance, while the US opposes the labeling of GM products arguing the osubstantial equivalenceo between the current, producer-oriented GM products and their conventional counterparts, the European Union has introduced mandatory labeling of GM products on the basis of its oprecautionary principleo and the expressed consumer aversion to these products. In addition to shaping the regulation of products of biotechnology, the vocal consumer opposition to the first-generation GM products has hurt the prospects of agricultural biotechnology and resulted in efforts by life science companies to develop consumer-oriented, second-generation GM products with augmented functional properties. While many of these consumer-oriented GM products are close to their commercialization stage, the economic ramifications of this shift in the focus of agricultural biotechnology and the subsequent introduction ofconsumer-oriented GM products into the food system have not been examined previously. The goal of this project is to systematically analyze the market and welfare impacts of the introduction of new GM products into the agri-food marketing system, examine the economic ramifications of different regulatory and labeling standards, and determine the impact of cooperatives on product and process innovation activity. The proposed research is of particular importance for the US where: (i) 89% of last yearAEs soybean crop and 61% of last yearAEs corn plantings were of biotech varieties that are resistant to a popular herbicide or insect pests (the relevant figures for the state of Nebraska were 90% and 76% for soybeans and corn, respectively), (ii) innovation activity attracts significant resources, equivalent to 10.14% of Agricultural GDP in 1998, and (iii) cooperatives account for 25% to 30% of total farm supply and marketing expenditures.

1058,"Over the last decade, our research laboratory has been very successful in identifying and mapping molecular markers associated with resistance to important quality traits in snap beans including calcium and sugar concentrations as well as disease resistance, including Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, and Aphanomyces euteiches. We have used quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping information to facilitate introgression and pyramid genes for favorable disease resistance and quality traits in snap beans. The consistent limitation has been that our linkage maps, though extensive, are based on marker systems (i.e. RAPDs) that do not allow ready communication to other mapped bean populations or comparisons to the genomes of other species of Fabaceae. The cooperative Bean CAP project provides not only sequence information but also the tagged SNP markers that will allow us to communicate and compare our results not only with other bean populations but also throughout the Fabaceae and even allow for potential gene discovery with Arabidopsis or maize. Common bean is 2n=2x=22 and soybean is 2n=2x=40 and both are members of the family Fabaceae. In early macrosyntentic level studies, genome comparisons of soybean, common bean, and mung bean determined that common bean shares a large synteny with soybean. The doubling the chromosome number in Glycine max is due to genome duplication followed by rearrangements leading to diploidization. In addition to soybean, genes in other Fabaceae including alfalfa, may also be present in common bean, and will likely map to a similar genomic position relative to other genes. The objective of our HATCH proposal is to take advantage of our extensive years of research and collection of field and molecular-based data and utilize it to connect to the genomic databases to enhance gene discovery and utilize this knowledge to develop improved snap bean cultivars with enhanced disease resistance, better adaptation to sustainable production and improved flavor and nutritional value.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1059,"The demand for fresh produce is greater than ever due to changes in eating preferences of consumers in industrialized nations. Increased consumption of raw fruits, salads and sprouts led to an increased number of reported illnesses due to contaminated produce. In the United States, bacterial pathogens are the major contributors to food-borne illness caused by fresh produce. In outbreaks caused by bacterial pathogens, Salmonella enterica is most frequently involved, accounting for nearly half of the outbreaks. To date, very little is known about the plant determinants that allow or facilitate the surface or internal colonization of crops. The goal of our research is to gain a better understanding on the plant responses to human enteric pathogens. To address these issues, we propose to use Medicago truncatula as a model plant and alfalfa and soybean as target crops. Our specific aims are to: 1. Identify Salmonella genes that contribute to the survival of these bacteria in the environments and to the colonization of legume sprouts. 2. Characterize plant genes regulated by Salmonella colonization. 3. Identify genetic loci of Medicago truncatula that control the colonization by Salmonella. Medicago, alfalfa and soybean plants will be infected with Salmonella and the colonization level will be evaluated. Likewise, the survival of Salmonella strains will be monitored under different environmental conditions. We will assess the effect of different plant compounds on Salmonella colonization. These experiments will allow us to identify genetic and environmental factors that affect the colonization of crop tissues by these human pathogens. For objective 2, we will identify plant genes that are regulated specifically by Salmonella colonization. To understand the biological role of these genes, their expression will be decreased or increased in Medicago plants. Medicago plants with modified expression of these genes will be infected with Salmonella and the colonization levels will be tested as described previously. With these experiments, we are expecting to better understand how legume sprouts respond to Salmonella colonization. For objective 3, based on the genes identified in objective 2, we will develop reporter constructs that get activated specifically under colonization by Salmonella. This will allow us to detect more easily the presence of Salmonella in plant tissues for genetic research but also for practical purposes. Transgenic plants expressing these reporters will be mutagenized and mutants will be analyzed by classical genetics to identify plant loci that control Salmonella colonization. We expect to generate the following outputs: 1. Better knowledge on the response of crops to Salmonella colonization and on the role of stress responses in Salmonella during plant colonization; 2. Identification of plant reporters, which will allow detecting more easily and more specifically plants infected or contaminated with Salmonella; 3.

This diversity of target of species will allow us to examine and compare small RNAs across species to identify commonalities and differences. We are particularly interested in a class of small RNAs known as 'phased siRNAs' because they have unique gene regulatory roles, and can be mobile within the plant. Small RNAs are known to have key roles in plant development and responses to stress, and thus their activities can be useful markers to characterize germplasm diversity and it's response to stress conditions. These small RNAs may regulate other genes during the response to these important stresses or developmental patterns. We postulate that some of these small RNAs will be conserved in plant species, and we will test this hypothesis by evaluating several examples from the NPGS using standard techniques.

1063,"Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) or white mold of soybean is caused by the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. In the temperate north central soybean production areas of the United States, SSR can be a significant yield limiting disease. In a recent survey of attendees at the University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension Pest Management Update Meetings attendees were asked what diseases resulted in the most significant yield loss of soybean in Wisconsin. Sclerotinia stem rot ranked first. In subsequent questions on the same surveys, attendees were asked to indicate which management strategies were most useful to control diseases of the various crops they planted. For soybean, the highest-ranking management strategy was crop rotation followed by the use of resistant varieties. Additionally, the respondents were asked to indicate what field crops pathology research and extension focus areas were most important for them over the next five years. The top ranking research/extension area was the development of disease resistant varieties. Also ranking high was the development and validation of disease forecasting systems. Considering the perceived importance of SSR and the desire for new disease resistant soybean varieties and disease forecasting systems, new research should focus on improving SSR resistance in soybean breeding lines that are also resistant to other significant diseases and that can be integrated into management systems that include technology such as SSR forecasting. Several fungicide application decision tools have been developed for controlling S. sclerotiorum in other crops such as canola and carrot. Adoption of such forecasting systems has been variable due to several circumstances including the ability to deliver weather variable information in a timely manner, limited availability of effective fungicides, and variability in the models used. Delivery of timely weather information is becoming much easier with the increasing use of the Internet and smart phone technology. In soybean, many new fungicides are being labeled to control SSR. The soybean/SSR pathosystem is a good candidate for the development of an effective fungicide application advisory system. Accurately predicting apothecial development at the R1 growth stage would enable more timely application of effective fungicides to control SSR. The role of moisture and temperature in the development S. sclerotiorum apothecia has been studied. Carpogenic germination and development of apothecia from sclerotia is generally favored by wet soil. Carpogenic germination and apothecial development can occur at a wide range of temperatures. Sun and Yang found that light influenced temperature and moisture requirements for apothecium development in S. sclerotiorum. At low-light intensity, optimal temperature for apothecial development ranged from 12-18&deg;C. Under the high light regime optimal temperature for apothecial development was 20&deg;C. In addition, light can also effect the moisture requirement for apothecial development. Sun and Yang found that at low light intensity and at 25&deg;C, a lower moisture level of sand resulted in the highest number of apothecia. Under high light intensity, high moisture levels were required for apothecial production. Sun and Yang concluded that if soil was relatively dry and light intensity high, little apothecial development would be expected. Additionally, high moisture would be required before canopy closure for apothecial development and after canopy closure soil moisture is of little importance because of reduced light. Light quality was also found to be important for apothecial development. Wavelengths of light below 390 nm (specifically 276 to 319 nm) have been shown to be required for normal apothecial development. More research should be conducted on light and the interaction of other environmental variables on the formation of apothecia of S. sclerotiorum. This information may be critical in the development of a reliable SSR prediction system to be used to advise fungicide application in soybean.

Given our incomplete understanding of the aphid salivary-gland secretome, the goal of further identifying proteins and enzymes of aphid saliva will be central in our research. Obj B: The Russian Wheat Aphid (RWA) exists in biotypes which differ in the ability to feed on cultivars of wheat and barley. These differences may lie in the proteins/enzymes of saliva, allowing individuals of a given biotype to feed or be unable to feed on a given cultivar. Understanding biotype differences in proteins of saliva could lead new approaches to lessening the agricultural impact of RWA by genetic engineering of wheat and barley. The biotypes of most importance in the US are RWA1 and RWA2, and they have strikingly different abilities to feed on various cultivars of grains. Obj C: Of the various proteins/enzymes that have been identified, protein C002 is the one for which there is the clearest evidence of a required role in aphid feeding on a host plant. We provided the initial evidence, largely through a combination of transcript-knockdown by injection of dsRNA and electrophysiological studies. Knockdown of the C002 transcript resulted in early death of the aphids and a lack of feeding. Other researchers have provided different evidence that supports a role of protein C002 as an effector in aphid feeding on plant tissue. We have shown C002 knockdown has no effect on feeding by pea aphids on artificial diet. It appears that protein C002 is involved with the interaction of the aphid with the plant, and in particular in establishing or maintaining prolonged contact with the sieve element and the phloem sap. Obj D: We have found that levels of transcripts of proteins of pea aphid saliva increase up to 30-fold when aphids are moved from artificial liquid diet to a host plant. Only some of these changes are observed when the aphids are placed on a non-host soybean. Measuring changes in levels of transcripts that encode proteins/enzymes of saliva appears promising as a means of determining the roles played by the proteins now believed to occur in aphid saliva and the different classes of proteins of saliva. We will investigate the Russian Wheat Aphid, where the existence of biotypes provides a beautiful experimental system and an opportunity to gain insight into the mechanisms by which ability to feed on a cultivar of wheat is established. Obj E: The only aphid for which a genome sequence has been reported is the pea aphid. Efforts are underway now on the green peach aphid genome. Undertaking a genome sequencing project on the RWA is also important, given the agricultural impact of this aphid and the existence of RWA biotypes.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
1069,"Soybean and wheat play a crucial role in the South Dakota&#39;s economy, however, plant diseases are one of the major biostresses that negatively impact crop yield. Among the major diseases of soybeans in South Dakota, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines)and the Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) are the most common. SCN is particularly a problem in South Dakota because it is relatively new and growers are either not aware or because of the absence of visual SCN foliar symptoms, growers don&#39;t consider SCN as a problem. Bean pod mottle virus is disseminated primarily by bean leaf beetles (BLB)and the overwintering and first summer BLB generations are the most important in the spread of BPMV. Lack of pre-plant overwintering BLB population prediction makes it difficult for growers to decide on insecticide seed treatment.In wheat, Fusarium head blight and leaf spot diseases cause significant yield reductions annually. Use of fungicide as a management tool for wheat fungal diseases has been increasing in South Dakota. However, most fungicide applications follow calendar sprays (for instance tank mix with herbicide application), irrespective of the disease intensity. This is in part due to lack of informationon effectiveness of timely application of fungicidein the management of fungaldiseases as well aslack reliable prediction of the likely risk ofplant diseaseepidemic development.Determining the occurrence and distribution of Heterodera glycines (HG) types present in South Dakota and continued sensitizationof the soybean growers on importance and management of SCN is crucial for increased soybean yield as well limiting SCN resistance development. Use of plant disease prediction tools can go a long way in limiting pesticide usage and ensuring a timely and effective pesticide application. The major focus of this research is determining HG types distribution and occurrence in South Dakota, validating the prediction tools for Fusarium head blight and bean leaf beetle winter mortality, and determining the effectiveness variousfungicide timings in controlling fungal pathogens in wheat..

1070,"The main focus of this project is innovative ideas for a variety of new products and processes described below from North Dakota&#39;s agricultural commodities, especially sugar beets, soybeans, canola and sunflower. These products and processes add significant value to those commodities, create new opportunities for business and employment, and address the needs of the world for safe food and a sustainable style of life. These products and processes are first tested at the bench-scale. If bench-scale tests are encouraging, the next step towards commercialization is a pilot scale test. Bench-scale typically implies product quantities of a few grams to several hundred grams per day, while pilot scale implies product quantities on the order of one kilogram or more (there may be overlap in these ranges, depending upon a number of factors such as the complexity of the process and value of the product). Bench-scale processes are unable to produce sufficient quantities for industry evaluation. Steps that are taken for granted in bench-scale processes, such as separation and refining steps, may pose formidable challenges at larger scale; evaluation at the pilot scale provides a more realistic evaluation of technical feasibility, overcomes hurdles that arise at larger scale, and results in more accurate predictions of the costs of industry scale processes. The NDSU Pilot Plant Laboratory was established in the early 1990s for just this purpose. Agricultural commodities, like all biological materials, inherently show much variability in physical and chemical characteristics. Variability in a raw material or  feedstock  will likely affect the process and/or product quality. Meanwhile, crop breeders are targeting new varieties with significant enhancements to important characteristics, such as yield and/or yield quality, the content of valuable components that present new opportunities for processing. Thus, methods are needed to rapidly quantify important characteristics of those commodities during scale up. Yet another issue during scale up is the storage of the feedstock for processing; the storage conditions must retain valuable characteristics of the feedstock at an affordable cost. The anticipated outcome of this project is that technical hurdles that impede the development of selected new products and processes will be identified and overcome. In some cases, demonstration of scaled up storage and processes will help guide decisions on commercialization; commercialization would, of course, be the best indicator of success of the project. However, technical presentations and peer-reviewed journal articles generated from these scale-up activities are also important indicators.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

In addition, corn is grown in most counties in New York either by grain crop producers, dairy producers, vegetable producers, or all three types of producers. Consequently, there are more corn growers in New York than growers of any other crop.

1072,"Corn and soybeans represent important crops in the state of Minnesota. With yield levels increasing at a steady pace, corn and soybean producers are constantly scrutinizing fertilizer rate guidelines as inadequate for the current varieties or hybrids planted. With cash rent prices increasing and more acres rented, farmers are managing owned and rented land differently in order to keep their enterprises profitable. The current fertilizer guidelines for the state of Minnesota were developed at least 20 years ago and are highly prescriptive when it comes to application rates. With an increased emphasis on best management practices due to water quality concerns for phosphorus, there is increased interest on limiting application rates to University guidelines. These guidelines need to be updated to accommodate current management practices like whole field fertilizer application strategies. Variable rate application is based on the predicated response to nutrient application. Minnesota research in the past five years found that corn and soybean yields could potentially be increased by 20 bushels per acre through grid sampling when low testing areas of phosphorus can be accurately identified. Soil test data, when properly correlated and calibrated provides a risk assessment for determining the relative sufficiency of a nutrient at a given soil test level, it is important to identify those risk areas. The probability of response to a nutrient and the average magnitude of that response are important in defining the relative risks associated with under and over application of fertilizer. Simple correlation and calibration studies of soil tests for phosphorus and potassium are critical to provide this type of information and to ensure data is up to date for use in fertilizer guidelines. Soil testing is the cornerstone of nutrient guidelines in Minnesota. Currently two tests, the Bray-P1 and Olsen, are recommended for phosphorus and one test for potassium, the ammonium acetate test. In neighboring states, the Mehlich-3 test is recommended to determine of both phosphorus and potassium needs for crops and also is preferred by some regulating agencies because it can be used to extract multiple elements at one time from a single sample. Past work with this test has shown it to perform poorly for extracting phosphorus in soils high in calcium carbonate in western Minnesota. There needs to be a better justification for or against using the Mehlich-3 test in the state of Minnesota. While it has been previously researched, past data are not readily available and questions have been more common on use of the Mehlich-3 test. Studying situations where the Mehlich-3 test will and will not work to assess the P sufficiency of crops is critical in determining whether it is used should it be recommended for assessing potential environmental impacts from nutrient applications. Questions have been raised about the effect of drying samples on the amount of potassium extracted using the ammonium acetate or Mehlich-3 test methods. When there is a difference between dry and wet samples, dried samples can test lower, higher, or similar in potassium concentration depending on the soil type and field conditions when the samples were taken. Since potassium is not thought of as a major pollutant to surface and groundwater, the concerns are with soils that will release potassium upon drying. This would results in a high soil test for potassium when in fact the soil may be low that could result in under application of fertilizer and a reduction in grain yield. Currently, we have limited understanding if drying Minnesota soils before testing is leading to incorrect assessment of potassium availability and on what soils there may be a greater concern. Since the analysis of potassium on moist samples is a completely different test and not a standard practice for most labs, there needs to be hard evidence as to the scope of the problem before this test is suggested for widespread use in certified commercial soil testing labs in Minnesota. However, data that supports the use of testing potassium on moist samples is from north-central Iowa with similar soil series and conditions as those in south-central and central Minnesota. If the issue is related to drainage, this problem also may be found in the western and northwestern regions of the state. In addition, with the extreme variability in weather patterns the past two years we have little understanding of the effects of dry weather conditions on soil test potassium levels and how this may also affect the test on field moist versus air dried samples. With the number of questions that crop producers, consultants, and fertilizer retailers have on this issue research comparing the two tests needs to be conducted so we can make a definitive conclusion on whether the moist test should be recommended for use as it is a major change to the current guidelines.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1073,"The delta region of Arkansas is highly diversified in production systems with major crops being rice, cotton, corn, wheat, and soybeans. Of the applied nutrients, nitrogen is one of the most widely used. It is required to optimize productivity but is also becoming a greater concern in respect to ground and surface water quality. Changes in management inputs within crop production systems may be altered to increase the efficiency of use and the subsequent potential loss of nitrogen to the environment. The potential of nitrate leaching has not been fully evaluated within the delta of Arkansas. The development of tools to assist growers in decision making is important.

US soybean production is also largely influenced by drought since more than 85% of soybean is produced by rain-fed farming. In Virginia, soybean is a major field crop (580,000 acres in 2012), but its productivity has been negatively affected by various environmental stresses including drought and flooding. Despite the economic impact of water-related stress in the major legume, fundamental mechanisms that regulate submergence and drought tolerance are largely unknown, presumably because the entire genome sequence and molecular tools were not available until recently. As a postdoctoral researcher, Takeshi Fukao led the USDA-NIFA-funded Sub1 Rice Project (2003-2012) exploring the mechanisms of submergence and drought tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) with Prof. Julia Bailey-Serres at UC Riverside. Fukao has successfully adapted molecular protocols established in Arabidopsis for rice research and characterized the master regulator of submergence tolerance, SUBMERGENCE-1A (SUB1A), at physiological, molecular, and genomic levels (Fukao et al., 2006; Fukao and Bailey-Serres, 2008; Fukao et al., 2009; Fukao et al., 2011; Fukao et al., 2012). In this project, his advanced understanding of stress survival strategies in rice and Arabidopsis will be applied to increase the adaptability of soybean to extremes in precipitation under changing climate conditions. His ultimate goal is systematic elucidation of the intricate regulatory networks that govern adaptation and tolerance to an excess and insufficiency of water in the major legume species, aiding to enhance submergence and drought tolerance in commercially important soybean varieties in Virginia and other states.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
1077,"Plant diseases account for significant losses in production agricutlure directly through reduction in yield quality and quantit. In North Carolina, cucurbits, wheat, corn and blueberry are some of the most economically important vegetable and field crops. Stagonospora nodorum is among the key diseases that affect wheat in the US. This disease has become more common due to no-till wheat production, and particularly where wheat is double-cropped with soybeans. Downy mildewof cucurbits spread rapidly throughout North Carolina causing major losses in the spring crop and near total loss in the summer crop and many fields were abandoned without harvesting and suffered 100% loss. Aspergillus ear rot (Aspergillus flavus) of corn have become increasingly important due to losses associated with quality reduction due to mycotoxin contamination in harvested grains. One approach to increase the effectiveness of the disease control options is through the application of epidemiological principles to guide disease management strategies. Due to the lack of resistant varieties, growers frequently apply fungicide to control SNB in epidemic years with no form of decision support system to facilitate such applications. Although fungicides can be effective disease in managing the disease in epidemic years, the cost can be economically prohibitive when the price of wheat is low. Fungicides also have a negative impact on the environmnt and beneficial microorganisms. There are knowledge gaps in the utility of pre-planting factors in assessing the risk of SNB during the season to reduce fungicide applications. Currently, forecasts of cucurbit downy are provide in the US to guide the first spray but the within-season risk assessment to guide subsquent sprays has not yet been established.Further, due to the uncertainty in the initial sources of inoculum, there is a need to quantify the regional patterns of temporal increase and spatial spread of CDM. Knowledge on the early temporal and spatial spread is important to be able to predict future spread and potential damage of CDM. The recent resurgence of the disease also points towards a &#39;new&#39; pathogen population that has yet to be determined.Developing a forecast system to predict the carpogenic germination of M. vaccinii-corymbosi pseudosclerotia require detailed knowledge of the effect of important environmental factors on this process. This will allow growers to time fungicide application to coincide with when a majority of mummies are likely to germinate.

1078,"Polymeric materials like rubber, resin, polyester and plastic are used widely in commodity and specialty products ranging from grocery bags to electronics. High consumption rates (estimated at 300lbs/capita) and environmental concerns over accumulation of petrochemical derived plastics have highlighted the need for exploring biocompatible materials from renewable resources. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) are produced by microbes under defined growth conditions. PHAs possess properties similar to thermoplastics like polypropylene and can be made elastomeric, but have the advantage of being biodegradable by microbial hydrolases and depolymerases. They can also be used in blends or as replacements for petrochemical polymers. Currently, sugars from corn are used for most biodegradable plastic production. However, limitations in corn yield and committed uses as food and feed point to the need for less expensive non-food sugar feedstocks. Researchers have investigated substrates like beet molasses, cheese whey, and soy residue, but found PHA yields to be uneconomical.

1079,"Soybean acreage has increased each year in Arkansas for the last several years. The popularity of soybean in the state is likely related to many factors including the current market value of the commodity, the availability of high-yielding cultivars, and a decline in popularity of cotton due to marginally profitable prices and increasing input costs. Although maturity group (MG) IV and V cultivars are the most popular among Arkansas growers, it is possible to grow cultivars ranging in maturity from MG III to MG VI, depending on location, soil type, and planting date. A major limiting factor in sustaining high yields has been the presence of several economically significant fungal pathogens and plant-parasitic nematodes statewide. Foliar diseases such as frogeye leaf spot, aerial blight, and Cercospora leaf blight occur almost every year somewhere in the state, depending on environmental conditions. In addition, southern stem canker, sudden death syndrome, and charcoal rot are frequently encountered on a more site-specific basis, as are plant-parasitic nematodes. While the incidence and economic significance of the soybean cyst nematode appears to be declining statewide, two emerging problems, particularly in regions of the state with a history of cotton monoculture, are root-knot and reniform nematodes. Regardless of the disease, Arkansas soybeans are at risk every year to pathogen-induced yield and quality losses. Management of these diseases will require integrated strategies that include the effective deployment of resistant cultivars where genetic resistance is available, crop rotation to minimize initial population densities, and fungicide or nematicide application in some cases.

The threat to groundwater and surface waters is well recognized and understood; the threat to air quality is more poorly recognized but no less real. Nitrogen trace gases can significantly affect regional / global climate over long time scales, as can other trace gases such as methane. Agricultural landscapes may play a critical role in global balances of these greenhouse gases, and the inclusion of perennial biofuel crops in the landscape may represent a mitigation option. Our research is showing that crop management can significantly affect nitrous oxide (N2O) production and methane (CH4) consumption in Michigan corn-soybean-wheat rotations. Importantly, low-input management strategies do not necessarily affect gas fluxes less than high-input management - in fact, systems in which leguminous cover crops substitute for inorganic fertilizers can have higher N2O fluxes, and similar CH4 fluxes. Specific modern management practices in general may, however, have less of a long-term impact than the simple historical effect of original land-use conversion. This means that the transient seasonal fluxes of gases from row-crops may occur on top of a baseline flux that is already elevated due to original forest clearing and, in highly productive systems, is since supported by high cycling rates of added organic and/or inorganic nitrogen. Because of the importance of these gas fluxes to global climate change, and the potential for changes in environmental policy and emerging biofuel markets that could affect future crop management potentials (IPCC 2007, Robertson et al. 2008, 2011), it is important to better understand the nature of elevated fluxes in row-crops - from the standpoints of both long-term legacies related to land use change as well as contemporary management impacts.

In North Carolina, rainfall in particular is highly variable from year to year and location to location. Climatologists have determined that the El Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has significant effects on weather patterns in the Southeast. Although it seems strange that sea surface temperatures in a particular region of the Pacific Ocean can affect weather in the Southeast, studies have indeed shown differences in precipitation and temperature patterns related to ENSO phase. Soybean, corn, cotton, and peanut yields across the Southeast tend to be lower than average in El Ni&ntilde;o years, and higher in La Ni&ntilde;a years. Since field experiments are expensive, research studies on climatic, environmental, and management impacts on crop growth and yield are of necessity limited to only a few locations, years, cultivars, soils, and management strategies. One common approach to extrapolating these results to other locations and time periods is to simulate crop growth under different conditions using historical weather data and a crop growth model that has been tested and found appropriate for use in the geographical area of interest. In this project we will adapt and evaluate existing soybean, peanut, and cotton growth models for use under North Carolina conditions. We will also develop a new, simpler model that will allow us to compare alternative ways of modeling important processes.

However, this treatment is controversial since the amount of protein that delays disease progression while meeting protein requirements has not been defined (Levey et al., 1999). This has led to interest in investigating the source rather than the amount of protein on PKD. Dietary soy protein has been shown to have renal protective effects in animal models of PKD (Davis et al., 2001). Similar to the dietary n-3 PUFA studies, results have been inconsistent, mechanisms of action are not understood, and safety studies have not been conducted. To our knowledge no studies have investigated the effects of dietary n-3 PUFA or soy protein on PKD complications of liver cysts and bone loss. Therefore, objective of the proposed research project is to investigate diet components alone or in combination that will reduce kidney cysts and alleviate related disease complications of liver cysts while producing the fewest side effects. A better understanding of the role of nutrition on PKD will contribute to the development of dietary recommendations and diet-based therapies to reduce PKD progression and severity.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
1090,"Soybean production is increasing to meet the world demand for protein amid dwindling food supplies. Since 2009, the US has produced over 3 billion bushels of soybeans, generating $32 billion in production value. However, various native and invasive insect pests whose distributions are rapidly expanding and adapting to management practices threaten soybean yield and quality. In the short-term, loss of current highly effective management tactics due to expanding pest complexes is increasing producer costs. In the long-term, the establishment of invasive insect pests will continue to impact soybean ecosystems, including interactions with native pests and the biological control offered by various natural enemies. To address these concerns, coordinated research and extension delivery are necessary to rapidly understand native and invasive pest biology, develop best management practices, and deliver recommendations to soybean producers. More specifically, this project will cooperate with others involved in this multi-state project to document insect losses, study pest behavior and injury to soybean, evaluate management strategies, and communicate these results with the consultants and growers making soybean production decisions so that economic losses to insects and environmental impact of management practices can be minimized.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In 2011 alone, a year characterized by excessive flooding, monetary losses for corn and soybean production in the Midwest were calculated to be more than $1.6 billion. Row crop agriculture in floodplain soils in the Missouri and Mississippi River Basins as well as its tributaries in Missouri are highly productive systems and represent a large land area in the state of Missouri. The incidence of excessive rainfall events in the Midwest region has increased over 30% from 1958 to 2007 and is predicted to increase more in the future. Moreover, these heavier rainfall events are expected to occur more often during the spring and the fall period is predicted to become drier. Major environmental concerns associated with N loss from agricultural activities include excessive nitrate in surface waters causing hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and soil greenhouse gas emissions of nitrous oxide.

1092,"Changes in domestic agricultural and economic policies; regulations and market developments; along with structural changes in production and marketing are major factors influencing the international competitiveness of the U.S. food and agricultural sector. Evidence of structural change comes from a doubling of the prices for corn, soybeans and wheat starting in 2006. The last time prices doubled was 1973-74. The higher prices were driven by rapid increases in ethanol production and the associated derived demand for corn. Exports were also a factor in structural changes due to a continuing devaluation of the dollar. In recent years one cannot ignore the emergence of China as an economic juggernaut with a middle class exceeding the entire population of the United States. The demand for food, protein, feed grains and other agricultural products is already reaching significantly into the U.S. Over the period of 2007-2012, U.S. agricultural exports rose from $82.2 billion to $135.8 billion - a 65 percent increase. Imports rose from $70.1 billion to $103.4 billion resulting in a positive agricultural trade balance going from $12.2 billion to $32.4 billion - a 166 percent increase (ERS and FAS, 2013). The principal benefits of this research includes information pertaining to trade creation and diversion, supply response, import demand, land values, price variability, agricultural value added, food safety, the environment, and emerging bio-energy issues.

1093,"Statement of Issue: The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys Stal (BMSB) originates from China, Korea and Japan. The first economic damage to crops by the BMSB in the United States occurred in 2009, and it has spread to 40 states (confirmed in all states around Arkansas but not confirmed in Arkansas as yet). Need: In 2010, there was $37 million in yield losses alone when BMSB damage approached 90% loss in tree fruits in Virginia and West Virginia. Since 2010, the BMSB has caused heavy losses in the eastern United States. Justification: The BMSB has caused damage to conventional and organic farms producing brambles, grapes, apples, pears, peaches, peppers, tomatoes, field and sweet corn and soybeans. It has also become a homeowner nuisance (overwinters in residences in large numbers). Caulking of windows and/or the sealing of cracks and voids in exterior walls, eaves, etc. are recommended to minimize entry of BMSB but insecticide treatments are yet to be labeled for use on/in residences. Prior to the BMSB introduction, pyrethroid insecticide use on fruit crops was discouraged due to its negative effects on natural enemies. Current BMSB management relies on weekly applications of a pyrethroid such as bifenthrin thus abandoning 40 years of IPM program development. This use of pyrethroids is causing outbreaks of wooly apple aphid and San Jose scale. Alternative management tactics are needed. Microbial agents or repellents such as Surround kaolin clay or mass trapping may prove to be useful in managing BMSB. In addition, several potential egg parasitoids of BMSB from Asia are currently in quarantine undergoing host specificity testing. Our issue is to determine when and where BMSB arrives in Arkansas and assess annually the damage this new pest inflicts on fruit and vegetable crops listed above or others. The goal is to discuss with growers to identify, adjust research needs and priorities and help manage BMSB. Once it appears in Arkansas, fruit growers will be taught through demonstrations the best monitoring method to determine how the BMSB moves between crops, when fruit damage is occurring (attractive trap catch plus fruit inspections), and the recommended best management practices against this new pest. If a biological control agent of the BMSB is identified, and later permitted for release, then we would request permission to also release it into Arkansas and monitor establishment and impact on local BMSB densities. We plan to test efficacy of several OMRI approved compounds or practices such as microbial agents or Surround kaolin against the BMSB at the Arkansas Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Fayetteville in organic tree and bramble fruit plantings. All NEERA-1306regional project findings on detection and best management practices of BMSB will be disseminated at local grower meetings, Horticulture Industry Show annual meeting and annual pest management updates in the MP144 Insecticide Recommendations for Arkansas. Growers will be informed that all information will be made available at three currently existing website dedicated to the BMSB: www.rce.rutgers.edu/stinkbug/; the NE IPM Center&#39;s Brown Marmorated Working Group website, http://www.northeastipm.org/working-groups/bmsb-working-group/); and StopBMSB.org.Arkansas entomologists of all crops affected by BMSB will contribute to mapping the current distribution and severity of brown marmorated stink bug damage on a crop by crop basis. Impact: The BMSB management practices adopted by growers will decrease monetary losses to BMSB, reduce pesticide residues on Arkansas crops found to be attacked by BMSB, help growers return to established management programs, and lead to the development of IPM tactics that could be implemented by the non-agricultural sector dealing with BMSB invading and overwintering in structures.

1094,"Although organic producers from Northeastern United States pasture their cows from May to mid-October, they begin to supplement with conserved forage in the fall. As a result, most organic dairies fed conserved feeds (e.g., silage, haylage, and baleage) for approximately seven months over the year raising farm costs. Purchased feeds including forage and grains accounted for approximately 36% of the total cash expenses of organic dairy farms located in Maine and Vermont. It is important to note that purchased grains contributed for 90% of the total feed costs of these farms. Because conserved forage has lower nutritional value compared to good quality pasture, winter feeding costs generally increase in response to more grain supplementation to maintain milk production. Research is crucial to help reduce winter feeding costs in organic dairy herds. Specifically, research must be conducted to help organic and conventional dairy farmers make informed decisions about the use of alternative protein supplements such as flaxseed meal, field peas, and canola meal. It is hypothesized that these alternative protein sources can entirely replace soybean meal in dairy diets without compromise milk production and composition and N efficiency when fed to lactating dairy cows. A survey of 987 dairy farms across the Northeast revealed that 13% of dairy farmers use rotational grazing, 7% use large, modern confinement systems (no grazing) with &gt;300 cows, and 80% use a combination of low-intensity grazing and traditional confinement with a herd size &lt;300 cows. We learned through focus group interviews (n = 35 farmers) and surveys (n = 143 respondents) that profitable strategies to maximize forage production are challenging to 75% Northeastern dairy farmers using rotational grazing. Traditional and grazing dairy farms feed higher forage diets than modern confinement dairies, and consequently they share similar concerns about how to maximize forage production year-round. Therefore, opportunities exist to develop resilient alternative forage crops systems (e.g., warm and cool season grasses, summer annuals, brassicas) that provide supplemental forage for grazing and/or silage feeding during periods of limited biomass production (e.g., early spring, the  summer slump , and late fall). However, despite the rapidly growing interest and adoption of alternative forage crops across the Northeast, research data are lacking to help farmers make informed decisions regarding which alternative forage crops and rotations maximize animal production, farm profitability, and ecosystem services (e.g., carbon and nitrogen sequestration, soil health, weed control, etc.) in their enterprises. It is hypothesize that alternative forage crops can improve the economic and environmental sustainability of organic and conventional dairy farms by mitigating supplemental grain costs and whole-farm greenhouse gas emissions per unit of land and milk output through enhanced forage intake and soil carbon:nitrogen ratio.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1095,"The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys St&aring;l (BMSB) is a highly polyphagous stink bug of Asian origin. In its native range of China, Korea and Japan, it is considered a periodic agricultural pest of soybeans, tree fruit and various ornamental and vegetable crops. Since its introduction into the United States around 1996, it has spread to over 40 states and the District of Columbia. This proposal&#39;s objectives reflect current needs established by the BMSB working group and will be modified during the life of the project to reflect changes in priorities as identified by the working group. In several eastern states, its presence in agricultural crops has been confirmed in 2009 and was documented causing severe damage to apples, peaches, pears, peppers and tomatoes. In 2010, 2011 and 2012 damage by this insect was also observed in brambles, field corn, grapes, ornamentals, soybeans, and sweet corn. Traditionally, management of stink bugs in soybeans, tree fruit and horticultural crops was accomplished through the use of targeted applications of organophosphate insecticides. This use pattern is already causing secondary outbreaks of pest such as the wooly apple aphid and San Jose scale that were previously controlled by natural enemies putting growers on a  pesticide treadmill  that can lead to complete failures of management programs for BMSB and other pests. This project will document the development and evaluation of IPM tactics including monitoring, biological control and targeted use of pesticides. Information about the tactics will be discussed by each PI at state and regional grower meetings and will result in information being made available at participating university websites, the NE IPM Center BMSB Working Group website (http://www.northeastipm.org/working-groups/bmsb-working-group/) and the STOPBMSB website (http://www.stopbmsb.org/). Placing this information on the web will allow distribution to growers and others throughout the US. We anticipate this project to have the following impacts: 1. The IPM tactics we propose to develop will be adopted by farmers in at least 23 states thereby potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of people through reductions in pesticide residues on field, fruit, nursery and vegetable crops. 2. This project will result in economic benefits in the form of decreased monetary losses due to yield reductions caused by this insect. It will also result in increased time being available for marketing of the crop that would otherwise be spent managing this insect. Finally, this project will ultimately result in fewer costs in managing this pest due to reductions in pesticide use. 3. The results of this project may also lead to the development of IPM tactics that could be implemented by in non-agricultural sectors (i.e., homeowners, building managers and pest control companies) reducing the illegal and often inappropriate use of insecticide by these groups. Anticipated reductions in insecticide use and the application of illegal or unnecessary insecticide treatments will result in reductions in health issues due the presence of large numbers of BMSB (asthma for example) and exposure to insecticide residues.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1096,"H. glycines is the most important pathogen of soybeans in terms of yield loss and is found throughout all soybean growing regions. Approximately 75 million acres of soybeans were planted in the US during 2011 (~9 million in Illinois alone) representing $35 billion in crop value (~$5 billion in IL alone). Current management strategies for H. glycines include plant resistance and crop rotation and, more recently, seed applied nematicides. Most commercially available H. glycines resistant soybean varieties are derived from a single resistance source. While resistance is effective at mitigating yield loss, populations of H. glycines that overcome this resistance are widespread. Additional methods for control of H. glycines are needed to supplement existing control strategies.As an animal, the nervous system of H. glycines regulates behaviors necessary for survival and infection. Disruption of the nervous system represents a novel avenue for controlling plant-parasitic nematodes. Nervous system disruption is already accomplished through various nematicides such as Avicta (abamectin) which targets glutamate gated ion channels of nematodes. However these compounds are ineffective against the survival stage of plant-parasitic nematodes. The availability of genetically diverse field isolates as well as inbred nematode lines established by Dr. Terry Niblack make the Department of Crop Sciences an ideal location for studying the neurobiology of H. glycines. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has world-class imaging facilities including: spinning disk and laser scanning confocal microscopes, ultramicrotomes and TEM facilities.

1097,"The role of production agriculture is very important for the future of sustainable food and biorenewable energy production. With challenges of raising world-wide energy consumption, global climate changes and a deteriorating U.S. rural economy, biofuels produced from bio-renewable resources are drawing attention. A biobased industry has the potential to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and strengthen rural economies. The U.S. agro-ecosystem is still largely focused on providing raw materials for the food and feed industry rather than chemicals and fuels. Therefore, the future demand for liquid fuels can only be met by increased plant productivity and much improved biomass-to-fuel conversion efficiency. Biobased renewable resources can be obtained from a wide range of agricultural crops, forestry products, and processing industries. The 2007 Energy Independent and Security Act mandates 36 billion gallons of biofuel production, with 21 billion gallons coming from advanced biofuels such as ethanol from cellulosic biomass feedstock, by the year 2022. Twenty one billion gallons of biofuel will require over 350 million tons of dry cellulosic feedstock annually. To meet the U.S. federal goal, a significant portion of biomass feedstock will come from production agriculture including crop residues and dedicated perennial energy crops such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and other native grasses. Switchgrass and other native grasses growing on marginal and less productive soils as a renewable bioenergy crop have many obvious environmental and economic benefits including improved soil conservation, enhanced energy gain, and reduction of greenhouse gas emission. Over the past 15 or so years, switchgrass has been extensively evaluated for potential as a bioenergy crop across the nation and in many parts of the world; as a result, a considerable amount of information is currently available on switchgrass biomass production. However, most of these studies were conducted with conventional varieties, which were developed for forage production rather than high biomass production. In addition, recent studies revealed that feedstock diversity is one of most important considerations for sustainable production. Obviously, identifying and developing high yielding dedicated energy crops for various land types are the necessary steps to meet the national goal for sustainable bioenergy production using perennial grasses. The U.S. has access to significant amounts of biobased resources, including those of the highly productive corn/soybean cropping system in the central U.S., arguably the largest man-made ecosystem on the planet. Corn stover represents the largest quantity of biomass residue in the U.S., with over 250 million dry tons produced annually, and as a consequence, it is a formidable renewable biomass resource, which can be used to produce chemicals and biofuels. However, our efforts on corn production system are currently limited on gran yield and other traits related to nutrient use efficiency and stress tolerances. Since we are now looking for total biomass increase and stover composition as well as grain yield, it is important to add our effort on total biomass production.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1098,"Background: Colon cancer is the third most prevalent form of malignancy among American men and women. Clinical data has shown that the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in women inhibits colon tumor formation. Likewise, a recent meta-analysis suggests that the consumption of soy which is a prominent source of phytoestrogens reduces the risk of colon tumor formation in women. We have demonstrated that endogenous estradiol (E2) and genistein (Gen), a well studied phytoestrogen, alter the physiology of epithelial cells in the colon prior to tumor formation. Specifically, at physicologically relevant concentrations these estrogenic compounds induce apoptosis of colonic epithelia and this, in part, seems to be a key factor in the chemopreventative actions of the molecules. However, the molecular mechanism by which these molecules elicit their effects is poorly defined and to date, no studies have focused on the ability of estrogenic compounds to suppress colonic inflammation with a focus on subsequent tumor formation. Objectives: Our long-term goal is to develop clinical strategies that exploit the protective actions of estrogenic compounds to decrease colonic tumor formation without increasing risk of other diseases associated with E2 exposure. We propose to use in vivo models of experimental colitis and colon carcinogenesis and studies in non-malignant colonocytes in vitro to test the hypothesis that exposure of non-malignant colonocytes to estrogenic compounds results in decreased sporadic and inflammation-associated colon tumor formation. Specific Aims: (1) We will test the hypothesis that the timing of exposure to estrogenic compounds influences their ability to suppress sporadic colon tumor formation. (2) We will use experimental models of colitis in vivo and non-malignant colonocytes in vitro to test the hypothesis that E2 and dietary Gen inhibit inflammation-associated colon tumor formation. (3) We will test the hypothesis that the protective effects of estrogenic compounds in the colon are mediated, in part, through p53 signaling pathways. Study Design: In aim 1 we will use an in vivo model of sporadic colon cancer to investigate how treatment of animals with E2 or Gen at various stages of tumor development influences the ability of the compounds to suppress tumor formation. Subsequent tissue analysis will define the physiological actions of the treatments on colonic epithelia at the different stages of disease development. In aim 2, cell culture and experimental colitis models will be used to study acute and chronic inflammation-induced tissue damage. We will then define the role of E2 and Gen on inflammation-related formation of aberrant crypt foci (premalignant lesions) and colonic tumors. Aim 3 will use in vivo and in vitro models to determine if E2 and Gen modulate the activity of p53 and its downstream targets in non-malignant colonocytes and if this results in reduction of inflammation-associated tumor formation. Furthermore, we will define the upstream mechanisms by which these compounds alter p53 activity. Cancer Relevance: The proposed studies are novel, because they will define physiological actions of endogenous estrogen and diet derived phytoestrogens on normal colonic tissue that reduce sporadic colon cancer as well as chronic inflammation and associated colon tumor formation and are significant because their completion will have immediate clinical relevance since many post-menopausal women currently use phytoestrogens as an alternative to traditional hormone replacement therapy. Ultimately these studies may lead to the development of prevention strategies for high risk patients and colon cancer survivors that go beyond the use of traditional HRT.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

1100,"Since 1937, North Dakota has consistently been among the top five wheat producing states by volume. However, the total area of wheat in the state has been decreasing steadily since 1990, as wheat cultivation is replaced by corn and soybeans. This large-scale change over the last 23 years has been beneficial to North Dakota&#39;s agricultural producers. For example, the introduction of several short-season corn and soybean varieties during this time frame has allowed producers to select from a wider variety of crops that can be produced profitably in North Dakota growing conditions. Increasing export demand for soybeans for foreign livestock operations has also increased soybean prices, making soybean production more profitable than before throughout the world. Federal subsidies for ethanol and biodiesel have also encouraged adoption of corn-soybean crop rotations by further increasing demand for these two crops as industrial input in the biofuels industry. Overall, these economic drivers of land use change are beneficial to farmers. However, land use change and public policy that promotes land use change may have unintended consequences for the environment. For example, different crops leave soil more or less exposed, potentially affecting soil erosion and water pollution levels. Productive agricultural lands also provide habitat for certain species. For example, winter wheat planted into stubble from the previous crop mimics the tall grass habitat preferred by early-nesting duck species. Spring wheat is also suitable nesting habitat for late-nesting duck species. These types of habitat are also preferred by pheasants. Thus, change in crop selection in North Dakota may affect the prevalence of certain economically valuable game animals. This project is an effort to model the economics of land use change in North Dakota and to explore the links between the agricultural economy and the environment in the state.

Since 2009, the US has produced over 3 billion bushels of soybeans, generating $32 billion in production value (NASS).Threats by native and invasive insect pests have occurred extensively in soybean and lack of management practices threatens soybean yield and quality in Kansas and other soybean producing states in the US. Invasive pest problems, such as soybean aphid, have been and will continue to be effectively addressed. Combatting the emergence of new pests in Kansas, especially like invasive Heteropterans (aphids, stink bugs, and Plataspids), will take an organized effort.

1103,"The great majority of plant viruses are positive-strand RNA viruses [(+)RNA viruses], which cause tremendous agricultural losses each year. Development of crops with broad-spectrum and stable viral resistance is crucial for fighting mixed infections, which are common in the fields. For example, synergistic infection of soybean by Soybean mosaic virus and Bean pod mottle virus causes much severe infections than that of each virus. A universal feature of (+)RNA virus replication is that they assemble their replication complexes in association with host intracellular membranes, which are usually remodeled by viral proteins during infections. However, the mechanisms of virus-induced membrane rearrangements are not well-understood and the lipid microenvironment of viral replication complexes is not well-defined. A better understanding of such processes will identify novel and promising targets for designing broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. Our project targets the above knowledge gap by using Brome mosaic virus (BMV), which invaginates endoplasmic reticulum membranes to form spherular structures in barley, Nicotiana benthamiana and the baker&#39;s yeast. The primary objectives of this proposal are to determine the lipidomic alterations induced by BMV infection in various hosts, dissect the mechanisms by which BMV modulates lipid synthesis, and develop a pipeline to generate crop plants that are resistant to multiple viruses, intially by manipulating host lipid synthesis. Specifically, by using lipidomic and electron microscopic analyses, we will test the hypothesis that BMV recruits host lipid synthesis enzymes to promote phospholipid synthesis dedicated to viral replication. Building on previously work and our preliminary data that unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) are required for replication of a number of plant viruses, we will generate crop plants that express artificial microRNAs to knock down the expression of UFA synthesis genes to achieve resistance to multiple viruses.

1104,"Climate change is in the forefront of the agricultural community. Current predictions on crop and animal performance are based on research literature and accepted understanding of the current biological systems. At present, published research is one the few options available to policy makers and producers alike to predict the potential impacts of climate change over the next 30 years. Many of these issues are extremely complex and cannot be evaluated in the field not only because of this complexity, but also because changes will be gradual. In addition, the magnitude of these changes is uncertain and difficult to predict, especially at the local scale.Numerous groups have sought to evaluate the impact of climate change on crop performance and the subsequent impacts that this may have on global food, fiber and fuel supplies. Hatfield et al. (2008) indicated that high night temperatures will reduce crop yields as a result of higher respiration requirements and carbon loss. Higher temperatures are also likely to cause more rapid crop development which may result in lower yields by shortening the grain filling period (Muchow, 1990). In fact, Lobell and Asner (2003) predict a 17 percent yield reduction in corn and soybean yield for each 1&deg;C increase in air temperatures when temperature effect was confounded with rainfall limitation. However, when the effect of rainfall deficit was accounted for separately, then Lobell and Field (2007) reported a smaller 8.3% reduction in corn yield and a 1.3% decline in soybean yield per 1&ordm;C rise in temperature. Backlund et al. (2008) also predict that precipitation variability will increase along with the increased incidence of heat waves. This rainfall pattern will likely result in longer periods of water stress followed by intense rainfall events. Wolfe et al. (2008) estimate that crops in the Northeast US will experience higher frequency of temperature stress, perennial crops will have inadequate chilling in the winter, and all crops will be exposed to increased pest and weed pressure. Crop, soil, pest, and economic models that are used singularly or simultaneously exist in systems that can rapidly test the impacts of drought and temperature stress on crop species.Several outcomes from this group will provide insight on the impacts of climate change on food, fiber, and fuel production. These outcomes include experience in risk management assessment, new techniques for predicting environmental stresses and the ability to assist producers in managing inputs such as irrigation water and selecting the most appropriate crop for a given scenario to achieve the goals of securing adequate food and fiber supplies while assisting a fledgling bioenergy industry. These results will also serve as the framework to expand these efforts to other regions of the U.S. and other regions of the world.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1105,"Plants differ in their capacity to grow at and survive low temperatures. At one extreme are tropical-climate cereals such as maize and rice that suffer chilling injury when exposed to 10oC. At the other extreme are the temperate-climate cereals including barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum spp.), and rye (Secale cereal) capable of surviving the temperate-climate winter. This ability to survive the temperate-climate winter is known as winter hardiness. Wheat, barley, and rye are generally classified as being of either a winter or a spring growth habit. Spring growth habit types are inherently reproductively competent and are typically sown in the spring. In comparison, winter growth habit types are sown in the autumn. They grow vegetatively for a short period before overwintering and then develop reproductively the following spring. If spring-sown they fail to properly develop reproductively. Spring and winter growth habit types also differ from one another in their ability to survive the temperate-climate winter. Typically winter growth habit types are able to survive colder temperatures than spring types and have greater winter hardiness. Winter genotypes are often preferred because they are capable of returning yields 40% greater than that of their spring counterparts. Winter genotypes are also much more efficient at making use of available water due to an extended vegetative growth phase and a much more extensive root system over spring genotypes. In Ohio and other states of the East North Central Midwest, winter barley and winter wheats are essential components in the crop rotation cycle with maize and soybean. Spring types have not been recommended for Ohio as conditions early in the spring are erratic leading to unpredictable and generally poor yields. Recent studies in wheat and barley have led to the identification of several key factors underlying the molecular basis of winter hardiness. These studies also reveal that expression of the genes underlying these factors are themselves affected by developmental programming inherent to the genetic makeup of the plant, and by environmental factors. Moreover, current data strongly supports the premise that the key factors act antagonistic to one another. It is these phenomena and the genetic basis underlying them that I am working to better understand. A goal of the work proposed here is to gain greater insight into their regulation, to better understand the nature of this interaction between the factors, and how their regulation is affected by the environment. These studies will contribute fundamental knowledge that can be used to enhance the productivity and freezing tolerance of cereal plants.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
1106,"Crop production must double by 2050 to meet global demands due to population growth and animal and biofuel consumption. However, for the last two decades, global crop yield has only increased from 0.9 to 1.6% in corn, soybean, rice, and wheat; insufficient to meet predicted needs. Alternatives are needed. The U.S. supplies 33% of the world&#39;s soybean production. In Louisiana, soybean accounted for 23% of the total agricultural production, with soybean production valued at $408 million.A recent survey conducted inLouisiana has shown that the number of acres scouted and the number of insecticide applications has doubled over the last four years. Losses due to insecticide applications and insect damage averaged $41.22 per acre. Thus, soybean producers will likely be more risk-averse, unwilling to suffer grain quality and yield losses due to insect pests. An effective and sustainable soybean IPM will be necessary to reduce pest impacts while increasing productivity.To implement this plan, knowledge on pest biology, host range, and population dynamics is necessary. Louisiana soybean is attacked by a diverse insect pest complex, but the primary problems in recent years have been associated with stink bugs, threecornered alfalfa hoppers, bean leaf beetle, and several Lepidopteran defoliators (velvetbean caterpillar, soybean looper, corn earworm, and green cloverworm). In addition, kudzu bug reached Louisiana in 2013. One or more of these pests are significant annual problems and are responsible for limiting soybean yields in Louisiana. This is an evolving system and new management tactics are needed to combat a changing pest assemblage. This project utilizes short and long term objectives to generate the necessary data on pest density, impact, biology, and control tactics that are critical to improve the overall soybean IPM program.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1107,"Legumes represent the second most important family of crop plants, accounting for ~27% of the world&#39;s crop production. While some legumes, such as alfalfa and clovers, are grown as forages, most crop legumes are grown for harvesting their nutritious seeds. The legume seeds are contained in the pod, which is composed of a single seed-bearing carpel that, when matures, splits open along two seams, a process called pod dehiscence or pod shattering. Pod shattering before harvest is a serious problem that causes yield loss of grain legumes. Furthermore, the dominant shattering trait of the wild progenitors is also a limiting factor for efficient introgression of value-added traits into elite breeding lines. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying pod shattering in soybeans. Knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underlying pod shattering will facilitate the breeding of shattering-resistant varieties, expedite the introgression of agronomically favorable traits from wild species to elite breeding lines, and enrich our understanding of the evolution of seed dispersal and crop domestication in diverse crop species.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
1108,"In 2011 the United States harvested approximately 84 million acres of corn for grain and cash receipts from sales of corn were estimated at $63.9 billion dollars (U.S.). It also harvested 73.8 million acres of soybeans and 45.7 million acres of wheat worth an estimated $37.6 billion and $14.6 billion dollars (U.S.). NC-213 participants focus their efforts on maintaining the quality and value of these important commodities and many of the co-products produced during processing of these products. Although many of the challenges or concerns facing the industry are not new, the way in which they combine in a given harvest season is often unique. Therefore, continual adaptation and innovation are needed to maintain and improve grain and co-product quality. During the 2012 Annual Technical Meeting, a roundtable consisting of industry representatives discussed trends currently influencing the U.S. and global grain industries, and outlined research needs of the industry. These were combined with the knowledge of NC 213 researchers to give the following listing of challenges that are on the horizon. First, it is likely that the yearly volume of grain produced will continue to increase, requiring an increase in storage, handling, and drying capacity. During recent years the rise in importance of local markets (e.g. ethanol processors) and the desire on the part of producers for more marketing options have led to an increase in the volume of grain stored on farms. At the same time, public concern for food safety has increased and the Food Safety Modernization Act (FMSA) of 2012 includes requirements for supplier verification, record keeping, hazard analysis, inspection, and product tracing that will require compliance from sectors of the grain industry. Finally, additional demands are being exerted on grain supplies by new uses for grain (biofuels, bio-products). Together these challenges mean that there will be additional pressures on the industry and its management infrastructure. The opportunities and challenges presented by the above are explained in more detail in the Multistate Research Project Summary.The needs of the industry will be addressed using a collaborative approach to accomplish the following project objectives: 1) development of methods to measure grain quality and methods that preserve and improve quality; 2) development of grain storage, handling and processing systems and strategies that maintain quality, capture value and preserve food safety; and 3) effectively disseminate to the industry, research results and knowledge that can help the industry preserve and improve grain value and quality. We anticipate that the end result will be an increase in overall grain and co-product quality and purity, improvements in efficiency and effectiveness of grain handling, storage and processing facilities and systems, and increased public confidence in the quality and value of their grain based food sources.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1109,"The production of biofuel relies heavily on plants like soybean and corn, which are also basic food crops. The use of these plants as a source of biofuel results in an increase in food prices and removes valuable farm land from the production of food by shifting it into the production of biofuel. Microalgae have been shown to produce carbohydrates and fats that can be used to produce ethanol and/or biodiesel. The algae can be grown commercially in large ponds, however, the grower has little control over the environmental conditions that may influence overall growth and yield. By growing algae in greenhouses where there is considerable control of temperature and light, will allow an increase in yield during the course of a year resulting in greater product and an enhanced ability to effectively market that product. One of the critical unknowns in designing a greenhouse production system is the lack of information on the impact of varying environmental conditions on the growth rate of the algae as well as on the amount of carbohydrate or fat that is produced. This project will discover that information.We will use a newly designed production system that will allow us to expose similar populations of algae to different temperature, light and atmospheric conditions. By doing this we will be able to provide engineers and growers with the information they need in both designing as well as managing a large scale algal production greenhouse. If these designs and management practices prove economically sound the ultimate goal would be to replace food crops as a source of biofuel. Additionally, since the greenhouse production of algae will not have as a requirement the use of high quality agricultural land, it will remove the competition between the use of land and crops for food or biofuel production and eliminate the increased food prices associated with this competition.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

1111,"Costs of grain and various feed ingredients have increased dramatically in recent years. In addition, the availability of certain commodities has become scarce in certain parts of the country. The result is that rations fed to livestock and in particular, lactating dairy cows, have risen dramatically in cost. The current cost to produce a hundred kg of milk is above the current milk price and therefore, the profitability of the dairy industry is negative, and producers are again losing equity. In the past, commodities and/or by-products have been used to reduce ration costs and improve profitability of the dairy operation. However, even these commodities are increasing in cost due to value and availability relative to corn and soybean meal. Therefore, new ways must be found to reduce feed costs to regain profitability and sustainability of the dairy industry to compete on a world market. Feed efficiency is one way to improve the profitability and sustainability of the dairy operation. Feed efficiency is defined as the unit of milk produced per unit of dry matter intake. The energy content of the ration is the greatest factor affecting the feed efficiency of the lactating dairy cow. The greatest factor(s) affecting the energy density of the diet are the digestibilities of the forages in the ration. Forages are the cheapest and most economical sources of nutrients on the farm when compared to grains, proteins, and various commodities sources. Therefore, increasing forage nutrient availability will increase their economic value relative to other commodities or by-products. The use of highly digestible forages may allow one to increase the amount used in the ration to meet the nutrient requirements of high producing dairy cows. In addition, meeting the nutrient requirements of dairy cows in later lactation may also be advantageous in order to reduce feed cost to improve profitability.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

These genetically improved populations of native species will be adapted to marginal land (e.g., poor drainage, salt-impacted soil) that is totally unsuitable for profitable production of conventional grain (e.g., corn, wheat, soybean) and forage (e.g., alfalfa) crops.This project also conducts research that creates new knowledge of the genetics of biomass production and related traits (e.g., insect resistance) in native grasses and forbs with potential for bioenergy production on marginal land.

1114,"The Lower Mississippi River Valley (LMRV) is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the United States, generating nearly $6.8 billion/yr in revenue and employing nearly 100,000. More than 3 million ha of irrigated cropland exist there, making it also one of the most heavily irrigated regions in the U.S. The Mississippi River Valley Alluvial (MRVA) aquifer supplies about 90% of this irrigation water, and its water withdrawal rate of 9,290 Mgal/d ranks second only to the High Plains aquifer (17,500 Mgal/d) in terms of irrigation use. In portions of Arkansas and Mississippi, the aquifer is declining at rates ranging from 0.15 to &gt; 0.45 m per year. At the same time, a growing human population, climate destabilization, and rising production input costs will all combine to further increase demand for irrigation in coming years, exacerbating aquifer overdraft. Improved irrigation efficiency will be central to any comprehensive approach to meeting future agricultural water needs in Mississippi. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop water- and energy-conserving systems for row crops in Mississippi. Emphasis will be placed on the 2:1 soybean (Glycine max)-rice (Oryza sativa) rotation that has a combined annual economic valuation &ge; $ 600 million. This particular rotation also currently consumes approximately 2 million A-ft irrigation water per season, representing about one-half of the water currently removed from the MRVA aquifer for irrigation in Mississippi. Thus, improvements in irrigation use efficiency in this rotation could have meaningful impacts on the on-going overdraft of the MRVA aquifer. However, research suggests that adoption of improved irrigation technology alone will not necessarily result in long-term resource conservation, indicating that human nature must also be factored into any comprehensive approach to reducing water use.

1117,"Environmental quality is directly impacted by water management for crop production. The goal of implementing best management practices (BMP) is to optimize crop production without degrading the environment needed to produce those crops. Intensive cropping practices suggest the need for continued improvement and/or development of BMPs. Often these improvements can be achieved simply through better education for end users of what has already been learned. However, the pressure to do more with less, especially in a world economy that places ever increasing demands on available energy, requires greater understanding of environmental impact both at the basic and applied levels. This project is designed to improve our understanding of environmental inputs on soil erosion, water quality, water quantity, and bioenergy production. Objectives are directed at gaining improved management of soil amendments across a greater spectrum of soils than presently understood. Use of unique laboratory facilities using rainfall simulators and droplet measuring techniques will be applied in gaining a fundamental understanding of the interactions of soil qualities that influence the behavior of these soil amendments. Improved cropping management through use of variable rate irrigation (VRI) technology for moving sprinkler systems offers the possibility of matching site specific needs of water and chemical application to field variability of soil texture, slope, and soil profile. This has potential to reduce crop inputs while maintaining or increasing crop production. Effectiveness of this strategy may be limited by the physical scale of field variations, and by the ability of the irrigation system to be controlled at a fine enough scale to match those variations. The project objective to evaluate uniformity of water application both along the center pivot and during cycling changes of application rate across the field will support development of recommendations to properly manage VRI systems. The production of grass biomass crops on eroded soils holds promise to supply alternative energy while reducing soil erosion, especially for marginal soils. This project will use agronomic and economic methods to compare production output between traditional corn and soybean with grass crops of switchgrass and miscanthus.

1118,"Executive Summary: Large shifts in acreages of cotton, corn, soybeans and wheat in the Mississippi Delta have occurred in recent years. These changes have been followed by the wide spread use of new technologies such as Global Positing Systems (GPS), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Variable Rate Technology applications (VRT), Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). The average size of farming operations has increased. This was accompanied by the introduction of larger planting, spraying, and harvesting equipment in an attempt to complete farming operations as soon as possible. Cotton acreage has declined because of low prices and many cotton gins and oil mills have closed. Soybean, corn, and wheat acreage has increased dramatically because of favorable prices. Entries in the Mississippi State University Soybean varietal trials have increased. The resistance of these varieties to the major diseases will be determined. Also, fungi have developed resistance to some currently used fungicides. Alternative fungicides will be determined. Input costs have also risen in part because of increased crop yields which led to increased nutrient removal and the greater need for fertilizer applications. Seed applied pesticides have improved and the use of in-furrow and hopper box fungicides, insecticides and nematicides has all but disappeared. Higher commodity prices and higher yielding varieties along with new more effective fungicides and nematicides have allowed the producer to consider the use of seed and foliar applied fungicides as a means of increasing and insuring the highest possible yields. The importance of certain diseases and nematodes has changed because of the acreage shifts and farming practices. An example is black root rot (6) which has become a problem on soybeans grown on land previously cropped to cotton. Another example is the increase in the importance of the root knot nematode. Corn is not a host of the reniform nematode. Corn, soybeans and cotton are all hosts of the root knot nematode. Research will be conducted on control methods for these diseases and nematodes. There has been a large increase in acres cropped to soybeans and corn. In many cases the soils on which these crops are grown are deficient in Potassium or other nutrients. Potassium deficiencies predispose soybeans to foliar diseases. In some fields, the addition of potassium will result in foliar disease control. Research is needed to determine the interaction between low potassium levels and foliar diseases. The method of acid delinting cotton has changed. Bacterial blight of cotton incidence has increased. In summary, research will be conducted on seedling and late season foliar diseases of cotton, corn, soybeans, and wheat. Resistance of the entries in the Mississippi State soybean varietal trials to stem canker, frogeye leaf spot, purple seed stain, black root rot and other diseases will be determined. Efficacy and optimum rates and timings of seed and foliar applied fungicides and nematicides will be determined.

1120,"Soybean yield is very sensitive to elevated temperatures. Global temperatures are predicted to increase and these changes in temperature conditions have the potential to considerably decrease soybean yields. The extent to which high temperatures influence seed yield and seed quality depends on the timing of the stress relative to the developmental stage of soybean. Photosynthesis is an important determinant of crop productivity and is sensitive to temperature. Through effects on photosynthesis, above-optimum temperatures occurring at any time during development may result in decreased soybean yields. Therefore, a thorough understanding of soybean photosynthetic responses to high temperatures and underlying regulatory mechanisms is critical to identify and efficiently improve performance under non-optimal temperature conditions. We will measure the responses of different components of the photosynthesis process to identify soybean genotypes with contrasting responses to high temperature conditions, and characterize the mechanisms underlying the responses of the contrasting genotypes.This research will result in the identification of soybean germplasm that can be employed in breeding programs to improve soybean heat tolerance. In addition, the mechanistic understanding gained is expected to reveal approaches that can be leveraged to improve soybean heat tolerance.

Drought has the greatest effect on decreasing soybean yields in the United States when directly compared with northern and Midwest regions of the US. On the other hand, Aluminum tolerant cultivars resist increased levels of accumulated Al by a series of mechanisms that are not well understood. Therefore, the United States Soybean Board has ranked breeding for drought and Al-tolerance as one of the top research priorities in recent years. Advances in understanding gene regulation and expression have allowed tremendous progress in controlling weeds, pests and fertility conditions in US crops.

1124,"Effective management of grain in the entire value chain, especially during post-harvest processing, is critical to mitigate current food safety/security concerns, particularly those related to mycotoxin contamination of grain and co-products. Mycotoxins, especially aflatoxin, are known carcinogens that pose a severe health hazard to human and animal consumers of grains and co-products.Freshly-harvested, high-moisture content grain must be dried to minimize (or prevent) excessive respiration and mold growth on grains. At present, most on-farm systems which use either natural air or slightly-heated air to dry grain are becoming very popular. With these systems, the grain could be dried more slowly which generally results in improved quality and also the drying practice reduces pressure on commercial driers. Although drying practice with on-farm systems can lead to very positive results, they are weather dependent and unfortunately could lead to over drying of grain, fissured kernels that reduce milling yields, result in loss of functional performance, nutritional and sensorial quality of the grain and even development of harmful molds in areas of the bin that incur delays prior to drying. In particular, the development of mycotoxin-producing mold leading to mycotoxin contamination of stored grain in the on-farm systems has become a great concern to the grain industry.Recently-introduced technology for use in on-farm drying systems offers a means to utilize the advantages of low-temperature, in-bin drying systems, yet prevent the disadvantages that are sometimes incurred. The new technology is governed by the principle of Equilibrium Moisture Content (EMC), which is the moisture content that a specific grain will attain if exposed to air with a given relative humidity and temperature for a long enough duration. Grain dried by continuous fan operation would be exposed to multiple drying/rewetting processes due to changing hourly/daily weather, resulting in inefficient and non-uniform drying. Natural air/low temperature (NA/LT) drying with fan operation in a given EMC window restricts the delivery of air that is too wet and/or too dry. The new NA/LT in-bin technology comprises cables to monitor not only air ambient conditions, but also grain moisture content and temperature throughout the entire grain bin mass and the data can also be accessed anytime via the internet. The systems have advanced fan and heater controls or self-adapting variable heat (SAVH) capability, which automatically adjusts the upper and lower EMC windows throughout the drying process, minimizing fan run-time hours and over drying costs, as well as moisture content non-uniformity.These new in-bin systems are becoming very popular and have great potential for wider adoption by many farmers. However, the duration required to achieve drying with the new systems is greatly affected by prevailing weather conditions (temperature and relative humidity). The real problem is that the weather may not allow drying of the grain, particularly the upper layers, in a timely manner. When this happens, there is a great possibility for mold growth in the grain mass, with potential mycotoxin development, and grain quality related problems such as loss of grades, functional performance, nutritional and sensory value may ensue as well. For instance, across the U.S. Mid-South, prevailing weather conditions will dictate the upper moisture content limit of grains that can be stored in these new in-bin drying/storage systems without significant  quality  deterioration and mold growth leading to mycotoxin development. The term  quality  could mean desirable characteristics for effective further processing and/or end-use. It is vital to know, for instance in the case of rice, how rapid grain  quality  attributes, such as grain yellowing, hardness, dry matter loss/respiration, milling, nutritional, functional (e.g. paste viscosity, stickiness, cohesiveness etc.) and sensory related characteristics change under prolonged high-MC conditions; and for the case of soybean destined for seed, how germination rate is impacted under different drying and storage conditions.The primary and practical questions the research will seek to answer for successful implementation of the new in-bin systems in Arkansas and the Mid-South are as follows: (1) what is the rate of grain  quality  reduction and mycotoxin development under various drying/storage scenarios; (2) with respect to stored product  quality , what is the upper moisture content limit for grain (rice, corn, sorghum, and soybean) placed into these systems at various locations; (3) what energy savings could be realized with these new in-bin drying/storage systems?",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

Insects of major interest include several stink bug species, soybean podworm, and other late season insect pests that feed on soybean foliage, pods, and seeds and are difficult to manage with available control methods. Also of concern are three additional soybean insect pests which will soon arrive in Missouri and attack the soybean crop. They include the red banded stink bug, the brown marmorated stink bug, and the bean plataspid. Knowledge gained from the study of current soybean insect pests may help in developing effective management strategies for the invading soybean pests.

This information will be gained through a statewide random survey of 60 producer fields each sampled three times during the growing season for a three year period. Insect samples will be collected by taking 20 sweeps using a 15-inch diameter sweep net. In a second study distribution of soybean insects within a soybean field will be determined through the growing season by collection of monthly sweep net samples at 10 locations within each plot ranging from field border rows to 160 feet into the field interior. Insect abundance will be determined at each of these ten sample locations in soybean planted at 7-, 15, and 30-inch row spacing. Insects that initially infest field edges before moving to field interiors will be the focus of this study. Several stink bug species will be intensively studied. A third soybean insect study will determine insect distribution through the growing season in soybean varieties with four different maturity ratings and three planting dates equivalent to early, mid, and late season. A fourth study will utilize pheromone baited traps and sweep net sampling to determine  first occurrence  and abundance of the red banded and brown marmorated stink bugs, plus the closely related bean plataspid species in Missouri. Pheromone traps and sweeps will be located along major highways and in select border counties. At present, the red banded stink bug is prevalent in Arkansas, the brown marmorated is found in several of Missouri&#39;s border states, and the bean plataspid has been found close to Missouri in the adjoining state of Tennessee. Early detection of these invading insect pests of soybean in Missouri should allow producers time to gain the knowledge to better manage these new soybean pests before population grow to economic levels in the state&#39;s soybean crop. The more knowledge available about each specific pest allows for development of effective pest control strategies and soybean integrated pest management programs.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1126,"Soybean yield is very sensitive to elevated temperatures. Global temperatures are predicted to increase and these changes in temperature conditions have the potential to considerably decrease soybean yields. The extent to which high temperatures influence seed yield and seed quality depends on the timing of the stress relative to the developmental stage of soybean. Photosynthesis is an important determinant of crop productivity and is sensitive to temperature. Through effects on photosynthesis, above-optimum temperatures occurring at any time during development may result in decreased soybean yields. Therefore, a thorough understanding of soybean photosynthetic responses to high temperatures and underlying regulatory mechanisms is critical to identify and efficiently improve performance under non-optimal temperature conditions. We will measure the responses of different components of the photosynthesis process to identify soybean genotypes with contrasting responses to high temperature conditions, and characterize the mechanisms underlying the responses of the contrasting genotypes.This research will result in the identification of soybean germplasm that can be employed in breeding programs to improve soybean heat tolerance. In addition, the mechanistic understanding gained is expected to reveal approaches that can be leveraged to improve soybean heat tolerance. In the long term, soybean farmers will benefit from the development of more heat tolerant soybean cultivars.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
1127,"Identifying nutritional managements systems that optimize feed resources will have significant impact on profitability of cow-calf operations. In any beef operation, there are multiple periods when nutritional and management interventions can have long-term consequences for the cattle performance and system profitability. Those critical periods include: 1) fetal and postnatal calf development; 2) calf post-weaning preconditioning period and feedlot receiving period; and 3) pre- and post-breeding period of replacement beef heifers and mature cows. The concept that early nutrition has lifetime consequences on animal development has biological and economical implications for agriculture, and should be explored in order to improve the performance of animals destined for food production. Another critical period of a calf&#39;s life is the post-weaning period that is followed by stressful events such as vaccination, castration, transportation and feedlot entry. During those periods, the immune systems of the calf is compromised and may result in increased incidence of bovine respiratory disease leading to increased calf morbidity and mortality, and decreased net return in the feedlot. Thus, additional studies are required to identify nutritional management systems that can enhance the performance of cattle during those critical life periods, and consequently, increase the profitability of cow-calf producers. Improving the immunity, growth and reproductive efficiency of beef cattle will help to ensure the sustainability of beef producers. In terms of nutritional interventions, potential approaches that may be utilized in order to optimize feed resources include changing the amount and/or the frequency of supplementation of essential nutrients, such as proteins, energy, minerals and fatty acids, and replacing traditional ingredients, such as corn and soybean meal, with local feed byproducts. By focusing of providing essential nutrients during critical periods of a cow-calf operation, and utilizing alternative byproduct-based supplements, the overall costs associated with feeding may be decreased, and overall profitability and sustainability may be increased. Therefore, our objectives include: (1)Stimulate the use of byproducts as a feed alternatives to beef cattle; (2)Evaluate different nutritional management systems to increase calf value at weaning and to enhance the post-stress immune response of beef calves; (3)Enhance the long-term performance of beef cattle by improving the nutritional status of cows during gestation (Fetal Programming) and calves during early stages of postnatal life (Metabolic Imprinting Program); and (4)Identify strategic supplementation alternatives to enhance the reproductive performance of beef females.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1128,"Regardless of the location, weeds are one of the most profit limiting pests for crop producers. In Louisiana, profitability of crop producers is often exaborated due the immense number of species that can act as weedy pest. In corn, cotton, and soybean, there are numerous methods that can be utilized for management of weeds ranging from cultural to chemical applications. Chemical application is the preferred method of weed management by Louisiana crop producers. As a consequence, the determination of the efficacy of herbicides on the numerous weed species in Louisiana is criticial. In addition, there are many herbicide-tolerant crop technologies available for use by producers; therefore, their evaluation in Louisiana is needed. Furthermore, frequent use of herbicides has increased the frequency of weeds that are resistant to frequently used herbicides. Determination of the level of resistance and documentation of the location and spread of the herbicide resistant weed in Louisiana is crucial to mitigate the spread and education stakeholders of the presence and consequences of herbicide resistant weeds.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1129,"The United States Corn Belt is one of the most productive agricultural areas on Earth. This is in large measure due to the effective use of irrigation, insect and weed control, and fertilizers to increase and maintain productivity throughout the region. As the climate becomes more variable (precipitation, temperature, and humidity patterns change, while atmospheric CO2 concentrations increase), the amount of water needed to maintain agricultural productivity will exceed the available supply. A sound understanding of the impacts of climate variability on carbon (C) sequestration, water use, and food production is critical to developing mitigation strategies and evaluating the long-term sustainability of agroecosystems.Canopy photosynthesis drives the exchange of CO2 and water vapor between the earth&#39;s surface and the atmosphere - key interactions of vegetation with the environment. These CO2 and water vapor exchanges are directly affected by the vegetation stress status. Typically, as vegetation stress increases, plant canopy CO2 uptake and transpiration decrease due to decreases in photosynthesis, increases in respiration, and changes in the plant ability to transport water vapor to the atmosphere. When these changes occur, a smaller proportion of the energy the plant canopy absorbs is able to be used in plant production (carbon gain). Plants under stress have a number of means to protect themselves by reducing sunlight absorption through physical changes such as leaf movement, leaf rolling, and chloroplast avoidance movement resulting in a change in canopy reflectance. Leaf surface temperature increases with stress because of reduced transpiration. Changes in the reflected sunlight and plant temperature provide a means of detecting canopy stress using remote sensing methods.Remote sensing provides a means of inferring vegetation condition since plants will absorb, reflect, and transmit incident sunlight in a manner closely linked with their vegetative condition. Vegetation biophysical properties, such as the concentration of pigments (including chlorophyll), the total amount of leaf material, leaf orientation, and canopy component reflectance properties, all influence observable reflected and transmitted light. In turn, measurements of reflected and transmitted light allow estimation of these vegetation parameters and, in particular, the level of photosynthetic activity occurring at leaf and canopy levels. Thermal measurements can also be used as an indication of plant stress.The research is expected to lead to 1) improved remote sensing techniques for identifying crop phenology and stress status of crops, and 2) near-real time assessment of ecosystem-level properties, in particular, those related to crop productivity and water use. We will couple greenhouse-based and field-based studies to answer questions at the forefront of remote sensing research and extend our measurement domain to the regional scale.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

1131,"There is increased interest in alternative energy sources due to increasing prices and security risks associated with fossil oils. A promising alternative energy source is biofuels made from biomass. Currently, biomass-based fuel production research is mainly focused on oil crops, sugar-based crops and cellulosic materials. Microalgae show promise as both a biofuels and bioproducts feedstock. Microalgae can produce more oil per hectare than land-based crops (Chisti, 2008; Demirbas, 2009 and 2011), have higher growth rate with a shorter harvest cycle (Schenk et al. 2008), the capability to sequester carbon dioxide and grow on low value agricultural land; therefore, not competing with agricultural crop resources. Algae 2020 report (2011) concluded that the long-term development of a biomass-based biofuels industry requires diversification of products to help revenue streams an area of increasing research interest. New algal biofuel companies have recently emerged that are producing food ingredients from the remaining algal biomass, such as Solazyme Inc., a renewable oil and bioproducts company founded in 2010. Besides the accumulation of lipids for fuels, algae produce fatty acids, pigments, and carbohydrates of key interest due to their potential health benefits and use as food ingredients (Wijffels et al., 2010). For these reasons, studies on microalgae as a source for biofuels and by-products are steadily increasing (Chisti, 2010, Mata et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2006, Andrich et al., 2006, Sawayama et al., 1999, Feinberg, 1984).The corn and soybean industries have been capitalizing on the functional characteristics of individual components for several years. Corn starch, corn oil, soy proteins and soybean oil have been utilized as food ingredients. This research has resulted in huge increases in the production and sale of these commodities as well as added value through the development of functional food ingredients. Suitable treatments for chemical modification include various potentially hazardous chemicals. These methods are generally undesirable because of safety and nutrition issues. New research can also be done to find less chemical waste and residue producing methods for manipulating the functional characteristics of starches, then those that exist now. This work would also help minimize costs associated modified starch ingredient manufacture through development of simpler methods.About 28 % of the 1.2 million tons of sweet potatoes produced annually in the U.S. are grown in the South Central region (USDA ERS 2011). In Louisiana sweet potatoes had a 2010 crop value of $80 million and value-added production value of $142 million (Smith 2011). The canning process can result in 600,000 lbs of mainly starchy waste per day, at least half of which goes directly into lagoons for digestion, creating an environmental waste issue. U.S. rice brokens range from 12% to 24% of milled rice (Sage V Foods 2012) and are sold at greatly discounted prices at 60% of the value of head rice (Siebenmorgan et al., 2012). Finding new uses for these products will add value and reduce environmental issues. The modification of corn starch to produce functional food ingredients has resulted in value-added ingredients, which has driven the selling price of native corn starch from $0.20/pound to $2.50/pound for modified corn starch-based fat replacers. There is a potential of a 10-fold increase in the value of algae by-product, rice, and sweet potato flours, from the development of starch-based fat replacers and other ingredients such as resistant starch, through utilization of the same technology.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
1132,"Due to the remarkable rise in obesity in the U.S., and the growing body of evidence linking obesity to diabetes, heart disease and cancer, on June 18, 2013, the American Medical Association officially declared that obesity is a disease. This new designation defines 78 million American adults and 12 million children as having a medical condition requiring treatment and underscores the severity of the obesity epidemic that is estimated to cost the U.S. $550 billion annually by 2030 when it is projected that ~50% of the population will be obese. Worldwide, the number is expected to reach &gt;1 billion obese adults by 2030. Often associated with obesity are diabetes, insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which along with heart disease and hypertension are often referred to as the Metabolic Syndrome.This project examines the role of soybean oil in diet-induced obesity and Metabolic Syndrome. Soybean oil constitutes about 50% of worldwide edible vegetable oil production and 30% of all fats and oils produced; the increased consumption of soybean oil has paralleled the rise in obesity in the U.S. Several decades ago when it was found that diets high in saturated fats are unhealthy, it was assumed that diets high in unsaturated fats were healthy. Soybean oil contains a high level of polyunsatured fats, most prevalent of which is linoleic acid. In this study, we show that when soybean oil is added to a diet high in saturated fats, the symptoms of the Metabolic Syndrome (obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, etc.) are aggravated. We propose to explore the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs so that appropriate dietary guidelines can be formulated for soybean oil and linoleic acid. Furthermore, we will examine the effects of a genetically modified soybean oil that is low in linoleic acid that is coming to market in 2014 and that is being advertised as being as healthful as olive oil. Finally, we will examine organic, non-genetically modified soybean oil to verify that it is not some other component of the commodity-grade soybean oil that is causing the symptoms of the Metabolic Syndrome. All told, this project could impact nutritional guidelines for linoleic acid, use of genetically modified soybean oil and organic soybean oil.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In particular, obesity prevalence in Mississippi State is the second highest in the U.S. (34.6%). Common bean production in Mississippi has been declined, partially due to the increased production of soybeans over the years.

1137,"The world poultry industry has maintained growth at unprecedented rates while consumer life styles and food preferences continue to change. Convenience foods that are consumer-friendly, affordable, nutritious, safe, and able to satisfy all of the basic consumer&#39;s quality preferences continue to direct the poultry industry&#39;s marketing path. To meet these needs, poultry producers and processors seeking to develop advanced production and processing technologies for use in producing consumer-oriented products. These changing technologies will require new basic knowledge about poultry production and processing efficiencies, and the safety, functional properties, and stability of poultry and egg products. This project is composed of three objective areas: 1. Poultry Meat Safety, 2. Poultry Meat Quality, 3. Egg Quality and Safety. The intent of this project is to efficiently use the capabilities of the resources at Texas A&amp;M to achieve the project objectives that address current national and international priorities of improving consumer food safety and product acceptance, and the commercial profitability of poultry meat and eggs by solving critical problems related to the quality of poultry meat and eggs; specifically color, flavor, or texture of the product, and the safety of poultry meat and eggs; specifically pathogen colonization, contamination, decontamination.Poultry Meat Safety Outbreaks of foodborne illness continue to persist in the U.S. food supply even though it is considered one of the safest in the world. There are an estimated 60 to 80 million individuals who contract foodborne illness each year leading to approximately 3,000 deaths (CDC, 2012). The annual costs of foodborne illness in the U.S. are estimated at from $5 to $6 billion, including both medical costs and productivity losses. Poultry products have come under scrutiny over the past several years due to listeriosis outbreaks and product recalls of precooked ready-to-eat products. As a consequence, the FSIS has implemented a zero tolerance for Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat products. Although FSIS instituted HACCP in 1996, food-borne illness continues to be a significant problem in consumers of poultry. Poultry processing plants throughout the U.S. are challenged by even lower FSIS Salmonella standards. Thus, the need to develop intervention strategies to aid in the elimination of pathogenic bacteria from the nation&#39;s food supply is a concern for both producers and consumers of poultry products. Moreover, USDA-FSIS has recently enacted Campylobacter standards. Many poultry companies are having difficulty meeting these standards as no field interventions exist for this pathogen. Removal and destruction of pathogens on the surfaces of poultry products are important links in the goal of producing pathogen-free products. Hence, new methods to reduce bacterial populations inherent to poultry products are needed while assuring that products reach the consumer in a wholesome state.Poultry Meat Quality Total U.S. per capita consumption of poultry meat has doubled in the past 40 years alone, increasing from 48 lbs in 1970 to nearly 100 lbs in 2013 with the majority (&gt;60%) comprised of boneless meat. Today, approximately 90% of the market consists of parts and further processed products compared to only 20% in 1960. The demand for boneless breast meat has steadily increased over the past 30 years and is produced for many market segments including retail, foodservice, and further processing. Broilers are processed in a variety of weight ranges in order to meet specific customer needs, and the processing of large birds, 6-9 lb., is becoming increasingly popular. More recently, a greater percentage of boneless, skinless breast meat comes from the big bird market segment because of increased yields and pounds per man hour. The average live weight of birds in this segment is now around 7.6 lbs. (ranging 6-9 lbs), approximately a 15% increase over 10 years ago. This demand has been met in part by the poultry industry&#39;s aim to provide lean and convenient products and to focus on the further processed markets. Concerns about maintaining quality, color, flavor, and functionality of poultry products are continuing to be expressed by both the poultry processing industry and consumers, especially as growth rate and bird sizes (weights) have increased. Furthermore, consumer expectations for consistent quality are increasing while demands for convenience have resulted in processes, such as accelerated processing and precooking, that place severe strain on color, textural, and flavor because of incomplete resolution of rigor mortis and the tendency for poultry meat lipids to oxidize resulting in  warmed over flavors . Continuing prevalence of defective meat such as PSE and white striping conditions and failure to reduce the incidence and/or severity of those conditions will further reduce the efficiency and competitiveness of the U.S. poultry industry in the global poultry market. Current and future trends include the use of marination for the enhancement of meat quality, controlled atmosphere and low atmosphere stunning, chilling processes, stream-lined processing (minimal aging), portioning and packaging techniques. These trends have the potential to impact poultry meat quality positively or negatively. Currently in the U.S. food industry, there is a trend toward marinating poultry products as a way to add value to the product and/or to improve quality of early deboned meat or PSE-like meat. Popular and functional non-meat ingredients including soy protein, carrageenan, modified food starch, and fibers have been traditionally added to meat products to serve as extenders, binders, and fillers in emulsified and comminuted products. However, there is limited information on the ability of these non-meat ingredients to increase the water holding capacity of whole muscle products. Because these products are used to increase the water holding capacity in many blended food products, they may be effective in improving poultry deli loaves made with whole muscle poultry meat that exhibit the poo meat quality. If these ingredients can restore meat functionality, then yield losses currently incurred would dramatically diminish resulting in economic benefits to the industry. However, clean labels (limited ingredients, recognizable by consumers) are also in demand by consumers and therefore, processors. Using limited ingredients can result in continued poor meat quality characteristics in finished products if raw ingredients are of poor quality.Egg Quality and Safety Eggs are a significant agricultural commodity and an important portion of America&#39;s diet. Americans consumed approximately 248 eggs per capita annually, fueling a domestic egg industry that produced 78.5 billion eggs in 2010 (AEB, 2012). Improvements in the management, disease control, nutrition, and genetics of laying hens as well as advancements in egg processing technology over the past 50 years have changed today&#39;s egg quality, composition, and safety; yet few investigations have documented these changes. In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration published a final rule to control Salmonella contamination and growth during egg production and through transportation (FDA, 2009). Egg producers with greater than 3,000 hens on site are held to the various requirements of the law. Updated research is needed to serve as a current baseline for evaluation of the application of the new regulations related to egg washing temperatures. In addition, research is needed to aid the egg processing industry to solve the technical problems that have hindered maintaining the consistent quality of the variety of egg products produced for today&#39;s market over the egg production cycle of the laying hens.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

1140,"Conservation of natural resources requires both an ecological and a human dimensions approach. The Prairie Pothole Region of North and South Dakota (hereafter referred to as the  Dakota PPR ) is a mosaic of grasslands and wetlands of various sizes, including larger recreationally important waters. In recent years, thousands of hectares of these grassland-wetland complexes have been tilled, drained, and converted for corn or soy production, with most of the conversion occurring in North and South Dakota. Individual landowner decisions to covert grasslands or wetlands to row crop agriculture can have negative impacts on fish communities that occupy lakes, but the exact impacts are unknown in South Dakota to date. Additionally the relative influence of various factors (e.g., economics, personal values, community structure) on rates of land conversion has yet to be determined. Such information is useful as understanding may inform outreach and policy decisions that could benefit natural resource conservation.An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) will be sued to determine the impacts of land conversion and other human disturbance on lake fish communities. Existing fish collection data from lakes in eastern South Dakota will be combined with several measures of watershed-level disturbance and within-lake water quality to determine which specific measurements of the fish community respond to various levels of human disturbance. This IBI will be shared with regional conservation agencies so that they may adopt this tool to monitor the relative health of lakes. To understand the relative influence of various factors related to land conversion decisions, semi-structured interviews and follow-up correspondences will be completed with farmers, ranchers, and other relevant stakeholders in South Dakota. The interviews and correspondence will be coded and a model will be developed that will allow estimation of land conversion rates in the future under various scenarios. This model will be shared with conservation agencies and the stakeholder groups identified in the interviews. Finally, a series of workshops will be held with producers in Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota to inform these stakeholders about various conservation concerns in the PPR region, how these factors may influence them in the future, and what they might do on their land to help alleviate these concerns. Participants will be surveyed throughout the program on perceptions of land use change and projected environmental and social consequences of such change, conservation priorities and mechanisms, and the motivations that influence their decision making processes. Producers (i.e., ranchers and rowcrop producers) will be targeted in this objective.

1141,"Significant changes have occurred in field corn production over the last 10 to 15 years. Introduction of corn hybrids with insect resistance traits (transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis traits) have provided southern corn growers with tools to effectively manage the corn borer complex (Southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar; sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.); and European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (H&uuml;bner)). These transgenic Bt traits (YieldGard, and Herculex I) had little activity against ear feeding caterpillars, except Herculex I which has activity against fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith). Newer Bt technologies (VT Triple Pro, SmartStax, and Viptera) that express more than one trait generally have substantially more activity against ear feeding caterpillars, particularly corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie). Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of Bt corn technologies against corn earworm infesting corn ears (Storer et. al., 2001, Buntin et. al., 2004a, Buntin et. al., 2004b). These studies used non Bt near isolines as comparisons for the transgenic Bt isolines, however differences in yield potential may exist between the transgenic and non-transgenic isolines. This increased efficacy has not consistently translated into yield increases (Chilcutt et al., 2007, Buntin (2008). Corn earworm has historically not been considered an economic pest of field corn, because there were no economical control measures for this insect. Because of this, the impact of corn earworm infestations field corn yield has not been fully investigated. Therefore, the value of newer Bt corn technologies cannot be adequately estimated with respect to corn earworm.Early season soil insect pests of corn are somewhat sporadic in Mississippi. When present, this pest complex can have a substantial impact on yield. This pest complex includes southern corn rootworm, Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardii Barber; wireworms, Elateridae; white grubs, Phyllophaga spp.; and seed corn maggot, Delia platura (Meigen); (Drees 1999, Eckenrode and Webb 1999, Keaster and Riley 1999, McCleod et al. 1999). Management considerations for the soil insect pest complex must be addressed at planting. The primary control measure for soil insect pests is insecticidal seed treatments, all of which are in the neonicotinoid class. With national and global concerns of the impact of neonicotinoids on pollinators, alternative control measures for early season soil insect pests of corn need to be investigated.Historically, soybean production in the Mississippi Delta region of the mid southern United States involved planting Maturity Group V, VI, and VII varieties which were planted in May and June. Recently, growers have transitioned to Maturity Group IV and V varieties planted in April and May (Early Soybean Production System) (Heatherly 1999). Another aspect of this is that many of the Maturity Group V varieties and the Maturity Group VI and VII varieties have a determinate growth habit. In contrast, the Maturity Group IV and some of the earlier maturing Maturity Group V varieties have an indeterminate growth habit. This shift in production systems along with increased management intensity has lead to increases in yield potential (Heatherly and Bowers 1998). Soybean acreage in Mississippi has increased from 1.43 million acres in 2007 to 2.22 million acres during 2010 (Musser and Catchot 2008, Musser et al. 2011). Much of this increased acreage has been planted to later maturing varieties for logistical reasons. These varieties tend to be planted later which extends the growing season into late summer and early fall when insect populations are higher. Later maturing varieties are also subject to insect injury for a longer period of time.Corn earworm (i.e. bollworm) can be a very damaging pest of soybeans. This pest feeds on the flowers and developing pods causing direct yield loss. During 2008 to 2011, the number of acres in Mississippi infested with corn earworm has ranged from 650,000 to 1,100,000 and the number of acres treated has increased from 250,000 to 750,000 (Musser et al. 2009, 2012). Also, the average number of applications has ranged from 1 application to 2.1 during this period. For many years the treatment threshold for corn earworm in Mississippi was 15 larvae / 25 sweeps or 4 larvae / foot of row (Catchot et al. 2009). Many growers, consultants, and entomologists felt that this threshold was too high. Through discussions among university entomologists from Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee, the threshold was reduced to 9 larvae / 25 sweeps or 3 larvae per row foot during 2010. An extensive literature search found several studies investigating corn earworm thresholds in soybeans. These include McAllister et al. 1958, Kincade et al.1971, Smith and Bass 1971, Miller 1972, Smith and Bass 1972a, Smith and Bass 1972b, Stern 1973, Thomas et al. 1974, Boldt et al. 1975, Thomas et al. 1976, Mueller and Engroff 1980, McPherson and Moss 1989, Eckel et al. 1992. However, these studies were conducted many years ago using determinate Maturity Group 6 and 7 varieties. The results of several of these studies loosely correspond with the current treatment threshold recommendations. With the increase in number of insecticide applications for corn earworm, changes in production systems, and the increased value of soybeans, accurate and reliable treatment thresholds are critical.As with corn earworm, treatment thresholds for many soybean insect pests were developed many years ago when soybeans were produced using production practices that are very different from those currently used. Treatment threshold for insect pests must be refined / validated periodically as production practices, i.e. drastic changes in planting dates and varieties of different maturities, evolve.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1142,"The project will be conducted at Verona, MS on a Marietta loam soil and at Stoneville on a Bosket/Dubbs silt loam complex, and a Savannah soil at Preston. These soils are representative of types from the Blackland Prairie, Southern Mississippi River Alluvium and Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Areas. The objective of the Verona and Stoneville studies is to evaluate the effects of corn and soybean soil management systems, in a corn-soybean rotation, on soil health and grain yield. Tillage treatments [no-tillage, bed-roll, disk + subsoil-bed-roll (one-pass operation), and subsoil-bed-roll] are the main plot treatments (Verona and Stoneville. At Preston the objective is to track the change in soil health under the conversion from conventionally-tilled vegetable production to no-till plus cover crops and from no-till without cover crops to no-till plus cover crops. These treatments will be on the same site for the duration of the study. Data to be collected at each location will include: operations performed, grain yield, soil health factors, crop emergence, stand uniformity/spatial variability, crop residue yield and nutrient analysis. Prior to fall tillage operations, each plot will be sampled to determine soil quality indicators (physical, chemical and biological properties) as specified by NRCS (NRCS, 2010b). Soil surface cover (crop residue and vegetation) will be determined after fall tillage operations and at planting by accepted procedures. The yield together with soil health indicators will indicate which soil management system provided the highest productivity and positive or negative impact on soil health. It is expected that fewer tillage operations will have a greater positive impact on soil health and yield, while lowering crop production inputs. Upon completion of the study, we will be able to provide the information enabling growers to understand how they can promote or alter soil health on their farm for increased input efficiency for tillage, fertilizer nutrients and water.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1143,"Cercospora leaf blight has become one of the most important diseases affecting soybean in the Gulf South. It not only has a significant impact on yield, it is also associated with a physiological disorder known as green stem, which greatly affects commercial harvesting operations. We have shown that the pathogen affects plants by producing a well-known toxin, which also acts as a biological chelator (siderophore). Plants and microbes produce siderophores to sequester minor elements, especially iron, when these elements become limiting for growth. By applying certain iron compounds as foliar sprays, we have shown that toxin production, and hence disease severity, by the pathogen is suppressed. In addition, we have shown that the characteristic symptoms of this disease may be a resistance reaction, and traditional disease resistance breeding strategies may not be applicable with this disease.It has been generally assumed that Cercospora kikuchii is the pathogen responsible for Cercospora leaf blight. With the advent of DNA sequencing technology and computational procedures, we now show that, in fact, the pathogen has not been correctly identified, and there are at least two other species that cause this disease. The practical implications of this finding apply to breeding efforts in which known pathogens must be used to screen for disease resistance. Much more additional work remains to be done in this area as we attempt to assess a worldwide collection of isolates and to sequence the entire genomes of representative strains of the pathogens.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1144,"Feed and feed manufacture comprise over 70% of the cost of poultry production. Currently poultry meat consumption is the primary animal protein consumed in the United States. The majority of US broiler and turkey feed is pelleted. The pelleting process involves the application of heat, moisture, and pressure to induce conformational changes in feed nutrients in order to bind ingredients and create pellets of high structural integrity. Thermal processes of feed manufacture may also effect nutrient availability. Pelleting of wheat and Barley based diets typically increases nutrient availability; however, corn and soybean based diets (most common in US poultry feed formulation) have been consistently demonstrated to be reduced in nutrient availability due to pelleting. In addition, feed additives such as enzymes are common in today&#39;s feed formulation and susceptible to denaturation during feed processing. Enzymes and other micronutrients can also be difficult to assess in terms of activity level and batch uniformity.Feed manufacture equipment and technique are highly variable among commercial feed mills in the US. Changes in ambient temperature, ingredient nutrient level, and feed manufacture technique adjustments contribute to the complexity of the feed manufacture process. Due to the small number of US Universities with feed manufacture research programs and the inability of commercial mills to perform in-house research, the relationship between feed manufacture variables, pellet quality, nutrient availability, poultry performance, and overall production economics is poorly understood.Our long term goal would be to develop a protocol to properly sample feed during manufacture for nutrient, feed additive, and mycotoxin content. These specific inclusion types vary from kg/tonne inclusion to parts per billion inclusion and will likely impact protocol. Next variations in feed processing that decrease nutrient availability as determined by poultry performance and in vivo digestibility assays would be correlated with numerous in vitro assays post proper sampling technique. The best in vitro assay could then be used as an indicator of nutritional quality of pelleted poultry feed.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1145,"Agricultural production systems are constantly evolving in response to population growth and consumer demands. Our global society, economy, and political focus, as well as climate change has produced a shift in energy production priorities towards alternative, renewable energy sources. This shift is not only philosophical, but also results in physical land use changes. Agricultural producers now have new markets for conventional crops (e.g., corn, soybeans) as production of ethanol and biodiesel fuels increase. Additionally, new perennial crops (e.g., Switchgrass) are a viable option as feedstocks (i.e., raw material) for biofuel production. The Midwestern US has a distinct advantage over southern states regarding the implementation of this technology because of historical uses of these taxa for cattle forage and erosion control. In addition, because native grass species have evolved in a regional climate, they require less anthropogenic maintenance when compared to, for example, the current corn-to-ethanol production model used in the U.S. Subsequently, use of perennial grasses may not disrupt ecosystem services as does traditional domestic species monoculture farming. Thus, region-specific information is needed to eliminate knowledge gaps specific to these plant species. We propose to evaluate perennial grasses as feedstocks for production and ecosystem services, thus addressing two MAFES priority research areas: sustainable bioenergy and environmental services, stewardship, and conservation.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1146,"In the southeastern part of the US, particularly in Georgia, the predominant warm season grass is Bermuda grass. There has been recently an increase in the acreage covered by eastern gamagrass but performance data with its use for sheep and goats is lacking. With the phenomenon of global warming, warm season grasses may have an extended growing season particularly in the southern USA. In the southern USA, warm season grassesconstitute mostof the roughage consumed by livestock including small ruminants. The performance of small ruminants fed grass-based diet supplemented with oil, dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), DDGS plus oil replacing corn as source of energy is not well documented. Goats tolerate more fat in their diet compared to other ruminants (cattle and sheep) and there is evidence that goats fed high fat convert into milk fat a larger proportion of their dietary fat. The diversion of corn and soybean oil away from human and animal feed for biofuel and biodiesel production has created a need for alternative energy supplements. DDGS high inprotein and digestible fiber is a good alternative to replace corn and soybean in small ruminant diets. In Experiment 1, sixty four weanedmale kids will be housed in 16 pensand fed one of 8 dietary treatments consisting of 2 types of ground grass (eastern gamagrass: Tripsacum dactyloides; or Bermuda grass: Cynodon dactylon) hay supplemented with 40% grain (control), soybean oil, DDGS or DDGS plus oil for 120 d. Experiment 2 will be similar to Experiment 1 except that animals will be weaned lambs. The same experimental diets will be fed in Experiment 3 to 56 lactating dairy does, 2 weeks after kidding for 28 d.

1147,"Soybean production is increasing to meet the world demand for protein amid dwindling food supplies. Since 2009, the US has produced over 3 billion bushels of soybeans, generating $32 billion in production value (NASS). However, various native and invasive insect pests whose distributions are rapidly expanding and adapting to management practices threaten soybean yield and quality. In the Mid-South, up to 70% of acreage is treated for stink bugs, corn earworm, and other lepidopteran defoliators each year, with the estimated value of yield loss plus management costs of $51.76 per acre. In the Midwest, untreated economic soybean aphid infestations can further reduce production value by 3%, causing an estimated annual loss of $2.4 billion (Tilmon et al. 2011). In the short-term, loss of current highly effective management tactics due to expanding pest complexes is increasing producer costs. In the long-term, the establishment of invasive insect pests will continue to impact soybean ecosystems, including interactions with native pests and the biological control offered by various natural enemies. To address these concerns, coordinated research and Extension delivery are necessary to rapidly understand native and invasive pest biology, develop best management practices, and deliver recommendations to soybean producers",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1148,"In the panhandle of Florida and in north Florida, peanut is a major crop. During the 5-year period 2009-2013, an average of 156,000 acres was planted each year (USDA NASS, 2013). The farm gate value of peanuts in Florida during that time period averaged about $133 million annually. In the southeastern states of Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi, where about 75% of US peanuts are grown, the farm gate value is about $840 million annually. Unlike many traditional crops such as soybean, corn, or cotton, for which private companies develop and deploy the majority of cultivars grown by farmers, the majority of peanut cultivars are bred and developed by public sector universities and the USDA. Improved cultivars are essential to the future competitiveness of the peanut industry. New cultivars with improved disease resistance can help to reduce the nearly $70 per acre spent to control fungal diseases in addition to increasing pod yield. For 93 years, the peanut breeding program of the University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences has served the southeastern peanut industry by providing improved cultivars, germplasm and knowledge. University of Florida-IFAS cultivars with improved disease resistance are used throughout the southeastern US and have contributed to the development of cultivars by other Universities and the USDA.

1149,"Objective(s): The overall objective is to refine and improve existing simulation models for corn and potato by developing new, and improving existing, functional relationships between physiological processes and nutrients in the soil and plant tissues. Results of this research will be used to address existing knowledge gaps in the models especially with respect to carbon, water, and temperature interactions. The modified models will be evaluated by testing simulated responses at plant component and whole plant levels. The potato and corn models, along with a rye cover crop model, and existing models for soybean and corn, will then be used for assessment of the environmental consequences of agricultural management practices on carbon sequestration and nutrient balances. These practices include fertilizer applications, rotations, and cover crops. The specific sub-objectives are 1) to improve simulation of the above- and below-ground potato and corn processes in the areas of: (a) water and nutrient stress effects on growth, development, morphology, and yield, (b) response of root growth and activity (water and nutrient uptake) to soil nutrients (N, P and K), and, c) evaluate the new model components using experimental data; and, 2) intercompare crop and economic models and foster improvements in these models to increase their capability to utilize data from climate scenarios as part of AgMIP.Approach:   Mechanistic models for soybean (GLYCIM), cotton (GOSSYM), corn (MAIZSIM), and potato (SPUDSIM), have been developed in previous projects by this group. The proposed research will broaden the capabilities of the corn and potato models by utilizing data from experiments carried out in unique, state-of-the-art sun-lit growth chambers and field plots. Short and long term experiments will be employed to test hypotheses and develop algorithms for plant processes to be used in the computer models. Data collected by collaborators will be used to test and evaluate the models. A simple Rye model will be developed to simulate a cover crop during the fall-winter season. A computer graphical user interface will be developed using components from the existing software program, GUICS, to allow a user to simulate long term crop rotations over multiple growing seasons. Advanced data management capabilities will be added to the interface to help with interpretation and management of input and output data. Tools for weather generation and estimation of soil hydraulic properties will be added to the interface to provide a wide range of environmental conditions for assessment.

Combine high seed protein content and high-yield in MG III U.S. adapted soybean germplasm.Approach:   Develop genetic resources for increasing the profitability and sustainability of the U.S. soybean crop and to make it more competitive in international markets. Stress resistant crops are extremely useful for environmentally sustainable, economically viable production and integrated pest management systems. Developing cultivars with genetic resistance to biotic stresses involves: (i) identification of new sources of resistance by screening germplasm, (ii) characterization of the resistance genes and (iii) integration of the resistance genes into desired cultivars or elite breeding lines. The USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection at Urbana, IL has nearly 20,000 soybean genotypes, most of which are poorly adapted plant introductions (PIs) from other countries. These PIs are often important sources of resistance to biotic stress. However, integration of resistance genes from PIs into adapted cultivars is often associated with yield reduction and other deleterious effects (linkage drag) due to transfer of undesirable alleles from the PIs that are tightly linked to the resistance genes. Marker assisted breeding (MAB) can be used to reduce the transfer of such undesirable alleles. In addition, MAB can reduce the time needed to transfer genes from PIs to cultivars.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1151,"Objective(s): Objectives are: 1) Control off-target drift and enhance penetration of active ingredients, such as fungicides and biological control agents, into crop canopies; and 2) Develop remote sensing methods, utilize and evaluate Global Positioning Systems (GPS), develop methods amendable to rapid image processing, and evaluate flow control systems to support variable rate aerial application.Approach:   This project seeks to advance application technology through improvements in 1) drift management technology, 2) technologies for improved within-canopy deposition, 3) use of low-altitude remote sensing to identify stressed plants, and 4) performance of variable rate aerial application systems. While drift management is a concern for all pesticide applications, it is of particular concern for aerial applications. The potential for drift is greater for aerial application due to higher altitudes of spray release and greater air turbulence in the wake of the aircraft. Determination of optimal spray release height will be a goal, as the effect of this variable on within-canopy deposition and off-target drift has not been considered adequately. Experiments for both drift and deposition will attempt to reduce confounding of treatment data with environmental effects, preserving statistical precision of the experiments. Penetration of sprayed material to the lower portions of the canopy is critical for control of fungal spore diseases like Asian Soybean Rust (ASR). Studies will compare nozzle types paired with carefully selected formulations and tank mixes for spray penetration. The deleterious effects of off-target herbicide drift of cotton will be detected using hyperspectral, multispectral, and thermal remote sensing techniques.

1152,"Background: The BRCA-1 gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein involved in DNA repair and transcription control. In women who carry a mutated BRCA-1 allele (BRCA-1+/-), the silencing of the wild-type (WT) allele creates a BRCA-1-/- -like phenotype, which is associated with a high probability (~60%-80%) of developing breast cancer. On the other hand, sporadic breast cancers, which represent the vast majority (~90%) of breast tumor cases, do not have mutations in the BRCA-1 gene (BRCA-1+/+), but have absent or markedly reduced levels of BRCA-1 protein. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that contribute to silencing of BRCA-1 has important implications for the prevention of both hereditary and sporadic breast tumors. Epigenetics refers to modifications in chromatin structure (i.e., histone and DNA CpG methylation) and non-coding RNAs. Sporadic breast cancers that have CpG methylated BRCA-1 promoter share phenotypic characteristics (BRCAness) with hereditary BRCA-1 mutation tumors, i.e., they tend to be triple-negative (TNBC) with reduced or absent expression of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), and epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her2) (ER-/PR-/Her2-). CpG methylation of the BRCA-1 promoter is associated with reduced BRCA-1 expression in 50%-60% of higher histological grade sporadic tumors. Although TNBC account for only 20% of breast cancer cases, their poor prognosis and lack of treatment options are responsible for a disproportionate number of breast cancer deaths.The overarching challenge is to identify what makes the breast susceptible to cancer development, and more specifically, the mechanisms that link epigenetic silencing of the BRCA-1 gene to the development of TNBCs. Objective/Hypothesis: The main objective of this project is to examine whether mammary tumor promotion in adult life is influenced by interactions between BRCA-1 genotype (i.e., BRCA-1 WT vs. BRCA-1 +/-) and in utero exposure to dietary compounds that influence CpG methylation. We hypothesize that in utero exposure to the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor and soy isoflavone genistein prevents CpG methylation of the BRCA-1 gene and development of TNBCs in the offspring. The rationale for this hypothesis stems from preliminary work that uncovered a positive association between in utero CpG methylation at the BRCA-1 gene and reduced BRCA-1 expression in mammary tissue of offspring. Also, our preliminary data indicate that exposure to the carcinogen DMBA (7,12-dimethylbenz[alpha]anthracene) induces mammary tumors that have increased CpG methylation at the BRCA-1 promoter and reduced ERalpha levels.Specific Aims: Aim 1: To examine how interactions between BRCA-1 genotype (i.e., BRCA-1 WT vs. BRCA-1+/-) and in utero exposure to genistein impact CpG methylation of BRCA-1 and genes associated with the TNBC phenotype in offspring. Aim 2: To examine how interactions between BRCA-1 genotype (i.e., BRCA-1 WT vs. BRCA-1+/-) and in utero exposure to genistein impact the development of TNBCs in offspring.Study Design: Aim 1 will examine the interactions between in utero exposure to genistein and BRCA-1 genotype (WT vs. conditional heterozygous) on CpG methylation associated with the TNBC phenotype in female offspring. Aim 2 will examine the combinatorial effects of in utero exposure to genistein and BRCA-1 genotype on development of TNBC mammary tumors. This design will provide the opportunity to study the role of maternal exposure to genistein on the epigenetic process leading to the development of TNBCs in women carrying WT(+/+) or hererozygous (+/-) BRCA-1.Impact: Genistein is a common food isoflavone with antagonistic properties toward DNMT enzymes that place methylation marks at CpGs. Therefore, this proposal integrates etiological and dietary factors with broad impact for the prevention of TNBCs, for which prospects for treatment remain poor.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

1154,"Objective(s): Increasing evidence points to a core honey bee gut microbiota, however the distribution and function of peripheral bacterial and fungal communities in honeybees and their food stores are relatively unknown. Our work will focus on bee bread to define the contribution of unknown and seemingly benign microbes to colony health and nutrition. Bee bread provides the bulk of proteins, vitamins and lipids that bees consume. We will determine the microbial succession in bee bread to understand the distribution of these bee bread-associated microbial communities and whether these communities contribute to the nutritive value of pollen, its digestion and storage, and the potential for disease transmission and amplification. We will examine factors associated with beekeeping and agricultural practices that may affect the microbial balance of the honey bee and its stored food, including colony origin, supplemental feeding, nectar source, pollen type, and exposure to biocides. These data will inform our perspective on how microbial communities contribute to colony health.  OBJECTIVES Our overall goal is to provide beekeepers and growers with practical advice for the maintenance of transitory commercial honey bee populations. Using a combination of laboratory and field approaches we will develop an understanding of the diversity, abundance, persistence and functional capacities of the microorganisms that occur in bees, stored food, the hive, and the general pollination environment. This information will be applied to the management of disease, nutrition, overwintering and biocides in the context of commercial beekeeping.    Objective 1: Determine the core fungal microbiota in bee bread and determine relationships with bacterial communities.  Subobjective 1A: Enumerate, identify, and characterize the core fungal and bacterial microbiota of bee bread.  Objective 2: Characterize microbial succession in bee bread, including core and non-core microbes and their persistence  Approach: Subobjective 1A: Determine whether bee bread contains a core microbial community. Bee bread will be sampled from multiple colonies, apiaries, and commercial operations across a variety of locations and seasons. rRNA will be used to characterize the active microbiota of bee bread. Fungal and bacterial groups identified at different levels of taxonomic certainty will be examined for significant co-occurrence using a variety of available metrics (including options for degenerate matrices) and a null hypothesis of random community assembly. Subobjective 2A: Determine whether the active microbial (bacterial and fungal) community remains constant as corbicular pollen becomes bee bread and as bee bread ages. We will detail the active fungal and bacterial communities in multiple colonies, controlling for the source of corbicular pollen and season. Multiple replicates of bee bread at 0.5, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days of age will be sampled and processed for microbial composition. Dependent upon the predictability of a  core  functional set of successional genes in bee bread, we will develop metagenomic profiling methods for a more efficient characterization of microbial function. Subobjective 2B: Determine whether the microbial communities of overwintered bee bread sampled from old wax comb differ from those of new wax comb. Bee bread will be collected in RNA later from both old and new wax comb from commercial beekeeping operations. RNA extracted from bee bread will be subject to 454 amplicon sequencing and compared according to overwintering status and comb age. If differences in the microbial communities are discovered, we will determine the nutrients, preservatives and metabolites associated with these changes. Subobjective 3A: Determine whether supplemental feed affects the active honey bee gut microbial community. Bees will be fed commonly used brewer's yeast/soy/sucrose-based nutritional supplements containing thymol alone, citric acid alone, thymol and citric acid, honey bee healthy, no additives, and fresh bee bread/honey as a control. RNA will be extracted from these pooled samples and community composition of the gut will be assessed using qRT-PCR targeted to the core gut bacteria. Subobjective 3B: Determine whether the active microbial communities in bee bread differ by pollination environment. We will sample both corbicular pollen and bee bread microbial communities of colonies actively pollinating two distantly located monocultures and two distantly located plant polycultures. Samples will be subject to qRT-PCR targeting specific genera, and also pooled by colony and subject to 454 amplicon sequencing for comparative purposes. If species-specific qRT-PCR primers prove overly time consuming or inefficient, we will rely on the sequencing of major functional COGs. Subobjective 3C: Determine whether the microbes and nutrition in bee bread are affected by fungicide. Endura fungicide will be applied at field concentrations to a Brassica mix grown in greenhouses. Bees will be allowed to forage on fungicide sprayed and non-fungicide controls.

1155,"Objective(s): Diet is a lifestyle factor that is fairly easy to change and can have a significant impact on health. The human diet contains thousands of bioactive food components which have a multitude of physiologic actions, some of which can interrupt processes in the development of a host of chronic diseases. The goal of this project plan is to enhance the understanding of biological actions of food-based bioactive compounds to improve their efficacy in promoting health and preventing disease. We have organized the research team to broadly address the main factors affecting health benefits of dietary bioactive compounds: how much is in the food (content), how much we absorb from the food and how well we retain it (bioavailability/metabolism/elimination), and how the bioactive compounds work in the body (mechanisms of action). With respect to content, we intend to address agricultural practices that impact the amount of bioactive compounds present in crops and how to extend the shelf life of agricultural products. With respect to bioavailability, metabolism, and elimination, we intend to study both phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of individuals that impact the body’s nutrient handling. With respect to mechanisms of action, we will address reduction of risk for cancer, as well as other obesity related diseases.

Delineate bioavailability, pathways of metabolism, and rates of elimination of bioactive substances from common foods (e.g., polyphenols, sulfur compounds, and other compounds as appropriate), and identify characteristics of humans that influence the body’s utilization of those bioactive substances. Objective 2. Determine the impact of bioactive substances from common foods (e.g., polyphenols, sulfur compounds, and other compoun  Approach: Epidemiological studies have shown that diets high in fruits and vegetables are associated with decreased risk of chronic diseases. However, the scientific foundation necessary to translate these epidemiological findings into dietary recommendations is weak. Studies will be conducted to determine the effect of postharvest processing on phytonutrient content. The initial focus of the postharvest studies will be leaf lettuce and tomatoes, and these studies will be expanded to include kale, spinach, swiss chard, and/or strawberries. Several studies will be conducted on phytonutrient (anthocyanins) bioavailability and metabolism. Methods will be developed to isotopically label quercetin in lettuce and isoflavones in soy. The influence of phytonutrients on biomarkers of chronic disease will be investigated, with an initial focus on phytonutrients found in garlic due to possible roles in cancer prevention. Genotyping will be included in clinical studies whenever sufficient scientific justification exists. This research will be conducted through plant growth and postharvest studies, human feeding trials, quantitative and qualitative chemistry, molecular biology, and kinetic mathematical modeling techniques. Information generated from this project can be used to develop recommendations for dietary intakes of phytonutrients that will improve health and reduce risk of chronic disease.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1156,"Objective(s): The overall goal of our research is to define the nutritional distresses and critical windows of development that alter physical activity (PA); understand the various factors that regulate mammary gland (MG) function in lactating mothers; and contribute to the development of nutritionally enhanced plant foods and assess their impact on human health. Specific objectives of this research include: 1) determine the effects of nutrition during critical window(s) of development on voluntary PA during late adolescence and middle age using mouse models; 2) determine the relative contributions of skeletal muscle mass, composition and contractile properties, exercise capacity, motor coordination, and behavior to the differences in voluntary PA induced by the nutritional perturbations incurred in early life; 3) determine the changes in gene and protein expression in skeletal and cardiac muscle and/or brain that contribute to the PA phenotypes induced by alterations in early life; 5) removed due to vacant position; 6) identify new genes required for calcium oxalate formation in Medicago truncatula; 7) identify genes required for calcium oxalate formation in Glycine max (soybean) and modify calcium oxalate content in Glycine max; 8) determine if microRNAs with plant-associated end chemistry can be functionally incorporated into a mammalian RNA-induced silencing complex/miRNA Ribonuclear Particle; 9) establish that food-associated microRNAs are present and functional in sera and tissues, and establish the relationship between dietary microRNA intake and metabolic changes; 10) determine the pathophysiology of lactation failure in obese women, including the role of progesterone, prolactin, and oxytocin in lactation in obese, as compared to normal weight women; 11) determine the importance of macrophage-mineralocorticoid receptor interaction to mammary gland development; 12) determine in obese and non-obese lactating women, the relationship between obesity, and maternal  Approach: These research studies will use various techniques to accomplish the research to be undertaken.  Complex and coordinated studies will be performed in mouse models to define the nutritional perturbations (over- and under-nutrition) and critical windows of development (pre- vs. postnatal) that alter physical activity in adulthood; define the type of activity that is altered; and elucidate the physiological basis for the observed changes. Obese and non-obese recent mothers will be recruited, studied, and recorded to evaluate hormone responses to breastfeeding, particularly to evaluate prolactin secretion and progesterone levels as well as oxytocin response variables. MRI scans will be used to evaluate the activation of dopamine-associated brain reward regions in response to seeing own vs. unknown infant face cues. Additionally mice will be utilized to determine if ablation of macrophages during late pregnancy in obese mice will restore milk production and allow for the support of normal weight gain in cross-fostered litters; and we will attempt to understand how stem and progenitor cells are affected by obesity that lead to altered lactation capacity. Genome-wide association analysis will be employed to identify genomic loci associated with altered nutritional traits.  We will also identify the plant genes that synthesize oxalate and calcium oxalate, and this information will be used to design strategies to manipulate oxalate content in important food plants (such as soybean) for the purpose of improving nutritional quality.  Experiments will be conducted to determine whether food-associated plant microRNAs are present and functional in sera and tissues, and to establish the relationship between dietary microRNA intake and metabolic changes. Finally, studies will occur on enzyme kinetic assays and in vitro models of liver (HepG2) and prostate (DU-145) carotenoid absorption and metabolism to shed light on fundamental gene-lycopene interactions that underlay carotenoid bioactivity.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Determine if bone turnover markers in urine/serum of obese children are improved after short-term interve  Approach: Studies will focus on the various dietary factors found in foods commonly consumed by children, such as breast milk, infant formulas, fruits, grain, milk, and soy to determine their long-term health effects in infants and children.  We will analyze how the early exposure to protein sources and fruits normally consumed by infants and children prevents the initiation of and protects against development of chronic diseases by altering tissue differentiation, inflammation, and/or oxidative status. We will use animal models to mechanistically address the molecular and cellular pathways regulated by intake of various dietary factors (such as in soy foods, berries, grains and milk) in mammary tissue, liver, adipose tissue, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, bone, skeletal muscle and the immune system; identify tissue and serum biomarkers of healthy status associated with these diets; and provide new molecular targets and processes underlying chronic diseases that may be influenced by proper nutrition. Additional work will be undertaken in an observational study of infants, The Beginnings Study, which is a longitudinal study of breast-fed, milk formula-fed, and soy formula-fed children from birth through puberty, will evaluate growth, development, body composition, metabolism, bone development, and immune system development and function. Animal models such as the neonatal pig will be utilized to explore molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of early dietary exposures.  Rodent models will be used to understand the parental epigenetic transmission of the effects of maternal obesity and high fat feeding to future generations and underlying molecular, biochemical, and endocrine mechanisms, in the offspring. These studies will be translated in an ongoing longitudinal clinical study of infant body composition in children of lean and overweight women (The Glowing Study). Work will be accomplished by evaluating critical periods of development and vulnerable stages of life (i.e. the nutritional status of women at the moment of conception; nutritional and developmental issues during pregnancy and lactation). Children (infants, toddlers, and school-aged youths) will be studied to evaluate the effects of infant diet (specifically, breast-milk and a variety of infant formulas) on morphological, neurophysiological, behavioral, and cognitive development in infants and children. Nutritional status assessments, anthropometric measurements, body composition, energy metabolism, physical activity fitness, urine and blood analysis, and measures of brain structure (MRI imaging), psychological and behavioral status (standardized testing), neuropsychological, and cognitive measures will be obtained and analyzed.

1159,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Widely used to promote cardiovascular health, grape seed extract (GSE) contains high levels of proanthocyanidins with strong antioxidant properties. In preliminary in vitro studies, we identifie a variety of GSE-mediated anti-neoplastic mechanisms, including induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation via down-regulation of specific microRNA (miRNA). We now aim to translate these in vitro findings and set the stage for future clinical trial. A standardized GSE preparation complexed with soy phospholipids into phytosomes to improve bioavailability (Leucoselect) is available over the counter. Leucoselect has been shown to improve the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and reduce LDL susceptibility to oxidative stress in heavy smokers, but the potential of Leucoselect against lung cancer has never been evaluated. We therefore hypothesize that oral administration of Leucoselect will exert antineoplastic effects andfavorably modulate mechanisms associated with lung cancer. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim #1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK)/ pharmacodynamics (PD), and anti-cancer effects of Leucoselect in mouse models. A dose range finding study with leucoselect will be conducted in nude mice given varying doses via oral gavage. Blood and lung samples will be obtained to determine PK of grape seed procyanidin (GSP) and metabolites as surrogate markers of bioavailability of GSE (systemically and in the lungs), and to establish the MTD over 2 weeks treatment duration. Aim #1.1: To determine the bioactivity of oral Leucoselect at the targeted organ site using a novel co-culture system of snap frozen mouse lung sections with human lung neoplastic cells. Bioactivity in the lungs will be assessed by comparing lung tissue sections from control vs. Leucoselect treated mice co-cultured with the human nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, A549, and the bronchial premaligant cell line, 1198. The effects of varying GSE doses on proliferation and apoptosis in co-cultured A549 and 1198 cells will be correlated to GSP and metabolites levels. Aim #2: To determine the anti-caner effects of Leucoselect on lung cancer xenograft models. Varying doses of Leucoselect based on MTD will be administered via oral gavage to mice bearing subcutaneous NSCLC xenografts for up to 8 weeks, with serial collections of plasma, lung tissues and tumor xenografts from each treatment group. The anticancer effects will be determined by tumor growth delay or time to reach maximum tumor volume, proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptotic (cleaved caspase 3) indices, and correlated to GSP levels in plasma, lung tissue, and xenograft tumor samples. Aim #2.1: To further characterize and correlate the mechanistic effects of Leucoselect against lung cancer in xenograft models. The mechanistic effects of GSE will be measured by modulations of: 1) COX-2 expression and PGE2 production, and 2) Additional markers of inflammations: 15(S)-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and 3) mir-19a, -19b and -106b levels, 4) cancer relevant, pathway specific gene expression profiles (GEP), 5) microRNA expression, and 6) common biomarkers of cancerization such as p53, p27, p21 and p16, in various sample types. Aim #3: To validate and characterize the roles of mir-19a, mir-19b, and mir-106b in mediating the anti- neoplastic effects of Leucoselect and examine the potential of plasma mir-19a, mir-19b, mir-106b as SEBM for therapeutic monitoring. In our preliminary in vitro studies, we have identified significant down-regulation of 3 oncomirs: mir-19a, mir-19b, and mir-106b in NSCLC and 1198 cell lines by GSE. These miRNAs are among the major plasma miRNAs identified to be predictors of lung cancer development. Therefore, we will measure these miRNA levels in plasma obtained from xenograft models to determine their utility as surrogate endpoint biomarkers (SEBM). IMPACT: Findings from the study will provide important insights into the feasibility and mechanistic effects of GSE against lung cancer, help identify SEBM and pave the way for clinical trials in the near future. The potential gain for the management and prevention oflung cancer is enormous.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
1160,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Work funded under the PI's previous VA Merit award has contributed directly to a novel and now widely accepted life-saving treatment for local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) resuscitation has also been used in many instances to rapidly reverse acute cardiac and neurological symptoms of toxicity caused by a wide range of lipophilic (fat soluble) medications. In many published case reports involving LAST or other overdoses, ILE was effective even after standard resuscitation measures had failed. ILE is now a principle element in treatment guidelines published by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia, the Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, the Resuscitation Council (UK) and was added to the most recent American Heart Association ACLS guidelines for treating LAST. Drug overdose is the second leading cause of accidental death in the United States contributing to 36,000 fatalities in 2007 placing it ahead of gunshot wounds and just behind motor vehicle accidents. Moreover, veterans are at particular risk given the prevalence of both illicit drug abuse and the difficulty for a geriatric population to adhere to instructions for such prescription drugs as long acting calcium channel blockers that can be potentially fatal in overdose. Notably, ILE has been used effectively in treating overdose of many common prescription medications (e.g. beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants or calcium channel blockers) that can be highly resistant to standard resuscitation measures. Identifying the precise mechanism(s) underlying ILE holds the promise of improving its efficacy and providing an effective, generic antidotal treatment for a range of life-threatening toxic drug overdoses. However, the precise mechanisms of ILE are not well understood. The conventional explanation involves partitioning of the offending toxin into the newly created lipemic plasma phase, or 'lipid sink'. However, even this mechanism has not been tested rigorously in vivo. Moreover, we have observed that key aspects of ILE cannot be explained by the sink alone, indicating that other, less well-understood, mechanisms are also at play. We believe that ILE also directly benefits cardiovascular function and have confirmed in preliminary experiments that the infusion of lipid emulsion in the intact rat exerts positive effecs on cardiac contractility and aortic blood flow. We hypothesize that this results in part from direc, positive effects of fatty acid metabolism on cardiac function. Moreover, it is well-established tha tissue ischemia can cause intercellular endothelial gaps to expand, thereby allowing liposomes to migrate into the myocardial interstitium. Such passive targeting of lipid particles, essentiallynano-medicine, will bypass the normal tissue barriers to diffusion of drug away from cells and diminish the response time to lipid signal effectors. We hypothesize that extravascular migration of lipid particles contributes to the overall efficacy of ILE in reversing cardiac drug toxicity. W propose studies to test the metabolic effects of ILE and transendothelial migration of lipid particles. Finally, we seek to improve the translation of ILE to cocaine-related toxicity and longer-lasting overdoses such as calcium channel blocker toxicity. Improved patient safety and outcomes from drug toxicity are the over-arching goals of this project.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1161,"AbstractParenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) is a significant complication of prolonged parenteralnutrition. An estimated 50,000 infants are at risk to develop PNAC each year in the United States. Thedisease is particularly common in premature infants and those who undergo major gastrointestinal operationsin the neonatal period. PNAC is associated with a 50% risk of sepsis and a mortality rate as high as 20% to30%. Studies have shown that soybean-based fat emulsions have a direct causative effect on thedevelopment of cholestasis and its progression to liver failure but this product remains the only FDA-approvedintravenous lipid available in the United States. Given these two factors, several strategies have beenundertaken to minimize the deleterious effects of soybean-based fat emulsions on the liver. One promisingapproach is the administration of a lower dose of the IV fat emulsion as both a treatment and preventativeapproach for PNAC. While IV fat emulsion dose reduction appears to offer substantial benefit in the treatmentand prevention of PNAC in infants in small, retrospective evaluations, data from well-controlled clinical studiesare not available. Several questions regarding IV fat emulsion dose reduction remain. Specifically, the timingof dose reduction and the optimal dose have not been elucidated. The overall long-term safety of thesestrategies in this population remain unknown particularly as they relate to neurodevelopmental outcomes.Limiting the dose of IV fat emulsion may have a negative effect on essential fatty acid levels which in turn mayaffect neurologic and behavioral development as essential fatty acids are crucial during brain development inthe neonatal period. Little data exist regarding the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonatestreated with IV fat emulsion dose reduction.This study will evaluate the hypothesis that a lower dose of IV fat emulsion will prevent and/or reducethe severity of PNAC when compared to a standard dose of IV fat emulsion without having negativeeffects on growth or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Study subjects will include surgical neonates who willbe dependent on parenteral nutrition for a prolonged period of time. Subjects will be enrolled in a prospective,randomized multi-center trial comparing IV fat emulsion given at a standard (3 g/kg/day) or reduced (1g/kg/day) dose. The primary outcome measure will be a comparison of the rate of rise of direct bilirubinbetween the two groups. Secondary outcome measures will include the time to development of PNAC as wellas the incidence of essential fatty acid deficiency and/or poor growth in both study arms. Finally,neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed in all subjects at 12 and 24 months of age to assess the long-term safety of this treatment modality.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1162,"Project SummaryLarge scale events like the Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig Explosion of 2010 and infant formulapurposely fortified with melamine in China cause great concern and heighten the level of awarenessof the importance of food safety. Local, state, and national response mechanisms are in place toquickly respond to these situations and help mitigate unforeseen consequences while protectingpublic and environmental health. Unfortunately, response assets at every level can quickly becomeoverwhelmed and may require surge or redundant capacity. The Food and Drug Administration FoodEmergency Response Network (FDA FERN) is one system in place that is comprised of both federaland state laboratories that bring personnel, supplies, equipment, and expertise together to enablefood and food product analyses during these situations. Many laboratories are volunteer laboratories,but 14 member laboratories have entered cooperative agreements for chemistry analysis and arenow referred to as FERN cCAP Laboratories. The Arkansas Department of Health-Arkansas PublicHealth Laboratory (ADH-PHL) became a FERN cCAP Laboratory in 2009 and has built a strongfoundation for food chemical analyses, method development, and emergency response.ADH-PHL provides a state-of-the-art laboratory environment for maintaining the Arkansas FERNChemistry Laboratory. Dedicated laboratory space, technical expertise, quality management systems,ISO 17025 accreditation as well as additional support staff, instrumentation, and space are availableif necessary. The entire laboratory staff has experience in the four key project areas of GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, and ELISA. ADH-PHL also partners with other federal response networks managed bythe Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency where ADH-PHL hasexercised and utilized the Incident Command Center within the state as well as nationally. Thisknowledge is crucial for mitigating large scale crises where food safety and human health isendangered.The Arkansas FERN Chemistry Laboratory continues to work to expand and enhance the capabilitiesof FERN by working closely with other cCAP laboratories and FDA. The laboratory is fully staffed,continues to cross-train, and validates FERN testing methods on GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, andELISA platforms. The laboratory continues to participate in all proficiency tests provided by FDA andhas exercised its response capabilities by developing new methods to successfully participate inthese proficiency tests. The laboratory participates in all technical and programmatic meetings, whichincludes conference calls. Currently, FERN analysts are actively involved in two, large, multi-laboratory method validations. In the past, the laboratory has analyzed numerous food matricesincluding powdered milk, freeze-dried tuna, spinach, mandarin oranges, pineapple juice, chocolatesyrup, soy-based baby formula, snack cakes, energy drinks, drinkable yogurt, salad dressing, catfish,spirits, snow peas, applesauce, cottage cheese, brown sugar, bottled water, cereal, baby food, fruitjuice and swordfish.

1163,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enhance global food security. Aquaculture is the fastest growing agroindustry while the world fisheries catch has leveled out. Consequently, half of all seafood consumed today is farmed. Unfortunately, at least 30% of fish feed is derived from forage fish, the anchovy and sardine-types at the base of the food chain. With demand for forage fish growing while wild populations remain level at best, the price of fish meal and oil (FM&0) climbs by 15% yearly. Clearly, dependence on FM&O is unsustainable. For fish farmers to thrive without abusing the oceanic ecosystem, substitutes are essential. One solution is to use vegetable-based ingredients such as wheat and soy, but these lack vital omega-3 fatty acids. Another is to turn to the insect world, especially by culturing ecofriendly black soldier fly larvae (BSFL). The larvae are fed seafood residuals mixed with marine kelp and/or microalgae so that the natural omega-3 passes through. The larvae are dried and separated into FM&O-like meal and oil. The overarching question is: can this be accomplished competitively? Apparently it is possible, but a 2-year pilot plant is required to prove the practicality.    The proposed project will not only demonstrate that very large volumes of BSFL can be cultured using omega-3 loaded wastes and algae, but that substitute fish feeds that are palatable, stimulate growth and confer health are feasible. This is best achieved by simultaneously conducting feeding trials with a variety of species, including isolated bottom dwellers such as black sea bass and, alternatively, schooling pelagic creatures such as California yellowtail. Observing degrees of palatability is straight forward. But as with any cuisine there are numerous ways to enhance the offering: live, dried or pelletized and, if the latter, unit size, moisture content and even some surface additive that confers a natural taste ? perhaps crab-like for black sea bass and squid-like for California yellowtail. Such refinements grant significant economic margins by virtue of better survival rates, shorter time in the tanks and less costly ingredients. At this local level, both the farmer and the consumer benefit while globally these gains can favorably impact food security, especially with marine species that only require saltwater, with recirculating system that discharge little or no waste and, of course, with substitute foodstuff derived from waste bio-remediated by flies.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

1166,"Non-technical:   Adhesives are extensively used in several applications and are almost always made from petroleum based starting materials, which is a depleting resource. Therefore replacing these resources with widely available and sustainable materials such as soybean oil for the synthesis of adhesives is a national need. In medicine, adhesives are a critical component, and in several instances such as in a cardiac surgery, medical adhesives are a necessity. However, the performance of human-made adhesives is often less than optimal when it is applied in surgical or wet environments. Nature provides spectacular examples of adhesives that work extraordinarily in wet and harsh conditions. Mussels are able to secrete protein based adhesives that enable them to stick to boats and docks underwater. The PIs have developed an adhesive that is made from readily available and sustainable soybean oil which demonstrates superior adhesion to surfaces in wet conditions. This award is aimed at providing a better understanding of the chemical processes that are responsible for strong adhesion of this soybean oil based adhesive in wet conditions. The PIs will systematically modify the chemical composition of these adhesives and examine the nature of the adhesion. Such studies will enable design of adhesives that perform in challenging environments and which are translationally viable. The award enables graduate students to gain expertise in techniques and methodologies that are at the cutting edge of their field. In addition, the award will provide research opportunities for undergraduate and high school students.   Technical:   Adhesives such as those secreted by mussels and sandcastle worms are impressive for their ability to function in harsh conditions such as sea water and high winds. Synthetic polymers fall far short in their ability to mimic this ability to perform in wet environments. This award is aimed at gaining a better understanding of the interactions at the interface that enable adhesion under wet environments. The PIs have designed a modular polyester platform that enables the incorporation of various functional groups into the designed polyester. The major monomer for the synthesis of the adhesive polyester is derived from soybean oil - a widely available and sustainable resource. The designed polyester will contain long-chain pendant groups derived from soybean oil, which will provide the hydrophobic character to enable exclusion of water. In addition, the adhesion to a substrate will be provided by catechol units. Cohesive strength will be provided by coumarin units that crosslink upon photoirradiation. It will also contain various functional groups such as hydroxyl and amine groups that will affect the adhesion.

1167,"This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the social and environmental implications of smallholder displacement by mechanized soy farming for an important agricultural frontier in the central Amazon Basin.  Mechanized soybean farming has recently crept towards the Amazon Basin, and there is growing concern about the consequences of this expansion on the rainforest.  Past research generally has focused on environmental impacts, namely deforestation via direct encroachments and indirect land-use change at a regional scale. As a result, less is known about the welfare impacts of soybean expansion or about more localized and nuanced land-change outcomes, particularly those associated with smallholder displacement.  The doctoral student will focus on social and environmental processes stemming from such displacements in the central Amazon near the city of Santarem.  He will conduct research that seeks to describe the circumstances under which such displacements occurred, such as whether land was sold at fair market value or was transferred without adequate compensation via coercion.  The student also will address land changes associated with soybean expansion in the central basin.  To this end, he will study the conversion of primary and secondary rainforests on properties transferred from smallholders to soybean interests, and he will examine the deforestation occurring in new frontiers created by the in-migration of smallholders from areas of soybean consolidation.  Research methods will include a survey of smallholders in order to describe the process of land transfer and to ascertain their destination choices upon land transfer to soybean interests as well as analyses of remotely sensed imagery to determine land-change impacts.  This project will address social processes and complex interactions involving multiple agents and their subsequent impacts on the Amazon landscape.  The project will contribute to development of land-change science, which has been long dominated by a paradigm focused on land managers acting in isolation.  This project will help expand this paradigm by showing how multiple land-change outcomes occurring on properties sold and on newly acquired holdings can result from a single land sale, and it can describe how land change occurs as a result of multiple agents and social processes impacted by power relations.  Project results should have policy implications, because little is known about the welfare effects of soybean mechanization, particularly with respect to smallholders.  Information generated by this project should contribute to policy debates regarding ways to balance development and the environment in the Amazon.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1168,"This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project with Ford Motor Company concerns the mechanical behavior of composites of nanometer-sized fibers from woody and herbaceous sources contained in synthetic and naturally derived resins. Research on the manufacture, characterization and mechanics of these materials will be jointly conducted at both the university and industrial partner's facilities. Based on previous research, the materials are expected to have pronounced ability to reduce vibration and to perform well under some impact conditions. Potential applications of the materials are in the public infrastructural area where they could be used in energy dissipation systems such as guard rails and safety flooring. Transportation industries are potential major users of bio-based materials due to the wide diversity of applications and the magnitude of resource consumption and product turnover. Transportation related applications include exterior vehicle body panels, interior energy absorbing material, and bumper energy reinforcements. Nanocellulose is inexpensive, widely available and can displace petroleum used in conventional fillers. Cellulose will be trialed from woody and soy sources. Since soybeans are an excess crop in the United States, industrial uses bolster the nation's farmers. Other broader impacts of the project include a large number of outreach activities, potential applications outside of the target field such as in bioengineering, and the education of a team of REU students, a GSRA and a Ford engineer.  The objective of the project is to create optimized cellulose nanocomposites via a research plan including sophisticated manufacturing techniques, finite element modeling of the composite nanostructure, and, vibration, viscoelastic and rate dependent constitutive testing. A goal is to tune the nanostructure of the materials to yield specific macroscopic characteristics. In preliminary modeling, it has been found that the dynamic response of material nanostructure of biocomposites can benefit from control of regional gradients of strain rate at the nanoscale. A ramification of this result is the suppression of local stress concentrations that are often the sites of dynamic fracture initiation in composites. The research could lead to novel nanocomposites that are well optimized for dynamic applications. Sophisticated manufacturing will advance current state-of-the-art functionalization techniques to improve the compatibility of nanocellulose and common matrix polymers. A full set of dynamic-mechanical data will result for the materials, as well as a model for damping, that would be useful to other researchers. The conclusions from the modeling can indicate how to best construct nanostructure to achieve particular performance characteristics, such as damping, creep, impact resistance and energy dissipation.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1169,"The project focuses on the connection between the nervous and immune systems, an exciting area of active investigation. Emerging evidence indicates that the so-called gut-brain-microbiota axis is very important for health in many different organisms. However, understanding how the nervous system can control host defenses against infection is very limited. Specifically, this research focuses on how neurotransmission in the central nervous system controls gene expression associated with host intestinal defenses in response to pathogens by a well-known molecular signaling pathway (Wnt signaling) in nematodes. Results from this study are expected to elucidate a previously unknown mechanism of neural control of intestinal immunity. The study of nematodes is significant because of their ecological ubiquity and because parasitic nematodes cause severe economic loss (for example, soybean cyst nematodes account for $1.5 billion in crop damage each year in the U.S. alone). In addition, the WNT and nervous system signaling that is the focus of this research using nematodes are conserved in other animals, so that this project will lead to fundamental insights that may be relevant to the nervous system and immune responses of vertebrates, including humans. This project integrates basic science research and a hands-on research experience for a high school teacher as a way to provide experience in the conduct of modern biological research and to have that perspective and understanding communicated to high school students.  Neural control of innate immunity is an exciting emerging aspect of host defense, about which little is understood. This is especially true of nematodes, which are the most abundant animals on the planet and are widely used model organisms. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that wingless-Int1 (Wnt) signaling in neurons distally controls the expression of host defense genes in the intestinal epithelium via neuroendocrine signaling. The objective of this proposal is to understand this mechanism of neuroimmune regulation, by defining upstream signaling components that relay Wnt signals in neurons, and downstream mechanisms that mediate neuronal communication with the intestinal epithelium, thereby testing the central hypothesis. To achieve this objective, the Principal Investigator will elucidate the relevant neuronal and Wnt pathway component, specifically which Wnt ligands are induced, the signaling components functioning in neurons, and specific neurons that are involved. The second aim is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Wnt-activated neurons communicate with the intestine to elicit the host response. The researcher will identify neuronal signal(s) that may activate the intestinal response, the role of intestinal muscarinic receptors, and transcription factors controlled by acetylcholine. Because of the novelty of the Wnt-acetylcholine axis, this research has the potential to radically influence our understanding of host-microbe interactions in nematodes. In addition, because the Wnt pathway and muscarinic signaling are evolutionarily conserved, this research has high potential to catalyze advances in neuroimmunity in other organisms.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1170,"A group of bacteria called rhizobia convert atmospheric nitrogen to a chemical form available to support growth and reproduction of plants in the legume family. The bacteria establish a symbiotic relationship with their legume hosts, residing in root nodules where specialized structures develop to facilitate the exchange of nutrients between the two partners. This is an economically important process as it reduces the amount of nitrogen fertilizer needed to grow crops and is a key component in sustainable agriculture. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the nodulation process should lead to insights about more effective ways to capture and fix atmospheric nitrogen and to the transfer of this capacity to non-legume plants. One notable achievement in our understanding of legume nodulation is the characterization of the signaling steps that control the infection of the plant root hair cell by rhizobia, the initial step of nodulation. This symbiotic pathway is regulated by almost 2000 genes in legume root hair cells. The investigators will characterize a network of genes essential in controlling the early stages of nodulation. In addition to its impact on legume research, the broader impacts of this project include the development of unique educational programs dedicated to Oklahoma high-school and undergraduate students from under-represented groups, promoting strong integration between research and education.  This CAREER project is built on the hypothesis that regulatory networks directly under the control of one or several transcription factors of the symbiotic pathway orchestrate the proper activation and timing of gene expression in root hair cells in response to rhizobia. Specifically focusing on the Nodulation Signaling Pathway1 (NSP1) regulatory network, this project will address two key questions: What is the identity of the soybean and medicago root hair genes directly under the control of NSP1? What are the protein complexes asscociated with NSP1 and how do they control the expression of root hair genes in response to rhizobial inoculation? To answer these questions, the investigators will 1) characterize the soybean root hair genes directly under the control of the transcription factors GmNSP1a and b in response to Bradyrhizobium japonicum through high-throughput sequencing technologies and by applying DamID-seq or ChIP-seq methods, 2) identify the protein partners of the GmNSP1a and b in root hair cells inoculated with B. japonicum by co-immunoprecipitation of the protein partners in root hair cells upon rhizobia inoculation; 3) validate the conservation of the root hair gene regulatory networks between soybean and Medicago truncatula, the model legume.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1171,"Nitrogen (N) is one of the most limiting nutrients for the growth of many plants though it is abundant in the atmosphere. Modern agriculture depends upon chemical N fertilizers that cause extensive environmental damage and are not sustainable. In contrast to the majority of crops, legumes (such as soybean, bean, lentils, alfalfa) form symbiotic associations with soil bacteria, resulting in the formation of nodules in which the bacteria accumulate in high numbers and fix atmospheric N for the plant. Because of N-fixing ability, legumes play an important role in sustainability in both agricultural and natural environments. However, many tree legumes do not form nodules and are thus considered non-N fixing. Many non-nodulating legumes are important components of various ecological systems and are increasingly being used for land reclamation and as biofuel crops. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which non-nodulating legumes obtain their nitrogen will be crucial in improving the utilization of these legumes in nutrient-poor soils. The project will provide opportunities to undergraduate students and a post-doctoral fellow to train in both microbial and plant biology, especially as they relate to plant-microbial interactions. The benefits of research on microbial symbioses will also be emphasized in the urban agriculture initiative at UW Milwaukee.   Legumes are by far the largest contributors of biologically fixed N2 to pristine environments. Although nodulation is often considered to be a distinguishing characteristic of legumes, a large number of species are not known to nodulate. Non-nodulating legumes live in the same native environments as their nodulating 'cousins' and yet have the same in planta N concentrations. Very little , however, is known about the mechanisms of N-acquisition in non-nodulated legumes. This project will explore the hypothesis that non-nodulating legume honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos L.) possesses the potential for symbiotic N2 fixation with rhizobia. Preliminary data from the investigator's laboratory shows the presence of nodule-like structures on the roots of G. triacanthos that contained rhizobia. This project will (i) Elucidate the extent and mechanism of rhizobial colonization in G. triacanthos, (ii) Determine the response of G. triacanthos to rhizobial infection and (iii) Determine the potential of N2-fixation in the G. triacanthos-rhizobial association. In the long term, the results of this project could pave the way to improve N nutrition of non-legumes, including cereal crops that do not form N-fixing symbiosis.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1172,"PI: Wolf Scheible (The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation)   Co-PIs: Michael Udvardi and Patrick Xuechun Zhao (The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation) and Hideki Takahashi (Michigan State University)   Key Collaborators: Michael Sussman (University of Wisconsin-Madison), Hiroo Fukuda (University of Tokyo, Japan), and Fiona McAlister (Southern Oklahoma Technology Center, Ardmore, OK)   Small signaling peptides (SSPs) emerge as an important class of regulatory molecules in plants, especially in the control of plant growth and development in response to environmental cues. Only a few of the many SSPs encoded in plant genomes have been characterized functionally in plants. In this respect, SSP-encoding genes represent some of the potentially most important  dark matter  of plant genomes. Medicago truncatula is a premier model legume species, which is closely related to the most important forage species in the USA, Medicago sativa (alfalfa), and to food legumes such as soybean and common bean. Legumes are key components of sustainable agricultural systems because they form symbioses with bacteria called rhizobia that reduce molecular nitrogen to ammonium in specialized root organs called nodules. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation provides legumes with a source of nitrogen, obviating the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers for these important crop species. Recently, it has become clear that SSPs can control both nodule and root development in legumes and the hunt is on for more SSPs that control important developmental traits in legumes of importance to agriculture. A priority objective of this project therefore is to identify novel SSPs that affect root and nodule development in M. truncatula, with a long-term view of using SSPs in non-transgenic approaches to improve plants for agriculture. Datasets and biological materials generated in this project will be made available through appropriate biological databases and stock centers. A database (MtSSPdb) will be developed and maintained for both project and public access to store, link and present the information on the comparative genomics of peptide-coding genes and to integrate and manage all experimental data emerging from this project. With regard to outreach and training, the project will leverage existing programs to provide research training for postdoctoral associates and graduate, undergraduate and high school students.      A multidisciplinary strategy will be implemented, including bioinformatics, chemical genomics, genetics, biochemistry, molecular and developmental biology. Activities of this project comprise a genome-wide survey of SSP-encoding genes in Medicago truncatula and the identification of macronutrient (N, P, S, and K) -responsive SSP-encoding genes from transcriptome data. A library of genome-encoded, synthetic peptides will be established as a community resource for biochemical genetics and used to screen for developmental and molecular phenotypes in M. truncatula. Constitutive overexpression lines will be produced in Arabidopsis thaliana and M. truncatula for selected SSP-encoding genes that are prioritized because they have been shown to be either strongly responsive to macronutrients (N, P, S, K), produce strong visual/molecular phenotypes when chemically synthesized peptides are exogenously applied to M. truncatula, and/or have their mature peptides predicted to be produced through posttranslational modifications that make chemical synthesis and/or exogenous application impracticable. The synthetic peptides will be further tested for their effects on root nodule development and nitrogen fixation in M. truncatula. The Medicago HAPMAP genotypes will be employed to identify genetic loci associated with natural diversity in response to bioactive peptides, and specific SSPs will also be tested for their efficacy in improving alfalfa performance in the field. Identification of a peptide receptor through genetic or chemo-proteomic approaches is another activity included in this project.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Farmer (National Center for Genome Resources) and Jeremy DeBarry (University of Arizona).   Senior Personnel: Ethalinda K.S. Cannon (Iowa State University)   Legumes play a central role in food security and nearly every cropping system worldwide. Among cultivated plants, legumes such as beans, peas and lentils are unique in their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen which is converted into a soluble organic form that can be taken up by plants through symbiosis with a soil bacterium. Approximately 33% of all nutritional nitrogen comes from legumes which are the most important source of protein in most developing countries. Genomic resources have been or are being developed for many legume crops, but the fragmented nature of these data resources limits the ability of researchers to leverage information generated in one species to infer function or identify candidate genes in another species. The overarching goal of this project is to address this deficiency by developing software and methods for a  Legume Federation  (LF) of diverse, independently funded and geographically separated genomic data portals (GDPs). The LF will facilitate utilization of genomic, genetic and phenotypic information across a wide range of legume species that will allow researchers and breeders to take full advantage of the data that are currently available at the GDPs. The project will provide research training opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds at different educational levels. In the context of outreach, the project will pro-actively engage the community of legume data providers through presentations and workshops at national and international meetings as well as through a central web portal that will provide information describing project goals, methods of implementation and progress reports to the community.    The pace of data collection across crop and model plants has increased dramatically. Most crop species have both a data management problem and great opportunities to access genetic  big data . The objectives of this project are to develop a federation model for legume databases, to facilitate data exchange across a wide range of legume species to enable cross-species translational genomics, and to adapt an existing set of open-source tools for biological information management that will provide a framework for project-oriented data management enabling both long-term integration and widespread use. The specific goals are to:    1). Adopt and port the data currently managed in each of the custom frameworks into a set of well-integrated, open source model organism database tools; 2). Define data formats, metadata standards, data exchange and Web service protocols to facilitate communications between species-centric databases at various levels;  3). Utilize orthology, synteny, and mappings of other significant features to integrate genetic, genomic, and phenotypic data across legume species, to enable identification of common molecular bases for important traits and enable traversal across database projects; 4). Improve the capacity of organism database projects to collect and manage complex phenotype data using ontologies, controlled vocabularies and well-defined protocols and schemas; and,  5). Facilitate productive data exchange by implementing a common, open, virtualized Data Repository for data exchange across sites and for stable, long-term archiving of data sets, standardized metadata, and robust methods for archiving, searching, and accessing data sets from federated GDPs.   It is anticipated that the LF will provide a model for a well-accepted open-source technology stack that can be adopted by other research communities that have limited resources or technical expertise. All data will be freely available to the general public through the project web site and through the associated GDPs that include but are not limited to MedicagoGenome (http://medicagogenome.org), SoyBase (http://soybase.org), PeanutBase (http://peanutbase.org), and the Legume Information System (http://legumeinfo.org).",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1174,"Deforestation, agricultural expansion and climate change are significant threats to the integrity of ecosystems in the Amazon Basin of South America. The effects of these changes on the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and other chemical elements that are essential nutrients for plant and animal life determine how fast vegetation regrows after forests are disturbed, the degree to which various agricultural practices are sustainable, the amounts and types of greenhouse gases that are emitted from soils, and the amount of pollution in groundwater and rivers. Over the last 22 years, the principal investigator of this project has worked with scientists and students from many countries on specific research projects in different parts of the Amazon Basin. Early work showed how important the cycling of soil nutrients is for sustaining cattle pastures with few surviving trees in them, for young re-growing forests, and for older (less disturbed) forests. A big experiment was then conducted where some rain was diverted from an older forest, with the results showing how important water availability is, even in places where it otherwise seems so abundant. Finally, the focus of the most recent research has been on the impacts of more intensive agriculture in the soy and corn cropping systems that have increasingly replaced forests in some parts of the Amazon, along with the role that fire plays in the degradation of forests in the southern part of the Basin. Changes in the Amazon are large scale and rapid, which presents both challenges and opportunities for research. The current project is designed specifically to try and link all of the prior research of the investigator in this region for addressing two main questions. First, how do the relative amounts of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus affect plant growth and the sustainable management of forests, cattle pastures and crop systems across the Amazon Basin? Second, what combinations of these land uses are the most sustainable and how might this change as the climate changes and fire becomes more widespread, as is predicted? In addition to a peer-reviewed monograph for scientific audiences, the investigate will write a book about the importance of nutrient cycling for the sustainability management of Amazonian forests and farms that is intended for a non-specialist audience and will be published in English, Portuguese and Spanish. The book will use real examples of cattle ranching, small-holder farming, large-scale farming, and various types of forest management across the climate gradients of the Amazon Basin, weaving together narratives and data for each.A major focus of this effort is the identification of circumstances where deforestation, farming and fire affect the balance of soil available nitrogen and phosphorus and their relative importance for plant growth and carbon storage in highly contrasting, but representative, ecosystems. Variation in the ratios of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus is the presumed key that will be pursued. As agriculture and beef production intensify, management of nutrients will become increasingly important and challenging across the entire region. This project will synthesize data and study results from the past quarter century that are central to addressing this issue. The investigator is in a unique position to provide accessible, reliable, important and enjoyable reading for a wide audience on the topics of natural resource management, environmental science and sustainability in the Amazon.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1175,"Crop yields depend on effective uptake of water and nutrients by the roots.  A current challenge is to understand how crop plants regulate the formation and function of their roots.  An understanding of the genes that control roots at this level would help plant breeders tailor root traits to match new agricultural practices, land use patterns, and suboptimal soils.  In this project, genome-wide gene expression will be defined from roots and root hairs from a wide range of crop plants and their relatives under various environmental conditions. These gene expression patterns will be analyzed to identify key genes that control the formation and function of roots. Further, these large gene expression datasets will provide a valuable tool for scientists studying many aspects of root biology. The knowledge obtained from this project is expected to provide new insight into the origin, diversification, and conservation of molecular mechanisms used to regulate the formation and function of roots and root hairs of plants. Further, given the important roles of roots/root hairs for plant growth and environmental response, these findings are expected to assist the rational design of strategies to manipulate root and root hair architecture in crop plants, a particularly important goal given concerns about nutrient-poor soils and the impact of environmental change.  This project will provide strong interdisciplinary training for the participating undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. A major outreach activity of this project is a collaborative research visitor exchange program with the College of Charleston (SC), a primarily undergraduate institution, to provide large-scale genomic and computational biology experiences to students who are unable to obtain this training at their home institution. The project will participate in the Michigan Biological Scholars Program, a bridging program assisting first-year undergraduates in the life sciences, especially underrepresented minorities. Finally, aspects of this research will be incorporated into a semester-long laboratory exercise as part of an advanced molecular development course at the University of Michigan. With the rapidly expanding gene and genome sequences available in plants, it is now possible to consider the ultimate goal of defining the gene activities present in every organ and cell type in species throughout the plant kingdom.  This knowledge would dramatically improve the understanding of plant processes and their diversity, and will likely lead to new opportunities for manipulating crop plants. This project is designed as a first step toward this ultimate goal by defining gene expression in a simple plant organ (the root) and a simple plant cell type (the root hair) in diverse plant species. In a preliminary study, expression data has been generated from seven species (rice, maize, soybean, cucumber, tomato, Arabidopsis, and Selaginella), demonstrating the feasibility and potential impact of the proposed research.  This project has two major objectives. The first is to identify sets of regulatory genes associated with specific root structural and functional traits, by defining transcriptomes from the three major zones of activity for the primary roots and other root types from a diverse set of crop plants. In the second objective, cell-specific regulatory genes will be defined by linking gene expression and cell characteristics in the root hair cells from these same plant species grown under normal and nutrient stress conditions. The results of this project are expected to have a significant impact on the plant research community, through the generation of root-zone-specific and root-hair-specific expression data from many diverse species, which will assist efforts to assign function to unknown genes, predict functional homologs, and assess gene evolutionary history.

Riparian forest buffers along streams can reduce the potential negative effects of forest clearing on stream water quality and stream habitat by intercepting nutrients, providing shade to reduce temperature and protecting stream channels. This project investigates how deforestation, cropland expansion and intensification, and increased fertilizer use influence the structure and sustainability of riparian forests, and ultimately affect their capacity to keep nutrient runoff from reaching streams. Research will take place in the Amazon state of Mato Grosso, Brazil's global hotspot of deforestation where soybean cultivation has expanded rapidly in the last two decades. Producers in the region are now shifting from single-cropped soybeans to double-cropped soybeans and corn, which greatly increases fertilizer inputs.

By improving understanding of the trajectories and causes of riparian forest change and predicting the movement of nitrogen through riparian zones, these results will provide a basis for managing the negative impacts of tropical agricultural intensification.

This project will investigate whether riparian forest fragments in cropland maintain their vegetation structure over time and how that structure is influenced by alterations to watershed hydrology and microclimate that are typical of cropland areas.

This will be accomplished by comparing riparian forests in replicated watersheds within intact tropical forest, soybean-only cropland and soybean-corn cropland. The project focuses on the following three hypotheses: (1) Riparian forests in cropland watersheds have higher tree mortality, lower tree growth and a more open canopy than either upland forests or riparian forests in forested watersheds. (2) Cropland watersheds have lower evapotranspiration, greater runoff and nutrient export, higher water tables, and wetter stream side slopes than forest watersheds but denitrification in riparian zones is insufficient to prevent excess nitrogen from reaching streams in double-cropped watersheds.

1177,"Plants often recruit soil microbes in order to enhance nutrient availability and absorption by an assortment of mechanisms. Nitrogen-fixing (NF) symbiosis and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis are two important examples. NF symbiosis has major growth effects on the crops that can form this relationship such as soybean, common bean, pea, peanuts, alfalfa, etc., while AM symbiosis can do the same for many crops that form this symbiosis such as maize and rice. Rice (Oryza sativa), specifically, can have a significant grain yield increase when inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi because of the enhanced nutrient uptake. This can be especially important in parts of the world that rely on this particular crop for the majority of its calories. This award supports research to investigate the role of the SYP132A gene in rice (Oryza sativa) by defining the mycorrhizal phenotype of rice SYP132A mutants.The research could ultimately shed light on a fundamental process in rice (AM symbiosis) that has the potential to greatly increase yield if optimized. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ertao Wang, an expert in AM symbiosis in rice, at the Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology in Shanghai, China.   The nitrogen-fixing (NF) symbiotic pathway in plants evolved from the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiotic pathway, and therefore the molecular mechanisms share many common elements. Protein trafficking from the plant to the bacteria during NF symbiosis has been shown to be indispensable, but protein trafficking during AM symbiosis is most likely important as well. For this proposed project, I will study the role of a syntaxin gene (SYP132A) in mycorrhizal symbiosis. This gene was previously identified to have a role in NF symbiosis in M. truncatula, namely, it specifically marks the membrane surrounding the intracellular bacteria for targeted protein delivery. I will investigate the function of SYP132A by characterizing the mycorrhizal phenotype of rice T-DNA mutant lines. My hypothesis is that this protein marks the membrane that separates host from the fungus within plant cells. This study will provide evidence that the function of SYP132A is universal and spans multiple host and microbial species.

The goal of this project is to create molecular tools to make it easy for geneticists and breeders to identify and study the function of genes associated with desirable agronomic traits. The project will provide laboratory and field research opportunities for postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate students, including students from a predominantly undergraduate institution. In addition, yearly workshops will bring together soybean researchers from across the nation to participate in hands-on training in precision genomics and in screening plant populations to identify new traits of interest.  The resources developed by this project will advance soybean improvement, which in turn can lead to designer oils and proteins for healthier diets, industrial compounds, and biodiesel to meet a growing global demand.  This research will add to the current set of forward and reverse genetics resources available to the plant research community. A key activity will be to develop and characterize the publicly available soybean fast neutron (FN) mutagenesis population with a goal of attaining a biologically relevant amount of genomic coverage.  Concurrently, individual genes within FN deleted regions that alter traits of importance to the soybean community (e.g., yield, oil, protein, stress tolerance, and nitrogen fixation) will be mutated using CRISPER/Cas9 technology to pinpoint the genes responsible for specific phenotypes. In addition, a set of complementary, transposon-based mutagenesis populations will be made to specifically tailor gene discovery for the highly duplicated genome of soybean. TheTnt1 insertional mutagenesis population will result in traditional loss-of-function phenotypes, the Ac/Ds activation tagging population will cause gene mis-expression, and the mPing transposon will be used for both gene silencing and overexpression. These strategies are expected to result in recovery of novel phenotypes not previously observed in soybean.  Data, phenotypes, seeds and other information will be available via the project website at http://soymutants.uga.edu and at SoyBase.org.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1180,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is the improvement of plant genetic transformation (the introduction of new genes via biotechnology approaches). The past two decades of research and commercialization of genetically modified plants have resulted in crop species with improved agronomic traits, such as herbicide tolerance and pest resistance, which have benefitted both farmers and consumers. Whereas the vast majority of corn and soybeans currently grown in the US is genetically modified, transformation of cotton and many other crops, including sunflower, remains difficult. In addition, it has been challenging for scientists to introduce desirable genes into plants without the concomitant introduction of extraneous DNA, resulting in both technical and regulatory complications.  These technical problems have limited production of important products, including rubber, in transformation-recalcitrant plants. Technology developed in this proposal will enable widespread transformation, and thereby commercialization, of a greater number of minor and industrial crop species by reducing product development costs and regulatory barriers. These transformation techniques will be applied toward the expression of industrial products including the sustainable domestic production of natural rubber in non-traditional crops, as well as enabling the creation of more efficient food crops.This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel Agrobacterium-based plant transformation platform to improve the efficiency and quality of transformation events in recalcitrant crops. This technology combines the use of plant histone genes or proteins, which increases transformation efficiency, with  launching  Agrobacterium T-DNA from the bacterial chromosome, which decreases integrated transgene copy number and eliminates integration of extraneous vector sequences that present regulatory problems.  Specially designed Agrobacterium strains will be tested that can transfer a histone H2A cDNA or protein simultaneously with T-DNA containing selection and reporter genes.  Transformation will be conducted on Arabidopsis (because of the ease of obtaining large numbers of transformants to analyze) and on tomato (a transformation-recalcitrant but agronomically important crop species).  The goal is to determine whether these novel Agrobacterium strains are able to double the transformation frequency. In addition, the plan is to analyze the genomes of hundreds of transgenic events, using qPCR and DNA blotting strategies, to determine whether transformation by these bacterial strains results in a high percentage of transgenic plants containing a single copy of the introduced transgenes without extraneous DNA sequences flanking the T-DNA (vector backbone or chromosomal DNA sequences). The best strain will be advanced for additional testing in Phase II.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1181,"In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jeffery A. Byers of Boston College is developing methods to convert chemicals made from renewable feedstocks, such as corn and soybean oil, into biodegradable plastics with a wide range of properties.  These methods are based upon using catalysts to accomplish chemical conversions, and the particular catalysts being developed are based upon a low toxicity, earth abundant element, iron.  The catalysts are able to make plastics with new structures and compositions that are expected to display improved physical properties.  To increase awareness of the need for new, sustainable materials and to promote the participation of under represented minorities in STEM fields, Professor Byers is developing, testing and disseminating a set of experiential demonstrations for teaching K-9 students about the scientific method as well as catalysis and polymers.  Professor Byers is also working on a  Paper to Plastics  workshop experience for high school students to discover how sustainable materials can be prepared.  In this project, Professor Byers is studying bis(imino)pyridine-bisalkoxide complexes of iron as catalysts for the polymerization of D,L-lactide and epoxides.  While in the +2 oxidation state the complexes catalyze the polymerization D,L-lactide but not epoxides and in the +3 oxidation state the complexes catalyze the polymerization of epoxides but not D,L-lactide.  Thus, redox chemistry or electrochemistry is being explored to switch the catalyst between two different modes of reactivity, and this property of the catalyst is being exploited for the synthesis of multiblock copolymers between epoxides and lactide as well as the development of a redox-triggered crosslinking reaction.  Termination chemistry is being explored that will link the two growing polymer chains on each metal center. These polymer structure modifications are expected to result in biodegradable polymers with properties that are unique compared to currently used biodegradable polymers.  The broader impacts of the project pertain to the potential uses of redox switching to mediate orthogonal reactivity in catalysis, the usefulness of sustainable materials, and the planned educational activities.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

The goals of this study are to: 1) assess the type and frequency of mutations in genetically transformed plants relative to plants modified by other means, and 2) to assess the degree of change in gene expression caused by transformation relative to those induced by mutagenesis.

1183,"Soybean meal has long been a critical input for animal feed in monogastric animals (such as chickens and pigs) as it provides an ideal protein profile to promote healthy, rapid animal growth at a competitive price. More recently, aquaculture, the fastest growing commercial animal protein segment, has sought to take advantage of the protein and cost advantages of soybean meal as an affordable protein substitute to more expensive and less sustainable fish feeds. In 2013, global aquaculture feed included approximately 15 million metric tons of soybean meal, or about 525 million bushels of soybeans. With global aquaculture production poised to double in the next 20 years the need for sustainable, cost effective feed inputs will be greater than ever - and soybean-based feeds must be part of the solution. Unfortunately, soy feeds use in aquaculture remains limited due to the presence of anti-nutritional factors (ANF) including undigested oligosaccharides, lectins that damage the intestinal lining and phytate that binds to and prevents the uptake of proteins.Our ultimate goal is to generate a soybean variety (or soybean varieties) with eliminated or reduced ANFs to support increased feed conversion ratios (FCRs) and allow for greater soybean meal inclusion in feeding rations. Our project will leverage Arcadia&#39;s robust soybean TILLING library, which has enough genetic diversity to evaluate the ANF levels in plants with a range of mutations in targeted genes - thus creating the best potential to identify commercially attractive traits. More precisely, in phase 1 we will identify allelic series of nonsense and missense mutations in genes directly responsible for the synthesis of the three targeted ANFs.In phase 2, the best mutations for each of the ANF traits will be introgressed into an elite soybean variety. The effects of each mutation on the phenotype and agronomic characteristics of the new varieties will be evaluated individually and in combination to produce a  low ANF  variety with competitive agronomic performance.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1184,"Glyphosate had been used for decades as a pre-emergence herbicide in commercial agriculture. The introduction of herbicide-resistant GMO soybeans and other herbicide-resistant crops made glyphosate the most popular herbicide for grain farmers in the U.S. As the use of glyphosate in post-emergence applications increased, several important weeds, among them Palmer amaranth or pigweed (Amaranthus palmeri), and mare&#39;s tail also called horseweed (Conyza canadensis), adapted varieties resistant to this non-selective systemic herbicide. In the last 10 years, a growing number of acres of otherwise arable land have been abandoned to weed species that cannot be effectively managed in an economically viable manner.This proposal offers a new approach to weed management for commercial agriculture; a means to apply herbicide exclusively to weeds in the presence crop plants. The proposed approach combines an autonomous carrier platform to navigate the field, a machine vision system to identify plants of interest and to direct the pointing and operation of a precision, leaf-specific herbicide applicators. These applicators, can be pointed at specific plants and parts of plants such as the leaves to project very small quantities of concentrated herbicide onto specific locations with great precision. The ability to apply any herbicide directly and exclusively to weeds in the presence of the crop expands the number and types of herbicides, including those herbicides previously restricted to burn-down applications, that can be now be applied in a post emergence herbicide treatment.While the primary purpose of the proposed system is weed control, it provides several other potential advantages to commercial farming. Among these are: (1) a means to geolocate and monitor the progress of specific plants during the growing season by capturing and saving images collected during repeated trips through the field; (2) scouting for pests and diseases as well as estimating yields and variations in yields across fields; (3) the ability to determine herbicide effectiveness on a plant-by-plant basis and to collect evidence of crop damage due to splatter or drift; (4) to more accurately verify herbicide resistance in weeds to better control the statistical models used in combined experiments and split-plot field trials as well as identifying and harvesting herbicide-resistant weed seed for agricultural research.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1185,"This research effort seeks to develop a non-toxic and biobased solution to the biofouling problem through the development of novel soy-based polymers that release biofouling when exposed to visible light.Biofouling, the unwanted growth of biological organisms on underwater surfaces, has long been recognized as a major problem for commercial aquaculture. Biofouling dramatically increases labor costs, reduces the value of product, and can harm cultured species. Fouling clogs gear, stops water flow and food delivery, can complete with culture organisms for food or space, and can directly affect the growth and survival of cultured organisms As a result, considerable physical and economic effort is directed toward the prevention and control of biofouling at culture facilities. Cleaning of gear and use of toxic coatings are the primary methods employed by the industry to maintain biofouling-free surfaces. Time and energy expended to keep gear clean taxes aquaculturalists consuming as much as 30% of labor costs and contributing 15% to operational costs. Non-toxic solutions to the biofouling problem that prevent growth for 12 months, are compatible with aquaculture gear, and are affordable do not exist.Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility us using soy-based polymers as photoactive release coatings for biofouling control. These polymers are engineered to react with visible light and release biofouling by the gradual breakdown of the surface binder resin catalyzed by the photochemical generation of peroxides for polymer scission. Phase II research seeks to optimize soy-based photoactive release coatings (SPRC) for use on aquaculture gear, confirm non-toxic claims, demonstrate long-life antifouling at aquaculture operations in different regions of the United States, and conduct demonstration projects with industry partners.Improved production efficiencies for the US aquaculture industry are needed as the cost of production continues to increase, while market prices remain the same or, as experienced more recently, have decreased due to increased competition on a global scale. The proposed non-toxic approach to prevent biofouling of aquaculture gear will improve production efficiency, and thus increase competitiveness of aquaculture in the United States. Eliminating costs associated with cleaning or changing gear used for growing shellfish and finfish by application of the proposed non-toxic antifouling technology will increase profitability of these farms. Improved animal health will result from clean nets and cages through better flow of nutrients and waste products. Most importantly, this research will provide a safe and cost-effective alternative to copper; the primary antifouling agent relied upon globally for farming finfish.Potential commercial applications for the proposed non-toxic biofouling release coating include netting used for fish farming (barrier and market), cages and bags used for oyster farming, lantern nets used for scallop farming, buoys and lines used for mussel and algae farming, barrier nets and bags used for clam farming, floating upweller systems (FLUPSY), fishing nets and traps, oceanographic equipment, and boat hulls.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

1188,"The North Central Canola Research Program (NCCRP) is a multi-state effort to enhance canola production in order to meet market demand. Canola&#39;s unique oil characteristics qualify it as the healthiest cooking oil on the market today. In 2006, the U.S. FDA ruled that canola oil is eligible to bear a qualified health claim based on its ability to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Also, canola is in demand for making biodiesel due to its high oil content, cold-flow characteristics, low saturated fat, and low iodine values (Canola Council of Canada).As part of the National Canola Research Program, a federally funded, multistate, coordinated effort, the NCCRP provides a framework for canola research and outreach activities for the states of North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. The NCCRP provides funding for scientists to address issues that will increase canola productivity and profitability. Research proposals are solicited each year and reviewed by a committee consisting of canola researchers, industry leaders, producers, and representatives of the Northern Canola Growers Association and the Minnesota Canola Council. The recommendations of this committee form the basis of this proposal.In order to meet the demand for canola, production must increase by being grown more frequently on more acres, through development of cultivars with higher yield potential and oil percentage, or through improved agronomic practices that increase yield and quality.This project will focus on methods to enhance production by optimizing fertilizer use and increasing yield potential and disease resistance through superior breeding lines of spring and winter canola. Benefits and risks of straight combining canola with or without a desiccant will be determined. If straight combining can be successfully completed, growers may be able to eliminate the time-consuming swathing operation and may consider growing more canola acres. Efforts to improve production efficiency by reducing inputs, better disease management programs, and improved or new uses of canola for the northern Great Plains will also benefit other growing regions of the U.S.In 2006, North Dakota State University initiated a canola breeding program to 1) develop high oil content spring canola germplasm and 2) create canola germplasm with properties suitable for biodiesel applications. Through the NCCRP research, a greater number of lines will be developed and evaluated, and the breeding process will be accelerated by planting and evaluating winter nurseries. Collaboration is on-going with Kansas State University to identify winter canola germplasm that may be used in the more harsh climates of the northern plains.After epidemics of blackleg broke out in the late 1990s, the canola industry moved quickly to include genetic resistance against the prevalent strains (PG 2) into their cultivars. However, the discovery in 2004 of strains of pathogenicity groups not previously present in North Dakota (Bradley et al. 2005) has increased the risk of severe blackleg epiphytotics. It is possible that the steady increase in blackleg incidence in our state in recent years (Bradley and Lamey 2005) is due in part to this change in pathogen makeup. However, given the fact that new pathogenicity profiles are present in our fields is an indication that new and better sources of resistance are needed. This project will also evaluate other methods for blackleg control.This project will evaluate the impact of tight rotations on canola and soybean yield. Many growers choose to either grow soybean OR canola. If the results of this study are favorable, then more soybean growers may choose to plant soybean and canola rather than one or the other, thus increasing canola acres.Soybean acres have increased in ND in recent years. Many growers primarily use glyphosate to control weeds in RR soybean. However, the presence of volunteer RR canola will require the application of other herbicides. In the proposed study, the goal is to find cost-effective herbicide treatments for controlling volunteer RR canola in RR soybean.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1189,"Winter canola is being introduced into the southern Great Plains as an alternative broadleaf crop. Canola is an oilseed thatproduces healthy cooking oil, which bears a qualified health claim stating consumption can reduce the risks of coronary heartdisease. The USA imports approximately 80% of the canola oil it consumes, thus a significant need exists for more acres and increased production to meet this large consumer demand. In regions where spring canola production is common, land area available for expansion is limited by the introduction of corn and soybeans. Today, the southern Great Plains shows the greatest potential for expanded canola acreage and production.With more than 20 million acres of wheat planted in the southern Great Plains annually, the potential for expanded canola production is substantial. In addition, growing winter canola in rotation with winter wheat will improve the sustainability of wheat-based cropping systems through increased yields and reduction of troublesome weed, disease, and insect pressures that often plague wheat production. Through this project, new winter canola varieties are being developed that are adapted to the climate of the southern Great Plains.

Each of these challenges impacts long-term profitability and system resilience. Management to address these individual challenges, however, can conflict such that it is critical to define strategies that minimize trade-offs.Our proposed research is designed to address these challenges, including this question of trade-offs.

Rice and beans merit biomarkers for nutritional assessment without reliance on self-reported intakes for whole grains and legumes during nutrition assessments as wheat, barley, rye and soybeans have been studied in dietary patterns and for relationships with disease risk. A major challenge with validating dietary biomarkers is that an elevated level of consumption is often required for reliable quantification, and emerging evidence supports that the overall dietary pattern (e.g. vegetarian, omnivore) can influence the profile of metabolites detected. The identification and validation of dietary biomarkers using metabolomics is an emerging field of investigation with broad-spectrum applications of health importance, and is the major focus of the research strategy for developing rice bran and navy bean biomarkers in children and adults herein.

1195,"Soybean is an important source of protein and oil for both human and livestock consumption. The US is the world leader in soybean production, and maintaining and increasing soybean yield is important for the US economy. Soybeans face yield losses from a variety of different pathogen species. One species that causes yield losses to soybean is the destructive fungal pathogen Fusarium virguliforme responsible for sudden death syndrome (SDS). SDS is an emerging disease spreading throughout the soybean growing regions of both North and South Americas. Growing SDS resistant varieties is the best method for controlling the disease. Unfortunately, SDS resistance is partial. To find new means of protecting soybean from SDS, the mechanisms used by the pathogen to cause SDS need to be investigated.This project proposes to do so by investigating a fungal polyamine oxidase gene (FvPO1) found to be upregulated during infection of soybean roots. Plant polyamine oxidases have been shown to be involved in the plant response to infection, but the involvement of the fungal polyamine oxidase has not. Possible involvement of fungal polyamine oxidases in plant-pathogen interactions has not yet been demonstrated. To understand the role of FvPO1 in the soybean-F. virguliforme interaction, knockout and complemented mutants have been created and will be characterized.

However, we have very little understanding of the relative importance of these different mechanisms, and limited ability to predict how these communities will change over time.At grasslands re-established on former corn-soy fields in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, we will measure the availability of resources mostlikely to limit plant productivity, characterize soil microbial communities with environmental sequencing and morphological identification, and obtain land management records from site owners, including seed additions, invasive species removal, grazing history, fire frequency, time since grasslands were re-established, and weather conditions during the year a site was established. We will test these variables as predictors of the productivity and diversity of re-established plant communities and as predictors of variables important to soil conservation, including water aggregate stability and carbon sequestration.

1197,"This project aims to test the effect of two volatile plant compounds (methyl salicylate and 2-phenylethanol) on soybean yield. Work with volatile plant compounds has suggested that they can increase the local density of herbivore enemies, but few of these studies have measured effects on fitness endpoints such as yield. My colleagues and I have shown in preliminary studies that these two compounds can increase soybean yield by as much as 25%, but the mechanism of this increase is not understood. Using field experiments, phytohormone analysis, and structural equation modelling, I plan to test four mechanistic hypotheses for this yield increase. The hypotheses include (1) the attraction of natural enemies, (2) the attraction of pollinators, (3) hormonal changes in resource allocation away from defense and toward seeds, and (4) negative effects on pathogenic nematodes caused by (a) the induction of defense pathways or (b) the direct effect of these compounds. I expect to find a hormonally induced redistribution of resources in the plant governed by cross-talk between defense pathways. This would allow plants to cope with a changing environment and may be one of the major mechanisms of plant tolerance to herbivory and a potential entry point to increase agricultural efficiency, adjust to climate change, and increase food security and safety.

1198,"The goal of this proposal is to enhance plant nutrition by developing a technology that uses soil protists to increase effectiveness plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Sometimes PGPR work reliably, and cost effectively. Often, however, PGPR are ineffective because they do not reach their sites of action on plant roots. This can be caused by: restricted movement of PGPR through soil; inefficient water-based transport of PGPR or competition with endogenous soil bacteria.We propose that soil protists have the capacity to move PGPR and that they could increase PGPR effectiveness by allowing PGPR to keep up with growing roots. We will isolate from Medicago truncatulaand soybean rhizospheres 30 types of cyst-forming protists. These will be characterized in an in vitro micromodel to select those that best transport bacteria to legume roots. In vitro data will be used to derive agent-based models of protist transport. The top 8 PGPR-moving protists will be used in a series of increasingly realistic experiments to determine their effectiveness in moving rhizobial bacteria. Experiments will measure the effects of protists on: rhizobial transport through soil, rhizobial effectiveness with competitors and rhizobial effectiveness on established roots.Rhizobia, the most frequently used PGPR for nutrient acquisition, are inoculated on soybean, alfalfa, bean, pea, clover and other legumes to provide cheap and sustainable nitrogen. Their use could increase if inoculation was more effective. Nitrogen acquisition in nonlegumes, phosphate acquisition, iron acquisition and biocontrol are also facilitated by PGPR and may be enhanced by protist transport of PGPR.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1199,"The global use of N fertilizers has been increasing to meet increasing demands for higher crop outputs. This creates tremendous burdens economically and environmentally because of energy costs of industrial N fixation, pollution, and eutrophication. There are intensive efforts and desire to develop crop plants that utilize N more efficiently. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the essential steps in plant uptake, transport, and assimilation of N. However, much less is known about signaling and regulatory events that modulate plant N utilization. A better understanding of the modulation can be applied towards designing crop plants that sense and utilize N more effectively. This project focuses on whether and how membrane lipids and associated enzymes modulate plant N utilization.The project will use soybean to determine the function of a specific group of phospholipase, PLD, providing opportunities to integrate basic knowledge with potential applications to increase crop production and quality. In addition, legume N2 fixation is the most important N source in agro-ecosystems. Thus, developing legume varieties with effective N2 fixation could have profound significance in improving agricultural sustainability. The project employs molecular, biochemical, cellular and whole-plant approaches towards improving N uptake, assimilation, accumulation, and/or utilization through studies in soybean and studies of plant-microbe interactions. It tests the hypotheses that PLD activity and membrane lipids modulate the nutrient-recycling, autophagic processes and plant N use efficiency. Potential conceptual breakthroughs from the study include revealing new mechanisms of regulation of autophagy, N remobilization, and N use efficiency. Also the study of soybean may offer an opportunity to determine how the lipid regulation of autophagy and N utilization impacts the tolerance of nodulation to soil N levels. An increased tolerance would allow increased N2 fixation in soils with a high residual level of N. Finally, manipulations of lipid regulated processes may lead to increased growth and seed production under N-limited conditions. Therefore, the proposed study addresses the program area: Plant Health and Production and Plant Products, particularly regarding the priority areas of Photosynthesis and Nutrient Use in Agricultural Plants (A1151). Such knowledge advances have the potential to reduce usage of N fertilizers, enhance the nation&#39;s natural resource base, and protect the environment.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

1201,"Corn (maize, Zea mays) is our nation&#39;s most extensively grown crop in terms of acreage planted. It is also by far the highest yielding of all the grain crops (e.g., compare U.S. average 160 bu./acre for maize versus soybeans, 43 bu./acre, and wheat, 46 bu./acre). The higher yield potential of maize is attributable to a specialized photosynthesis process, termed C4 photosynthesis, that maize leaves use for fixing CO2 into carbohydrate. In contrast, all the other major grain crops, with the exception of Sorghum, rely on a more widely occurring photosynthesis process termed  C3  photosynthesis. The difference between C3 and C4 photosynthesis in terms of productivity (i.e., carbohydrate synthesized per unit of absorbed sunlight) is striking. By using C4 photosynthesis, maize leaves can synthesize twice the amount of carbohydrate from assimilated CO2 versus grain crops that utilize C3 photosynthesis. Because of the huge productivity advantage conferred by C4 photosynthesis several consortiums of plant scientists world-wide are now organized with the expressed aim of engineering C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species such as rice. Recent studies estimate that a  C4  rice would yield up to 60% more grain than present day C3 rice cultivars. To enable the introduction of this powerful photosynthetic engine into C3 crop species, a comprehensive understanding of how C4 photosynthesis is biochemically regulated in leaves will need to be gained. This research project will expand our knowledge in this area by elucidating how a newly discovered enzyme in maize leaves called pyruvate phosphate dikinase isoform 2 (PDRP2) biochemically regulates the C4 photosynthesis enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK). Our working hypothesis is that PDRP2 functions to biochemically inactivate PPDK enzyme that inadvertently accumulates in a specialized leaf cell called bundle sheath (BS) cell. According to current models of C4 photosynthesis, the presence of any PPDK in the BS cells would result in a short circuiting of the photosynthetic process. We propose that PDRP2 prevents such a short circuit from ever developing by ensuring that any PPDK that appears in this cell type will be rendered catalytically dead. This hypothesis will be experimentally examined using principally immunological (antibody dependent) methods. These methods include high resolution western blotting and confocal microscopy. In parallel to these experiments, an in-depth investigation into the biochemical properties of PDRP2 will be conducted to better understand the mechanism of how PDRP2 catalyzes biochemical regulation of PPDK.

1202,"Current issue or problem: Just a third of our agricultural nitrogen needs are met by biological nitrogen fixation in symbiotic legume nodules; the rest is met by energy-intensive, environmentally damaging, and expensive chemical fertilizers.The PD envisions increasing the contribution of biological nitrogen fixation and decrease dependence on chemical fertilizers. Identifying plant mechanisms that regulate symbiotic nodule development in legumes will enable mechanism-based strategies to optimize biological nitrogen fixation, transfer this trait to non-legumes, and thus reduce the use of chemical fertilizers. Existing knowledge indicates that a balance between auxinand cytokinin,two key plant hormones, is crucial for proper nodule development in soybean. It is not known how plants achieve a precise balance between these hormones to enable proper nodule development. This research project seeks to fill this gap in knowledge byidentifying molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the balance between auxin and cytokinin,two key plant hormones,isregulated during soybean nodule development.Through a previous research project funded by NIFA-AFRI, the PD&#39;s lab identified that a regulatory module comprised of a regulatory RNA (microRNA160) dictates developmental stage-specific sensitivities to auxin and cytokinin, and directs proper nodule formation and maturation in soybean. microRNA160 functions by regulating the levels of a family of transcription factors belonging to the ARF10/16/17 family (referred to as ARF10) that suppress the action of auxin.The major objective in this proposal is to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which ARF10 proteins regulate auxin-cytokinin balance and subsequent nodule development. Therationalehere is that knowledge on these mechanisms will meaningfully contribute to strategies for optimizing nodule formation and nitrogen fixation, and potentially transfer this trait to non-legumes.Methods and approaches:The research project willdetermine the sites of GmARF10 activitythrough molecular probing and microscopy analysis; identify and validate its interacting partner proteins through protein-protein interactions assays in yeast and in soybean plants; identify and validate its direct downstream targets using high throughput sequencing andin vitro binding assays; and evaluate the role of a selected set of ARF10 effectors and downstream targets in nodule development through loss of function assays.Ultimate goal(s):The long-term goal of this research is to sustainably meet our agricultural nitrogen needs and reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers.Studying nodule development in soybean, a major food, feed and potential biofuel crop, is of high relevance to modern U.S agriculture. U.S. farmers used ~13 million tons of nitrogen in 2011 costing them on average $10 billion (USDA-ERS data) which could be significantly reduced through enhancement ofbiological nitrogen fixation.

1204,"Skim milk powder (SMP) is an inexpensive protein ingredient, but its application in beverages is limited due to turbidity caused by the micellar structure of caseins and the tendency to aggregate and precipitate at acidic pH. The overall project goal is to improve physical properties and applications of SMP by reducing the size of casein micelles and preventing their precipitation at acidic pH. Our preliminary work indicated that derivatized SMP (dSMP) can be produced by heating SMP dispersion at around pH 3.0, and the dSMP enabled clarity at pH 3.0-7.0, with assistance of soluble soybean polysaccharides at intermediate acidity. Three objectives are proposed to advance and understand the application of dSMP in beverages. The first objective is proposed to understand the mechanism of producing dSMP and characterize physicochemical properties of dSMP. This will be studied for physical properties of SMP before and after derivatization, primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structural changes of proteins, and molecular forces involved in these changes. Polysaccharides will be studied to disperse dSMP at pH 2-7, and protein-polysaccharide interactions will be characterized. In the second objective, functional properties of dSMP will be studied in model beverages that will be characterized for quality parameter changes during shelf-life storage.

1206,"Wheat is one of the most important crops in the U.S., following corn and soy beans, with production exceeded by only China, the European Union, and India. Excess rainfalls near harvest can cause pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), rendering wheat unsuitable for human food use. This wheat can still be sold for livestock feed, but at staggering losses. Falling Number (FN) is a widely implemented method used to test enzyme activity of PHS-damaged wheat and determine pricing, but has not shown to be a reliable predictor. These discrepancies have highlighted a knowledge gap in how PHS influences starch properties within wheat kernels. The proposed FN system will be critical to addressing these issues as it will serve as the only means of communication between quality control and research. Our goals are to address critical issues related to wheat quality through (1) elucidating the mechanism for the effect of PHS, (2) clarifying the relationship between FN and end-use quality, and (3) facilitating the development of new wheat varieties that are more resistant to PHS. The acquisition of a FN system in this proposal will enhance research capacity at the University of Idaho (UI), the teaching quality of the food science and plant science programs, and the collaboration between food science and wheat breeding program at the UI.

1207,"Herbicides are the major pesticide input in agriculture in terms of volume and market share. Preemergence soil-applied herbicides continue to be widely used in many crops. Atrazine was applied to 55% of the total corn area, while acetochlor and s-metolachlor were applied to 38 and 27% of the total corn area in the USA in 2014, respectively (NASS 2015). In Kansas, total land area of 4.05 million corn acres, 2.85 million grain sorghum acres, and 4 million soybean acres were planted in 2014 (NASS 2015). Significant acres planted to these crops, together with increasingly more acres treated with PRE herbicides, highlights the efficacious and economic need to optimize the application of these soil-applied products. Soil application of herbicides for preplant or preemergence weed control is not a new technology but has slipped from producers&#39; minds with the advent of herbicide-tolerant corn hybrids and soybean cultivars. Herbicide-tolerant traits in corn, soybean, cotton, sunflower, and soon in grain sorghum, encourage producers to use more post-emergent (POST) herbicides, often glyphosate or other broad spectrum products. With the shift to these herbicide choices, however, an increased occurrence of weeds resistant to these same or related herbicides has occurred, resulting in poor or complete lack of weed control (Godar and Stahlman 2015; Godar et al. 2015). As a result, the use of soil-applied herbicides as a tool for integrated weed management in corn, grain sorghum, and soybean production will need to increase. Many herbicides that are applied to soil for weed control do present their own concerns from an environmental standpoint, such as carryover issues to subsequent crops in a rotation (Van Acker 2005), loss of efficacy with rapid degradation rates (Shaner et al. 2007), or leaching and/or runoff to groundwater and surface waters (Van Acker 2005). The activity and fate of soil-applied herbicides are affected by multiple soil factors, including soil organic matter (SOM), pH, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), and texture (Blackshaw et al. 1994; Kerr et al. 2004; Nordmeyer 2015), which affect the adsorption of the herbicide to soil. Adsorption of herbicides to soil determines the bioavailability of the chemical in soil solution to weeds for control and to soil microbes for degradation.Spatially-dense maps of soil properties would allow design of effective prescription maps for soil-applied herbicide applications. The next step is to actually apply these herbicides using the prescription map in the field. Equipment to apply VRA herbicides according to prescription maps is currently available (e.g., Gerhards et al. 2001; Vogel 2004). There is great potential to reduce total herbicide load applied, and to place the right amount of herbicide in the right place in the field for greatest efficacy.Precision application technology has been available to VRA soil-applied herbicides for more than 15 years, but the algorithms necessary for optimizing the use of these tools still need to be developed and validated for use in farmers&#39; fields. There is no published research that has evaluated the use of VRA soil-applied herbicides in the field. Herbicide labels describe how recommended rates can be varied based on soil texture, SOM, and pH, which are soil properties that can vary dramatically within a given field, not just from one field to the next. Theoretically, it has been demonstrated that VRA herbicide applications should be effective (Novak et al. 1997; Shaner et al. 2008; Williams et al. 2001).The overall goal of this project is to develop procedures for determining effective soil management zones for variable rate application (VRA) of preemergence (PRE) soil-applied herbicides for corn, grain sorghum, and soybean production fields across Kansas and surrounding states based on apparent soil electrical conductivity (soil ECa) and related data. A Veris MSP3 system will be used across 6 different fields of ~5 ha to document soil ECa, organic matter, pH, topography and other data that can be used to define soil management zones. Each zone is expected to require a different herbicide rate for efficacious weed control. To determine the appropriateness of these soil management zones we will set up comparisons using strip trials of VRA and uniform soil-applied herbicide applications in each of these fields in 2016. The herbicide application effectiveness will be evaluated by sampling soil in each strip before and after application to determine herbicide binding and residue, and by using small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) with optical sensors, together with on-the-ground evaluation, to determine weed control efficacy. Grain yields will be collected across each strip using a combine equipped with a yield monitor, if available, or an area within each strip and soil management zone will be hand-harvested to determine yield. These studies will be repeated over two years in different fields, thus refining the precision crop protection algorithm based on first year results.The goal of VRA soil-applied herbicides is to optimize weed control efficacy (right rate in right location) while maximizing profit per acre, to minimize potential losses (due to leaching or rapid degradation), and to limit spread of herbicide-resistant weed populations in fields.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

1209,"North Dakota is a leading potato producer in the United States. Potato acreage in ND ranks in the top three and total production is among the top three or four states, depending on the year (Anonymous, 2013). Additionally, added value to the states&#39; potato production comes from the two French fry production facility and multiple wash plants that pack and nationally distribute fresh market potatoes. ND is the second largest seed potato producer, much of which is exported out of state to other potato producing regions. Clearly, potato production is a major economic factor among agricultural commodities in the state, and ND plays an integral part in the US potato production market.Potato diseases are an extremely important yield and quality-limiting factor for this crop. A significantly higher percentage of the variable cost inputs into the potato crop are directed at disease management compared to other crops grown in ND. A primary reason for this is that the crop is vegetatively propagated. There are approximately 150 diseases that affect potato, of which 30-40 are economically important, all of which can be harbored in or on the tuber. Plant diseases that would normally not be a problem in a true seed crop such as wheat, soybean, corn or dry edible beans are transmitted and harbored by the potato tuber, making diseases of the crop a major economic constraint and very difficult to control.In 2006 and 2007, potato producers in ND and MN lost in excess of $8 million due to storage rots, leak and pink rot and approximately $12 million to bacterial ring rot (RD Offutt, Co., Simplot, Inc., Lamb-Weston, Inc; personal communication). The cost of controlling Verticillium wilt by soil fumigation with metam sodium is estimated to cost growers in ND and MN approximately $25-28 million (estimate provided by the manufacturer, AmVac, Inc.). This clearly illustrates the need to improve our understanding of these diseases, their management and the means to predict their development. In addition, new and emerging diseases occur all the time in potato production, such as the recent immigration of the new viruses PMTV and TRV into the U.S. and the development of ZC caused by a very primitive bacterium. We must be prepared to address such disease issues as they arise.Research performed by this project has made significant progress in the management of potato diseases that improve the profitability and sustainability of this crop to ND producers and to the value-added constituency. However, due to the nature of the crop and susceptibility of the major potato cultivars to many diseases, further progress is needed to insure continued productivity of the crop to the region and the U.S. Much of the future progress will be directed at providing immediate disease development strategies that are research-based and through the development of cultivars that resist disease.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1210,"Soybean (Glycine max) and corn (Zea mays) are the crops of greatest acreage and economic value in Minnesota and the Northern U.S. These crops are commonly grown in rotation and they influence each other&#39;s productivity and health. Many diseases reduce yield and quality and increase production risk for both crops. In most cases, diseases and pathogens do not cross infect these crops, but both crops are susceptible to some of the same pathogens.Soybean yield varies across the region and fluctuates from year to year due in large part to weather and disease. Many different soilborne root and stem diseases are widespread and common across Minnesota and the North central States. Although corn producers in Minnesota have historically had few significant problems with leaf diseases, they face a relatively new threat from the bacterial disease Goss&#39;s leaf blight and wilt ( Goss&#39;s wilt , caused by Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis) that can reduce yields by at least 40% in very susceptible hybrids. This disease has been spreading across the U.S. and Canada. The overall goals of this project are to develop and exploit new information on the biology and pathogenicity of key soilborne root and stem diseases of soybean and Goss&#39;s wilt of corn that will lead to improved and durable disease management strategies. Much has been learned previously about many of the important root and stem diseases affecting soybean and about Goss&#39;s wilt of corn, but much critical information is lacking.

1211,"In the Midwest of the USA, soybean is generally rotated annually with corn, although other crop rotations sequencing including a greater number of years of corn rotation are practiced by some farmers due to market pressures such as a high demand for corn as a source for cellulolytic biofuels. Research has demonstrated yield penalties of soybean associated with inadequate rotation of corn with soybean. The effects of inadequate crop rotation on microbial communities in soil and on pathogens such as the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) remain poorly understood. The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is a major agricultural pest in Minnesota, the Midwest of the USA, and globally. The SCN may contribute to decreased soybean yield both through direct infection of roots and also by vectoring other soybean pathogens associated with the nematode cysts. In this research, we propose to evaluate the relationships between crop-rotation, SCN densities, and both the beneficial and detrimental communities of microbes found associated with the SCN cysts. We will utilize both traditional culture-based and DNA-based (e.g. metagenomics) approaches to characterize bacterial and fungal communities in cysts. Fungal strains will also be tested for pathogenicity or production of toxins antagonism to the SCN.

1213,"Achieving a balance between sustainable, economically viable, agriculture and the preservation of clean air, clean water, and healthy ecosystems is a grand environmental challenge for the 21st century. This balance is especially difficult to achieve with the nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles. Agriculture is an important driver of changes in regional nitrogen cycles because inorganic nitrogen fertilizers and legume cultivation are integral high yielding crop production. Society is increasingly looking to agricultural ecosystems to mitigate changes in the global C cycle by storing more carbon in soils and expanding production of bioenergy crops with low global warming potential. The overall goal of this project is to increase our understanding of the fates of C and N in agricultural and bioenergy cropping systems of Pennsylvania and surrounding states. Our specific goals are to: 1) evaluate the potential to replace synthetic N fertilizer with biological N fixation by soil microorganisms and cover crops, 2) improve computer simulation models to provide new tools for soil fertility testing and N fertilizer recommendations, and 3) evaluate whether expansion of bioenergy crops in the region could provide a fuel with low global warming potential.To meet these goals we will monitor existing and establish new field experiments at the Penn State research station and on private farms. We are comparing nitrogen losses from corn-soybean-wheat rotations with no cover crop, with monoculture cover crops, and with polyculture cover crop mixtures. Our hypothesis is that the high diversity cover crop mixtures provide more ecosystem services than monocultures. We are monitoring C and N cycles in willow, switchgrass, miscanthus, and biodiverse conservation grasslands to determine which bioenergy cropping systems may have low global warming potential.

1214,"Oils are the most energy-dense plant reserves, supplying humans with much of the calories and essential fatty acids required in our diet. Because they are composed of long chain hydrocarbons, plant oils can also replace petroleum in many applications, including as feedstocks for the chemical industry and as biofuels. The majority of the plant oils we consume are accumulated in seeds.Genetic engineering can transform crop plants from their traditional role of providing low-cost food and fiber toward a much more diverse and profitable role of producing an array of higher value chemicals. This statement arises from three fundamentals. First, plants can be viewed as efficient and specific chemical factories which use sunlight and carbon dioxide to produce an extremely wide range of organic chemicals. Second, US agriculture has excelled in producing oils, starch, protein and fibre in surplus quantities for commodity markets at extremely low cost. And third, basic research advances in biochemistry and molecular genetics have resulted in unparalleled new opportunities to engineer plant metabolism to produce entirely novel, value-added products. Nevertheless, substantial technical barriers currently limit the wide use of crops as chemical factories. The long-term goal of our research is to overcome these barriers. The emphasis of our research is oilseeds because oilseed transgenic technology for lipids is the most advanced of all plant  natural products  and because plant oils are the most appropriate substitutes for the petroleum on which the chemical industry is based. The  green chemistry  made possible by this research, in addition to substituting renewable resources for petroleum will increase demand for agricultural products, thus helping to support the profitability of farming.Why it is important to tackle the issues related to plant oilseed engineering?(1) US agriculture is so efficient that there is a production over-capacity. We believe there are far better opportunities for US agriculture than the fermentation of grain to produce fuel ethanol. The gap between prices of petrochemical feedstocks that supply most of industry and ag-based feedstocks has closed over the last decades. The historic downward trend in commodity ag prices in conjunction with the upward trend in crude oil can now facilitate greater use of plants and their derivatives for cost-effective feedstocks for industry. The ability to create desirable new organic feedstocks for US industry will enable agricultural production capacity to be utilized for products that will command a premium relative to commodity crop prices.(2) The identification of key genes of lipid biosynthesis has occupied the resources of many academic and industrial labs for the last 5-10 years resulting in transgenic plants producing short- and long-chain-, hydroxy- and epoxy- fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and polyhydroxy-alkanoates. However, it turns out that this is not the central problem in oilseed modification for the future. In almost all cases where a newly identified gene has been transferred into soybean, canola or another crop species, the proportion of the desired product in the transgenic host has been considerably lower than in the wild species from which the gene was obtained. The new phenotypes are almost invariably inadequate for commercialization. The activity of the new enzyme has not generally been limiting, so it is necessary to determine other factors which limit product accumulation. Addressing these issues will require a far more complete knowledge of the cellular biochemistry in oil-accumulating tissues than is currently available. One major emphasis of this project will be to provide this knowledge with the aim of being able to dissociate pathways from constraints of metabolic regulation and end-product storage, and thereby increase the yield of new products in transgenic plants. Meeting this goal will necessarily require the application and integration of many biochemical and biological approaches. We need to know what are the limits to the changes we can effect, and how to engineer around these limits. Thus, this project will develop the underlying science to allow plant metabolic engineering to proceed well beyond its current limitations.(3) Advances in genomic technologies such as next generation sequencing methods are now providing unprecedented power for gene discovery. High through-put DNA sequencing allows efficient gene discovery such that gene cloning is no longer limiting. The Arabidopsis thaliana and many crop genomes are now fully sequenced and we are very fortunate that Arabidopsis produces high-oil seeds that are an excellent model for canola, the world&#39;s third largest oilseed crop. A high proportion of plant genes are involved in regulation and control of development (DNA binding proteins, protein kinases, etc.). Making sense of this massive new information will take time and one function of this project will be to specifically direct plant functional genomics at an important applied problem. The promise of detailed knowledge of genetic regulation will be key in producing a  deregulated  plant chemical production system.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1215,"The swine feed industry has faced some dramatic changes to our  typical  US diet feeding programs with the drought in 2012 and our traditional energy sources being diverted to ethanol and biodiesel production over the past several years, leaving us by-products from these industries to feed and still try to remain profitable. Additional by-products are now being evaluated for their maximum inclusion rates in swine diets and what limitations (anti-nutritional factors, palatability, etc.) they have across all phases of swine production. Successful use of by-products as an alternative to more expensive feed options is dependent upon a pig&#39;s ability to utilize the nutrients available in the by-products to maintain a similar growth rate. The components of a diet containing by-products can be adjusted to be similar in energy content, but generally contain a higher fibrous fraction. The traditional question is if supplemental enzymes can be used in a by-product based diet to improve digestibility, nutrient utilization, and growth performance of pigs, which has been reported for mannans in swine only by Petty et al., 2002. Perhaps what is less understood is the difference in the negative impact to increased fiber content between or amongst fiber fractions or fiber sources and the alignment to an effective enzyme for improvement in nutrient utilization by the pig.Soybean Meal (SBM) and some non-legume feed ingredients contain the soluble non-starch polysaccharide &szlig;-galactomannan (&szlig;-mannan; Hsiao et. al. 2006) while dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) contains the non-starch polysaccharide &beta;-glucan. The 1,4-&beta;-D mannans and 1,3-&beta;-D glucans of various types are recognized by the innate immune system by several Pattern Recognition Receptors including the serum protein mannose binding lectin, cell surface receptors, and others (DC-SIGN) on key immune system cells (Stahl and Ezekowitz,1998; Huang et al., 2009). The stimulation of the immune system to a pathogen response consists of several proliferation and formation factors of clonal, lymphocytes, lymphoid tissue maturation of Ig, and the synthesis of effector molecules (e.g., complement) and communication molecules (e.g., cytokines). The recognition to non-pathogens is commonly known as a PAMP or MAMP - Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern and Microbe Associated Molecular Pattern - and is influenced by the innate immune systems capability to recognize these compounds as non-self due to their molecular pattern. Most are accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response, including metabolic and cellular responses that can markedly impact nutrient partitioning among tissues (Klasing 2007; Gabler and Spurlock, 2008). The feeding of a variety of by-products to swine has opened the door for more of these  anti-nutritional factors  to be present and cause possibly more than lower nutrient digestibility.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
1216,"Growers are deeply concerned that the annual gain in soybean yield over the past few decades has been minimal, especially compared to corn. However, soybean yield over the past 90 years have increased annually ~0.34 bu ac-1 in the US and ~0.40 bu ac-1 across the Midwest. Yield gains were attributed to advances in genetics, pest control, and production practices. Recent studies have documented faster yield gains since the ~1970s than the previous ~50 years. Yet, much of the fertility recommendations for soybean and the nutrient allocation by soybean were based on research from the 1970s. A greater rate of yield gain is desired by growers to increase profits (or at least maintain profits with increasing input costs). Maximizing the yield potential of soybean demands an updated investigation in nutrient uptake and allocation. Additionally, fertilizer inputs are among the most costly inputs in soybean production. Improving the efficiency at which soybean uses P and K will improve grower profitability while potentially reducing the environmental impact (e.g., P in surface waters).Our research will help identify underlying fertility factors that are potentially limiting soybean yields within Indiana. These results will help direct applied research efforts and fine-tune production and management recommendations for specific soybean producing regions in Indiana. Improved soybean production would aid in the supply of much needed protein for the livestock industry and subsequently human consumption. Greater soybean production is also needed to meet the rising demands for soybean oil from human to industrial needs. To this end, soybean cultivars modified to supply healthier oil (high in oleic oil) or specific balance of carbohydrate will also be investigated for maximizing quality and quantity based on nutrient needs.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The increasing number of resistance cases is perceived as a serious threat to agricultural productivity, environmental integrity, and farm sustainability.

1218,"Bioenergy production forecasts call for the use of marginal lands for biomass production in order to avoid competition with food crops. Marginal croplands typically fall out of use due to soil factors that limit production, often associated with seasonal wetness. Second generation bioenergy crops such as perennial grasses are less sensitive to these problems than are first generation row crops (corn, soybeans), and also provide far greater net energy returns. However, their adaptation, performance and environmental impacts on marginal soils of NY are still poorly defined. The core of a sustainable bioenergy system is healthy soil, and it is important to understand how soil quality is maintained or enhanced in addition to ensuring economically viable yields. This research takes synergistic advantage of an existing large-scale long-term (5 year) experimental system to 1) track and analyze trends in soil quality beyond the scope of the original project, and 2) add robust testing of giant miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) a sterile warm-season grass hybrid emerging as a high-yielding feedstock but which has been given little attention in NY. In addition to the scale of this project, we uniquely address the realities of production on wetness-prone marginal soils which are a primary land resource base available for bioenergy production in NY.

However, the presence of saturated and trans fats, especially in processed soybean oils,is a concern for human health, and could cost U.S. soybean farmers more than $1 billion in lost market share. In this proposal, I detail our plans to engineer desaturases from a cyanobacterium and a nematode that can efficiently reduce saturates during the synthesis of triacylglycerol, the principal component of seed oils. Additional transgene approaches will ensure adequate supply of reductant to these desaturases. Our discovery of genetic mechanisms that can boost the production of high-oleic oils, while protecting membrane function required for seed development and germination will provide the means to produce oils with more than 80% monounsaturated fatty acids, effectively eliminating the production of trans fats. We will employ sophisticated transformation vectors to produce mutlitransgenic soybean and canola lines in which our traits are stacked to produce optimized oil compositions.Our genetic and biotechnology approaches will directly address priorities in Biology of Agricultural Plants (A1101) in the areas of&bull; Molecular and cellular genetics and plant biotechnology and&bull; Improved nutrient qualities of plant products.The products of our research will contribute to the AFRI goal to enhance the quality of life for U.S. society through the health benefits of these modified oils.

1221,"The largest cost in production of a calf is associated with maintaining the brood cows and the cost of winter feeding including the costs producing and storing hay is a large proportion of this annual cost and thus the biggest drain on the cow-calf industry&#39;s potential to be profitable. Reducing winter feed requirements by utilization of stockpiled forages and complementary forage species to the warm-season grass base in place in most of the deep South will increase profitability and productivity of cow-calf production in this region.The 2012 Census of Agriculture (USDA, 2012) indicates that the number of cattle farms has decreased by 5% since the last census in 2007, but the numbers of farms with &lt;10 head of beef cows increased by 6% with decreases in operations in every other size category. During this time beef cow numbers decreased by 12%. It is inevitable that herd rebuilding will occur and research is needed to determine the best way to produce replacement females for long-term productivity and profitability.As a result the following two goals have been developed:Increase net returns of cow-calf production in the Southeast by reducing reliance on winter supplementation.Increase productivity of cow-calf operations in the Southeast through improved heifer development.In order to meet these goals the current objectives are in place: 1. Study the effects of complementary forage and grazing management systems on cow calf production with emphasis on providing more grazing days annually; 2.Examine the effects of heifer development programs on reproductive efficiency and longevity in the cowherd.Complementary Forage and Grazing Management Systems (Objective 1). This systems research will be conducted over 5 years and will use nine 12-acre bermudagrass pastures located at the SWREC Cow-Calf Unit stocked with 72 beef cows at either 6 or 12 cow units per pasture. Cows stocked to these pastures will be managed in 3 systems 1) Low Management - using continuous grazing at a low stocking rate (2 acres per cow, n = 6 cows per pasture) with minimal additional management inputs; 2) Intensive Management - with 2 stocking rates (2 acres per cow or 1 acre per cow) and managed grazing using rotational grazing, stockpiled bermudagrass, and interseeded cool-season annual grasses.Heifer Development (Objective 2). Using Stored Forages or Cool-Season Annual Grasses for Wintering Developing Replacement Heifers before Breeding in the Spring (Trial 1.) Seventy-two heifers/year from the SWREC cowherd will be used to determine the effects of post-weaning development on breeding and longevity in the cowherd over a 5-year period. These heifers generally weigh 500 lbs at weaning with a range in BW from 450 to 550 lbs. Heifers will be allotted to 9 groups by BW, and these 9 groups will then be assigned to 3 treatments; 1) Hay -dry warm-season grass hay and a supplement will be fed in drylot to promote ADG of 1.5 lb/d from weaning until ryegrass becomes available for grazing in the early spring; 2) Silage -annual ryegrass silage will be fed in drylot to promote ADG of 1.5 lb/d until ryegrass becomes available for grazing in the early spring; 3) Winter Pasture -heifers will be placed on cool-season annual grass pastures at a stocking rate of 2 acres per heifer to promote ADG in excess of 1.5 lb/d throughout the winter and spring until breeding. Heifers will be comingled in the early spring when forage growth is adequate to carry all heifers on allotted acreage.Effect of Feed Additives to Improve Heifer Growth Performance during Development on Reproductive Efficiency (Trial 2.)

1222,"Soybean is a major crop in the US with a total crop value that exceeded $35.7 billion in 2011. High yields are critical to US soybean producers&#39; profit margins. Soybean yield is suppressed by multiple disease problems. Yield loss in the US due to Phytophthora root rot disease alone was $420M in 2008. Therefore, even a few percent yield loss in soybean would be considered significant to the local producers. Tremendous yield savings can result through the application of disease control strategies in crop production. Pesticides have been effective in increasing agricultural productivity, however, they carry the risk of environmental pollution and are harmful to human health.The proposed study deals with three diseases including Soybean mosaic virus (SMV), Pythium and Phytophthora root and stem rot.

1224,"Soybean production is important to Ohio&#39;s economy and agricultural industries. Ohio is only one of two  Corn-Belt  states that has more soybean production than corn production (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2013). Overall, Ohio is ranked 9th in U.S. soybean production with approximately 4.6 million acres in 2013. Approximately 206 million bushels were harvested at a total value of 3.0 billion dollars (American Soybean Association, 2013). Most soybean research efforts are focused on increasing yield because farmers are paid based on volume of production (bushels) rather than quality. With a projected world population of 9 billion by 2050, research efforts to increase yield are justified (Fukushima, 1991; Hubert et al., 2010). However, soybean commodity groups are interested in increasing soybean quality to meet customers&#39; needs and promote the soybean industry. Half of the United Soybean Board&#39;s 2014 strategic objectives include improving soybean quality (United Soybean Board, 2013).The two main components of soybean quality are protein and oil. Soybean seeds contain approximately 18% oil and 36% protein (Bethel et al., 2013). Soybean oil is used for both human consumption (margarine, salad dressing, cooking oil, etc) and also industrial products including plastics and biodiesel (American Soybean Association, 2013). Increasing protein content of soybean is important to the animal industry as soybean meal is used in animal feed and (to a lesser extent) edible soybean protein products. One goal of the United Soybean Board is to improve soybean seed protein content as yield is increased without loss of oil content (United Soybean Board, 2013). To meet this goal, the United Soybean Board is investing in research to develop soybean varieties and management practices that results in a 10% increase in combined protein and oil seed content by 2025.Many farmers are interested in the use of inputs (fertilizer, fungicide, and insecticide) to increase soybean yield. However, soybean seed quality is often overlooked. This project will identify management practices that contribute to increased soybean seed quality components of protein and oil through a series of field trials conducted at several locations throughout Ohio.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1225,"Seed oils provide food for human and animal consumption but also feedstocks for high energy transportation biofuels such as biodiesel or even jet fuels. However, the oil yield of currently grown seed oil crops such as canola, soybean, corn or sunflower is limited. Therefore, biofuels derived from temperate seed oil crops can only replace a small fraction of current transportation fuel needs without competing with the production of feed and food. Engineered plants that produce oils in tissues other than developing embryos have the potential to increase the oil yield per available land. Moreover engineering oil in vegetative tissues such as leaves, stems or roots enhances the energy density of potential fuel crops. The nature of the portfolio of biofuel crops or photosynthetic organisms that could be utilized for biofuel production is not yet defined. However, it is clear that potentially viable options aside from dedicated biofuel crops with novel properties include microalgal biomass enriched in oils (triacylglycerols). Unicellular microalgae species are known that have the propensity to produce and accumulate oil up to 60% of their cell mass. Knowledge and understanding of biological model systems coupled with recent advances in genetic and genomic technologies have opened a wealth of new possibilities. These new advances promise rapid progress towards the development of algal systems that could potentially produce oil on a scale that might soon supplement and possibly one day replace fossil high energy density liquid fuels. Algae have the potential advantage over conventional crops that they can be grown on marginal land not suitable for conventional agriculture. Thus, microalgal production systems do not compete with the production of food and feed using conventional crops. Moreover, algal culture systems are explored that can take advantage of flue gases emitted by coal-firing plants and waste streams of sewage treatment facilities. Because of the currently uncertain nature of biofuel feedstocks, it seems prudent to explore the potential of land based biofuel crops and microalgae in parallel. Both have the potential to transform agriculture as we currently know it and it seems likely that local solutions will require different feedstocks. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to gain a fundamental understanding of the regulation of oil biosynthesis in plants and algae. It is expected that this basic knowledge can be explored to engineer new biofuel crops and enhanced microalgal production strains in support of building a sustainable biofuel economy.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

The present project focuses on a large class of plant defense-activating  LRR-containing  proteins that are known to control many plant disease resistance traits including specific resistance to multiple nematode diseases.

1228,"Phosphorus inputs to surface waters promote algae growth, which can in turn decrease dissolved oxygen, trigger fish kills, and increase drinking water treatment costs. Furthermore, excess P inputs to surface water are cited as a primary cause of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Therefore, it is important that we develop agricultural best management practices that minimize loss to surface water.Both fertilizer timing and placement can have large impacts on P loss. Currently recommended BMPs have focused on sub-surface fertilizer placement as the recommended method for reducing P loss. In contrast, economic and farm management factors may encourage producers to use surface-broadcast P applications in the fall. Weather patterns typical of the Great Plains indicate that a shift to fall applications may also reduce P loss from surface applied P fertilizer compared to spring surface applications. We need field-scale data comparing P loss from fall surface-applied P fertilizer to sub-surface spring-applied P fertilizer so we can make accurate recommendations for the right timing and placement combinations to minimize P loss.Cover crop use may also protect against potential increased P loss associated with fall surface-applied fertilizers, thereby allowing producers wider flexibility in fertilizer management while maintaining minimal P loss. However, we need more information about the effects of cover crops on P loss and the interaction between cover crops and P fertilizer management. Because cover crops can also impact crop yields, we need comprehensive analysis that includes cover crop and fertilizer management impact on multiple agronomic, environmental, and economic factors, including grain yield, N uptake and use, and P uptake and use, input costs, gross return, net return, N and P loss, sediment loss, and runoff volume.We will study the effects of cover crops and fertilizer management on water quality and crop growth in corn-soybean rotations. Six management systems will be implemented in 18 small watersheds ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 ac in size. The management systems represent low-cost conventional production practices (fall broadcast P fertilizer) contrasted with the currently recommended BMP (spring injected P fertilizer). A control (with no P fertilizer) will provide essential information on crop response to P fertilizer and P losses in the absence of P fertilization. Each fertilizer treatment will be studied both with and without cover crop use. We will monitor runoff from natural rainfall from all plots, including sediment and nutrient losses. We will monitor treatment effects on yield, nutrient recovery, and profitability.This project will develop best management practices that protect water quality and maximize nutrient use efficiency while simultaneously providing producers with flexible management options for phosphorus (P) fertilizers. It will increase our understanding of the impact of cover crops and fertilizer management on crop yield, water quality, and net return. We expect that winter cover crops will reduce the runoff and P loss from corn-soybean cropping systems. Cover crops will have a minimal impact on water availability for the succeeding corn or soybean crop because the increased water use will be compensated by the reduced water loss in runoff. We expect that fall-broadcast P fertilizer applications will have higher P loss compared to P fertilizer injected into the soil at planting. However, we expect that the fertilizer management will not impact P loss when winter cover crops are planted. Producers who follow guidelines resulting from this research will reduce P loss from their fields, thereby decreasing the occurrence of harmful algae blooms and protecting public health.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1229,"Increasing crop yield, maintenance of soil quality and minimization of environmental risks are the current agricultural priorities. To simultaneously meet the increased demand for food, fiber, forage and fuel production while providing ecosystem services is a very challenging task. Traditional agronomic approaches are limited by time (usually field experiments are conducted for 2-3 years) and space (typically 1-2 locations are considered for spatial variability). When experimental data are combined with the capabilities of a cropping systems model (platform that includes several crop and environment modules), they can be extrapolated beyond the study&#39;s time and space to expand the knowledge. Moreover it provides a unique opportunity to test and identify site-specific management practices that improve the overall efficiency of Iowa&#39;s cropping systems. However, the task of identifying improved management practices becomes more challenging under climate change creating a ripple effect on our production systems. An increase in temperature will affect planting date (earlier planting) and choice of corn hybrids and soybean cultivars in Iowa (longer maturity). This means increased plant demand for soil water and nutrients and, therefore, changes in management recommendations (i.e. more nutrients and/or irrigation) to maintain yield potential. To cope with all of these dynamic trends and ambitious agronomic goals we propose to develop a stronger coupling between experimental research and cropping systems modeling approaches to enhance understanding of complex genotype by management by environment interactions; and therefore, to propose adaptive management practices. Central to this approach is the performance of the system and not the crop or the soil as separate competing units. It is anticipated this project will inform experimental research about potential avenues to achieve multiple agricultural targets. Also, it provides a direct link to bridge the gap between research disciplines such as soil science, plant physiology, climatology, and economics as many variables of the soil-plant-atmosphere system will be evaluated.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Phytate causes low feed conversion ratio and high level of phosphorus in the waste running into water. Soybean varieties with low phytate (LP) content will be an effective solution to the extreme economic burden to reduce adding phytase in meal processing and unhealthy aquatic environment. However, LP seeds tend to have low germination and field emergence due to reduced phosphorous in the seeds.

1232,"Flowering is a major developmental transition from a vegetative growth phase to a reproductive phase to produce progeny. The flowering transition is central to reproductive success in plants and for determining environmental fitness. In the case of crop species, flowering-related traits are major targets in the domestication process by human selection. The flowering process involves extensive rearrangement of plant architecture and is metabolically costly for both annual and perennial plants. Therefore it is important to achieve tight and precise control of the timing of flowering to synchronize with suitable environments (i.e. availability of pollinators or seasonal timing that allows seed maturation) or with agricultural production practices. Understanding molecular mechanisms of the flowering process will provide genetic and genomic tools to modify flowering time in a variety of plant species. Although flowering-gene pathways are known to be one of the best studied molecular networks in plants, applications of flowering genes for agricultural use have been limited. First, most of our current knowledge has been focused on perception and response to external signals, rather than the internal signaling mechanisms that may allow molecular switches to be turned on/off easily and directly by artificial modulation. Secondly, most of present efforts are restricted to model species, and studies in commercially important crop species are less advanced.In this project, our first aim is to clarify the core flower signaling mechanisms by antagonistic regulators FT and TFL1, a major florigen and anti-florigen in a model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and in the crop plant, soybean. FT and TFL1 provide excellent tools to dissect the processes of flower signaling. Elucidation of the molecular actions of FT and TFL1 and examination of evolutionary relationships through species comparisons will provide us tools to control the actions of florigen and anti-florigen activity in economically important crop plants.

The curing time for PSA preparation is about 30 seconds by hot air or a few seconds by UV light. The new technology of converting soybean oil to dihydroxylated derivatives through ring opening of epoxidized soybean oil, which contains more hydroxyl functional groups as polyols compared to commercially available plant oil based polyols (i.e. BiOH by Cargill). This dihydroxylated soybean oil (DSO) was successfully used as a co-polymer to prepare PSA for tape applications [3]. The PSA had similar peel adhesion strength (~3.5N/cm) as Scotch Magic Tape (~2.2N/cm). The DSO also showed great potential for coating and polyurathane plastic applications. No literature has been available to make plant oils for high performance tapes and coatings beyond what we have obtained and will accomplish in this proposal.We at Kansas State University have successfully developed soybean protein based adhesives as alternatives to urea formaldehyde, polyvinyl acetate (PVAC), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based resins [7-9]. Hydrophobic interaction was identified to be the dominant factor controlling soy protein unfolding, aggregation, emulsion, and adhesion [10]. The soy protein based adhesive (SPA) has similar adhesion performance and meets the specifications for wood based products, such as wood veneer, plywood, particleboard, and pulp fiber board. Soy protein based adhesives have been commercially available in the past few years, such as SoyadTM and NaturesinTM. However, the water resistance of the SPA is still not good enough to compete with phenol formaldehyde and isocyanate based adhesives for exterior applications. Industry is vigorously seeking low cost biobased materials to improve the water resistance of SPA in order to make SPA more competitive to the petroleum based adhesives in both performance and cost.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1234,"Goal 1: Identification of phages for termite controlThe Formosan subterranean termite (FST, an important invasive pest with a diverse symbiotic bacteria population) will be used as a model to describe the biodiversity, genomics and host-relationship of bacteriophages in an insect gut. I propose to design a novel pesticide-free and environmentally safe system for subterranean termite control by using phage therapy. Phage therapy has been used as an alternative to antibiotics and phages have also been utilized as potential biocontrol agents for plant pathogens and for aquaculture.The primary goal is to isolate phages from the termite gut and the environment that infect bacteria in the hindgut of FST, sequence and annotate their genomes, and provide proof of concept for the application of phages for termite control via phage therapy. The culture independent  phageome  will help us to better understand the role of bacteriophages in the unique environment of the termite gut. Successful completion will provide first insight into the biodiversity and genomics of phages in a complex symbiotic system, such as the termite gut.The proposed study contributes to the understanding of the biology of subterranean termites and their symbionts and is expected to lead to a novel, creative approach that is an environmentally friendly alternative to termite management. Therefore, this project is expected to yield long-term benefits to agriculture and forestry and improvements to life in rural and urban communities.Goal 2: Investigate population genetic structure and food web of horse flies as indicators for marsh health The ecosystems of coastal marshes in general and especially in Louisiana are threatened due to multiple human-induced stressors and climate change. Oil spills in particular have added to the degradation of marshes in the recent past, causing acute death of plants and animals as well as long-term effects, such as increased erosion, persistence of oil-derived components in the food web and overall decrease in ecosystem services. The blowout of BP&#39;s Macondo well caused the largest marine man-made oil spill to date with a total release of approximately 5 million barrels of oil.Studies are proposed to use both adult and larval saltmarsh green head horse fly (Tabanus nigrovittatus) populations as bioindicators of tidal marsh health with emphasis on effects of oiling events that occurred following the Deep Water Horizon drilling platform explosion. The rationale for selecting the saltmarsh green head (T. nigrovittatus) as the entomological model for Gulf coastal ecology studies is that this species is native to and tightly bound to specific coastal marsh habitats that range from the Texas coast to Nova Scotia. The larvae of T. nigrovittatus are apex predators that are dependent upon the invertebrate food web around them in the mud of the tidal marshes, and thus are reflective of the health of the invertebrate populations in marshes. Adult tabanids that are active in the summer developed as larvae in the marshes over the past 9-12 months and are thus direct indicators of marsh quality after prior insults of the environment.I propose to conduct tabanid larval food web studies with sediment samples and larval guts that were archived after the oil spill. I will use the presence of tabanid larvae as indicator that a healthy food web is available in sediment samples nearby. Metagenetic analyses will be used to describe the micro- and meiofauna community found in their guts and in the immediate environment where tabanid larvae are found to establish the existing food web and what part larvae prey upon. I then would compare the food web found in healthy marshes to that in oiled marshes to establish whether oiling leads to a depauperation of the food web and to identify taxa whose presence/absence is indicative for marsh health. Subsequently, I will develop a PCR based assay for detection of these bioindicator taxa which could be used for extensive and cost effective surveys for establishing marsh health status at reduced labor and analysis costs. Chemical analyses and toxicity studies also would be conducted with the sediment samples to potentially explain the absence of tabanid larvae or food web taxa.Goal 3: Provide molecular biology expertise and techniques for other faculty in collaborative projectsThrough collaboration with LSU faculty, e.g., Drs. Foil (horn fly project) and Davis (stink bug project) on various projects that would be enhanced by including molecular genetic analyses of insects and symbionts, interdisciplinary teams will be formed.The horn fly Haematobia irritans (L.) is considered to be the primary insect pest of cattle in the United States due to production losses. Insecticide resistance is widespread which results in over a billion dollar losses to cattle farmers yearly. Traditional insecticidal control campaigns against important dipteran pests and vectors of agents of disease have resulted in successful outcomes in certain situations, but generally these successes have been transient due to limited resources or development of insecticide resistance in targeted insect populations. There are insecticide resistance management strategies that are aimed at preservation or augmentation of susceptible genotypes in targeted insect populations. Replacing resistant populations with susceptible flies facilitates resistance management. If the resistant populations are simply suppressed, then repopulation with resistant immigrants is probable. All these techniques require genetic profiling to follow the fate of the released insects in the wild population.I propose to use microsatellite markers for genetic tracking of laboratory raised susceptible horn flies released into partially suppressed or resistant horn fly field populations. The immediate application of the genetic profiling would be to assign flies to their source population, establish the impact of introduction of horn flies from insecticide susceptible colonies in managing insecticide resistant horn fly populations and correlate changes in insecticide resistance with changes in population genetic structure. The long term application of the techniques developed in this proposal would be to establish the horn fly as a model to monitor survival, mating success, and genetic contribution of members of insects from laboratory colonies that are released within established natural insect populations.Prior to 2000, the red banded stinkbug, Piezodorus guildinii (RBSB) had never been an economic threat to U.S. agriculture and had been found only in the states of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. In 2002, RBSB reached economic threshold levels in Louisiana and since then, it has become the dominant stink bug infesting Louisiana soybeans. In 2012, 95% of the soybean acreage in Louisiana was treated for RBSB with a yield loss plus cost of insecticides reaching $28 million. RBSB has rapidly spread throughout Louisiana and has now reached pest status in all neighboring states being also the predominant stink bug species in southeastern Texas. I propose to develop microsatellite markers for population genetic analyses to be able to detect cryptic species, invasion routes and expansion of range and host use in the future.

In 2008, sales of powdered infant formula in the U.S. reached about $3.5 billion according to the USDA. Eighty-three percent of the infant formula sold in the U.S. is in powdered form, and is primarily milk or soy based. Many of these formulated drink mixes and infant formulas contain a combination of components that catalyze the formation of free radicals, including the generation of hydrogen peroxide (and daughter radicals), after the powdered products are hydrated. Intrinsic free radical reactions in human foods, particularly the reactions responsible for the initiation of oxidative cascades have received inadequate attention. This is in large part due to the limitation of methodology available to identify and measure these reactions. Knowledge and understanding of the origin of free radicals in foods and their consequences for nutritional integrity (as well as food safety) are essential to decisions as to formulation and use of these products by the public. This is especially important in some products because they provide nutrients that are essential for growth and development during an infant&#39;s first years of life, or because they are consumed by aged populations with vulnerable health, or those under physiological stress of intense exertion. The primary objective of this project is to develop analytical techniques that can be used to investigate the metal-catalyzed reactions that initiate free radical cascades in various types of food products.

1238,"Agriculture, especially the sector of crop production, is highly vulnerable to prolonged heat and cold temperatures, as well as drought, particularly when these events occur during key developmental stages. According to the NOAA&#39;s National Climatic Data Center, the winter of 2013-2014 was among the coldest on record in the Midwest and the driest and warmest in the Southwest (http://www.weather.com/news/winter-ncdc-state-climate-report-2013-2014-20140313). In August 2014, several counties are under drought conditions in the State of Tennessee, leaving farmers with more than 40% loss of major crops such as corn and soybean. Developing strategies to improve the tolerance of plants to these stresses will make significant contribution to sustainable agricultural development and food security at regional, national and international levels. Two mechanisms are used by plants to develop tolerance to stress factors. The first one is based on genetic makeup where tolerance is encoded by discrete genes. The second mechanism is by changing gene expression patterns without changes in the genome makeup. Epigenetic modification occurs through the second mechanism, which involves alteration of specific chromatin regions to allow or repress transcription of particular genes, thus regulating expression of certain sets of genes in response to environmental stimuli.It has long been known that plants can acclimate to stress conditions and become more tolerant when the next round of similar stresses occur. Furthermore, the parental plants can pass on the acquired tolerance to offspring generations. Growing evidences have proved that epigenetics plays a very important role in the creation and sustaining of plant phenotypic plasticity. Panicum halliis a perennial C4 warm season plant species. These plants grow through the same schedule of different growth seasons in successive years throughout their life time. These plants are the ideal genetic materials for studying how and if the stress conditions experienced in the previous season will affect plant performance in the coming year. Additionally, P. halli plants produce plenty of fertile seeds; therefore those traits can also be tracked using seed-propagated plants. This project aims to address the following issues: the epigenetic reprogramming during transition from vegetative to reproductive phases; and the epigenetic processes occurring in tissues of actively root-tips and leafblade under reciprocal water and temperature stresses compared to optimal growth conditions for plants derived from seeds or branches regenerated from stock plants. The final goal is to provide insight into factors responsible for regulating stress tolerance traits that are inherited via seeds or genome imprinting in stock plants.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1239,"Feed cost is a substantial proportion of the total cost of production for sheep operations. Since 2006 the value of traditional feed ingredients fed to sheep have risen by 2 to 3 fold, they include forage, grain and protein sources. Developing more economical diets to meet nutrient requirements for mature and growing sheep is essential for a sustainable industry. Fortunately the rapid development of the bio-fuels industry over the past 10 years has provided sheep and other ruminant livestock species with many different co-products to consider in diet formulation decisions. These co-product feeds include soyhulls (SH), dried distillers grains (DDG), processed/treated corn stover and liquid co-products including glycerol. These feed ingredients frequently have an economic advantage in nutritional management and diet formulation decisions compared to traditional dietary ingredients for sheep.This proposed project will develop a new era of feeding management strategies for sheep and lambs using co-product and traditional ingredients. However research is limited on the effect and interactions of diets formulated with various levels of co-product and traditional feed ingredients on animal performance efficiencies and the rumen environment. Identifying the appropriate levels of co-products and traditional ingredients in diets to lower the unit cost of production and promote excellent animal health is important to commercial feed manufactures and individual producers.

1240,"Prior to the advent of glyphosate-tolerant crop production system, several different herbicide mixtures were required to control the broad spectrum of weeds present in row crop production. After the adoption of glyphosate-based system, weed control cost and complexity was greatly reduced. In 2006, glyphosate-resistant weed biotypes were detected and confirmed in the Southeastern United States. In response, growersreadily adopted management practices that included adding multiple soil residual herbicide applications throughout the growing season, preplant and in-season tillage, and hand weeding to combat this resistant weed which substantially increased production costs and environmental degradation. In addition, several cultural practices are being evaluated to combat resistant weeds including cover crops and selective tillage. Cover crops have shown the potential to greatly reduce the incidence of annual weed emergence. Cover crop mixtures also enhance key soil attributes by adding nutrients to the soil, improve soil structure, and increase organic matter content. Therefore, this research project will evaluate integated chemical and culturalapproaches to management of troublesome weeds in agronomic crops in South Carolina. Field trials will be established where appriopriate weed populationsare present. In the fall of each year, cover crops will be established at each site. Data collected from each plot and site will include spring cover crop biomass at planting, percent cotton injury and Palmer amaranth control plus population counts at selected timings, stand counts, percent in-season management efficacy for other economically important weeds, crop yields, and relative costs of all weed management operations.In addition, cover crop biomass sampleswill be collected to evaluate the degree of degradation of the cover crop residue on the soil surfacethroughout the growing season. In addition, field trials will be established to evaluate selected herbicide programs for the management of resistant and troublesome weeds in cotton, soybean, grain sorghum, peanut, and corn. Visual crop injury and growth parameters, plant stand and heights, will be measured at selected periods after planting. In addition, plant heights and crop reflectance will be collected 7 days after each herbicide application. Weed control evaluations will be collected at predetermined interval after herbicide application. Yields for each crop will be collected at the end of the season. Currently, herbicide resistant weeds are the most threatening agricultural pest issue in South Carolina and the Southern United States. Current managementstrategies in response to weed resistancehave greatly increased production costs.

1245,"Evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds jeopardizes the food security of the US and global population. This is especially true in case of the development of resistance against glyphosate as more than 70% of the production systems in the US rely on glyphosate-resistant crop varieties. Due to the unscrupulous usage of glyphosate the evolution of resistance against this herbicide has been rapid with biotypes of more than 26 weedy species evolving resistance in the past 15 years. Of the glyphosate resistant weeds, Amaranthus palmeri is the most economically damaging as it is an extremely problematic weeds in cotton, corn and soybean production systems, which entirely rely on &#39;Roundup Ready&#39; (90% of the planted acreage in 2013) trait for weed management. Also, compared to other glyphosate-resistant weedy biotypes, control options of A. plameri is much limited, and the indiscriminate usage of alternate herbicides has resulted in evolution of multiple-resistance biotypes. Palmer amaranth is a highly problematic weed in row-crop production throughout south eastern US especially in the state of South Carolina. The evolution of resistance against glyphosate has gravely jeopardized the sustenance of Roundup-Ready trait based cropping system that is widely adopted in the state. Currently, 130,000 acres across nine counties in South Carolina is estimated to be threatened by glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth.Invasive plant species in US causes economic damage that account to $34 billion annually, and are a major cause for the extinction of endangered species.Anthropogenic changes in resource availability are well established as a major factor that inadvertently promotes the spread of introduced plant species. Equally well documented are the ecosystem level impacts of plant invasions. However, less studied are how these invasive species may alter ecosystem processes in a way that favors their own spread. Most of these ecosystem alterations are driven by metabolites produced by the invader as these metabolites change the soil carbon and nitrogen cycling of introduced habitat, inhibit the growth of native plants and alter soil microbial community structure and functions. Additionally, these invader induced changes in ecosystem processes could persist even after the removal of the invasive species (legacy effect), thus preventing the restoration of the invaded sites.The proposed research projects utilizes the metabolic infomation in plant species to help to elucidate i) the metabolic-level processes that confer glyphosate resistance in amaranth, and assist in knowledge-based selection of alternate herbicides to manage glyphosate resistance, ii)to develop knowledge based remedial measures that specifically mitigates the influence of metabolites of the invading plants, and thus restore soil properties and their associated biota in invaded ecosystems.First, the proposed approach would enable development of robust metabolic markers that would enable the identification of resistant populations of Palmer amaranth, which could also be used to track resistance in other species. Second, by identifying the vulnerable metabolic pathways in R-biotypes our approach will enable the development of knowledge-based integrated management practices that specifically targets the R-biotypes.The research on metabolites of invasive species would facilitate a knowledge-based synthesis of designer biochar, that would nullify one of the key advantages that an invading plant would have over the native species, thus would provide a very specific and efficient management strategy. Along with ameliorating invasion potential, the biochar offers many benefits to ecosystem by improving overall soil health and plant growth, and its long-lasting effects guarantees minimal intervention.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and soybean (Glycine max L.)are the predominant row crops grown in Louisiana,and were grown onapproximately 1,868, 931 acres in 2013. Cropping systems are a delicate balance between the inputs and outputs.Depending on the form or goal of an input, it can eitherresult in apositive ornegative effect on the whole system. Fertilizers are a major input into most row crop systems. When fertilizers are managed properly, losses to the environment can be minimized. Fertilizer management can occur through soil testing and plant tissue analysis. Either of these methods have been proven to provide accurate methods to properly manage nutrient inputs into cropping systems. In addition to proven techniques, new management practices are becoming available. These include enhanced efficiencynitrogen fertilizers, which can help reduce the amount of N which is not utilized by the crop, and the portable X-Ray fluorescence, which allows for rapid analysis of elemental data for different materials. Agriculture must work closely with environmental issues because of the proximity of the Agriculture/Environmentalsystems.

However, continued genetic improvement of crops, such as cotton, maize, wheat, soybean and rice, will be largely contingent on the development of new knowledge and new tools enabling comprehensive understanding and effective manipulation of the traits important to agriculture, such as crop yield and quality. Therefore, extensive research has been pursued worldwide in molecular genetics, molecular biology and then genomics in crops in the past 30 years. However, few of the molecular and genomic tools have been widely used in plant genetic improvement and many of those used have been unexpectedly low in effectiveness due to shortage of cloned genes controlling agronomic traits and the molecular mechanisms underlying the trait development.

1249,"Project 1Honey bees provide great benefits to humanity, both in the form of useful hive products such as honey and wax, but even more importantly, as pollinators of a wide variety of fruit, vegetable, oil, and nut crops. Crops that are predominantly pollinated by honeybees have an estimated value of more than $215 billion worldwide, and bees are thought to be responsible for every third bite of food we eat.Disturbingly, the number of honey bee hives in the U.S. has declined sharply in recent decades, from 6 million after World War II, to 2.4 million today. In fact, pollinators are in decline worldwide, creating a pollination deficit for agricultural production. On top of the existing pollinator crisis, since 2006 huge numbers of U.S. honey bee colonies have been lost to a mysterious new malady,  Colony Collapse Disorder  (CCD). This disorder is diagnosed by colony abandonment by adult worker bees. Since the onset of CCD, annual colony losses have doubled in many areas of the U.S., creating a new urgency to the pollination crisis faced in agriculture.There have been many recent studies that have attempted to identify the causes of CCD. Collapsed colonies turn out to have numerous problems, including more diseases (including fungus, bacteria, and viruses), parasitic mites, and pesticide residues. CCD is more likely to occur in colonies found in disturbed urban or agricultural landscapes, rather than in open land habitats with abundant and diverse floral food sources. However, despite all the research, there is still no  silver bullet -- no study to date has been able to pin down the actual cause of CCD. In fact, the only thing researchers can agree on is that CCD must be caused by a combination of several factors.In this project, we propose to test a new hypothesis for CCD. It focuses on the negative effects of two critical factors to bee health--infection with multiple viruses and nutritional stress. We hypothesize that bees under nutritional stress leave the hive in search of food, but are unable to return due to negative effects of being infected with viruses, such as paralysis. When bees fail to return to their hives, their colonies produce new foragers, who may then meet the same fate. This cycle of bees leaving the hive and failing to return could quickly lead to the sudden  disappearance  of worker bees, the diagnostic symptom of CCD.We will use a combination of laboratory and field-based studies to examine the effects of three viruses and nutritional stress on worker bees and their colonies. We will determine whether these two negative factors together can cause the symptoms of CCD. We will be specifically looking for higher loads of viruses, hive abandonment behavior, diagnostic patterns of gene activity, and ultimately, hive death.These findings may lead to changes in apicultural management, such as: more informed virus quarantine practices, colony supplementation with multi-source pollen when bees are nutritionally stressed, allowing bees to forage on crops of high nutritional value after low, and encouraging farmers and beekeepers to use land management practices that increase floral diversity. Project 2Growing evidence suggests that soybean yield is increased when plants are visited by bees (Milfont et al. 2013, Erickson et al. 1978, Erickson et al. 1975). In Brazil, when bees were allowed to visit blooming soybeans, yield increased from 6% to 18% depending upon if the pollinator was a wild or managed bee (Milfont et al. 2013).&middot; A recent two year study in Iowa observed at least 43 species of bees (including honey bees) in soybeans, several with soybean pollen (Gill and O&#39;Neal in review). Often these native, wild bees were more abundant that honey bees. To what extent these bees improve soybean yield in the US is not clear.&middot; Our growing awareness of the benefits of bees to soybean production is coming at a time when both managed and wild bees are suffering declines. For honey bees, colony losses have mounted in the past several decades, and have worsened further in the past decade (National Research Council 2007). Some of these recent losses are associated with a malady known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) that leads to rapid disappearance of adult bees from their hives (Van Engelsdorp et al., 2012).&middot; Corn pollen is of limited nutritional value to honey bees, but soybeans may be a valuable source of forage, since soybean nectar is a major contributor to honey produced in the Midwest (Erickson 1984). For example, soybean nectar-derived honey may contain anti-oxidants that have the potential to positively affect honey bee detoxification systems, allowing them to deal better with environmental toxins (Mao et al. 2013). If soybeans contribute to honey bee health, there may be a win-win for beekeepers and soybean farmers.&middot; Our long term goal is to explore novel ways to improve soybean production that enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture. To achieve this goal, we have two major aims: Determine if 1) soybeans benefit from bees; and, 2) if bees benefit from soybeans? For the first aim, we will determine the amount of yield improvement soybeans experience when exposed to pollinators. For the second aim, we will determine if soybeans provide quality pollen and nectar forage to honey bees.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1250,"Located on the fringes of the United States soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) belt, South Dakota is ranked eighth in the production of soybeans in the country. Four million acres are dedicated to soybean production in South Dakota and at least 100 million bushels are produced annually. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates soybean production in South Dakota to be at a record high of 196 million bushels and harvested area of 4.91 million acres for 2014, which is seven percent higher than the production in 2013 (USDA-NASS). For sunflowers (Helianthus annuus L.), South Dakota ranks first in the nation for production according to USDA and produced nearly half of all sunflower in the country in 2013 at nearly 1 million pounds (USDA-NASS, 2014). Despite tremendous improvements in crop yield potential, soybean and sunflower production remains highly dependent on climate and plant diseases are influenced by climate. New diseases continue to appear because of changes in crop varieties, cultural practices and genetic shifts in existing populations of pathogens. On soybeans, seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium spp., Fusarium spp., Phytophthora spp., and Diaporthe spp., ranked first among diseases that reduced yield from 2003 to 2005 in the states of North Central U.S. including South Dakota (Wrather et al., 2006). Among the seedling diseases, soybean growers have indicated an increasing concern about Fusarium root rot in the North Central U.S. states causing severe yield losses and poor root health based on field observations. For example, surveys were undertaken in Iowa in 2007-2009 to characterize the distribution of Fusarium species associated with soybean roots and 15 species were identified (D&iacute;az Arias et al., 2013). While Fusarium acuminatum Ellis &amp; Everh., Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, Fusarium oxysporum Schltdl., and Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc. were the most commonly recovered from the soybean roots in Iowa, Fusarium virguliforme O&#39;Donnell &amp; T. Aoki (the causal agent of sudden death syndrome) was less frequently found (D&iacute;az Arias et al., 2013). It is possible that management practices such as crop rotation and tillage could affect population shift of Fusarium species. Soybean producers in South Dakota use corn-soybean or wheat-soybean rotation in combination with minimum-tillage or no-tillage. These cultural practices can favor survival of Fusarium species on wheat or corn residues on the soil surface and affect soybean plants in the next growing season. Fusarium spp. are also known to interact with other soil-borne plant pathogens, of which Heterodera glycines (the causal agent of soybean cyst nematode (SCN)) is the most common and widely recognized synergist on soybeans. The synergistic interaction of H. glycines with Fusarium spp. (such as F. virguliforme) can result in greater damage on soybean (Wrather and Koenning, 2011). In South Dakota, considering (1) the widespread distribution of SCN, (2) the soybean cultivars have little or no resistance to Fusarium spp. and H. glycines, and (3) the amount of revenues invested in disease management, we require a thorough understanding of the two diseases and the possible interaction of Fusarium spp. and H. glycines to develop effective management strategies. On sunflowers, Phomopsis stem canker has emerged as a significant threat to sunflower production in the United States. According to data from the annual survey coordinated by the National Sunflower Association (NSA) in the United States, incidence of fields with Phomopsis stem canker has increased from approximately 1.5% of the crop in 2001 to 24.4% in 2012 (Kandel, 2012). In 2010, a Phomopsis stem canker epidemic occurred on sunflowers in the states of North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota, where over 75% of the U.S. sunflower crop is grown (USDA-NASS, 2014). Concurrently, 50% yield reductions have been reported from commercial fields and seed nurseries in these states. While it was thought Diaporthe helianthi Munt.-Cvetk., Mihaljc. &amp; M. Petrov was the sole causal agent of Phomopsis stem canker in sunflowers, some researchers previously hypothesized more species could be involved in epidemics in other locations. Research by Mathew et al. (2011) revealed two Diaporthe species, D. helianthi and Diaporthe gulyae Shivas, Thompson &amp; Young, associated with significant yield loss from Phomopsis stem canker epidemics in South Dakota in 2010 (Markell and Gulya, personal communication). One hypothesis would suggest a recent exotic pathogen(s) introduction might have occurred in the United States, particularly in South Dakota. An alternate hypothesis would be due to changes in cropping systems (no-tillage or minimum-tillage) or crop genetics in South Dakota. A final hypothesis could be the existence of multiple Diaporthe species on sunflowers were endemic, but the ability to distinguish Diaporthe species prior to molecular techniques was impossible and recent yield loss is coincidental. The identification of two Diaporthe species causing Phomopsis stem canker in South Dakota is critical for implementing effective management practices.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1251,"Oilseeds are important alternative crops that add diversity to South Dakota agriculture. South Dakota is currently the second leading producer of sunflower and flax in the U.S. There is a need for information on variety performance, production practices and pest control, to help SD sunflower and flax growers improve crop management. Good varieties, combined with sound management practices, will boost economic returns to producers. For example, there were 650,000 acres of sunflower harvested in South Dakota in 2013. At the marketing year average price of $20.20/cwt, a 100 lbs/acre increase in yield would add $13.1 million to the value of South Dakota agricultural production. Other oilseed crops, such as Carinata, canola, crambe, mustard, and camelina, have shown promise for increased production in South Dakota, particularly for biofuel production. Biofuels produced from renewable raw materials represent an opportunity to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and imported energy, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Officially-mandated requirements to use renewable energy are growing worldwide. Vegetable oils produced from oilseed crops like camelina or Carinata can successfully be used as feedstocks for the production of biodiesel or jet fuel. These crops are relatively new to SD and basic production information is needed to assist growers with crop and variety selection and crop management if they are to become a viable option in SD production systems. New oilseed crops should also be evaluated for their potential as alternative crops in South Dakota. Oilseeds work well in rotation with more traditional crops such as corn, soybean, and wheat, helping to break weed and pest cycles.This project will cooperate with SDSU, CES, NDSU, USDA-ARS, and other regional personnel to conduct research and provide advice to growers on oilseed crop and variety selection, and general production practices for maximizing seed yield, oil content, and crop quality. We will evaluate the potential of new or underutilized oilseed crops such as Carinata, camelina, flax, canola, and crambe for increased South Dakota production and provide resources to growers interested in including oilseeds in their cropping systems. Results of the research will be communicated to the public through publications, field days, crop clinics, iGrow articles, mass media, workshops, and training sessions.Expected outcomes from this project includes increased knowledge of the researchers and public about oilseed crops which may lead to changes in production practices or cropping systems that have the impact of increasing farm productivity and profitability. This project will also provide information on the adaptability of new oilseed crops to South Dakota environments. Some of these oilseed crops could have a large economic and environmental impact in the area of renewable fuels.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1252,"Oat provides an excellent source of energy and nutrients for the animal diet and presents numerous health benefits for human consumption. Oat has the potential to lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of type-2 diabetes, and possibly help in weight loss. In addition, oat is rich in antioxidants and is a good source of several micronutrients. All those characteristics make oat an important cereal to consider as part of a healthy diet, especially considering some of the current global challenges, i.e. malnutrition and obesity. Currently, a large proportion of the oat used by the American oat milling industry is sourced in Canada. But because of several limitations (i.e. transportation), the industry would benefit from an increased domestic supply. South Dakota is an important oat producing state that can contribute significantly in increasing American oat supply. For South Dakota producers, oat is a low input crop which can provide benefits when included in rotation with corn and soybean by breaking weed and pests cycles, thus promoting a more sustainable agriculture. The objectives of the project is to develop productive oat cultivars resistant to new pathogen races and which exhibit enhanced quality targeting the multiple end-uses of the crop.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1253,"Production efficiency plays a pivotal role in the development of regional cropping systems. Production depends on factors that can be divided into four broad categories: (1) physical, which includes soils, climatic phenomena, topography and other agronomic factors; (2) structural, which includes farm size, farm equipment and machinery technologies, land tenure, and human capital; (3) governmental, which includes those state and national policies that impact either directly or indirectly on agricultural activities; and (4) economic, which includes market supply and demand impacts on commodity market price, the cost of production inputs, investment and operating costs of farm machinery and equipment, and other economic and financial phenomena. All of these factors have a direct impact on the economic viability of sugarcane production in a given region.The sugar industry in Louisiana, as part of the U.S. sugarcane and sugar beet production sector, is currently facing many changes and challenges. Increased production expenses, primarily due to the significant rise in fuel and fertilizer prices beginning in the 2006-08 period, has substantially reduced the core profitability level of the industry&#39;s production sector. In addition, the sugarcane production sector in the state is heavily reliant on the H2-A temporary nonimmigrant labor program to supply farm labor. The significant increase in Mexican sugar exports to the U.S., executed under provisions of the NAFTA trade agreement, has had significant adverse impacts on the domestic raw and refined sugar price in the U.S. market. The use of best management practices is becoming much more important to the economic viability of sugarcane production in Louisiana. Over the past several years, much less of the sugarcane acreage in the state is harvested out through third stubble as sugarcane varieties adopted by producers change over time. As a result, understanding the impact of variety selection and expected yield on optimal sugarcane crop cycle length has become more important. Farming practices such as green cane harvesting, burning, removal of harvest residue from fields, use of chemical ripeners, minimum tillage or no till field operations and the production of soybean or other alternative crops on sugarcane fallow land, as well as the adoption of new sugarcane production technology such as improved combine harvesters, new technology tractors, and multiple row planters, all have a significant impact on whole farm production costs and economic returns as well as sugarcane crop yields and production cycle length.All of these trade policies, farm programs, commodity market conditions and alternative farming practices directly impact the farm-level economic returns associated with sugarcane production. In order to remain viable farm business enterprises well into the future, Louisiana sugarcane farms will need to select the appropriate combination of sugarcane and other commodities, production technologies, and farm management practices to most efficiently utilize available resources and to achieve the long-term goals of the farm business.

1254,"In 2012, the total market value of crops sold from Illinois farms, nurseries, and greenhouses was over $14 billion, which was the third largest value recorded among the 50 states. Similarly, Illinois produced the second largest quantities of maize and soybeans in the nation, with a total value of production amounting to $9.5 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively, in 2012. Thus the implementation of genomic selection to Illinois breeding programs has the potential to significantly bolster the productivity of an extremely important sector of Illinois. Indeed the advantages of genomic selection in maize breeding programs have been demonstrated, and it is expected that similar advantages will come into fruition for dedicated soybean genomic selection breeding programs.The University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign is an excellent location to initiate genomic selection breeding efforts. Many of the faculty is already engaged in interdisciplinary collaborations that seek to understand the genomic underpinnings of important crops. Such collaborations should ultimately result in increases in the yield and quality of crops produced in Illinois. Additionally, the University of Illinois offers several unique computational resources, for example the Blue Waters supercomputer, which should facilitate the development of optimal genomic selection models for Illinois breeding programs.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1255,"The importance of beef and corn production to the Nebraska economy cannot be overstated. Among US states, Nebraska ranks number 2 in beef cow inventory, number 1 in cattle on feed, number 2 in ethanol production, and number 3 in corn production. As recently as 2010, beef production alone accounted for over $10.7 billion of the $22.6 billion in economic revenue generated by agriculture and over 10% of the GSP of Nebraska. The interdependence of beef and corn production is also critical to Nebraska. Nebraska is positioned to become the beef production epicenter of the world because of the natural resources (i.e. grasslands, farmland, water) currently managed by beef and corn producers. However, the relationships between beef and corn production have changed over the past ten years. High corn prices have resulted in a dramatic conversion of grasslands to farmland. Approximately 1.3 million acres of rangeland in the western cornbelt region of ND, SD, NE, MN and IA have been converted to corn and soybeans during the time period of 2006 to 2011. Since 85% of all feed resources utilized to produce a pound of beef come from forage, the loss in grasslands may put Nebraska&#39;s beef production at a disadvantage. Yet the increase in corn production (due to both acres and yield) has the potential to provide additional forage resources (i.e., corn residue) for beef production without negatively affecting corn production if the resources are managed appropriately. Additionally, there is increasing interest in using complementary forage crops (e.g., cover crops and other annual forages) on cropland to diversify, increase forage resources and to improve soil health. Finally, the existing grasslands will receive increasing grazing pressure and will be managed more intensively. The University of Nebraska needs to be prepared with management recommendations under this scenario while balancing considerations for efficiency of use and long-term sustainability of the natural resource.

1256,"Cancer remains the second most common cause of death in the US, accounting for nearly 1 of every 4 deaths (American Cancer Society). Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide with nearly 1.5 million new cases every year and the leading cause of cancer death in women. The other type of cancer that deserves special attention is liver cancer with rising rates of incidence and deaths. The National Cancer Institute estimates that 76% of new liver cancer cases in 2014 in the US will result in death within next 5 years. Searching for new strategies that will prevent cancer, change behaviors and promote health has become the main goal of recent scientific efforts. Research has shown that poor diet is one of the key factors that can increase a person&#39;s cancer risk. On the other hand, certain dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet are known to be effective in health maintenance and lowering risk of cancer however active compounds and the mechanisms underlying these effects are yet to be determined. Therefore, the proposed studies are intended to elucidate cancer preventive effects and mechanisms, with focus on epigenetics, of two polyphenols, resveratrol and pterostilbene, that are active components of grapes and blueberries.Human DNA, a nucleic acid storing genetic information, undergoes specific modifications called DNA methylation in order to determine cell functions in different tissues. Every healthy tissue has a precise DNA methylation pattern that is part of a group of modifications called epigenetics. This pattern is drastically altered during cancer development forming a cancer-specific design. Dietary compounds such as bioactives from grapes, soy beans, and green tea have been shown to reverse cancer-specific changes in DNA methylation at target genes. We have enough evidence to hypothesize that dietary compounds change the DNA methylation patterns that consequently alter protein functions and interactions between different cell components leading to cancer prevention.In the proposed project using state-of-the-art technology and both cellular and animal models, we aim to establish the role of resveratrol and pterostilbene in health maintenance upon various negative triggers and test epigenetic modifications as an underlying mechanism. The latter compound is of special interest as its bioavailability is 4 times higher compared with resveratrol. Our project will address two overarching challenges in the field of human nutrition, delivering scientific evidence for beneficial effects of active compounds present in foods and elaborating on their mechanisms of action.Our findings are of interest to human nutrition and will increase our understanding of complex regulation of the epigenome by dietary polyphenols and consequences of this regulation to human health. This will increase awareness of the general community about beneficial effects of plant-derived bioactives and have the impact on introducing changes in public health policies and daily dietary recommendations.

1257,"Climate change is in the forefront of the agricultural community. Current predictions on crop and animal performance are based on research literature and accepted understanding of the current biological systems. At present, published research is one the few options available to policy makers and producers alike to predict the potential impacts of climate change over the next 30 years. Many of these issues are extremely complex and cannot be evaluated in the field not only because of this complexity, but also because changes will be gradual. In addition, the magnitude of these changes is uncertain and difficult to predict, especially at the local scale.Numerous groups have sought to evaluate the impact of climate change on crop performance and the subsequent impacts that this may have on global food, fiber and fuel supplies. Hatfield et al. (2008) indicated that high night temperatures will reduce crop yields as a result of higher respiration requirements and carbon loss. Higher temperatures are also likely to cause more rapid crop development which may result in lower yields by shortening the grain filling period (Muchow, 1990). In fact, Lobell and Asner (2003) predict a 17 percent yield reduction in corn and soybean yield for each 1&deg;C increase in air temperatures when temperature effect was confounded with rainfall limitation. However, when the effect of rainfall deficit was accounted for separately, then Lobell and Field (2007) reported a smaller 8.3% reduction in corn yield and a 1.3% decline in soybean yield per 1&ordm;C rise in temperature. Backlund et al. (2008) also predict that precipitation variability will increase along with the increased incidence of heat waves. This rainfall pattern will likely result in longer periods of water stress followed by intense rainfall events. Wolfe et al. (2008) estimate that crops in the Northeast US will experience higher frequency of temperature stress, perennial crops will have inadequate chilling in the winter, and all crops will be exposed to increased pest and weed pressure. Crop, soil, pest, and economic models that are used singularly or simultaneously exist in systems that can rapidly test the impacts of drought and temperature stress on crop species.Several outcomes from this group will provide insight on the impacts of climate change on food, fiber, and fuel production. These outcomes include experience in risk management assessment, new techniques for predicting environmental stresses and the ability to assist producers in managing inputs such as irrigation water and selecting the most appropriate crop for a given scenario to achieve the goals of securing adequate food and fiber supplies while assisting a fledgling bioenergy industry.

1258,"Genetic improvement exhibited by many crops during the last 70 years has been due primarily to increased capacity to evaluate larger numbers of potential cultivars through mechanization of planting, cultivation and harvest, logistics of seed transfer between northern and southern hemispheres and computational infrastructure. In the 1940s a breeding program might evaluate hundreds of lines to identify a few superior cultivars over a period of ten to fifteen years. Today commercial maize and soybean breeding programs evaluate millions of progeny annually to identify superior cultivars in half as much time. In the next 30 years human population growth is going to result in demands for genetic improvements at a rate that is 3x current rates. These increased demands will occur at at time of climate change and increased costs associated with expanding resource capacities used in the past.To address this challenge, plant breeders must rapidly deploy genes that will enable plants to adapt to rapidly changing environments while increasing the rate of genetic gain for yield. Plant breeding can no longer be approached as an art based on trial and error. Like the mechanical arts of 100 years ago, plant breeding must become an engineering discipline capable of designing systems in which trade-offs among competing breeding objectives can be quantitatively assessed, so that rational decisions can be made.This umbrella project will demonstrate 1) how to rapidly deploy genes that enable plants to adapt to rapidly changing environments and 2) how to transform plant breeding from an art into an engineering discipline.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Recently, construction of two canola based processing plants required a three-fold of canola production only in North Dakota.

With the goal of developing a nutrient loss reduction strategy to address excess nutrients in Illinois waterways, a statewide effort has recently been undertaken involving key agricultural, environmental, and governmental stakeholders. Within this framework, decisions are being made to address nutrient losses at the state level, yet these efforts are limited by the small amount of available field data examining management strategies to reduce losses at the field-scale.In particular, how different N management practices will affect N leaching losses in Illinois corn-soybean production systems is a critical question, yet very few published studies exist on this topic. Despite this knowledge gap, a nutrient loss reduction policy working group has been assembled with the task of developing an effective and implementable action plan for reducing nutrient losses by 15% by 2025. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify N management practices that reduce losses while maintaining or improving crop yields.Likewise, very limited data exist on the magnitude and variability of N2O emissions under conventional and alternative crop management strategies in Illinois cropping systems. Soil N2O emissions can vary widely in time and space, thus any current decisions made regarding strategies to minimize N2O emissions may not be based on a range of representative data. Our results will greatly add to the existing data on this topic for Illinois, enhancing both our understanding of the natural variability of these emissions in Illinois and how this variability is influenced by crop management practices such as N management, tillage, and residue management practices.Our goal is to develop practical and easy-to-implement strategies that help address N leaching and N2O emission concerns in Illinois.

1264,"Root lateral organs such as lateral roots (LRs) and symbiotic nodules are unique in that they arise from non-meristematic differentiated cells whereas lateral organs in the shoot arise from founder cells in the meristem. LRs are initiated in response to both developmental and primarily abiotic environmental cues (e.g. nutrients, mechanical stimuli). A better root architecture achieved through coordinated initiation of lateral roots promotes water and nutrient uptake efficiency. Leguminous plants initiate symbiotic nodule development in response to rhizobia-derived lipo chito-oligosaccharide nodulation (nod) signals specifically under nitrogen-deprived conditions. Biological nitrogen fixation in symbiotic nodules of crop legumes viz. soybean alleviates the use of environmentally damaging chemical fertilizers. Therefore, understanding the development of these root lateral organs in crop legumes viz. as soybean is crucial for enhanced management of agriculture, natural resources and the environment especially in South Dakota. We propose to identify transcripts and microRNAs (miRNAs) differentially expressed between lateral root primordia (LRP) and nodule primordia (NP) followed by functional analysis of selected candidates. It is our strong argument that our genome-enabled transcriptome, and silence-ome analysis would bridge the knowledge gap on distinct signaling mechanisms governing the development of LRs and determinate nodules.A number of microbes, specifically bacteria, colonize root surfaces and some of these contribute to plant protection, nutrient cycling, resource conservation and even protection against environmental stresses. Understanding the influence of rhizodeposits (compounds released by plant roots) on the composition of root surface microbial communities would help us elucidate plant-microbe communication in the rhizosphere.

The goal of the project will be to develop sustainable soil health in crop fields through characterizing microbial communities associated with plant-parasitic nematodes with emphasis on the soybean cyst nematode. The outcome of the research will be reduction of crop damage caused by plant-parasitic nematodes, and increase of the crop productivity.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1268,"The 2014 Farm Bill (Agricultural Act of 2014) was passed into law in February of 2014. Farm bills define and authorize agricultural programs for the subsequent five or six years. The policy changes in the new farm bill are the most far reaching since the 1996 bill when policy changes were largely driven by efforts to comply with World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations that stipulate member nations must reduce their use of production-promoting and trade-distorting agricultural policies.As a result of a recent trade dispute brought before the World Trade Organization&#39;s dispute settlement panel, cotton was singled out for the first time in the 81 year history of field crop subsidy programs in the 2014 bill. Cotton is excluded from two new crop programs but is eligible to received payments under a new insurance program exclusive to cotton. While these unprecedented changes to the treatment of cotton in the new farm bill make significant progress towards reforming cotton subsidy programs, the question remains whether the new policies are less trade-distorting than the predecessor policies. In addition, it has yet to be determined whether or not the policies awarded to cotton are more or less distorting than policies awarded to other feed grains (referred to as  program crops  which include corn, wheat, oats, barley, soybeans, and rice). This research seeks to address these questions using USDA data and simulation analyses.Furthermore, cotton is now excluded from receiving payments from programs upon which payments are calculated based on historic production determined by crop specific acreage and yields during a specific previous time period. These historic acres are referred to as  base acres . While cotton producers are no longer entitled to payments calculated using base acres, cotton producers with historic base acres associated with cotton production now have the ability to reassign these cotton base acres, referred to as  generic base , each year to another planted program crop. For that year, those generic base acres are considered base acres for the program crop to which they were assigned for the purposes of calculating program payments. Thus, producers with generic base acres have an incentive to make planting decision based on expected support payments for the various supported commodities and market price expectations. This is likely to lead to production distortions. This research seeks to estimate the potential production distortions associated with producers reallocating their base acres using USDA data and simulation analyses.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1269,"Pennsylvania is currently ranked 12th in the United States for total pounds of pork produced, and the industry is expanding. There are over 1.5 million market hogs produced annually that gross greater than $537 million for the state of Pennsylvania. Pork producers are being continually challenged with increasing feed prices, rising cost of production, the induction of new viruses such as Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, and the demand among pork consumers for more transparent production practices. Further research in pork production is justified, such that greater information may be provided to producers on options to offset the increasing challenges. Within this region pork is being produced using various husbandry practices, including conventional, organic, and natural production. Weaning from the sow is the most stressful period in the pig&#39;s life, so it is critical to continue investigating nutrition and management strategies to ease the transition into the nursery phase. This includes further development of palatable ingredient options for post-weaning diets, as well as options that fit into both natural and organic production systems. Research should be completed with special consideration for feed ingredients readily available in the Northeast that factor into least cost diets, or provide appeal to alternative production systems.In the previous decade there has been very little applied swine research within academia in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the country. There is thus great need for swine production research to support the ever-changing industry. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate relevant nutritional and management practices during the nursery phase to provide current and future producers with production options and information. Such research has present and future applications to swine producers in the Northeast that may make use of these ingredients at a lower cost than most commonly used corn and soybean meal. Furthermore, the proposed research will support allied industries such assoybean and candy producers, and will help find solutions to manage the many byproducts available for use in livestock diets in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The United States currently uses 55 billion gallons of petroleum-diesel per year, while only an insignificant percentage of biodiesel is produced mostly from cultivated crops such as soybean and canola. Therefore, being able to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of producing a viable feedstock for biofuels from winter canola, a non-traditional crop in this region is an important undertaking. The acceptance of winter-canola rising in the southeastern states and farmers including the crop in their winter rotation season, when most cultivated lands traditionally are left fallow. Additional benefits of using the extracted oil for biodiesel and the resulting meal for aquaculture increase the paybacks of growing winter canola. During the period of this project, the objectives to be carried out will integrate canola production from experimental plots (3-5 acres), post-harvest extraction of oil from canola seeds, conversion of the oil to biodiesel, manufacturing of fish feed from the canola meal and applying waste from the fish as fertilizer for the production of canola. This closed-loop system will provide clean renewable energy, production of protein in the form of fish production and organic fertilizer for continued production of winter canola.

Additionally, infection by plant viruses causes significant changes in grain or seed quality. Identification of plant viruses, monitoring for new viral diseases, understanding the vectors that transmit viruses, and determining viral and vector impacts on the growth and development of crop cultivars and lines is vital to managing and controlling these diseases. In addition to damaging crops and causing yield losses, plant viruses interact with vectors and other diseases to increase the damage from the diseases/pests. This increases the difficulty of controlling both the plant virus and the interacting pathogen or vector.

1273,"Plant-parasitic nematodes are considered to be one of the most important soybeans pathogenscausingserious yield losses everyyear. The major nematodes that are a problem in the South include the Southern root-knot and reniform nematodes. Although the soybean cystnematode is considered the most importantsoybean nematodein the U.S., it&#39;s importance has declined in a number of southern states such as Louisiana. The Southern root-knot nematode is associated with coarse-textured soils which have fairly high levels of sand. The reniform nematode prefers soils that are more fine-textured and can reach very high populations in soils that have high levels of silt and clay. Producers rely rotating to a non-host or resistant crop, plant a resistant soybean variety, or utilize a nematicide to manage plant-parasitic nematodes.There are times when either crop rotation or resistance is not available and nematicides become the only option. Since Southern root-knotand reniform nematodes show soil preferences, this information could be used to better define where in a field nematicides are needed. Most nematicides areeither over-or-under applied to an entire fieldwhich reduces profitabilityfor the producer.This project will examine at the impact of soil texture and associated nematicide application to determine which areas of a field require treatment. Current technology allowsfields to be mapped for soil texture using asimple device that measures the movement of an electrical current through the soil profile. This information can be used to divide the field into different zones that have similar soil texture. When strips of nematicide-treated and untreated rows are planted through these various soil textures, the differences in responses to nematicides can be used to best identify which treatment works best. Management zones can then be established to apply nematicides only to these areas. These management zones will allow producers to make informed decisions and provide economical and environmentally sound methods of dealing with nematodes.There is considerable variability in the levels of resistance present in many soybean varieties to the reniform nematode. Some of these varieties are very resistant while others aresusceptible. In the past, both resistant and susceptible soybean varieties were reported to be damaged by reniform nematode. Part of this study willevaluate howsoybean resistance may be impacted byvariations in soil texture.

1274,"Similar to any biological organism, weed communities have the potential to evolve resistance to selection pressure imposed on them (Gressel and Segel 1978; Harper 1956). Herbicides typically exert enormous selection pressures due to high control efficacies. Currently, herbicide-resistant weeds pose an immense threat to crop production efficiency worldwide. As of 2015, there are 449 unique cases of herbicide resistance in 245 weed species across the world (Heap 2015). A common phenomenon shared by these cases is that weed management practitioners relied heavily on few herbicide options without implementing sufficient management diversity (Norsworthy et al. 2012).In Texas, the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds is an emerging problem in several cropping systems, tremendously affecting crop yields, quality and profitability. Currently, glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth and common waterhemp are two major weed issues in Texas causing serious economic damages in a number of row-crops, including cotton, sorghum, corn and soybean (Baumann 2013; McGinty et al. 2015). Herbicide-resistant annual ryegrass (resistance to ALS- and ACCase-inhibitors) is a serious threat to wheat production throughout the Blacklands of Texas (Swart 2012; Swart et al. 2012). The first ALS-inhibitor-resistant johnsongrass was reported in 2000 (Green 2000) and currently more resistant populations are suspected in Texas corn and sorghum. In Texas rice, ALS-inhibitor-resistant red rice (Avila et al. 2005) and barnyardgrass (Bradshaw, personal communication) are two of the important resistant weed problems. As a result of growing resistance issues, producers are forced to use more and more environmentally less-benign herbicides in their weed management programs, which has a direct impact on production costs and the environmental footprint of weed management practices. Surveys indicate that herbicide-resistant weed issues have tremendously increased herbicide use, hand-weeding, and mechanical tillage, tremendously increasing crop production costs (Sosnoskie and Culpepper 2014). In areas where conservation tillage practices have been adopted for long-time, returning to tillage as a means for controlling herbicide-resistant weeds has been jeopardizing all the soil conservation gains made over the past several years (Shaw et al. 2012). Overall, herbicide resistance issues have been threatening the sustainability of economical weed management in several cropping systems in Texas.Although herbicide resistance, particularly resistance to glyphosate, is a growing problem in Texas, it is still in its early stages in several parts of the state. There is a critical need to prevent further evolution and spread of resistant weeds and effectively manage already existing resistant populations. The key to preventing resistance is to be proactive, but a better understanding of the factors influencing the evolution of herbicide resistance can guide the deployment of robust and effective proactive tactics. Knowledge on weed biology, population genetics, management factors, and their interactions is vital to understand the evolutionary dynamics of herbicide resistance. However, research information is often limited in this regard.Developing a robust resistance management strategy begins with an understanding of the background levels of resistance at regional scales. A key consideration to herbicide resistance management is managing selection pressure (Norsworthy et al. 2012), which is achieved through diversifying management tools by integrating both chemical and non-chemical options. Diversified approaches will minimize selection pressure placed on a single management tool. Yet, the number of tools available for effective resistance prevention and management are limited. While there is a need to develop additional tools for integration, it is critical to protect and preserve all the management tools that are currently available. Additionally, research efforts are needed to develop stewardship practices to ensure sustainable deployment of herbicides and herbicide-resistant crop technologies in our cropping systems and minimize potential unintended impacts on the broader environment. Further, developing decision-support tools are necessary to facilitate extension and outreach activities geared towards promoting widespread adoption of sustainable resistance management practices.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1275,"Cotton remains the dominant crop for the Texas High/Rolling Plains region, with 3.3 million acres planted and 3.82 million balesharvested in 2009 (NASS 2009). It is estimated that 70% of Texas cotton is exported and must be marketable, both in terms ofprice and quality to compete in global markets. Producers must increase efficiencies by utilizing new technologies includingimproved transgenic varieties, tillage systems, and irrigation technology. Advances in genetics have improved fiber quality,however other quality parameters related to crop maturity vary due to weather and crop management. Integrated productionsystems must be developed to optimize yield, profitability and more importantly, lint quality. An economically andenvironmentally sustainable cropping system must optimize soil and water resources, manage insects, weeds, and diseases,and respond to changing commodity markets. Two trends which influence cropping systems include the adoption ofconservation/no till systems and herbicide-tolerant crops. The Texas Southern High Plains (TSHP) is a semi-arid region withapproximately 50% of crop acreage irrigated from the non-recharging Ogallala aquifer. Improved irrigation technology, such aslow-energy precision application (LEPA) and more recently sub-surface drip (SDI) has made irrigation more viable where wateris limited. These systems have replaced furrow irrigation and allowed producers to use water more efficiently, but have notreduced the quantity of water pumped. Returns are higher from cotton than from alternative crops leading to a cottonmonoculture. Crop rotations, when combined with conservation tillage can have significant impacts on soil, crop yields andprofitability. Cover crops, including small grains or legumes have been investigated to provide crop residue in cropping systemswhich do not produce sufficient residue to provide adequate cover, such as with cotton or soybean. The use of conservationtillage to maintain crop residues on the soil surface offers great potential for reducing soil erosion by wind and water, which isespecially important for the sandyland areas of the Southern High Plains. Cotton seedlings are extremely susceptible toabrasion damage. Studies have attempted to identify amounts of crop residue needed to protect soil in the Northern GreatPlains from wind erosion, and to estimate losses under various tillage systems and crop residue combination. Previous researchhas established effective weed control programs in conventional tillage cotton for the Southern High Plains. In several states,including Tennessee and Arkansas, intensive glyphosate use has led to the development of glyphosate-resistant horseweed.New and improved GR crops continue to be developed with multiple herbicide resistance genes to meet changing weedmanagement needs to help sustain the efficacy of glyphosate. Widespread development of Palmer amaranth resistance toglyphosate has been reported in numerous states. The control of volunteer GR crops is an increasing problem.

1276,"Introduction/JustificationTofu, also known as bean curd, originated in China about 2,000 years ago and later spread out into Korean, Japan and in other Asian countries and finally into the USA. Tofu is a perfect protein rich food, often used as meat substitute in vegetarian meals, and contains about 8% of protein. About 2.2 ounces of tofu contains about five grams of protein, an equivalent to one ounce of meat. In 2012, USDA permitted to use tofu as a meat alternative in school lunches. Tofu is made by coagulating soymilk and then pressing the resulting curds into soft white block. Tofu is made to be soft, firm and extra firm in texture. Coagulation, the suspension of protein and oil in boiled soymilk is the most important step towards tofu production. Generally, salts and acids are used for coagulation. Also, a few enzymes are used for production of tofu. Demand for tofu, as an inexpensive source of plant protein, is increasing both in the USA and in other countries (Chianu et al., 2010; Yamaura, 2011). Food-grade soybean varieties used for tofu and soy milk production are distinct from commodity soybean that does not require any particular characteristics. However, soybeans for tofu production require specific seed composition, shape, size and color, which include high protein content, clear or yellow hilum, large and round seed shape (Cai and Cheng, 1999; Poysa et al., 2006). In 2013, about 93% of all soybean produced in the United States were genetically modified (GM) and rest 7% were conventional (non-GM) soybeans (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2014). However, demand for conventional soybeans especially, food-grade type is increasing constantly. Customers in Asia are willing to pay a higher price for non-GM food-grade soybeans thus soy food companies are willing to pay premiums for non-GM food-grade soybean. There are large markets for specialty soybean in China, Japan and Korea. Also, demand for food-grade soybean is increasing in other countries of the world. The US farmers can meet growing demand of food-grade soybeans in Asian markets as well as in other countries. By growing and exporting food-grade soybeans, US farmers have a larger profit margin (United States Soybean Export Council-USSEC, 2008). Food-grade soybean varieties generally yield less than commercially grown transgenic (GM) soybean varieties. Yield is negatively correlated with seed protein content. But soybean varieties for tofu need larger seed with higher protein content. Currently, a few tofu types, high yielding varieties are available for soybean growers, particularly in maturity groups (MG) III, IV and V adapted to Missouri. In addition to a premium price, growers need food-grade varieties with higher yield potential to increase profitability comparable to commercially grown transgenic varieties. Development of high yielding, value added (high oleic acid with low linolenic acid content) non-GM food-grade soybean with high protein, clear hilum and larger seed size will motivate US small farmers towards variety selection for lucrative farming. Production of food-grade soybeans needs extra care than production of commodity soybeans. The objective of this project is to develop high yielding tofu type, conventional soybean varieties of MG III-IV. Both small and large soybean farmers will increase profitability by growing and exporting these high yielding value added tofu type soybean varieties.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1277,"Profitable crop production requires that soils have adequate amounts of nutrients, but the nutrient amounts and application methods should be such that non-renewable resources are used efficiently and impacts on water quality are minimized. In recent years, however, impacts of agriculture on water quality have generated numerous questions and pressure on researchers concerning how to optimize mainly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) management to maintain farm profitability while minimizing nutrient loss from fields. Potassium (K) is not of major concern for water quality but is a major plant nutrient that greatly affects crop yield and the economics of crop production. Furthermore, there is a strong interest on assessments of crop productivity and environmental impacts within a more comprehensive and long-term context of soil health. Therefore, research is needed to better understand underlying processes that influence nutrient uptake, recycling, and transport off fields and also to identify the most desirable levels of nutrients in soils and efficient methods of nutrient application.Diagnostic tools such as soil testing and plant analysis are essential to assess soil nutrient levels for crops to be able to determine economically optimum nutrient application rates and also to assess the risk of nutrient loss to water resources as part of comprehensive assessment tools that consider other factors. The calibration of soil and tissue methods with crop yield response to fertilization is an essential part of the process needed for implementing soil testing and better management practices in production agriculture. As crop yields keep increasing and genotypes change, there is a continuous need of updating calibrations of diagnostic tools. However, improved diagnostic tools by themselves will not result in progress because of multiple interactions between soil nutrient dynamics with cropping, soil, and water management and conservation practices. Multidisciplinary research is needed to better understand and quantify processes in alternative management systems that influence P and K cycling, distribution in the soil profile, optimum application rates for crops, best placement methods, and the mechanisms of P loss from fields. New research on P issues should focus on investigating the loss of dissolved P and not just total P loss (which includes P bound to soil particles) because it is the most active fraction at stimulating algae growth and practices which reduce loss of P bound to soil (such as no-tillage) may not be efficient at reducing loss of dissolved P and actually can increase losses.The proposed research is organized into four main projects. One project will investigate how traditional or new agronomic and soil health soil P diagnostic tools relate to crop yield response to P fertilization by using short-term and long-term field experiments with corn-soybean rotations in fields with a range of initial soil-test P values, soil properties, tillage systems, and Iowa climatic regions. A second project will evaluate impacts of tillage, cover crops, P fertilizer placement methods, and legacy P in soils testing very high in P on loss of both dissolved and particulate P with surface runoff from corn and soybean fields. A third project will use an ongoing long-term study to continue investigating impacts of crop, soil, and P management practices on P loss with subsurface tile drainage. The primary objectives of this project are to determine the impact of tillage, cover crops, and fertilizer- or swine manure-based N and P application for continuous corn and corn-soybean rotations on P loss with subsurface tile drainage. The fourth project will focus on K issues, and will focus on improving the reliability of diagnostic tools for the plant-availability of K in soils by studying relationships between various soil K pools, clay mineralogy, K recycling with crop residues, and soil moisture. The project consists of three main components that will be developed in the laboratory, incubations of soil and fertilizer under controlled conditions, and field crop response experiments.The research will provide better scientific knowledge of underlying processes affecting P and K use efficiency and P loss from agricultural fields. It will result in improved diagnostic tools and guidelines useful for crop production and water quality conservation, and also will provide data useful to develop future multidisciplinary efforts for improving models of P transport from fields to water resources.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1278,"Soybean is the second leading crop produced in the USA. Soybean production in this country provided over $40 billion in direct revenue to USA farmers in 2014. Soybean is a vital USA export commodity to China and Japan, helping sustain our nation&#39;s balance of trade with these and other nations. The land area for soybean production in the USA has been declining as agricultural lands gradually become developed and populated. But global demand for soybeans is estimated to continually increase for the next several decades. Thus it is critical to increase soybean yield per acre to meet the increasing demand. It is also very important to protect the yield with disease resistance. Improvements in soybean oil and protein quality will further protect demand and enhance human and livestock nutrition.Our basic approach will be to identify promising new genetic resources and combine complimentary parents of soybean to improve seed yield, pest resistance, and seed quality. DNA technologies will be utilized to streamline our choices. We will advance generations using USDA and private industry winter production field sites and our University of Tennessee Research and Education Centers during summer production. A series of preliminary, intermediate, and advanced field trials will be conducted to identify superior new lines. The best new lines will be tested over multiple environments in the Tennessee State Variety Test, the USDA Southern Uniform Test, and other broad scale trials to gauge productive field performance.Ultimately the project expects to deliver new soybean varieties to producers that are higher yielding, have better quality, and with improved disease resistance. The producer is anticipated to benefit directly from higher income per acre, and from reduced cost of fungicide and herbicide applications. Soybean processors are expected to realize better economies of scale from vegetable oil crushing, extracting, and biodiesel processing, along with soymeal protein processing of soybeans developed by this project with improved seed oil and protein composition. Soybean traders will experience improved demand for soybeans due to the additional value-added traits in newly developed high yielding varieties. The public will benefit from improved human and livestock nutrition.

1279,"Decline in the monarch butterfly in the Midwest is attributed to the reduction of milkweed species in field crops including corn, soybeans and grasslands. This situation resulted in the petition the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to include the monarch as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. In order to contribute to the restoration of the monarch butterfly a project lead by Iowa State University was launched recently (NC507 Monarch Conservation in the Midwest). The state of Michigan is very important to support this effort because of the millions of acres planted with field crops and grasslands, as well as other areas suitable for monarch butterflies. This project has the following objectives: 1) Develop methods to establish and maintain milkweeds and companion plants in rural, suburban and urban landscapes in Michigan; 2) Survey and analysis of the Monarch larval distribution in Michigan in different species of milkweeds and different landscapes; 3) Monitor the larval and adult Monarch butterflies in Michigan; and 4) Establish research demonstration plots of the milkweeds species and other plants that provide refuge and food to monarch butterflies; 5) Outreach to farmers and citizens in Michigan about the important of restoration of the monarch butterfly.A survey of the milkweed species in field crops and grassland areas as well as other areas will be performed in Michigan. In addition, a survey of the density of adult and larvae will be performed. Field plots to demonstrate the best distribution of milkweed species together with other plants that are not used for farming and ranching will be established. Field days will be performed to demonstrate the methods to conserve monarch butterfly in Michigan. The expected outcome is that the populations of milkweeds and monarch butterfly will increase in Michigan thereby reducing the necessity to use agriculture land to plant milkweed species.

1280,"In swine and poultry nutrition, there are nutritional requirements for individual amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks for protein and needed for lean growth and efficient utilization of feed in swine and poultry. In animal nutrition, the amounts and sources of these amino acids is very important, especially in young animals. As of today, some of these amino acid requirements are known, but there are several others that are not. This has two important implications. The first is formulating economical diets to meet amino acid requirements. This will optimize growth performance, lower diet costs, and minimize nutrient excretion that ultimately ends up in the environment. In our second objective, we will use the findings of our first objective in formulating diets with different sources (ingredients) of protein and amino acids. This is important not only from a growth stand point, but also to minimize health problems associate with early life. High quality/well utilized protein sources, used to formulate diets with proper amino acid profiles, will ultimately be an animal welfare issue as they are important to maintain good health and proper digestion.In a series of experiments, pigs/poultry will be fed blends of diets with a high and low level of specific amino acids being tested to determine the response curve for that amino acid. These experiments will be conducted as several short-term experiments with nursery pigs, finishing pigs, and broilers to match amino acid requirement estimates to the targeted animal. Using these results, we can determine economic response curves based on the growth and feed efficiency responses.For the second and third objectives, several experiments will be conducted at the K-State Swine and Poultry Teaching and Research facilities. In each of these experiments, alternative specialty protein sources, such as novel fish meal, refined or modified soy protein sources, and single cell protein sources will be compared to standard diets to determine the impact of the protein source on growth performance and health.Ultimately, results of these research projects will help nutritionists and producers formulate diets more accurately. They will be able to identify nutrient requirements and processing technologies that will maximize pig and poultry growth and efficiency, as well as be more environmentally friendly. They also will know which protein sources to use and their amounts to add to diets to stimulate feed intake that will ensure maximum growth, efficiency, and health.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1281,"Iron deficiency is a problem for plant growth and often results from alkaline soil pH. In Nebraska, iron deficiency is particularly common in soybean, which in certain environments can experience Iron Deficiency Chlorosis (IDC). To find ways to ameliorate IDC, the Waters, Schachtman, and Graef labs will pursue a project that involves two different strategies. One strategy will be to look for genes in plants that respond to iron and/or copper deficiencies, and/or to alkaline stress. Further study will determine whether these genes could be used to enhance iron uptake or improve growth on alkaline soils. A second strategy will be to identify soil microbes (bacteria) that are found on plant roots in alkaline soils, but not in neutral-to-acidic soils. These microbes will have the potential to modify soil conditions or root growth in such a way that nutrient availability to roots is increased. If successful, both strategies will converge on the production of transgenic plant lines with new capabilities for enhanced nutrient uptake. An additional or alternative outcome will be a microbial culture that can be applied to soils to increase nutrient uptake.

Enable, from a technological standpoint, the commercial conversion of fatty acids into olefinic hydrocarbon monomers. Sub-objective 1.B. Enable the commercial production of oxygenated monomers from biological feedstocks. Objective 2: Enable the commercial production of polymers from acrylated and epoxidized soybean oil (ESO).  Approach: The decarboxylation of fatty acids is thermodynamically favorable at temperatures above 100 deg C. However, the barrier to decarboxylation is quite high, resulting in exceedingly slow rates at temperatures which are convenient for industrial reactions. The barrier is influenced by the functional groups on the fatty acid, especially those near the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid moiety. Specifically, a fatty acid with a double bond at the beta-gamma position undergoes decarboxylation significantly faster than that of other positions. A process which takes advantage of this phenomenon has already been demonstrated, in a preliminary manner, utilizing a new ARS technology.

M9D will serve as a platform chemical for readily polymerizable monomers, whereas 1-decene already has established commercial outlets as a monomer for industrial poly alpha olefins. Anticipated commercial applications of materials derived from M9D include as components in adhesives, coatings, latexes, and sealants. Separation of M9D  from 1-decene and unreacted methyl oleate (if present) will be accomplished using methods selected for economic and practical considerations.  There are currently many different 3D printing technologies available. The use of this additive technology has many advantages including efficient use of materials, versatility and ability to produce different shapes at only the touch of a button. However, the amount of available materials useful for these printing technologies has fallen behind the printing hardware itself.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Develop polyketo, polyamines, and corresponding salts as chelating or sequestering agents and plasticizers.  Approach: New off-season crop development is critical to the future sustainability of the United States (U.S.) agriculture by reducing the farmer’s dependence on government subsidies for a select few commodity crops such as corn and soybeans, and by supplementing our need for energy without decreasing food production (food vs. fuel). A number of off-season new crops (pennycress and coriander) will be further developed for the U.S. by developing cost effective industrial products and processes from these agricultural feedstocks. A collaborative effort to the development of pennycress, camelina, and coriander will occur: 1) Off-season germplasm development will be supported through developing analytical methods to rapidly analyze glucosinolates, oil, and seed quality. Additionally, off-season crop germplasm resources will be surveyed and publicly accessible databases generated; 2) Development of chemical and physical processes that enable the commercial production of oils, meal, gums, and proteins in off-season oilseed crops. In order to produce and demonstrate economic data, the new crop raw materials will be produced in pilot scale quantities. 3) Development of novel industrial chemicals and processes through organic synthesis based on off-season crop raw materials derived above. Products to be developed include biodegradable lubricants, biobased viscosity modifiers, lubricant additives, cosmetics, and chelating or sequestering agents.

Sub-objective 1: Production of microbial glycolipids and variants to enhance commercial viability.    1A: Genetic engineering of P. chlororaphis for production of RL from low-cost bioglycerol and soy-sugar byproduct.    1B: Fermentative production of short-chain (C=12) and very-long-chain (C22) sophorolipids.  Sub-objective 2: Synthesis and testing of value-added products from glycolipids and components.      Enabling chemical and/or enzymatic production of glycolipid components and testing products as novel antimicrobial agents and novel sugar substitutes.  Approach: To enhance the commercial viability of microbial glycolipids (i.e., sophorolipids, SLs; and rhamnolipids, RLs), their high-value antimicrobial property will be extensively researched in this project for full exploitation in end-user industrial applications.  Accordingly, the structure-function relationship of the antimicrobial activity of these glycolipids will be established by first biosynthesizing various structurally varied glycolipids through the use of new producing strains and uniquely synthesized oleochemicals from fats and oils as fermentative feedstocks.  The resultant microbial SLs containing very-long-chain (C22) and short-chain (C</=12) fatty acid, and previously produced medium-chain (C16-18) SLs and the RLs from non-pathogenic bacterium, will then be assayed for antimicrobial activity to establish structure-function correlation.  The mechanism(s) of action of these glycolipids will be studied by screening their bacteriostatic/bacteriocidal potency against various industrially relevant and detrimental Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  Cellular structural changes of sensitive target bacteria will be studied by microscopic analysis to further elucidate the glycolipids’ mode of action.  Equally important for the commercial viability of microbial glycolipids is a low production cost.  Metabolic engineering and fermentation optimization of the bioprocesses for utilizing low-cost bioglycerol and soybean-based waste streams to produce C22- and C</=12-SLs and RLs will be studied.

1287,"Objective(s): This project creates new chemical and biochemical processes to produce value-added products from biomass, particularly from plant lipids and lignocellulose.  The new, bio-based value-added products will create new markets and expand existing markets for vegetable oils and agrimaterials, enhancing the profitability of small- and medium-sized agribusinesses, which in turn benefits the local rural economy. New products will be developed that improve the health and safety of the American public, extend the shelf life of consumer products, and provide biobased alternatives and substitutes for petroleum-based chemicals. We will collaborate within the project, with other Agricultural Research Service researchers, with academic researchers and industrial partners to reach the following objectives. Objective 1: Enable, from a technological perspective, commercially-viable microbial, enzymatic, and chemical processes to produce commercial products from vegetable oils. Subobjective 1.A: Evaluate marketable oil derivatives under conditions of use. Subobjective 1.B: Produce polyol oils and oxygenated fatty acids from soybean oil through novel microbial biocatalysis. Objective 2: Enable new commercial encapsulation systems for controlled-release of bioactive molecules. Objective 3: Enable new commercial processes for the production of industrial chemicals from vegetable oils or lignocellulosics.  Approach: The objectives of this research are accomplished using strategies that include isolated enzymes in unconventional media, microbial strain development and fermentation, encapsulation and controlled release of bioactive molecules, high temperature, inorganic catalytic conversions, chemical/biochemical syntheses, and analytical analyses using state of the art equipment and facilities.  Approaches for this project currently include the following areas of research:  Vegetable oil-based biochemicals. We develop chemical and biochemical systems for the conversion of seed oils to value-added specialty/commodity chemicals.  Our approach is to use isolated enzymes, whole microorganisms, and inorganic catalysts to modify domestically produced vegetable oils to introduce functional features valuable to consumer marketplaces. While the industry accepts such new molecules upon adequate safety testing, stronger product claims based on efficacy still need to be substantiated. Biochemical, cellular, and tribological analyses are undertaken to establish the metabolic fate and influence of the novel vegetable oil derivatives. No human or live animal testing is needed. Encapsulation and timed release of bioactive molecules. We develop phospholipid-based encapsulation systems (i.e. liposomes) that limit the release of bioactive molecules and protect the bioactives from degradation. Liposomes are used to encapsulate the bioactives of interest and the bioactives-loaded liposomes are further compartmentalized within a secondary liposome for increased protection.  The multicompartmentalized liposome system provides increased protection and controlled release of the bioactive molecule. The liposome encapsulated bioactive systems are analyzed for stability and release rate of the bioactive molecules. Highly stable encapsulation and controlled release systems are highly desirable in the functional foods and beverage industries. Integrated biorefinery systems for biochemicals. We couple biomass pretreatment with catalytic conversions to form integrated processes to convert lignocellulosics and lipids into bio-based chemicals that replace petroleum-based products. Whole biomass, crop residue or dedicated crops (e.g. switchgrass), is milled and extracted with hot water to produce a mixture of lignin and sugars. Lipids are treated to introduce oxygen atoms into the fatty acids. These pretreated materials are subjected to catalytic conversion to produce bio-based chemicals. The catalysts are designed and synthesized with specific capabilities to produce targeted agri-based chemicals. The pretreatment and catalytic conversion steps are developed to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a continuous pretreatment/catalytic conversion technology platform for use in biorefineries.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1288,"Objective(s): Six objectives will be used to improve the efficiency of trout production by the development of alternative feeds and fish better able to use those feeds. Some ingredients are developed in-house and we have both laboratory and pilot scale production capabilities. Digestibility of nutrients from specific ingredients has traditionally been conducted with large fish. The effect of strain and size will be determined. A tank system is available to collect feces both by sedimentation and stripping. The effect of strain and size on protein and amino acid retention will be conducted to determine the need for strain or life stage specific diets. Most trout culture use water from one raceway to another up to 5 times. A 36 tank system located on a commercial farm that receives water from 1st, 3rd, or 5th use will be used to determine the effect of water quality as a stressor on specific mineral and fat soluble vitamins in the tissues. A strain of trout selected  to utilize plant-based diets is available and the effect of the gut microflora communities will be characterized. Fish oil has been the source of the heart/brain healthy fatty acids, EPA/DHA. This source is limited by supply and cost. Variability among trout in a specific strain for their ability to biosynthesize EPA/DHA has been identified. Trout with this trait will be bred to enhance the nutritional quality of the fillet for the benefit of the consumer.  Objective 1: Develop and evaluate new ingredients and ingredient processing methods to increase nutritional and economic value. 1.A: Develop an improved soybean processing method to simultaneously separate protein and oil and remove anti-nutrients. 1.B: Development of alternative methods for the concentration of protein from wheat, barley, and oats.  1.C: Determine the nutritional and economic value of new and modified ingredients.   Objective 2: Determine whether stage specific and strain specific diets are needed by evaluating nutrient digestibility at  Approach: Objective 1: 1.A: An improved aqueous processing method that results in high oil and protein recovery and removal of anti-nutrients will reduce the diarrheic effect of soybeans for trout. Experiments to optimize pretreatment and extraction conditions will be conducted.  1.B: Improved processing methods will increase the nutritional and economic value of protein concentrates from wheat, barley and oats. Trials will be conducted with wheat to optimize starting material and processing conditions to concentrate to 70% protein, and remove the binding effect. This effect of wheat gluten limits inclusion level in extruded feeds. Protein concentrates of barley and oats will be produced using another aqueous fractionation method that features alkaline extraction, centrifugation, and acid precipitation of supernatant.  1.C: A seven phase program will evaluate the nutritional value of alternative ingredients. Complete nutrient and anti-nutrient analysis, fry screening trials, effect on feed intake and extrusion, nutrient digestibility, growth trials, and effect on fecal size will be conducted.   Objective 2: 2.A: Nutrient digestibility is affected by either fish size or strain or both. The ADC’s for major nutrients and amino acids will be determined with four unique strains of trout at three sizes (15, 500, 1500 g, 12 trials).  2.B: Nutrient retention efficiency is affected by fish size or strain or both. The same strains and fish size will be used as in 2.A in 12 week growth studies to evaluate protein and amino acid retention. Four diets varying in protein (40/45%) and lipid (20/25%) will be fed.  Objective 3: 3.A: Improved diets containing elevated levels of stress-affected minerals and fat soluble vitamins will improve performance of rainbow trout raised in serial-reuse water. The effect of water source (1st, 3rd, & 5th use) as a stressor in three strains of rainbow trout on tissue concentrations of fat soluble vitamins and minerals will be determined. 3.B: Specific combinations of ingredients and prebiotics affect intestinal inflammation and the consistency of rainbow trout feces. To improve waste management dietary factors that affect fecal particle size will be determined.   Objective 4: 4.A: Intestinal microflora community structure in rainbow trout is affected by diet and host genotype. Microbial communities will be identified in two strains of trout, one susceptible to soy enteritis and the other resistant.  4.B: Transplantation of microbiota from selected trout fed plant-based feed into non-selected trout will reduce intestinal enteritis when fed plant-based feeds. A cross-over experimental design will be used to determine if different microbial communities can protect a trout from soy induced intestinal enteritis.   Objective 5: The ability to biosynthesize EPA and DHA in muscle tissue of rainbow trout fed diets containing plant oils can be selectively enhanced. To evaluate the potential to increase the ability of trout to biosynthesize EPA and DHA in their muscle, variation among individuals and families of rainbow trout will be determined. Individuals with known performance values for this trait will then be selectively bred.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Experimental design, diet analyses, procedures for stocking, feeding, pond management, data collection and statistical and economic analysis will be the same as described for Sub-objective 1.A.   All soybean meal in hybrid catfish feeds will be replaced with various combinations of cottonseed meal, distiller’s grains with solubles, peanut meal, and porcine meat and bone meal. Pond will be stocked with hybrid catfish fingerlings, and diet analyses, experimental design, procedures for stocking, feeding, pond management, data collection and statistical analysis, and economic analysis will be the same as described for Sub-objective 1.A.    Four thousand small hybrid catfish fingerlings will be stocked into 20 tanks with 200 fish each.  Four diets of 32% or 36% protein using either soybean meal or soybean substitutes will be evaluated. Diet, statistical, and economic analysis will be the same as described for Sub-objective 1A.  Growth and disease resistance of juvenile channel catfish will be evaluated in fish fed diets with varying levels of taurine in replicated aquaria.   The proposed study will evaluate effects of no feeding, maintenance feeding, and re-feeding on growth, feed conversion ratio, and processing yield of hybrid catfish. Market-size hybrid catfish (1.5 lb) will be stocked into ponds at the end of May or early June.  The experimental design, procedures for stocking, feeding, pond management, data collection and statistical analysis will be the same as described for Sub-objective 1.A.

The study will be repeated yearly with the same stocking rates but with varying fish size. Catfish will be fed and managed according to standard industry practices and cultured through one production season.  Each treatment will consist of 4 replicate ponds to evaluate using hay, planted wheat, or rice as substrates to increase freshwater prawn production. Ponds with no substrate addition will served as controls. Ponds will be stocked with 10,000 prawn/ac.  All ponds will be fed range cubes. Prawns will be harvested in the fall.

1290,"Objective(s): Project objectives are: 1) Measure and model the impact of agricultural systems (animal and cropping) on air quality components to identify and develop potential mitigation strategies, 2) Measure and model the impact of agricultural systems on greenhouse gas emissions and develop and evaluate potential mitigation strategies, 3) Measure and model soil and atmospheric factors limiting water, nitrogen, and light use efficiency of annual and perennial cropping systems to determine how they can become more resilient to climate change and 4) Develop science-based, regionspecific information and technologies for agricultural and natural resource managers that enable climate-smart decision-making and where possible provide assistance to enable land managers to implement those decisions. The work will be conducted as the Midwest USDA Climate Change Hub and will be coordinated with NRCS, FS, and other USDA and non-USDA organizations in accordance with guidance found in the USDA Climate Change Hubs Charter, and Terms of Reference.  Approach: Studies across the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in this project will develop new methods for quantifying emission and dispersion (particulates, NH3, VOCÆs) from animal and cropping systems, improve methods for measuring different compounds in the air to provide increased quantitative capability to measure impacts of CAFOÆs on air quality, determine greenhouse gas emissions (N2O, CH4, CO2) from cropping systems, and quantify effects of changing climate on water, light, and nitrogen use by crops. The initial development of a lidar-based approach to measure plume dynamics from animal facilities will be evaluated to produce a remote-sensing approach that will be used to guide sampling methods that use point-based samplers. These data will be collected over a range of facilities and throughout the day to capture the range of atmospheric stability conditions. Air sampling methods for volatile organic compounds will be accomplished with a range of methods from sorbent tubes and canisters. These will also be coupled with methods to measure the volatile organic compounds attached to particulates. These observations will be collected in different livestock facilities. Greenhouse gas emissions will be quantified using soil chambers for a range of soil management and nitrogen management studies to quantify the emissions throughout a year. Measures of water, nitrogen,carbon accumulation, and light use efficiency will use an integrated approach that blends micrometeorological with physiological measurements. These experiments will be conducted using field-scale environments and will integrate all efficiency factors into a combined assessment. The energy balance approach used in these studies blends the fast response of CO2 and H2O vapor signals with sonic anemometers, net radiation components, soil heat flux, and surface temperature along with remote sensing to obtain growth characteristics of the crop. Studies will be conducted in the rhizotron to assess the impact of rapidly induced temperature changes on crop physiological responses under a range of soil water conditions. Accomplishing these three objectives will result in the development of agricultural practices and mitigation strategies that reduce environmental impact, while maintaining or increasing productivity. Mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions will balance agricultural production efficiency and increased carbon capture and nitrogen use efficiency. Climate change and its impact on cropping systems raise additional concerns regarding resilience of current production practices and plant adaption to those changes. Methods are needed to quantify plant-climate interaction to link field observations with simulation models for corn, soybean, wheat, and native prairie systems. Developing a long-term program to quantify plant response to climate anomalies will also establish a database for developing more resilient crop production systems.

1292,"Objective(s): Objective 1. Enable new methods using organogels and alternative oil structuring agents to generate commercial zero trans fat, low saturated fat margarines, shortenings, confectionary fats, and other lipid ingredients.   Sub-Objective 1.A. Investigate and optimize the physical, rheological, and sensory properties of edible organogels. Sub-objective 1.B. Evaluate the effect of organogels on the properties of structured fats composed of either modified fatty acid composition vegetable oils or fully hydrogenated soybean or cottonseed oil with vegetable oils.  Objective 2. Enable new commercial delivery systems using natural antioxidant technologies to protect frying oils, polyunsaturated oils, and bioactive lipids.  Sub-Objective 2.A. Evaluate the activity of naturally occurring antioxidants and antioxidant combinations for protection of frying oils and fried foods.  Sub-objective 2.B. Evaluate antioxidants or natural antioxidant extracts for protection of polyunsaturated and omega-3 oils and bioactive lipids.  Sub-objective 2.C. Investigate new delivery systems for antioxidants, omega-3 oils, and bioactive ingredients.  Objective 3. Quantitate and evaluate bioactive ingredients including antioxidants and bioactive lipids in commodity and non-commodity crops as well as in food and agricultural waste processing streams.  Approach: In order to tackle health issues facing the nation including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes, nutritional experts are urging U.S. consumers to limit their consumption of both saturated fats and trans fats from hydrogenated oils, and to eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, in order to obtain the added benefits of the bioactive food constituents found in these foods. Food manufacturers, restaurants and bakeries are looking for alternatives to hydrogenated vegetable oils or imported palm oil that have the stability necessary for frying, or the functionality needed for margarines and shortenings. U.S. commodity vegetable oils are low in saturated fats and high in healthy polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. However, without hydrogenation, the majority of these oils are not stable enough for frying and do not have the proper functionality for margarines and shortenings.   The first objective of this project plan is to develop alternative methods of structuring oils in order to solve the problem of functionality for margarine and shortening applications. Low concentrations of natural, inexpensive ingredients, will be used to form organogels with liquid oils. Physical and rheological characteristics of organogels will be fully investigated and test margarines and shortenings will be developed from organogels with desirable physical and rheological properties. These will be further tested in food applications for creaming, aerating, and structuring ability, as well as sensory quality.   The second objective of this plan is to develop natural antioxidant systems to protect polyunsaturated fats and bioactive lipids from oxidation and degradation in frying and in food systems, in order to extend the shelf-life and healthfulness of lipids and foods, and to replace synthetic antioxidants. Antioxidants will be tested for activity in commodity oils during frying, in order to extend the fry life and prevent oxidation products from forming. Potential antioxidants will also be tested for their ability to extend the oxidative stability and shelf life of model food systems, such as in oil-in-water emulsions, and in whole grain food products. The potential antioxidants will also be compared to synthetic antioxidants.   The third objective of this research is to analyze byproducts of food and agricultural processing for valuable bioactive lipids and/or antioxidants, in order to develop new ingredients from these products, and to reduce waste.

1293,"Objective(s): The overall goal of this research project is to make food production more sustainable by using food processing technologies to add value to the byproducts generated from the harvest of specialty crops and production of processed foods. We will focus on the following three objectives over the next five years:    Objective 1: Increase the commercial value of plant-based, postharvest waste materials, high in dietary fiber and/or polyphenols (grape, berries, tomato, carrot, and olive pomace, olive leaves and water, mushroom byproducts), by reprocessing into healthful food ingredients. 1.1: Screen processing wastes for nutritional properties of the whole pomace, seeds, skins, and the extractable and nonextractable (high fiber) fractions using appropriate animal models. 1.2: Increase value by developing healthful ingredients with improved bioaccessibility to bioactive polyphenols by process treatments such as extrusion, thermal, chemical and enzymatic processing of the whole waste.   Objective 2: Enable new, commercial functional foods from high protein–based waste materials (nuts, legumes, rice, fish).  2.1: Analyze nutrient content of processed farm waste (soybean, peanut, rice and salmon) for functional properties and nutritional quality of protein fraction.  2.2: Formulate and test high protein gluten free health promoting products for consumer acceptability.   Objective 3: Enable value-added commercial applications of nanofibers from specialty crop waste materials to deliver bioactives in new functional foods.   Objective 4: Increase the utilization of post-harvest waste materials by identifying and removing astringent and mineral components that detract from taste, quality, nutritional value and consumer acceptance.  Approach: Objective 1: Determine if processed food wastes or their components from regional fruit and vegetable food processing have health promoting properties by using animal models of obesity and related metabolic diseases to evaluate bioactivity. Animal models are necessary since many bioactive compounds are not absorbed directly but are mediated by gut bacteria. Some waste materials may require fractionation, for example seeds from peels, in order to concentrate bioactive components to a useful level. Bioavailability and bioactivity of more bioactive compounds such as polyphenolics and plant sterols may be increased by removing and modifying dietary fibers that block accessibility to enzymes and gut bacteria. Bioactive food wastes such as mushrooms with high vitamin D content will be processed into films or coatings.   Objective 2: Develop new healthy and flavorful foods from high protein waste materials. Processing wastes from soybeans, peanuts, rice and salmon will be analyzed for protein composition and food related physico-chemical properties. The waste materials will be formulated into foods to increase protein content and improve protein quality. Waste ingredients are often high in insoluble fibers that reduce functionality and may require fractionation from fiber to improve useful properties.    Objective 3: Develop blow spinning technology to efficiently produce natural nanofibers for controlled release applications and evaluate potential pulmonary toxicity effects of nanofibers in mice after intratracheal instillation of nanofibers. Using blow spinning processes nanofibers will be created from food ingredients such as gelatin, chitosan, and fruit and vegetable pomaces (grape, carrot, tomato and olive) in order to eliminate or reduce potential inhalation inflammation or toxicity. Although the nanofibers will be used for encapsulation of bioactive compounds for oral delivery the potential for inhalation during process requires toxicity testing. The ingredients as well as the nanofibers will be evaluated for inflammation and toxicity in a mouse model to determine degree and persistence of inflammation or toxicity if any. Ingredients that are most biocompatible will be used in subsequent studies.  Objective 4: Develop strategies to mitigate astringency in post-harvest materials in order to increase their utilization.  Tannins and minerals contribute to astringency and the identification and characterization of these components is essential. Total and free mineral contents in waste materials (nut shells, hulls, pits, pomaces, skins and seeds from stone fruits, nuts, and persimmons) will be measured using microwave-induced plasma atomic emission spectrometry following microwave-assisted digestion or leaching.  Tannin levels in the same materials will be measured using total soluble phenolic, potassium iodate (hydrolysable tannin), and vanillin (condensed tannin) assays.  The metal (Zn, Cu, Fe) and protein binding properties of waste material tannins will be measured and compared to the properties of commercially available tannins.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
1294,"Objective(s): 1. Enable new commercial sensor-in-system flowing-grain microwave moisture and density meters for precision farming and yield monitoring.   2. Enable a portable, commercial microwave meter to create capacity for rapid grading in-shell almond and peanut by determining moisture content, meat content, and foreign material contents.  3. Enable new commercial microwave sensors for monitoring controlled drying of grain, peanuts and other seeds.  Approach: I:  To enable a new commercial sensor for flowing grain microwave moisture and density, dielectric-based algorithms for bulk density and moisture content determination at microwave frequencies will be tested in flowing situations. In designing a flowing-grain system, the frequency must be higher than 3 GHz, free-space transmission techniques will be used for on-line applications, and measurements will be performed in the near field to keep the system compact. At least three cultivars each of wheat, corn, and soybeans will be obtained from certified seed with some geographic and seasonal diversity. Moisture, density, and temperature will be varied for model development and then validated on flowing grain.  Next, a prototype sensor made with off-the-shelf components will be assembled and tested. Then a user-friendly, step-by-step software programs will be developed to control the measurements with moisture predictions within 0.2% to 0.5%, and bulk density will be within less than 2% relative error.  II:  The above system will next be developed for rapid grading of in-shell almond and peanut by determining moisture content, meat content, and foreign material contents. First dielectric properties data will be collected with laboratory grade instrumentation on un-cleaned and cleaned in-shell almonds and peanuts of different varieties and from different locations and compared to oven-drying moisture and meat content.  Measurements will also be collected on almond and peanut kernels alone.  The data will comprise of dielectric properties corresponding to frequency, temperature, moisture content, bulk density, meat content, and foreign material content. The next step is to develop a microwave prototype for moisture content, meat content, and foreign material content in in-shell almonds and peanuts which will be externally controlled with a laptop computer and ultimately packaged to satisfy grading requirements and withstand working conditions at buying stations.    III: The last approach is to use the microwave moisture sensors developed above to monitor and record moisture content of grain, peanuts and other seeds in real-time during drying while improving efficiency through control of drying and minimizing energy consumption when compared to existing drying controls.  To accomplish this, a microwave moisture meter will be combined with three temperature sensors and a relative humidity sensor to monitor peanut drying in a quarter scale-model drying wagon to optimize the drying process by determining real time in-shell kernel moisture content in different zones of the trailer.  Similar work will be performed with cereal grains and oilseeds stored and dried in large, farm storage bins. Varying temperature and moisture profiles will be evaluated during the drying process. Through feedback control, the system will optimize the drying process to better ensure even drying throughout the trailer (for peanuts) and bin (for grains). Once successful, the microwave moisture meter(s) will then be integrated with all other sensors in one single unit including a microcontroller, an LCD, and mass storage device.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

To test whether defensive bacterial endosymbionts affect acceptance and suitability of hosts of parasitoids and to determine mechanisms underlying these effects, we will assay more species of parasitoids on more species of aphids with and without their defensive endosymbionts. To test whether host ranges of Aphelinus species are ever dynamic, we will test the effects of starvation, age, and experience on parasitism of sub-optimal hosts by parasitoid species with broad host ranges. We will do additional experiments on the interactions between host plant resistance and parasitism by Aphelinus species.

Commercially available and experimental sweet potato varieties will be planted annually and the economic impact of insect and nematode control in sweet potato will be examined.  The impact of current insect management strategies in southern row crops on populations of pollinators and beneficial insects will be examined in production fields. The surrounding habitats of each field will be documented for plant community composition, focusing on blooming plants that may be of interest to pollinators. Each of these fields will be sampled using a combination of sampling techniques.  Community structure will be compared between cropping systems, and related to insecticide applications. We plan to evaluate acute and sub-lethal toxicities and synergistic/antagonistic interactions of honey bees to commonly used pesticides.  An examination of gene regulation in honey bees associated with immunity, adaptation, detoxification, digestion/metabolism, and stress-related genes will be conducted after exposure to pesticides with techniques such as real-time PCR , RNAseq or microarrays.  Hemipteran and lepidopteran phytophagous pest populations are highly mobile within the landscape and use a variety of weeds and crops as host plants. To examine landscape influences on these insects, the landscape composition surrounding historic and current collection locations will be quantified using Cropland Data Layers (CDLs).  Using these CDL layers, buffer zones will be generated around locations. Output data will be tabulated to produce total area of habitat type included within each buffer area and will be related to data collected on insect populations using appropriate statistical analyses.  SIMRU will continue to examine susceptibilities of hemipteran and lepidopteran insect pests collected from locations across the Mississippi Delta with a variety of assay methods which may include topically treated diet, residual contact bioassays, glass vial bioassays and a feeding contact assays using floral foam.  Insects from original collections will be preserved for molecular analysis using genetic markers.  When colonies of any of the pest groups have reduced susceptibility to the tested insecticides, efforts will be made to preserve the colony under a selected and non-selected sequence of exposures to the insecticides of interest We propose to develop rapid bioassays to predict the effectiveness of an insecticide application on a real field population of insects.

Develop novel and cost-competitive structures of biobased additives and base oils.   Sub-objective 3.B. Investigate tribological property of novel biobased additives and base oils and use results to optimize the respective chemical structures.  This project is aimed at developing enabling new commercial technologies, processes, and biobased products for various markets including for: remediation (specifically heavy metal remediation to include water treatment/purification); lubricant additives; lubricant base oils; and chemical additives. The technologies and products from this research will be competitive in cost and performance to those currently in the respective markets.

These items present a series of decision points that will be addressed during the course of the research project.  (2)Recent research within the unit has shown thioalkyl derivatives of vegetable oils can be used in heavy metal remediation applications with the thioalkyl derivatives acting as metal-coordinating agents for silver ions. Building on these successful findings, new compounds featuring sulfur as the source of binding or chelation will be the primary objective. The initial feedstocks to be examined will be monounsaturated fatty compounds. This will be followed by the more chemically challenging di- and tri-unsaturated fatty compounds and, finally, vegetable oils. Emphasis will be placed on industrial oil feedstocks with enhanced sustainability. Additionally, materials from Objective 1, as they become available, will serve as unique, valuable starting materials.  (3a) New biobased additives and base oils will be synthesized from commodity oils and their derivatives. Commodity vegetable oils comprise fatty acids with unsaturation that can be used as reactive sites for chemical modification. In addition to commodity vegetable oils, polymercaptanized soybean oil, which is produced in large quantities from abundant soybean oil and cheap hydrogen sulfide will be used. Other biobased feedstocks to be used in the synthesis include: FAME, obtained from the biodiesel process, especially those with unsaturation on their hydrocarbon chains; esters of fatty acid with various alcohol structures; etc. (3b) The new biobased additives will be first investigated for their compatibility with standard base oils. Additives found to be incompatible will be investigated using various approaches to make them more compatible. Only compatible additives will be allowed into the next phase which involves the investigation of their effectiveness at performing the specific tasks relevant to its application. Additives will be investigated relative to commercial reference additives using established tests for each application.

Manipulate swine dietary ingredients to improve nutrient utilization and reduce nutrient excretion and the emission of gasses into the environment. 2. Quantify and modify swine gastrointestinal microflora to improve nutrient utilization and reduce the emission of gasses into the environment. 3. Quantify the impact of swine dietary regimens on nutrient metabolism and immune function of the gastrointestinal tract and the whole animal in order to assess the potential tradeoffs between environmental concerns and production. 4. Exploit genetically-mediated mechanisms involved in Salmonella colonization of the swine gastrointestinal tract to reduce subsequent shedding into manure.  Approach: The impact of dietary ingredients on nutrient utilization in the pig and subsequent nutrient excretion and emission of gasses into the environment will be assessed through altering the source and level of dietary protein and carbohydrate. The protein level will be adjusted relative to the level of soybean meal and amino acid supplementation utilized in diet formulation, while the protein source factor will be accomplished by replacing soybean meal with either canola meal, corn gluten meal, or poultry meal. The source and level of complex carbohydrate will be accomplished by utilizing barley, beet pulp, distillers dried grains with solubles, soybean hulls, and wheat bran as a partial replacement of soybean meal. Nutrient retention, excretion, and gas emissions will be accomplished using animal metabolism trials and the employment of a manure storage system currently in place at the lab. Microbial ecology of the large intestine (via fresh feces) and manure, as affected by the source and level of protein and carbohydrate, will be assessed by classical and molecular methods currently employed at the Unit, using the same pigs and diets as described above. The impact of dietary regimens on nutrient metabolism and immune function will be accomplished by utilizing similarly formulated diets as above, but on a separate group of pigs, with assessment of systemic and intestinal immune system function using techniques currently being utilized within the Unit.

1301,"Objective(s): The main objectives proposed in this Project Plan are to develop and improve sustainable management strategies for weeds and insects. Effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs are vital to a sustainable cropping system. Over the next 5 years, the project will focus on the following objectives:  Objective 1: Evaluate newer herbicide chemistries (i.e., 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPPD) inhibitors, cell wall biosynthesis inhibitors, etc.) for efficacy of weed control in sugarcane and crop safety, as well as older, currently registered herbicides to improve weed management (tank-mix combinations, timing of application, use of spray adjuvants, etc.).  Objective 2: Evaluate cultural control methods for reducing weed interference in sugarcane including, but not limited to: varietal differences in competitiveness of sugarcane, inter-row tillage timing, type, frequency, and rotational crops (including green manure cover crops) that could be used during fallow season compared with chemical fallow, and site-specific management.  Objective 3: Enhance the role of plant resistance in managing damaging infestations of stem borers (i.e., sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer) in sugarcane. Sub-objective 3.A: Characterize fiber among commercial sugarcane cultivars resistant to the sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer. Sub-objective 3.B: Identify borer resistant progeny in high sucrose bi-parental crosses.  Objective 4: Identify control tactics for managing damaging infestations of a hemipteran complex (e.g., sugarcane aphid, yellow sugarcane aphid, West Indian canefly, and sugarcane delphacid) to include the role of soil health on these infestations and new insecticides for controlling the complex.  Approach: The approach to meeting the objectives of this project plan will be primarily in the form of replicated field experiments. Some of these field experiments will also be supported by laboratory analyses. New herbicide chemistries, when they become available, will provide the potential for greater efficacy in weed control; however, determining appropriate application rates, application timing, and application methodology will require replicated field experimentation that are repeated in multiple years. Results from these experiments will be used for obtaining labeling by EPA and ultimately in formulating extension recommendations to sugarcane growers. Cultural controls provide opportunities for reducing weed pressure by planting sugarcane varieties with greater competitiveness resulting in more efficient tillage practices (i.e. fewer cultivations). Planting rotational crops (e.g. soybean and sweet sorghum) will provide an additional income stream to growers while also aiding in suppressing weed infestations. To develop these improved cultural practices will also require a series of field experiments. The results from these studies will also be used to develop extension recommendations for sugarcane growers. Enhancing the role of plant resistance in controlling the sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer will require a more in-depth knowledge of fiber composition in commercial sugarcane varieties. A replicated field experiment consisting of sugarcane varieties with known reaction to sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer will provide plant tissue for detailed fiber analyses. Ultimately a fiber profile will be qualified and quantified that will allow selection for stem borer resistance in the absence of the insect pest. Finally, field experiments will be conducted to identify control tactics for managing damaging infestations of a four-species hemipteran complex infesting sugarcane. These experiments will seek to better refine damage thresholds and ultimately establish action thresholds for initiating insecticide applications. The most effective insecticide formulations will need be to be identified as well as determining their most economical application rates. Ultimately, the findings from this Project Plan will be used to develop improved and sustainable management strategies for weeds and insects pest of sugarcane primarily in Louisiana, but the findings are generally applicable for sugarcane grown in Florida and Texas.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

1304,"AbstractParenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) is a significant complication of prolonged parenteralnutrition. An estimated 50,000 infants are at risk to develop PNAC each year in the United States. Thedisease is particularly common in premature infants and those who undergo major gastrointestinal operationsin the neonatal period. PNAC is associated with a 50% risk of sepsis and a mortality rate as high as 20% to30%. Studies have shown that soybean-based fat emulsions have a direct causative effect on thedevelopment of cholestasis and its progression to liver failure but this product remains the only FDA-approvedintravenous lipid available in the United States. Given these two factors, several strategies have beenundertaken to minimize the deleterious effects of soybean-based fat emulsions on the liver. One promisingapproach is the administration of a lower dose of the IV fat emulsion as both a treatment and preventativeapproach for PNAC. While IV fat emulsion dose reduction appears to offer substantial benefit in the treatmentand prevention of PNAC in infants in small, retrospective evaluations, data from well-controlled clinical studiesare not available. Several questions regarding IV fat emulsion dose reduction remain. Specifically, the timingof dose reduction and the optimal dose have not been elucidated. The overall long-term safety of thesestrategies in this population remain unknown particularly as they relate to neurodevelopmental outcomes.Limiting the dose of IV fat emulsion may have a negative effect on essential fatty acid levels which in turn mayaffect neurologic and behavioral development as essential fatty acids are crucial during brain development inthe neonatal period. Little data exist regarding the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonatestreated with IV fat emulsion dose reduction.This study will evaluate the hypothesis that a lower dose of IV fat emulsion will prevent and/or reducethe severity of PNAC when compared to a standard dose of IV fat emulsion without having negativeeffects on growth or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Study subjects will include surgical neonates who willbe dependent on parenteral nutrition for a prolonged period of time. Subjects will be enrolled in a prospective,randomized multi-center trial comparing IV fat emulsion given at a standard (3 g/kg/day) or reduced (1g/kg/day) dose. The primary outcome measure will be a comparison of the rate of rise of direct bilirubinbetween the two groups. Secondary outcome measures will include the time to development of PNAC as wellas the incidence of essential fatty acid deficiency and/or poor growth in both study arms. Finally,neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed in all subjects at 12 and 24 months of age to assess the long-term safety of this treatment modality.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1305,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Widely used to promote cardiovascular health, grape seed extract (GSE) contains high levels of proanthocyanidins with strong antioxidant properties. In preliminary in vitro studies, we identifie a variety of GSE-mediated anti-neoplastic mechanisms, including induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation via down-regulation of specific microRNA (miRNA). We now aim to translate these in vitro findings and set the stage for future clinical trial. A standardized GSE preparation complexed with soy phospholipids into phytosomes to improve bioavailability (Leucoselect) is available over the counter. Leucoselect has been shown to improve the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and reduce LDL susceptibility to oxidative stress in heavy smokers, but the potential of Leucoselect against lung cancer has never been evaluated. We therefore hypothesize that oral administration of Leucoselect will exert antineoplastic effects andfavorably modulate mechanisms associated with lung cancer. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim #1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK)/ pharmacodynamics (PD), and anti-cancer effects of Leucoselect in mouse models. A dose range finding study with leucoselect will be conducted in nude mice given varying doses via oral gavage. Blood and lung samples will be obtained to determine PK of grape seed procyanidin (GSP) and metabolites as surrogate markers of bioavailability of GSE (systemically and in the lungs), and to establish the MTD over 2 weeks treatment duration. Aim #1.1: To determine the bioactivity of oral Leucoselect at the targeted organ site using a novel co-culture system of snap frozen mouse lung sections with human lung neoplastic cells. Bioactivity in the lungs will be assessed by comparing lung tissue sections from control vs. Leucoselect treated mice co-cultured with the human nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, A549, and the bronchial premaligant cell line, 1198. The effects of varying GSE doses on proliferation and apoptosis in co-cultured A549 and 1198 cells will be correlated to GSP and metabolites levels. Aim #2: To determine the anti-caner effects of Leucoselect on lung cancer xenograft models. Varying doses of Leucoselect based on MTD will be administered via oral gavage to mice bearing subcutaneous NSCLC xenografts for up to 8 weeks, with serial collections of plasma, lung tissues and tumor xenografts from each treatment group. The anticancer effects will be determined by tumor growth delay or time to reach maximum tumor volume, proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptotic (cleaved caspase 3) indices, and correlated to GSP levels in plasma, lung tissue, and xenograft tumor samples. Aim #2.1: To further characterize and correlate the mechanistic effects of Leucoselect against lung cancer in xenograft models. The mechanistic effects of GSE will be measured by modulations of: 1) COX-2 expression and PGE2 production, and 2) Additional markers of inflammations: 15(S)-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and 3) mir-19a, -19b and -106b levels, 4) cancer relevant, pathway specific gene expression profiles (GEP), 5) microRNA expression, and 6) common biomarkers of cancerization such as p53, p27, p21 and p16, in various sample types. Aim #3: To validate and characterize the roles of mir-19a, mir-19b, and mir-106b in mediating the anti- neoplastic effects of Leucoselect and examine the potential of plasma mir-19a, mir-19b, mir-106b as SEBM for therapeutic monitoring. In our preliminary in vitro studies, we have identified significant down-regulation of 3 oncomirs: mir-19a, mir-19b, and mir-106b in NSCLC and 1198 cell lines by GSE. These miRNAs are among the major plasma miRNAs identified to be predictors of lung cancer development. Therefore, we will measure these miRNA levels in plasma obtained from xenograft models to determine their utility as surrogate endpoint biomarkers (SEBM). IMPACT: Findings from the study will provide important insights into the feasibility and mechanistic effects of GSE against lung cancer, help identify SEBM and pave the way for clinical trials in the near future. The potential gain for the management and prevention oflung cancer is enormous.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

1307,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Work funded under the PI's previous VA Merit award has contributed directly to a novel and now widely accepted life-saving treatment for local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) resuscitation has also been used in many instances to rapidly reverse acute cardiac and neurological symptoms of toxicity caused by a wide range of lipophilic (fat soluble) medications. In many published case reports involving LAST or other overdoses, ILE was effective even after standard resuscitation measures had failed. ILE is now a principle element in treatment guidelines published by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia, the Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, the Resuscitation Council (UK) and was added to the most recent American Heart Association ACLS guidelines for treating LAST. Drug overdose is the second leading cause of accidental death in the United States contributing to 36,000 fatalities in 2007 placing it ahead of gunshot wounds and just behind motor vehicle accidents. Moreover, veterans are at particular risk given the prevalence of both illicit drug abuse and the difficulty for a geriatric population to adhere to instructions for such prescription drugs as long acting calcium channel blockers that can be potentially fatal in overdose. Notably, ILE has been used effectively in treating overdose of many common prescription medications (e.g. beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants or calcium channel blockers) that can be highly resistant to standard resuscitation measures. Identifying the precise mechanism(s) underlying ILE holds the promise of improving its efficacy and providing an effective, generic antidotal treatment for a range of life-threatening toxic drug overdoses. However, the precise mechanisms of ILE are not well understood. The conventional explanation involves partitioning of the offending toxin into the newly created lipemic plasma phase, or 'lipid sink'. However, even this mechanism has not been tested rigorously in vivo. Moreover, we have observed that key aspects of ILE cannot be explained by the sink alone, indicating that other, less well-understood, mechanisms are also at play. We believe that ILE also directly benefits cardiovascular function and have confirmed in preliminary experiments that the infusion of lipid emulsion in the intact rat exerts positive effecs on cardiac contractility and aortic blood flow. We hypothesize that this results in part from direc, positive effects of fatty acid metabolism on cardiac function. Moreover, it is well-established tha tissue ischemia can cause intercellular endothelial gaps to expand, thereby allowing liposomes to migrate into the myocardial interstitium. Such passive targeting of lipid particles, essentiallynano-medicine, will bypass the normal tissue barriers to diffusion of drug away from cells and diminish the response time to lipid signal effectors. We hypothesize that extravascular migration of lipid particles contributes to the overall efficacy of ILE in reversing cardiac drug toxicity. W propose studies to test the metabolic effects of ILE and transendothelial migration of lipid particles. Finally, we seek to improve the translation of ILE to cocaine-related toxicity and longer-lasting overdoses such as calcium channel blocker toxicity. Improved patient safety and outcomes from drug toxicity are the over-arching goals of this project.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

1309,"Project SummaryLarge scale events like the Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig Explosion of 2010 and infant formulapurposely fortified with melamine in China cause great concern and heighten the level of awarenessof the importance of food safety. Local, state, and national response mechanisms are in place toquickly respond to these situations and help mitigate unforeseen consequences while protectingpublic and environmental health. Unfortunately, response assets at every level can quickly becomeoverwhelmed and may require surge or redundant capacity. The Food and Drug Administration FoodEmergency Response Network (FDA FERN) is one system in place that is comprised of both federaland state laboratories that bring personnel, supplies, equipment, and expertise together to enablefood and food product analyses during these situations. Many laboratories are volunteer laboratories,but 14 member laboratories have entered cooperative agreements for chemistry analysis and arenow referred to as FERN cCAP Laboratories. The Arkansas Department of Health-Arkansas PublicHealth Laboratory (ADH-PHL) became a FERN cCAP Laboratory in 2009 and has built a strongfoundation for food chemical analyses, method development, and emergency response.ADH-PHL provides a state-of-the-art laboratory environment for maintaining the Arkansas FERNChemistry Laboratory. Dedicated laboratory space, technical expertise, quality management systems,ISO 17025 accreditation as well as additional support staff, instrumentation, and space are availableif necessary. The entire laboratory staff has experience in the four key project areas of GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, and ELISA. ADH-PHL also partners with other federal response networks managed bythe Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency where ADH-PHL hasexercised and utilized the Incident Command Center within the state as well as nationally. Thisknowledge is crucial for mitigating large scale crises where food safety and human health isendangered.The Arkansas FERN Chemistry Laboratory continues to work to expand and enhance the capabilitiesof FERN by working closely with other cCAP laboratories and FDA. The laboratory is fully staffed,continues to cross-train, and validates FERN testing methods on GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, andELISA platforms. The laboratory continues to participate in all proficiency tests provided by FDA andhas exercised its response capabilities by developing new methods to successfully participate inthese proficiency tests. The laboratory participates in all technical and programmatic meetings, whichincludes conference calls. Currently, FERN analysts are actively involved in two, large, multi-laboratory method validations. In the past, the laboratory has analyzed numerous food matricesincluding powdered milk, freeze-dried tuna, spinach, mandarin oranges, pineapple juice, chocolatesyrup, soy-based baby formula, snack cakes, energy drinks, drinkable yogurt, salad dressing, catfish,spirits, snow peas, applesauce, cottage cheese, brown sugar, bottled water, cereal, baby food, fruitjuice and swordfish. Also, the laboratory has participated in surveillance activities, including thepolitical conventions and analyzing arsenic in juice.The project plan for this cooperative agreement continues to work closely with FDA to develop newmethods that are necessary for proactively responding to food safety initiatives while maintainingemergency preparedness by participating in proficiency tests, cross-training staff to provide additionalsurge support, and continued participation technical and national meetings and conference calls.Training sessions provided by FDA and other FERN partners will also be used to stay up-to-date ofthe newest technology used by FERN.

1310,"During the next 50 years we will need to produce more food than in the entire history of humankind on a decreasing amount of land for agriculture. A major challenge for the 21st century, therefore, is to increase the yields of major crop plants, such as soybean, using state-of-the-art genetic technologies in order to increase food production using the limited amount of land available for growing crops. Seeds represent a major source of food for human and animal consumption. The experiments in this project will investigate seed differentiation in higher plants. The long-term objective of this project is to use state-of-the-art genomic technologies to uncover the gene regulatory networks, or DNA control circuits, required to  make a seed.  There are several reasons that support the selection of soybean for this study. Soybean seeds are one of the largest sources of protein feed and vegetable oil in the world, providing $30 billion annually in farm value to the U.S.  Soybean seeds are uniquely suited to study the basic processes controlling seed development. Finally, there are enormous genetic resources for soybeans that will facilitate progress, including the availability of its entire DNA sequence. Undergraduates majoring in both science and humanities from three universities, including a historically African-American university, will also participate in this project in order to learn first-hand about the  excitement of scientific discovery  and the role crop genetic engineering plays in society.The goal of this project is to identify the gene regulatory networks that are responsible for controlling the differentiation and function of major soybean seed regions and subregions throughout development- including the embryo, endosperm, and seed coat. Chip-Seq experiments will be used to identify downstream gene targets and cognate DNA control elements of transcription factors (TFs) that are specific for each seed region and subregion from fertilization through maturation. Bioinformatic approaches will be used to construct regulatory networks that guide and control specific seed functions spatially during development. SELEX-Seq experiments will complement the Chip-Seq studies by identifying the DNA binding motifs for each region- and subregion-specific TF in vitro. Functional studies using a seed protoplast system will be used to perturb and validate TF gene targets identified with Chip-Seq in vivo. The significance of these experiments is that they will provide new insights into the gene circuits and cis-control modules that are important for  making a soybean seed.  By understanding the DNA  wiring  required for the establishment of seed form and function, novel approaches can be designed for increasing seed yield and, therefore, food production.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1311,"The human population is projected to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050, requiring a 50% increase in food and fiber production. A major constraint to this goal is crop losses due to microbial plant diseases which destroy approximately 15% of the world's total crop production every year. Advances in the science of plant disease control are needed to reduce crop losses to disease. Plant genomes encode thousands of genes involved in disease resistance, called the plant immune system. For some crops, modern science has made rapid progress in identifying disease resistance genes and using them in plant breeding, but for others such as long-lived tree crops, it is much more difficult to make rapid progress. This project will explore the plant immune system via a comprehensive study of the genes important for disease resistance to key pathogens of an important crop, cacao, which is the source of chocolate, and an important cash crop for millions of farmers in developing countries. The methods, tools and knowledge gained will be directly applicable to discovery of genes underlying important traits in other crops, especially trees and many perennial grasses. In addition to contributing to building a global partnership in reaching the goals of feeding a growing population sustainably, this project will involve students and young scientists in the US and in developing countries though international exchanges and collaborations.This project will establish a new approach for use with perennial crop plants to identify candidate loci for disease resistance using a model tree crop, Theobroma cacao (the chocolate tree). Whole genome re-sequencing and transcriptome sequencing of a core collection of highly diverse cacao genotypes will provide the genetic information necessary to drive the discovery of genes critical for pathogen resistance. Functional analysis of these genes will test their role in resistance and set the stage for future translation of these basic findings to guiding more efficient breeding programs utilizing a wider array of genetic diversity. Importantly, the methods, tools, and knowledge gained will be directly applicable to discovery of genes underlying important traits in other crops, especially heterozygous perennials such as trees and many grasses which are not particularly amenable to approaches developed for the major annual crops such as corn and soybean. The basic evolutionary and functional principles that will be discovered can be generalized to most if not all crop plants. To promote and build genomics research capacity in developing countries and to promote inter-disciplinary cross-training the project will support scientific exchanges between project members and foreign collaborators, through postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student training at multiple institutions and will involve students from minority serving institutions.

1312,"The conversion of large areas of Amazon forest vegetation for intensive crop production is one of the major forces shaping the Earth. Riparian forest buffers along streams can reduce the potential negative effects of forest clearing on stream water quality and stream habitat by intercepting nutrients, providing shade to reduce temperature and protecting stream channels. This project investigates how deforestation, cropland expansion and intensification, and increased fertilizer use influence the structure and sustainability of riparian forests, and ultimately affect their capacity to keep nutrient runoff from reaching streams. Research will take place in the Amazon state of Mato Grosso, Brazil's global hotspot of deforestation where soybean cultivation has expanded rapidly in the last two decades. Producers in the region are now shifting from single-cropped soybeans to double-cropped soybeans and corn, which greatly increases fertilizer inputs. This project addresses the globally important issue of how to protect and sustain water quality and aquatic resources in tropical regions, where high deforestation and rapid cropland expansion are increasingly common. By improving understanding of the trajectories and causes of riparian forest change and predicting the movement of nitrogen through riparian zones, these results will provide a basis for managing the negative impacts of tropical agricultural intensification. The project team will convey findings to policymakers and farmers in Brazil and the US by conducting two workshops on the scientific basis for riparian forest management and conservation. This project will investigate whether riparian forest fragments in cropland maintain their vegetation structure over time and how that structure is influenced by alterations to watershed hydrology and microclimate that are typical of cropland areas. Investigators will determine whether riparian forests bordering streams in croplands intercept and remove nitrogen from watersheds and whether this nitrogen removal function is sufficient to prevent excess nitrogen from reaching streams in cropland watersheds with high fertilizer inputs. The project will quantify how changes to riparian forest structure in croplands alter stream temperature, metabolism, nutrient uptake and downstream nutrient export. This will be accomplished by comparing riparian forests in replicated watersheds within intact tropical forest, soybean-only cropland and soybean-corn cropland. The project focuses on the following three hypotheses: (1) Riparian forests in cropland watersheds have higher tree mortality, lower tree growth and a more open canopy than either upland forests or riparian forests in forested watersheds. (2) Cropland watersheds have lower evapotranspiration, greater runoff and nutrient export, higher water tables, and wetter stream side slopes than forest watersheds but denitrification in riparian zones is insufficient to prevent excess nitrogen from reaching streams in double-cropped watersheds. (3) More open canopies in cropland riparian forest will increase stream temperature and metabolism. This project will create a new conceptual framework for understanding how deforestation, cropland expansion, and agricultural intensification influence tropical riparian forests and streams.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1313,"The project focuses on the connection between the nervous and immune systems, an exciting area of active investigation. Emerging evidence indicates that the so-called gut-brain-microbiota axis is very important for health in many different organisms. However, understanding how the nervous system can control host defenses against infection is very limited. Specifically, this research focuses on how neurotransmission in the central nervous system controls gene expression associated with host intestinal defenses in response to pathogens by a well-known molecular signaling pathway (Wnt signaling) in nematodes. Results from this study are expected to elucidate a previously unknown mechanism of neural control of intestinal immunity. The study of nematodes is significant because of their ecological ubiquity and because parasitic nematodes cause severe economic loss (for example, soybean cyst nematodes account for $1.5 billion in crop damage each year in the U.S. alone). In addition, the WNT and nervous system signaling that is the focus of this research using nematodes are conserved in other animals, so that this project will lead to fundamental insights that may be relevant to the nervous system and immune responses of vertebrates, including humans. This project integrates basic science research and a hands-on research experience for a high school teacher as a way to provide experience in the conduct of modern biological research and to have that perspective and understanding communicated to high school students.Neural control of innate immunity is an exciting emerging aspect of host defense, about which little is understood. This is especially true of nematodes, which are the most abundant animals on the planet and are widely used model organisms. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that wingless-Int1 (Wnt) signaling in neurons distally controls the expression of host defense genes in the intestinal epithelium via neuroendocrine signaling. The objective of this proposal is to understand this mechanism of neuroimmune regulation, by defining upstream signaling components that relay Wnt signals in neurons, and downstream mechanisms that mediate neuronal communication with the intestinal epithelium, thereby testing the central hypothesis. To achieve this objective, the Principal Investigator will elucidate the relevant neuronal and Wnt pathway component, specifically which Wnt ligands are induced, the signaling components functioning in neurons, and specific neurons that are involved. The second aim is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Wnt-activated neurons communicate with the intestine to elicit the host response. The researcher will identify neuronal signal(s) that may activate the intestinal response, the role of intestinal muscarinic receptors, and transcription factors controlled by acetylcholine. Because of the novelty of the Wnt-acetylcholine axis, this research has the potential to radically influence our understanding of host-microbe interactions in nematodes. In addition, because the Wnt pathway and muscarinic signaling are evolutionarily conserved, this research has high potential to catalyze advances in neuroimmunity in other organisms.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1314,"Funds are provided to study nitrogen (N) cycles in the Brazilian Amazon. The research aims at quantifying N transformation and transport pathways in natural and agricultural settings in the Neotropics. The shift in agriculture combined with the increase in nitrogen fertilizer inputs in tropical regions have the potential to drive profound losses of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere, or increased movement of soluble N to rivers and streams. The proposed field research will quantify N2O fluxes and N fate in the vadose zone, groundwater and streams under natural conditions (tropical forest), single cropping of soybeans, and double cropping with soybeans and maize.  Remote sensing will be used to scale up results from the field and model to the Amazon region, and incorporation of research results into a dynamic vegetation model (IBIS) that has been parameterized for the Amazon and will be used to estimate N emissions under different climate and land use management scenarios in the future. The work will test two hypotheses: (1) that increased N fertilization will lead to moderately but not greatly higher N2O emissions compared to natural forest because soils are well-drained and are not expected to go anaerobic long enough for accumulation of N2O, and (2) that N losses to streams will be minimal in N-fertilized plots because of high rates of uptake by maize crop and retention of any residual N leachates in deep, clay soils through anion exchange.The research will aid in understanding effects of changing agricultural practices on greenhouse gas emissions and stream pollution in the Amazon. Partnerships with local Brazilian scientists and training of US and Brazilian students will be important impacts from the research.

1315,"The goal of this work is to investigate in plants the function and evolution of a novel class of regulatory small RNAs. Prior work demonstrated that plant genes like those known to confer resistance to pathogens are the targets of a set of  microRNAs --suppressive regulatory RNAs just 22 nucleotides in length. These microRNAs are believed to function as master regulators of a very large family of protein coding disease-resistance genes, and part of their activity is to trigger the production of additional small RNAs (21 nucleotides in length) that have an unusual, regularly spaced pattern, or  phasing  of biogenesis. The regulation of this gene family, and several others targeted by microRNAs in the same way, is a new paradigm for microRNA function. The investigators have identified these small RNAs as conserved in many crop plants, including soybean, an alfalfa relative, tomato and potato. The aim of this project is to investigate this novel gene regulatory circuit to understand its function in plants, its role in plant defenses or beneficial microbial interactions, and whether it can ultimately be developed as a tool for improving plants or altering plant-microbe interactions to reduce disease or improve beneficial interactions. The project will utilize methods that include plant genomics, plant cell biology, plant-microbial interactions, and RNA analysis. The expected result is the dissection and understanding of a novel and complex gene regulatory mechanism.

In collaboration with Dr. Maj Padamsee of Landcare Research in Auckland, New Zealand, who has expertise working with kauri dieback and fungi that associate with kauri, this work aims to (1) identify beneficial fungi that associate with the roots of kauri; and (2) evaluate their potential to inhibit infection or slow the progression of the pathogen. The network formed to complete this work will be beneficial for professional development and future international collaborations. Findings from this research have the potential to improve control methods for kauri dieback and diseases caused by similar pathogens such as sudden oak death, soybean root rot and cocoa black pod disease that threaten economically and culturally important trees in other regions around the globe.Agathis australis (Araucariaceae), commonly referred to as kauri, is an ancient, long-lived, economically important and culturally significant conifer that is endemic to New Zealand. Kauri have been reduced from 1.6 million hectares to only ca. 7500 hectares since European arrival and the remaining trees are currently threatened by Phytophthora agathicida, an oomycete pathogen that causes a devastating collar rot known as kauri dieback. Padamsee and colleagues characterized mycorrhizal associations with kauri roots and found evidence of dark septate endophytes (DSEs) also being present in association with the roots via microscopic analyses. The scope of the present work is to (1) identify kauri-associated DSE fungi at the species level by sequencing their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions; and (2) evaluate the potential of DSE fungi to inhibit vegetative growth and spore germination rates of P. agathicida via two in vitro inhibition assays. Results from this investigation may serve as the basis for biocontrol methods that can be applied to kauri dieback and other important diseases that are caused by Phytophthora spp.This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1320,"Cowpea, also known as black-eyed pea in the U.S.A., is a protein-rich grain-producing plant native to Africa. When cowpea is combined with starchy grains such as corn, sorghum or rice, the result is a complete source of major nutrients for energy and growth. It also provides protein-rich leaves and is used for animal feed.  Cowpea is the primary source of protein for people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where it is presently produced on over 20 million acres mainly by farmers with small land holdings. Its popularity is also due to its resilience to low rainfall and heat while also enriching the soil. Despite its relevance to food security in Africa and elsewhere, there has been relatively little basic research on cowpea. Advances in next generation sequencing technology have made it possible to  read  the genetic material of cowpea and decipher the instructions (genes and genetic variation) that ultimately provide for crop improvement.  Producing an optimized reference genome sequence for cowpea is one of the main goals of this project, a feat that has been accomplished for human, mouse, cow and economically important crop plants such as corn, soybean, rice, bean and poplar. A broader purpose is to provide genetic resources to improve decision-making abilities within an existing network of African cowpea breeders. Breeders develop new varieties by making crosses between parents that carry favorable traits and selecting progeny containing favorable characteristics of both parents. This project will provide new materials for progeny selection in addition to knowledge that will facilitate the development of new cowpea varieties for increased food production. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is in the family Fabaceae, tribe Phaseoleae which includes other warm season legumes such as soybean, common bean and pigeon pea, as well as Vigna species adzuki bean and mung bean. Cowpea is diploid with 2n=22 chromosomes and a genome size of 620 Mb. Unlike other legumes, cowpea lacks a published reference genome. A highly fragmented draft genome sequence assembly has been available from previous work since 2011 (harvest-blast.org; harvest-web.org) and is derived from 60x short-reads combined with BAC-end and gene survey Sanger sequences. This project will elevate the sequence of cowpea to state-of-the art by: (1) adding long-read sequences and an optical map; (2) anchoring contigs to a recently developed genetic map containing 37,372 SNPs; and (3) improving browser access for the broader legume community. This will enable deeper utilization of cowpea germplasm for gene discovery and marker development, while providing a stronger foundation for the cowpea genetics and breeding community. Genetic intercrosses will be conducted to produce new pre-breeding lines that will theoretically carry optimal combinations of traits present within elite lines using a recently developed multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population based on eight parental lines.

1321,"An award is made to Iowa State University (ISU) to develop an automated instrument that can extract and quantify nematodes (roundworms) from soil samples.  Identifying crop nematode infestation with a quick and reliable soil analysis technique is possibly the Holy Grail in plant nematology. In this context, an automated instrument to determine cyst nematode egg numbers will be truly appealing for farmers, plant scientists, and agribusinesses. Knowing the nature and level of cyst nematode infestation in a field will help the farmer monitor the effectiveness of and plan for better pest management strategies, thereby improving soybean productivity. The instrument technology will be disseminated through extension talks to Iowa farmers and agribusiness personnel, online newsletters, videos on educational websites, and demonstrations at scientific and farmer conferences. Outreach will be conducted to stakeholders in the seed industry and universities to convince them to test the new instrument and provide feedback. In addition, programs will be developed to train minority and female life science students in programming and engaging third grade Iowa students through a unique NSF STEM-C project called Trinect.Plant-parasitic nematodes, such as the Soybean Cyst Nematode (SCN), are microscopic worms that damage plants and reduce crop yields worldwide. The only definite way to accurately identify SCN infestations and predict future crop damage in fields is by extracting and counting the number of SCN worms, cysts, and eggs in the soil. Current nematode extraction procedures and instruments are very old and labor intensive, and it is challenging to automate methods of soil processing and analysis. This project is to build a modern, automated instrument to perform all the mechanical functions involved in current nematode extraction procedures. Also, a smartphone-based microscope with custom software will be realized for the counting of SCN worms, cysts, and eggs. This automation will improve data consistency and reliability, reduce labor costs, and increase SCN testing of fields. The new instrument is designed to be flexible in operation for extracting different types of plant-parasitic nematodes, soil-borne fungal spores, and weed seeds.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1322,"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:Presently, the majority of polymers are derived from petroleum feedstocks. The development of sustainable, alternative resources for polymers is an open societal challenge. Epoxy resins are an important commercial class of polymer used in a variety of applications such as structural applications, advanced adhesives, aerospace and automotive components, and wind turbine blades. Epoxy resins are derived predominantly from petrochemicals. Additionally, these polymers cannot be recycled after the useful lifetime of the material. Plastic waste which is not recycled resides in landfills, and sometimes in unintentional locations such as waterways. This project will develop new epoxy resins with a reduced environmental impact through implementation of sustainable sources and enhancing the biodegradability of the materials. Two plant-based resources will be examined: vegetable oils and phenolic acids (found in many fruit and vegetable byproducts). Chemical routes will be developed for preparation of these materials, and their physical performance will be investigated. This project will also cultivate knowledge in students, educators and the general public on the impact of polymers on the environment, through the following activities: expansion of the Materials Day at UH program for local K-12 students, development of modules for the Houston Energy Day and Houston Earth Day celebrations, and participation of graduate and undergraduate students in research activities.TECHNICAL SUMMARY:The objective of this project is to develop new epoxy resins which contain sustainable, biodegradable, and non-toxic components, yet maintain the advantageous properties of conventional, petroleum-sourced materials. The research plan is structured around three specific aims. In the first aim, synthetic strategies will be established for epoxy resins containing biobased components. Plant-sourced phenolic acids will be employed to impart desirable mechanical behavior to the epoxy resins (due to the presence of aromatic rings) and soybean oil will be employed to impart biodegradability to the epoxy resins (due to the presence of ester linkages). In the second aim, a detailed understanding of structure-property-function relationships in sustainable epoxy resins will be developed. The functionality of the starting components is expected to have a great impact on the structural parameters of the epoxy network and ultimate macroscopic mechanical properties. The design of multicomponent epoxy resins will be leveraged to develop microphase separated thermoset blends with advantageous properties. In the third aim, hydrolytic degradation and biodegradation of epoxy resins containing soybean oil will be investigated. A key premise of the proposed work is that epoxy resins derived from soybean oil will maintain their properties during the useful lifetime of the products they are utilized in, yet can undergo biodegradation in a compost environment. The expected outcomes from this study are synthetic pathways to epoxy resins from non-traditional sources, characterization of the thermal and mechanical behavior of the newly derived epoxy resins, morphological investigation of microphase separated multicomponent epoxy resins, and hydrolytic and biodegradation mechanisms of epoxy resins which contain ester linkages.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1323,"The research supported by this award will investigate the human causes and consequences of agricultural expansion with accompanying deforestation. Deforestation's environmental impacts, including soil erosion, increased flooding, desertification, and habitat loss, are well-established. Logging can be a deforestation trigger, but agriculture is its biggest driver. Small-scale farmers cut wood for fuel and clear modest spaces for crops; mechanized, industrial farming and large-scale ranching clear larger tracts. Industrial agriculture has increased food production and reduced local food shortages. But because these large scale operations require access to expensive technologies and farming inputs, the expansion of industrial agriculture has also pushed poor rural farmers off their lands into cities and into the global flow of migrants. This confluence of agriculture, deforestation, urbanization, and migration changes local environments, destabilizes local politics, and impacts migrant receiving countries, including the United States.  These processes are well-documented on a global scale, but the local-level micro-processes that set these effects off in the beginning are much more poorly understood. How exactly does mechanized agriculture expand into forested areas? How do smallholders lose control of land? Why do so many end up leaving for urban areas? These are the questions the research funded by this award will address.The research will be carried out by University of Arizona anthropology doctoral student, Cari Tusing, with the supervision of senior anthropologist  Dr. Linda B. Green. Because these processes have already taken place in the United States, where industrial agriculture is now the norm, Tusing will travel to Paraguay where industrial soy farming is just now moving into forested areas, dramatically modifying the landscape and giving Paraguay a deforestation rate that is among the highest in the world. The researcher will concentrate data collection in the region surrounding the Paraguay-Brazil border, where Brazilians are crossing into Paraguay to develop land for large-scale agriculture and ranching in an area where Paraguayan small-scale farmers and Guarani Amerindians practice agroforestry and subsistence agriculture. The researcher will collect data on land titling; class, race, and national identities; and cultural understandings of the relationship between agriculture and deforestation. For this phase of a multi-phase project, the investigator will focus on the Brazilian (also called Brasiguayo) farmers to document their farming practices, strategies employed to obtain land, and social and economic networks. Data will be collected with multiple social science methods including participant observation, interviews, and farm transect walks. Comparable data have already been collected on small-holder farmers and Guarani Amerindians. Cumulatively, the three data sets will produce a fully rounded account of the nature of recent land-use change and its effects on agricultural production, deforestation, local livelihoods, and rural-to-urban migration.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1324,"This project is focused on using endogenous plant genes to engineer resistance to important crop pathogens.  This will be accomplished by enabling plants to detect the presence of specific pathogen proteases, which are enzymes that act like molecular scissors to cut specific target proteins in the host. Specifically, a single soybean gene will be modified, which should then enable soybean to detect the activity of pathogen proteases, and then activate defense responses. This protease recognition system does not require transfer of genes between species, thus such modified soybeans should not be considered GMOs, which should simplify regulatory approval, as well as consumer acceptance.  If this approach is successful in soybean, it should be applicable to all crop plants, which would decrease our dependence on environmentally harmful pesticides, while boosting crop yields and increasing world food security.Many important plant pathogens depend on proteases to infect host plants. The Innes laboratory is developing a novel method for engineering resistance to such pathogens based on detecting these specific proteases.  This system arises from their work on the AvrPphB protease from the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. AvrPphB is injected into host cells, where it targets a family of protein kinases that regulate basal defense responses, cleaving them in a single position. In Arabidopsis, this cleavage event is detected by the disease resistance (R) protein RPS5, which then activates defense responses. Specifically, cleavage of the host kinase PBS1 by AvrPphB activates RPS5-mediated resistance. The Innes laboratory has recently shown that the AvrPphB recognition sequence within PBS1 (seven amino acids) can be replaced by the recognition sequence for other pathogen proteases. These 'decoy' kinases can then be cleaved by the matching protease and activate RPS5.  Thus, by manipulating the PBS1 amino acid sequence, it is possible to engineer RPS5 to recognize just about any pathogen protease. This project seeks to extend this discovery to crop plants.  As a proof of concept, a soybean PBS1 ortholog will be modified, in separate constructs, to detect proteases from Soybean mosaic virus and Asian Soybean Rust.  Because most soybean varieties carry an endogenous disease resistance gene that detects AvrPphB protease activity, it is expected that modification of an endogenous soybean PBS1 protein, which is highly conserved among flowering plants, will enable detection of corresponding proteases. This project will provide underrepresented minorities at the high school and undergraduate levels with opportunities to participate in hands-on research, and to engage in the topic of sustainable agriculture.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1325,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the production of enhanced-nutrition (EN) soybeans that contain taurine and increased methionine. As the world population increases and becomes more affluent, meat and fish consumption is rapidly growing. The fastest growing food sector is aquaculture. Small wild-caught fish are used to make feed for aquaculture, but wild-caught fish harvests have not changed in 25 years. This practice is not sustainable. Overfishing the small fish population jeopardizes the marine ecosystem.  Aquafeed producers are turning to soy-based protein to replace fishmeal but plant proteins lack taurine and are deficient in methionine, two important amino acids for fish. To meet fish nutritional requirements, producers supplement soy-based aquafeed with synthetic taurine and methionine. In addition to added costs, synthetic taurine and methionine are produced from hazardous substances, and synthetic taurine has been shown to contain arsenic. EN soybeans would reduce the amount of supplemental amino acids required in aquafeed, a $2.2B global annual cost predicted for 2020, and could save aquafeed producers 20% of additive feed costs. The EN soybean would be an economical, healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly and secure source of taurine and methionine for the rapidly growing aquaculture industry.This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate that the enhanced-nutrition (EN) technology can produce commercially viable levels of taurine and methionine in soybean seeds without adversely affecting seed quality. Soy-based protein is replacing meat and fish-based protein. However, plants lack some amino acids required in aquafeed and must be supplemented, which increases feed-production costs. Taurine and methionine, two amino acids either lacking or limited in soybean, are added to soy-based aquafeed. The goal of this SBIR project is to produce soybeans that contain taurine and increased methionine that can be used in aquafeed with reduced supplemental amino acids. Molecular, biochemical, and physiological methods will be used to meet the following objectives in this Phase I research.  The goals are to determine whether EN soybean seeds contain taurine and have higher methionine levels compared with seeds of control lines; determine whether the EN technology affects the other amino acid levels, seed quality (total protein, oil, moisture content, and seed viability), or seed-storage protein levels; and identify five lines with high levels of taurine and methionine. Anticipated technical results are EN soybean seeds with taurine levels at least 0.2% dry seed weight and total methionine levels at least twice that of seeds in control lines.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Objective 3: Estimate the sensitivity of regional food production to climate change and contribute to international model intercomparison efforts.  Approach: Mechanistic models for soybean (GLYCIM), cotton (GOSSYM), corn (MAIZSIM), and potato (SPUDSIM), have been developed in previous projects by this group.

Objective 2: Evaluate winter oilseed yield potential in a corn-soybean rotation under various climate conditions. Objective 3: Evaluate water and nutrient management practices on crop and feedstock production, and soil properties.  Approach: An integrated approach is needed to improve farming systems toward greater sustainability to meet societal demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel.  Soil and crop management strategies can optimize the capacity of agricultural soils to store carbon while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions from nitrogen fertilizer and management practices. Past research has increased crop nutrient and water use efficiencies through best management practices coupled with the development of more heat- and drought-resistant germplasm; more improvements are required to adapt to a changing climate, increased competition for limited water resources, and increased demand by a growing population and improved standard of living. Further, a better understanding of how management affects soil organic carbon dynamics, including impacts on soil microbial structure and function, are needed to improve or maintain critical soil functions and associated ecosystem services. This project will (1) evaluate conservation tillage practices and crop diversity on the soil resource, (2) develop management guidelines for sustainable intensification of current corn-soybean rotations using winter oilseeds, and (3) improve water and nutrient practices on crop and feedstock production.

Sub-objective 2b: Develop and compare weed management systems in edamame, utilizing cover crops, herbicides, and physical weeding.  Approach: Multi-tactic integrated weed management (IWM) offers one potential approach to address the problem of multiple herbicide resistant (MHR) weeds. In IWM systems, suites of multiple complementary tactics are deployed throughout weed life cycles to increase efficacy of weed suppression, prevent survival of weeds that escape earlier management, and reduce weed populations over the long-term. In this project, we evaluate the utility of chemical, cultural, biological, and physical tactics in IWM systems for weed suppression and crop yield protection in fields with MHR weed populations. Edamame (vegetable soybean) cultivars tolerant to cover crop residues will be combined with cover crops, recently registered herbicides, and physical weeding to examine the potential of IWM in legume vegetable production systems. The contribution of improved knowledge of soil N cycling to aid better prediction of weed seedling emergence and community composition also will be evaluated in this production system.

Basic growth analyses, assays and bioassays using whole plants and plant tissues from laboratory, greenhouse and field experiments will determine major changes in resistant versus susceptible biotypes.  Subsequent biochemical, genetic, proteomic, immunochemical and radiological studies will identify and characterize specific site differences in herbicide resistant and sensitive weed biotypes within species.

[NP304, Component 2, Problem Statement 2A3]  Sub-objective 2.A: Identify genetic markers for improving the weed-suppressing trait of winter hardiness in winter canola and/or camelina varieties. Sub-objective 2.B: Evaluate the weed-suppressing traits of winter-hardy canola and camelina in the field.  Approach: Weeds are major pests of agro-ecosystems that reduce production of the nation’s food, feed, fiber and fuel crops. The industry-adopted practice of rotating crops with engineered tolerance to a limited set of herbicides continues to put selection pressure on the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. As part of a holistic and sustainable approach to managing weeds in temperate agro-ecosystems, we propose to identify cover crop-relay crop interactions to enhance relay crop productivity, cover crop-weed interactions to enhance weed suppression, and identify winter-hardy annual cover crops that suppress weeds in relay cropping systems. In this proposal, winter canola will serve a dual purpose as both a cover crop for evaluating weed suppression, and as a surrogate weed for weed-relay crop interactions. Our model relay cropping system consists of inter-seeding a commodity crop (corn or sunflower) into an established cover crop (winter canola) such that their lifecycles overlap. Currently, no winter-hardy annual broadleaf cover crops are economically suited for weed suppression in relay cropping systems in the upper Midwest (UMW) and Northern Great Plains (NGP). Consequently, the objectives of this project are: (1) elucidating regulatory signals and pathways associated with cover crop-relay crop and cover crop-weed interactions that impact plant productivity, and (2) identifying economically suited winter-hardy broadleaf cover crops that suppress weed establishment in inter-seeded relay crops.

Determine the best annual clovers to use as cover crops to control post-harvest weeds without tillage.  Approach: Pest management is crucial in cropping systems, and strategies to control weeds and insect pests need to be integrated with agronomic and other management goals to achieve sustainable cropping systems. In the northern Great Plains, corn rootworms, soybean aphids, and weeds greatly reduce agricultural productivity and profitability through yield loss and costly control measures. Widely adopted management tactics have initially reduced economic loss from these pests, but their utility needs reassessment in light of herbicide-tolerant weeds, insect adaptation to resistance transgenes, secondary pest outbreaks, and unwitting impacts on pollinators, natural enemies, and soil health. This project plan proposes research to address strategies used against major pests such as corn rootworms and soybean aphid, refine tactics for weed management in organic production systems, and determine the value and drawbacks to pest management and ecosystem services from diversifying crop rotations, incorporating cover crops, and using various plant-incorporated protectants.

1334,"Objective(s): Objective 1: Improve the representation of key responses in crop simulation models with emphasis on temperature responses and specific genetic controls (e.g., for phenology and growth habit). Objective 2: Characterize temperature responses of four cereal grain crops using an exceptionally wide range of natural air temperatures that emphasize near-lethal high temperature regimes, and assess quantitative responses simulated by crop models. Objective 3: Develop proximal sensing approaches for field-based, high-throughput phenotyping for drought and heat tolerance, including sensor testing, vehicle design, and software for work flows and data analysis.  Approach: Process-based ecophysiological models are among the best tools for quantifying how crop genetics (G), growing environments (E) and management (M) interact to determine productivity as well as ancillary properties of crop production including net greenhouse gas sequestration or releases, nutrient runoff and leaching, and water use. Crop models are especially useful where climate uncertainty or geospatial variability are of prime concerns and where information is needed for scenarios that are not readily adduced from historical data or field experiments. Modeling analyses are constrained by the accuracy of the responses quantified in the models, and recent modeling intercomparisons have identified numerous weaknesses and areas of high uncertainty in widely-used crop models. Our research seeks to improve model accuracy via three interrelated activities.   Insights from genomics and molecular biology will be used to strengthen how processes are represented in crop models and how parameters are estimated for individual cultivars. We propose to use existing large crop performance datasets and recently available genetic data (e.g., the soybean “SoySNP50K” initiative) to improve models. The two target topics are temperature interactions with water deficits and with nitrogen and representation of genetically controlled differences in phenology.   Because semi-arid desert regions experience wide temperature ranges, intra- and inter-annual variations in ambient temperature provide a cost-effective means to obtain robust data across multiple cereal grain crops simultaneously. To refine modeled thermal responses of crops at higher temperatures, we will conduct a Thermal Regime Agronomic Cereal Experiment (TRACE) using sequential sowing dates that range from the normal, commercial December plantings to very late dates in April and May, with closer intervals between plantings. The genotypes will include hard red and durum wheat, barley and triticale. Sowing the four crop types (with four replicates) over 8 planting dates and 2 years will provide data from 256 genotype x air temperature conditions, with air temperatures ranging from -2 to 42°C. These data will be assembled and formatted in accordance with ICASA Version 2.0 standards and distributed to the AgMIP-wheat team for model intercomparisons and improvement.

For locally adapted soybean and wheat cultivars, determine whether cultivar differences in effects of carbon dioxide concentration on yield in the field correlate with responses of flowering phenology or tillering to elevated carbon dioxide. (NP 216 Action Plan Component 5)  Objective 3.  Experimentally determine for soybeans, rice and wheat and some economically important weeds how much the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased crop yields and weed growth since 1960.  (NP 216 Action Plan Component 5)  Approach: Research will focus on determining how rising temperature alters responses of crop and weed physiology, growth, and product quality to elevated carbon dioxide. Differences among genotypes within several crop species in responses to elevated carbon dioxide and temperature will be assessed to identify traits which would help to adapt crops to these global change conditions. Responses of weeds in a locally and nationally important crop system will be evaluated to determine if rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature will increase their impact on crop yields and their resistance to control by glyphosate, a popular herbicide.

1336,"Nitrogen, with the occasional exception of water, is the most common limiting nutrient in agriculture. Overall agricultural production must increase if we are to continue to feed all of the people on this planet by the middle of the current millennium and beyond (Grantham 2012). While we may not be able to increase the acreage for agricultural production, we can attempt to make each acre produce more food and more nutritious food (Grantham 2012). The increased use of nitrogen fertilizers raises the cost of food production and creates environmental problems (Agency. 2005; Kim 2008; Mulvaney 2009). Symbiotic nitrogen fixation can be achieved cheaply without environmental problems. Unfortunately, many leguminous plants meet only about half of the plants nitrogen needs (Schumpp 2010; Sulieman 2010; Terpolilli 2012; Terpolilli 2008; van Kessel 2000). For example, soybean crops in the Midwest typically obtain only 25-60% of the nitrogen through symbiosis (Abel 1964; Carter 1978; Devine 1996; Erdman 1928; Esfahani 2014; Graham 1984; Hanus 1981; Herridge 1990; Salvagiotti 2008; Schubert 1978; Sulieman 2010; Terpolilli 2012). Achieving 100% of leguminous crop nitrogen from the atmosphere is possible if the physiological limitations of symbiotic nitrogen fixation can be identified (Terpolilli 2012). The complexity of the symbiotic nitrogen fixation means the process can be improved at many steps (Terpolilli 2012). This proposal attempts to identify one of these limiting factors in functioning nodules. The rationale for attempting to increase nitrogen fixation in soybean is that it is already an established feedstock with an established harvesting, collection, processing and distribution systems. Once these limitations are understood, that knowledge can be applied to create non-leguminous plants to fix atmospheric N2 symbiotically (Cocking 2009).",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Improvement of soybean productivity with limited moisture through the modern tools of plant breeding and biotechnology provide more sustainable approach to tolerate drought.

1340,"Subterranean termites and kudzu bugs are exotic invasive pests in the U.S. Both have significant economic and environment impacts on the urban and agriculture environments.Subterranean termites are the single greatest economic pest in the United States. These termites cause billions of dollars in damage each year to homes, historical structures and commercial buildings, as well as to forest and horticultural plants (Rust and Su 2012). Termites evolved as decomposers of dead plant materials and contribute to the nutrient turnover of soil (Holt and Lepage 2000), but rapid urbanization and deforestation changed their habitats and turned them into serious pests in urban, agriculture and forest environments. The Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Isoptera, Rhinotermitidae), alone was accountable for $1.5 billion annually in damage in 1994 (Su). The control cost, although high compared to those for other household pests, is considered relatively small in comparison with the value of a house and the damage potential by termites (Su and Scheffrahn 1998). In the southern states, there is an 80 - 100% chance of a home being attacked by termites in the absence of termite control measures (Mauldin 1986). Successful management of subterranean termites has been a challenge because of termites&#39; cryptic living style, unique social structure, large populations, tenacious foraging habits, unpredictable foraging patterns, and most importantly, unlimited food and moisture supplies in the urban and forest ecosystems (Potter 1997, Su and Scheffrahn 1998, Henderson 2001). Termite control carries the highest risk for the pest control industry of all categories in urban pest management. The termination of USDA  Operation Termite Full Stop  program (1998-2007) further aggravates our battle with Formosan subterranean termites in Alabama. This is partially attributed to the deposit of tons of termite-infested wood debris from neighboring states to Alabama in the wake of hurricanes and partially to declining in support for termite research and control program. In recent years, we have experienced an increasing number of calls from Historic Structure Organizations, the Society of Arboriculture and the Forest Society about Formosan termites endangering historic buildings and destroying living trees and ornamentals. Termites are also expanding their territory to infest horticulture crops, gardens and landscapes, causing economic loss and affecting the environment. Questions remain to be answered about what are the mechanism of their successful adaptations in urban and forest ecosystems, and what are the strategies and mechanisms in combating soil-borne harmful microorganisms and surviving standard termiticide treatments. For these reasons, termite research is a high priority.The kudzu bug (Heteroptera: Plataspididae: Megacopta cribraria F.) is an exotic insect. It was first discovered in the southeastern U.S. in 2009 and has now established across much of the Southeast (Gardner et al. 2013). Kudzu bugs have become a serious pest threatening soybean, vegetable, and horticultural producers. The kudzu bug problem is also exacerbated by its abundance in kudzu-infested urban areas where it has become a nuisance in homes and buildings. In addition to the severe crop loss caused to soybean, M. cribraria infestation also impacts international trade and commerce. After inspections of containers revealed dead kudzu bugs in shipments of frozen chicken meat paste, some Central American countries issued quarantine of products from Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina with a fear of accidental introductions in contaminated shipments there. As the pest has established in all the 67 counties in Alabama, the threat posed by this invasive insect species is rapidly increasing and no effective control strategies other than chemical insecticides are currently available to help soybean farmers manage this exotic insect in the region. As a consequence, farmers have continued to rely heavily on insecticide sprays to control kudzu bug. This increased use of chemical pesticides can result in the development of pest resistance. Though presumed no local natural enemies, we discovered two naturally occurring parasitoids and a pathogenic fungus in AL in 2014 (Golec et al. 2013, Gardner et al. 2013). However, their economic impact in suppressing kudzu bug populations and effects on soybean yield remain unclear. Because it is new pest in U.S. and its pest status continue elevating in urban, agriculture and international trade, kudzu bug research deserves a high priority.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1341,"This proposal specifically providesfundamental knowledge to application to improve emerging technologies having direct field application in reducing the cost of feed.Getting nursery pigs started on feed and off to a good start is one key to success for swine producers. Although soybean meal is a relatively cheap protein source, it contains anti-nutritional factors that limit its substantial inclusion in weanling pig diets. Animal proteins such as fish meal are often used to replace soybean meal in weanling pig diets to help improve growth performance. Over recent years the supply of fish meal has continued to decrease while the demand has continued to increase, driving increases in its price. Identifying replacement ingredients for fish meal can provide an economic advantage to pork producers when raising nursery pigs. Microalgae production is one emerging technology that has potential to provide a sustainable feed ingredient for swine. Microalgae growth captures CO2 and generate protein without compromising food security and land use. After the oil extraction process, a co-product (DFAP) resides that contains significant amounts of protein, lipids, and other nutrients such as carotenoids.Disadvantages of algal protein powder The production of microalgae is a relatively new and emerging technology. Therefore, the short term benefits for swine producers are hard to grasp. This technology is in the developing stages with advancements being made to further improve its efficiency to generate more protein. It is important to understand the basic knowledge and application of DFAP in order to take advantage of future opportunities when they become available. The experiments conducted within the scope of this grant will use DFAP derived from the microalgae Dunaliella salina (Renewable Algal Energy, Johnson City, Tenn.). Quantities are currently available to achieve the scope of work provided.Advantages of algal protein powder: De-fatted algal powder produced by Dunaliella salina algae has comparable levels of most amino acids (AA) compared to fish meal. Although, SID AA values are not available, DFAP may have a higher bioavailability of amino acids because the pliable cell membrane is ruptured prior to use in the feed. Therefore, it is probable that DFAP could be a viable replacement for fish meal and reduce the amount of soybean meal included in nursery pig diets. In addition, DFAP produced by Dunaliella salina algae contain omega-3 fatty acids with a 3:1 ratio of omega 3/omega 6 and various carotenoids. Dunaliella salina algae is currently one of the top three algal species grown in the world [EERE National Algal Biofuels Roadmap, p. 62 (2010)], and is unique because of its favorable amino acid profile in combination with the absence of a cell wall. Advancing basic scientific information: Due to the recent development of this ingredient there is little information about its inclusion in nursery pig feed. Currently nutrient composition data is not available for this product in the NRC (2012). Thus, it is imperative to quantify nutrient composition, content of SID AA, and practical application in nursery pig diets.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1342,"This project is about remote sensing in precision agriculture. The focus is to explore new approaches utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and advanced remote sensing techniques such as hyperspectral imaging and novel chemical sensor development to solve agricultural problems including insect population distribution mapping in field scale, apple yield and ripeness mapping and corn nitrogen deficiency detection. These are either emerging issues or future precision agriculture applications that growers are eager to know more about. For example, soybean aphid mapping can help soybean growers apply pesticide more precisely in their field, targeting only aphid populations that cause potential yield reduction. This in turn is good for the environment since fewer chemicals will run to our surface water. The expected output of these remote sensing projects is a systematic solution for agricultural researchers and growers to better use remote sensing techniques in solving fundamental agricultural problems. We will study novel experimental and computational approaches integrating the following techniques: multispectral/hyperspectral imaging, sensor development and machine learning.

1343,"The growth of marine aquaculture is meeting resistance in many areas, however, because of multiple user conflicts, concerns over environmental degradation, and reports of the spread of diseases to wild fish populations.Freshwater finfish production in the northeastern US is generally conducted in private, dug ponds, recirculating aquaculture systems, or in the case of trout, flow-through raceways. For many foodfish species, pond culture in the northeast is economically challenging, because of the relatively short growing season. One remedy for all of these concerns is to grow fish in tanks in land-based systems that continuously re-use water (recirculating aquaculture systems; RAS). Additional profits may be realized by co-culturing fish and vegetable plants in recirculating aquaponic systems (aquaculture-hydroponic). The success of these culture systems, however, is often determined by the optimizing selection of both fish and crop species. Another great concern in aquaculture, that will likely limit future growth of the industry, is the use of fishmeal, derived from small, marine fish, primarily harvested from South American waters, as a protein source in finfish diets. Although also used as a feed component in the poultry and swine industries, fishmeal comprises a greater percentage of fish diets and its use is viewed as unsustainable in the long term. Globally, aquaculture consumes two-thirds of the world&#39;s fishmeal and three-fourths of the fish oil supply. Alternatives protein sources, derived from terrestrial products (e.g. soy), have been used to replace some or all of the fishmeal in finfish diets, but their suitability is highly species-dependent and can lead to unfavorable fatty acid profiles in the harvested fish.This research addresses these major concerns by investigating the growth of freshwater fish species (brown bullhead, striped bass) in recirculating aquaculture systems while also incorporating crop production.

1349,"The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an important crop in several regions of the United States (U.S.). Demand for dry and snap beans is expected to remain strong or increase as consumers search for healthy alternatives in their diet and there are greater numbers of citizens in the U.S. with a culinary tradition of consuming beans. In order to compete with other commodities such as soybeans and maize, dry bean seed yields need to continue to increase. More efficient use of inputs such as water and nitrogen is needed to reduce production costs and to preserve scarce resources. Numerous abiotic and biotic stresses can threaten both dry and snap bean production. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases are among the main production constraints, whereas drought, heat, soil mineral deficiencies, and short growing seasons reduce productivity and contribute to a yield-gap between on-farm and potential seed yield in many production areas.In addition to human health benefits, beans promote soil and environmental health through biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen which allows beans to be produced with less N-fertilizer than other non-legume crops. The nitrogen fixation characteristic of common bean and other legumes promotes sustainable agriculture practices by reducing fertilizer use, the potential for water contamination through run-off, and crop expansion in low nitrogen soils.Several diseases can occur simultaneously and reduce dry and snap bean yield and quality within and across different production regions. Yield losses can range from 10 to 90%, depending on the diseases involved and the severity. For example, in the Western U.S., Beet curly top virus (BCTV), Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), Fusarium root rot (caused by Fusarium solani f.sp. phaseoli) and Fusarium wilt (caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. phaseoli), and white mold (caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), can simultaneously infect susceptible cultivars. Similarly, in Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, anthracnose (caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum), bacterial brown spot [caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Psp)], BCMV, common bacterial blight [caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli (Xcp) and X. axonopodis pv. phaseoli var. fuscans (Xcpf), Syn. with X. campestris], halo blight (caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola), root rots (in most cases caused by a complex of fungal pathogens), rust (caused by Uromyces appendiculatus), and white mold can occur together and cause severe yield losses. Similarly, the root rot pathogens cause serious problems in snap beans and kidney beans across all production regions. In addition, snap beans are vulnerable to regional epidemics of viral diseases including Beet mild curly top virus (BMCTV) in the western states (e.g., California, Idaho and Washington), and to a virus complex in the Great Lakes states which includes Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV), and Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV), among others. Many of these pathogens are highly variable in their virulence and new races or strains can appear in different regions.This interdisciplinary, multi-state, collaborative W-3150 project proposal comprises several complementary sub-projects. Key collaboration among participants in these sub-projects is designed to achieve our overall goals and objectives of developing high yielding cultivars with enhanced culinary and nutritional qualities and resistance to major abiotic and biotic stresses. These cultivars will help reduce production costs and pesticide use, increase yield and competitiveness of the U.S. bean growers, and sustain production for domestic consumption and export. Researchers participating in each sub-project have complementary expertise and represent two or more institutions.

1350,"Phototrophic microorganisms have a great potential for use as a biological catalyst that converts sunlight (as a renewable energy source) into biodiesel precursor molecules, specialty chemical substrates, or biomass for biofuel or feed. Additionally, algae can remediate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and attention to biodiesel has increased in recent years. Current existing land estimates to satisfy the US fuel demand with corn and soybean derived oil exceed 1600% and 650% of existing US cropping area, respectively. Comparatively, these same fuel demands can be accomplished using 5% of existing land with microalgae averaging 30% dry weight as TAG. This is a conservative percentage due to reports of strains capable of 50-60% TAG per dry weight. In addition,  algae  represents a broad class of organisms, that grow in diverse environmental conditions including marine, hypersaline, alkaline, brackish, and municipal or agricultural wastewaters. By coupling these water sources with land not fit for agricultural crops, traditional food crop resources can be avoided for use in biodiesel production.In some cases algae can fix atmospheric nitrogen for potential biofertilizer applications; and often being the primary limiting essential nutrient for plant cropping, nitrogen is estimated to require 1.2% of the total global energy demand using current methods of producing chemical nitrogen fertilizer. Production of these fertilizers (i.e., ammonia, ammonium nitrate, and urea) is most commonly based on natural gas, consuming 3-5% of the world&#39;s annual production, and many life cycle assessment studies attribute production of these fertilizers as one of agriculture&#39;s major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. However, nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria (classified as algae) are capable of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) fixation and represent an alternative approach to supplying nitrogen to soils in the US. Thus, given that they grow using solar energy with minimal nutrients, nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria are a progressive alternative approach to biofertilizers in a commercial setting.

1352,"Fungal pathogens of plants destroy thousands of acres of crops annually. In addition to losses, control of fungal diseases frequently involves the use of pesticides that are expensive and can have an impact on the environment. Research that advances our understanding of how fungi cause disease on plants may lead to the development of crops that naturally resist infection. Cultivation of disease-resistant crop varieties reduces crop losses and the need for chemical pesticides and other expensive control methods, and thus is the control method of choice for affordable and environmentally sound crop disease control. Fungal pathogens of plants utilize many strategies for successful disease development. Among them is the production of toxins that kill host plant cells. This project focuses on two important fungal pathogens of plants and the toxins they use to infect their hosts. Fungi in the genus Cercospora are a group of highly successful and destructive pathogens that cause disease on a wide range of host plants world-wide including sugar beet, corn, soybean, coffee, and peanut, as well as vegetable and ornamental crops. Previous studies have shown that these fungi utilize a light-activated toxin for successful disease development. The toxin produces toxic forms of oxygen that harm living cells and is toxic to animals and microorganisms in addition to plants. The Cercospora fungi, however, are resistant. This project will engineer plants with genes previously identified that provide resistance to the toxin or interfere with its production, and determine if this strategy can provide disease resistance. This project will also study the fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis, the causal agent of one of the most destructive diseases of banana, the black Sigatoka disease. Previous studies have suggested that this fungus also uses a light-activated toxin for infection. This project will focus on identifying and characterizing toxins produced by this fungus and confirming their importance in successful disease development.

1353,"Over the last decade, our research laboratory has been very successful in identifying and mapping molecular markers associated with resistance to important quality traits in snap beans including calcium and sugar concentrations as well as disease resistance, including Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, and Aphanomyces euteiches. We have used quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping information to facilitate introgression and pyramid genes for favorable disease resistance and quality traits in snap beans. The consistent limitation has been that our linkage maps, though extensive, are based on marker systems (i.e. RAPDs) that do not allow ready communication to other mapped bean populations or comparisons to the genomes of other species of Fabaceae. The cooperative Bean CAP project provides not only sequence information but also the tagged SNP markers that will allow us to communicate and compare our results not only with other bean populations but also throughout the Fabaceae and even allow for potential gene discovery with Arabidopsis or maize.Common bean is 2n=2x=22 and soybean is 2n=2x=40 and both are members of the family Fabaceae. In early macrosyntentic level studies, genome comparisons of soybean, common bean, and mung bean determined that common bean shares a large synteny with soybean. The doubling the chromosome number in Glycine max is due to genome duplication followed by rearrangements leading to diploidization. In addition to soybean, genes in other Fabaceae, including alfalfa, may also be present in common bean, and will likely map to a similar genomic position relative to other genes. The objective of our research is to take advantage of our extensive years of research and collection of field and molecular-based data and utilize it to connect to the genomic databases to enhance gene discovery and utilize this knowledge to develop improved snap bean cultivars with enhanced disease resistance, better adaptation to sustainable production and improved flavor and nutritional value.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1354,"The cereal, oilseed and meat industries are major components of Arkansas agriculture and the value-added food industry of the state. Maintaining the food quality and health value of these products is vital to the profitability of the industry.Although lipids are important components of plant and animal food products, they are potentially unstable and can give rise to off-flavors by oxidation to produce other substances that may compromise food quality. Lipid oxidation also has health consequences and oxidation of dietary lipids and cell membrane lipids play a role in the development of heart disease and cancer. Therefore an understanding of lipid changes in food on human bio-molecules would provide a scientific platform to propel the production of healthy lipid-based food products with significant economic and health benefits. However, lipids can also have important positive health effects and identifying and studying those lipids that will promote health is vitally important. We are continuing to study conversion of soy oil linoleic acid to Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) rich oil as a dietary means to combat obesity related disease and incorporating it into common foods acceptable to consumers.Production of new value added products, especially those addressing health and nutritional needs and new markets would promote food industry economic value. Improving the nutritional and nutraceutical value of food lipid and lipid based foods would be important in promoting the health of Arkansans.

1356,"Lack of diversity in crop rotations and intensive tillage practices (primarily before corn in rotation) impair both field crop productivity and soil quality. One of the goals of this project is to examine the effectiveness of alternate rotations, tillage systems and nutrient management to improve soil quality and crop yields while reducing the release of greenhouse gasses from the same fields. Overall sustainability of corn production in the Midwest can be enhanced via continuing refinements of management systems and by achieving better scientific understanding of the underlying reasons for the genotype by environment by management (G x E x M) interactions as the climate and the crop inputs or equipment change.Corn production systems are changing rapidly, and cropping systems research can help drive good decision making at the farm level. Corn producers in the Eastern Corn Belt are growing progressively higher plant populations of corn hybrids with transgenic-pest resistant or drought-tolerant traits. We have published a series of review papers that conclude that modern hybrids take up proportionately more N following the silk emergence stage (Ciampitti and Vyn, 2012, 2013, 2014a). The importance of post-flowering N uptake has brought with it a need to better understand the changing dynamics of corn nutrient uptake and how we can better match the timing of N or other nutrient applications to coincide better with plant uptake. Better utilization of the N fertilizers we apply should help improve the N recovery efficiency by corn and, simultaneously, reduce N losses to the environment. Integrated management systems can help corn stands achieve higher late-season functional photosynthesis as well as plant-to-plant uniformity, especially in drought or nutrient stress environments, and these will help to advance yield. Banded nutrient applications can also help prevent nutrient losses (like P) to the environment and may increase corn yields when the bands are optimally positioned relative to corn rows, and for those reasons it is essential to study advanced strip-till and nutrient placement systems using precision guidance.Overall environmental sustainability of corn production systems can be enhanced if soil erosion is prevented, if nutrient losses to ground/surface waters are minimized and if N application systems can be modified to minimize nitrous oxide emissions to the atmosphere. However, reaching the goal of improved sustainability involves much more than just a reduction in fertilizer rates. It involves the adoption of integrated technologies where research has considered the combined impacts of changing corn production systems (like more conservation tillage and higher corn populations), new products (like N fertilizer stabilizers and hybrids with potential gains in nutrient use efficiency) and new equipment for fertilizer application (e.g., precision guidance and high clearance N injection tools).If crop input costs were reduced via the adoption of strip tillage or other less intensive alternatives to conventional tillage systems before corn, the input cost savings could exceed $20 per acre. If that kind of savings could be realized even on half of the presently tilled fields before corn (i.e., other than the 25% now in no-till or strip- till), the cost savings to agriculture would exceed $45 million annually before any additional benefits to society (and these are much more difficult to quantify) include the benefits in more atmospheric carbon sequestered, less soil erosion loss, improved water quality and improved sustainability of food production in the long term.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1357,"Soybean consistently ranks as one of the top crops in Virginia both in acreage and value, but diseases continue to be one of the major constraints to soybean production in the region. Much progress has been made in development of soybean varieties with at least partial resistance or tolerance to target diseases, and many fungicide chemistries are available for management of fungal diseases. Total applications of fungicides have increased in soybean production over the past decade, but integrated approaches to management of diseases are needed to maximize soybean yields and grower profits and to increase food and feed production at regional and global levels while minimizing environmental impacts. Unnecessary fungicide applications reduce grower profits and place selection pressure for fungicide resistance on pathogen populations. The overall goal of this project is to develop disease advisories and management recommendations for soybean in Virginia. This will be acomplished through 1) development and validation of weather-based disease advisories with a combination of on-farm and small plot fungicide trials, 2) surveys of soybean diseases in Virginia and quantification of yield losses to these diseases, and 3) an assessment of fungicide resistance within fungal pathogen populations associated with soybean. Information on best management practice for reducing soybean crop losses to disease will be obtained through these studies and surveys, and results and recommendations will be disseminated to growers through extension activities including field days, crop production meetings, extension publications, and a web-based disease advisory system. Overall fungicide use is expected to decrease and soybean yields and grower profits are expected to increase as a result of this project.

1358,"Introduction - Housing. Alternative hen housing for egg production is a topic that continues to receive growing interest and attention among U.S. egg producers and those connected to or affected by the egg industry. This development mainly stems from the intention/demand for improving animal welfare, other aspects of production food safety/security, environmental impact, economic efficiency, and ergonomics of the caretakers must also be taken into consideration to ensure a sustainable future of egg supply and the industry. Alternative hen housing not only effects production performance (Karsten et al., 2010) but also skeletal health and bone breakage in hens.Hens maintained in alternative housing systems have a higher rate of keel fractures (Freire et al., 2003; Wilkins et al., 2004; Nicol et al., 2006). Keel fractures have been shown in experimental settings to relate to individual`s birds latency to transition between varying heights to access a food reward suggesting the fractures are a source of pain, particularly as the latency was diminished with administration of an analgesic (Nasr et al., 2012). Evidence was also found that birds with fractures had reduced egg production; however, the trials were conducted in small groups of birds (less than 20) (Nasr et al., 2013). The effect of pullet rearing and early nutrition programs on skeletal quality during egg laying has not been extensively studied.Feed ingredients. Energy and protein remain the most expensive components of feeding programs and most influence bird performance (growth and utilization) and economics. Concentrated energy sources are being diverted elsewhere and lower energy diets are being fed along with exogenous enzymes to maintain energy utilization. Utilization of byproducts such as corn-derived distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) and alternative grains and protein sources (Purdum and Noll, 2013 ) is becoming more common compared to the traditional corn-soy diet in the Midwest. DDGS has been successfully used in pullet (Masadeh, et.al. 2011) and layer diets (Masadeh, et al. 2012 ).Production of DDGS remains strong in the U.S. but recent processing developments have changed the composition of the product by removing the oil to levels less than 7% of the dried product leading to the question of an appropriate energy value for the product. Despite the reduction in fat content, fat content alone is not predictive of metabolizable energy. Volatility in the price of conventional feed ingredients such as corn and soybean meal for poultry feed and increased biofuel production has and will make different alternative feed sources available. Previous studies have shown that carbohydrases and phytase increased AME (Apparent Metabolizable Energy) and growth performance of the broiler diet with high DDGS (Adeola et al., 2010). It is critical to determine proper inclusions of these by-products into poultry diets and their efficacy when one or more exogenous enzymes are included in the diet.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

1360,"Most groups of higher plants accumulate crystalline calcium oxalate inside cell vacuoles (Zindler-Frank 1976). These include important crop plants such as soybean and other legumes (Ilarslan et al. 1997), tomato and other members of the Solanaceae (de Kreij et al. 1992), sugar beet (Mostafa and Ulrich 1976), grape (Webb et al. 1995), banana (Li et al, 2014) and many other fruits, vegetables, and horticultural crops. Calcium oxalate crystals in plants exhibit distinct patterns of morphology and distribution, indicating that plants control the sites and modes of calcium oxalate crystallization (reviewed in Webb 1999; Franceschi and Nakata 2005).Calcium oxalate provides several important functions in plants:Calcium oxalate crystallization removes excess calcium from active plant metabolism. Many plants respond to increases in external calcium supply by increased accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals (reviewed in Webb 1999; Franceschi and Nakata 2005). Thus calcium oxalate accumulation provides an essential mechanism for sequestering excess calcium in plants.Calcium oxalate crystals protect plants against animal herbivory (Salz and Ward 2000; Molano-Flores 2001; Korth et al. 2006). In some plants raphides are associated with toxic or acrid proteins (Perera et al. 1990), which confer a bitter taste and/or cause an inflammatory reaction when the plant is eaten (Bradbury and Nixon 1998). Raphides are particularly common in monocots, but also occur in dicots (www.mobot.org).Calcium oxalate in deciduous leaves favorably impacts retention and recycling of calcium in soils of forest ecosystems (Bailey et al. 2003). The oxalate component of calcium oxalate also provides a store for CO2, relevant to amelioration of climate change.Recent studies have revealed that calcium oxalate crystals and calcium carbonate cystoliths in some plants function to scatter light within leaves to promote photosynthesis (Gal et al. 2012).Calcium oxalate can also be harmful to humans and other animals that consume plants. High levels of oxalates in plant foods can be toxic, and in some house or garden plants poisonous substances are associated with calcium oxalate crystals. Calcium transport and partitioning contribute to disorders in fruits and vegetables, such as bitter pit, blossom end rot, and fruit softening, resulting in localized calcium deficiency, even in plants that contain large amounts of calcium oxalate (Mostafa and Ulrich 1976; Millaway and Wiersholm 1979). Some plants accumulate levels of calcium oxalate up to 80% of plant dry weight (Zindler-Frank 1976) or 80-90% of total calcium (Fink 1991). Research that clarifies factors mediating calcium oxalate pools and crystallization of calcium oxalate in cells will contribute to understanding harmful diseases or disorders caused by excessive calcium oxalate.Calcium bioavailability is reduced in foods containing calcium oxalate (Heaney et al 1988; McConn and Nakata 2004). Foods with high oxalate content contribute to elevated urinary oxalate and can lead to kidney disease (Holmes et al. 2001) and diets for patients with susceptibility to kidney stones recommend eliminating high-oxalate foods. Normal human urine contains a variety of proteins, some of which inhibit crystal growth (Ryall et al. 2000). Identification of additional inhibitors of calcium oxalate crystallization in plants could contribute to prevention and treatment for this serious disease.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
1361,"The need for the proposed project is due to a void existing at the intersection of organic poultry nutrition, research on environmental damage and agricultural sustainability. Several associated factors are (1) the critical need to find an organic source of methionine, an essential amino acid (protein building block) for poultry production, (2) the extraordinary consumer acceptance and call for more organic poultry products, (3) the extreme loss of nutritious by-products from harvesting, processing and distribution of horticultural byproducts, (4) the enormous need to reduce deposition of waste in landfills and contribute less to environmental damage, (5) continuing increased production of organic corn and soybean and (6) the ever present void of a comprehensive database coupled with an efficient technological process to formulate diets quickly and inexpensively. These factors are discussed below. Organic source of methionine. The national list for organic poultry feeds ingredients permits use of DL-Methionine, DL-Methionine-hydroxy analog, and DL-Methionine-hydroxy analog calcium (CAS #&#39;s 59-51-8, 583-91-5, 4857-44-7, and 922-50-9) at two pounds per ton for layers and broilers and three pounds per ton for turkeys. These synthetic products are allowed due to lack of a suitable organic methionine source. Beans also contain methionine. A combination of mostly organic cowpeas known as black-eyed peas (but actually a bean) and other beans (black, kidney, Great Northern) can be mixed with organic by-products (remaining after processing of fruits, grains, nuts, seeds and vegetables) and organic corn and soy to produce diets for broilers (meat-type birds), laying hens and turkeys. Many beans are high in anti-nutritive factors that may be difficult to digest by poultry. Therefore, we will use various procedures to remove anti-nutritional factors while maintaining most of the protein/methionine content. There is a continuing upward trend for consumption of organic poultry meat, eggs and their products in the U.S. Approximately 2.0% of the food supply and 1.0% of U.S. cropland is devoted to organic production of food. Some experts suggest that the organic food markets grew by 15 - 20% in previous years and upwards of 40% of U.S. consumers favor some organic food products. With 19% of national organic farms and 36% of all sales, CA, the leading agricultural state, also leads the nation in organic production of food. The state produces 14%, 47%, 58% and 14% of the organic berries, fruits, tree nuts and vegetables, respectively, for the US. CA is the second largest producers of organic chicken and laying hens and the first in production of organic turkeys.Poultry, found in many retail and conventional groceries, leads in the sale of organic meats. As the most popular organic meat, it is purchased by 73% of shoppers. Its domination of the meat market is due to a short production cycle, low price and mostly integrated production in comparison to beef or pork. Price, due to production costs, continues to outstrip demand; thus, organic poultry products remains out of reach for many in the US population. Use of organic horticultural by-products to replace part of the organic corn and soy could reduce the overall production cost. Moreover, in conjunction with beans, organic by-products can be used to improve the quality and efficiency of meat and eggs production. Many discarded by-products contain antioxidants that retard the deterioration of lipids (fats) and cholesterol in feed, post-mortem tissue and possibly in humans. For instance, &alpha;-tocopherol can be fed to broilers in diets containing tomato pomace, be stored in cell membranes of poultry muscle tissue during growth and remain in meat after processing to prevent lipid oxidation during storage, heating and freezing. Lycopene from tomato pomace can be stored in egg yolk Chlorogenic acid is an antioxidant in sweet potatoes while apples skins, another novel feed ingredient, contains more antioxidants than in the flesh of the fruit. Many  second rate  berries, larger fruits, broccoli stems/ leaves meal and nuts also contain valuable nutrients and antioxidants that could be stored in poultry meat and eggs and ultimately consumed by humans. Indeed, feeding nutrients such as antioxidants to broilers and layers, followed by tracking their deposition in meat and eggs, then monitoring their uptake in humans has received some attention by the medical profession; however, this area of research has not been sufficiently explored. Loss of nutritious by-products. Ranking third in production of fruits after China and India, the US is fourth in production of vegetables following China, India and Brazil. For US raw and processed fruits, vegetables and grains, about 23.4%, 25.4% and 32.0%, respectively, were wasted from production to consumption in 2010. While there is no separate data for loss of organic material, it is easy to realize that the loss of organic by-products will increase with demand for organic food.Reduction of depositions in landfills is a significant benefit from our research. When managing waste of any type, disposal in landfills is the seventh and last method listed after all others. Even with technical advances, post-harvest food loss remains a great concern in CA. Because CA leads the nation in the production of many fruits and vegetables, the lost in by-products is not manageable except for deposition in landfills. Increase in production of organic corn and soy. Corn and soy are major sources of protein for poultry. Feed costs for mostly corn and/or soy is 65 - 70% of the total financial input for production. With the demand for more organic poultry, use of these important crops can be extended if feed for organic poultry include organic beans and by-products. Need for extensive databases. Presently, researchers substitute one novel feedstuff for corn or soy for each investigation - a very slow process while the proof of concept for feeding by-products has been proven many times. Thus, an up-to-date database for by-products is under development in the PI&#39;s laboratory.

1362,"An in-depth knowledge of relationships between crop growth and development and environmental factors including projected changes in climate that includes extremes is a prerequisite to truly understanding crop production and to provide decision support system for stakeholders such as farm managers, governments, students, and planners to meet the food and fiber needs of the growing world population. An interdisciplinary, integrated approach involving state-of-the-art,controlled environment facilities for experimentation and algorithm development, and process-level crop models will be utilized to assist stakeholder needs in this area.Executive SummaryClimate change and variability, escalating costs of agricultural inputs, growing competition for land, water and energy, and feeding increasing population with greater purchasing power are challenges facing agriculture in the 21st century and beyond. As agricultural production and weather/climate are intimately connected, the future of agricultural production is critical to regional and national economies and to global food/fiber/energy security. In production agriculture, every season is unique, and when precipitation, temperature, and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation regimes combine with cultural practices, soils, and variety characteristics, crop production and policy managers have more variables to consider than the human mind can reasonably organize. Information needs to be organized within some sort of theoretical framework to assist resource and policy managers in decision making processes. With the availability of computers and a comprehensive knowledge of how crops respond to weather variables, decision support systems can be developed to assist in making production-management and policy decisions. Therefore, understanding crop responses to environment and management is pivotal in providing decision support for stakeholders such as farm managers, governments, and planners to meet the food and fiber needs of the growing world population.This project addresses our long-term goal of understanding the interactive effects of environmental factors on crops. Crops grown for food and fiber (cotton, corn, rice, and soybean) in the US Midsouth will be our main focus. Despite many experiments on the effects of environmental factors including the changes projected in climate on crops, there are still few studies that have addressed and quantified the effects of a range of environmental factors to develop meaningful functional relationships for various growth and developmental processes for plants grown under realistic field-like conditions.We will investigate the effects of temperature, drought, elevated atmospheric [CO2] and UV-B radiation, and other environmental variables on these crops to provide functional algorithms for improving existing crop models and/or developing new models. We will use an internationally unique system of sunlit chambers that allow the growth of tall crops under complete control of microclimate and atmosphere, with simultaneous precise monitoring of water and carbon balance throughout the life of the crop. The crop will be grown from sowing to specific growth stages under current and projected climatic conditions. Quantitative data on various growth and developmental processes will be measured, and functional algorithms will be developed for those processes. We intend to contribute our data to improve the performance of crop simulation models such as cotton and soybean (GOSSYM and GLYSIM) and corn (DSSAT or CEREES-Maize and soybean), and to assist in the integration of these crop models with regional climate models. The improved crop-climate assessment tools can be used to assist producers in day-to-day production decisions and policy makers in devising mitigation strategies to minimize the impact of climate change on food and fiber production in the coming decades.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1363,"The demand for agricultural crops is expected to more than double by 2050. This is due largely to an increase in world population, which is anticipated to grow from about 7 billion people today, to well over 9 billion in 2050, but also reflects increasing consumption of meat and dairy products, and the use of biomass in the production of biofuels. Meeting the goal of doubling crop production by 2050 is a major challenge. Indeed, between 1985 and 2005, crop yields per acre increased only about 20%. If this increase alone were to continue until 2050, we would fall well short of demand. Moreover, the increases in yields for the major crops that feed the world--maize, rice, wheat and soybeans--have stagnated in many regions including locations within the U.S. In addition, we are in a period of climate instability (climate change) with an uncertain future, and the potential of having major negative impacts on crop productivity. What is needed is a  Second Green Revolution  that includes what the Royal Society has referred to a  sustainable intensification of global agriculture.  This goal, which will necessitate higher yields with less input of water, will require the development of crops that are more resistant to abiotic and biotic stresses including drought, extremes in temperature, flooding, disease (bacterial, fungal, viral) and insect pests. Our primary research interest is to identify regulatory pathways that contribute to plant freezing tolerance and to use this information to improve the stress tolerance of plants. Our studies have focused on cold acclimation, the process whereby plants increase in freezing tolerance in response to low nonfreezing temperatures. With support from the USDA and other federal agencies, we developed Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter referred to as Arabidopsis) as a model plant to study cold acclimation and cold-regulated gene expression; discovered the CRT/DRE Binding Factor (CBF) regulatory pathway; established--along with many other labs--that the CBF pathway is highly conserved in plants; and have identified regulatory proteins that contribute to regulation of the CBF pathway in response to low temperature, the circadian clock, and photoperiod. In the current proposed research project, we will conduct multiple lines of investigation to identify molecular components of the low temperature  thermometer  that regulate expression of the CBF genes and will use natural genetic variation to identify novel pathways that contribute to cold acclimation.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1364,"The quantity and quality of forages is an important limitation to improved milk production in the tropics. In PR it has remained unaltered over the last 30 years, despite improvements in the genetic potential of cows. However, despite climate limitations there is the potential to produce high quality forages in the tropics. Research in PR has determined the high nutritive value and digestibility of the tropical legumes &#39;Henorico&#39; perennial peanut (HPP) and perennial soybean (Neonotonia wightii), and of the grass &#39;Maralfalfa&#39; (Pennisetum spp). The proposed research aims to evaluate the productivity of these three nutritive and highly digestible forages for their ability to produce higher milk production when fed to lactating dairy cows. Production of the forages will be recorded for HPP in experimental plots under subterranean drip irrigation and for Maralfalfa grass and perennial soybean under aereal irrigation. Milk production potential (quality of the forages) and dry matter intake will be evaluated in feeding trials with early lactation dairy cows. A second objective will be to evaluate short-hair Holsteins with the &#39;slick&#39; gene as to their potential for higher milk production under grazing management or under a confinement management where locally grown high quality forages will be fed. Major findings of the research will be disseminated to stakeholders through periodic field days and farmers and industry personnel visits to the project.

1365,"Row crop production in the Midsouthern U.S. (Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, and the Missouri Bootheel) is a multi-billion dollar industry and depends heavily upon irrigation. Irrigation capacity in this region, however, is in danger because of an increase in aquifer depths. Additionally, the quality of water from many wells is compromised and not suitable for irrigation due to high concentrations of salts that often contaminate wells as the aquifer depth increases. Effective management and genetic strategies are needed to improve crop performance with diminishing irrigation capacity and to improve the efficiency of irrigation use.Previous research has determined that relatively short-season soybean cultivars can have yields similar to full-season cultivars when planted early and grown in relatively narrow rows, but the short-season cultivars require 30 to 50% less irrigation than full-season cultivars. Research outlined in this proposal will evaluate resources (soil moisture, nutrients, solar radiation) that potentially limit yield for short-season and full-season soybean cultivars.While there are a few documented genetic differences in drought tolerance in soybean, these traits have not been fully utilized in developing adapted cultivars. One reason for this is that breeders have not known what traits to evaluate under drought conditions. Research from this project is focused on assessing traits that provide clear agronomic benefits under drought conditions. These traits include prolonged nitrogen fixation during drought, delayed canopy wilting and cool canopy temperatures, and stable isotope analysis for nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen. These tools allow relatively large numbers of genotypes to be evaluated, which is essential for any breeding strategy. Diverse soybean genotypes will be evaluated for these traits, and the appropriate germplasm will be identified for crossing with high-yielding cultivars.A second reason that drought tolerance in soybean has not been a priority for breeding efforts is that genotypes identified with drought tolerance are often unimproved accessions with poor agronomic characteristics. Recovering the beneficial drought-tolerance trait from an unimproved accession when crossed with a high-yielding cultivar has been, until recently, nearly impossible. New technology that uses molecular markers to identify segments of DNA associated with drought tolerance makes development of drought tolerant crops an achievable goal. This project will identify regions of DNA with molecular markers that confer drought tolerance traits. The molecular markers can be used to select and combine the drought tolerance regions into high-yielding genetic backgrounds.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1366,"Agricultural production needs to respond to the increasing global demand for food and dietary improvement. Crop price increases have led to farming expansion into marginal previously unprofitable areas and recent price fluctuations and climate volatility present further challenges to crop producers. In a February 2015 report to Governor Bentley entitled  Strategic Plan to Grow Alabama&#39;s Agriculture, Agribusiness, Forestry, and Forest Products Industries, 2015-2020 , the Alabama Department of Agriculture &amp; Industries and Alabama Cooperative Extension System identified priorities and strategic goals to respond to the increase in global food demand and economic opportunities in the state. Within the Industry Goals for Cotton, Peanuts, Soybean, Wheat, and Feed Grains, the stated objectives are:  increase wheat and soybean yields, quality, and production acreage [..], and increase the statewide average yield of agronomic crops . The report notes the need to reduce inter-annual output variability to improve profitability and attract food processing plants and the renewal of Alabama Irrigation Initiative.These objectives can be achieved in several ways. One way is to increase and stabilize yields by investing in new technologies including planting genetically engineered crop varieties, investment in irrigation, and using improved production practices. Another way is to improve yield and farm income stability is to use financial risk management tools such as crop insurance and/or forward contracting and futures and options stressed in the new Farm Bill.Consequently, I propose to analyze row crop farming profitability and efficiency under different technological and management practices in Alabama and the Southeast and identify tools and practices to achieve higher yields and farm income stability for the major crops currently available and adopted by producers. This research complements my participation in my primary Multi-State Research Project NC1179: Food, Feed, Fuel, and Fiber: Security under a Changing Climate and in my secondary collaborative group SCC-76: Economics and Management of Risk in Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources. This analysis is distinct from the analysis of field trial data in that it utilizes historical farm-level production and economic data which are more representative of the actual crop profitability. It also includes evaluation of crop insurance emphasized in the 2014 Farm Bill and the new agricultural support payments.The main data source for the proposed research is the Agricultural Recourse Management Survey (ARMS) that contains annual farm-level data which includes production, sales, cost information, farm characteristics, and weights that reflect the actual country- and statewide farming population. The PI, has published on and with current graduate students continues to study crop profitability and yield volatility in the Southeast and the Midwest and the links of yields and profits to climate volatility (Nadolnyak&amp; Vedenov 2013; Nadolnyak &amp;Quaye, 2015).The main methodology is regression analysis and simulations. Regression analysis will be used to estimate production and profit functions conditional on production practices and local weather and land characteristics. Simulation analysis uses these estimates to evaluate the relative productivity and efficiency of alternative production and risk management practices. Related policy analysis will be facilitated by the PI&#39;s experience from his current sabbatical in Brussels, Belgium, where he is learning about the European Union&#39;s environmental policy (changes) and consequent farmers&#39; choice of rick management tools. The PI is also working on a proposal on providing insurance in rural areas to be submitted to the ILO Impact Insurance .The results are expected to have direct policy implications that include, but are not limited to, promotion of irrigation and adoption of GE crop varieties, small farm support polices, and the use of insurance.

Influencing a host&#39;s gene silencing pathways as a strategy for pathogenicity is well documented for viral pathogens, but recently, it has become clear that silencing pathways also play an important role in other plant pathogen interactions. In this proposal we show that plant-parasitic nematodes are influencing host&#39;s gene silencing pathways as an important element of their pathogenicity. Using a battery of transcriptomic analyses and reporter gene studies in Arabidopsis, soybean and tobacco, we have determined that the RNA interference (RNAi) pathways in nematode-induced feeding sites are suppressed. This suppression of RNAi is specific to the nematode-induced feeding site and has been observed in both root-knot and cyst nematode infections. We demonstrate that plants expressing an inhibitor of RNAi are more successfully colonized by nematodes. Preliminary data on gene expression in the nematode has also identified numerous secreted effector proteins that may be involved in the suppression of RNAi in the host. The phenomenon of suppression of RNAi by plant pathogens appears to be an important theme in plant pathogen interactions but we know little about how wide-spread it is in the nematode phylum. We propose to further examine the breadth of nematode-induced suppression of RNAi across different species of plant-parasitic nematodes, determine if suppression of RNAi increases susceptibility in host plants and identify the nematode effector protein(s) that may regulate RNAi in the host.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
1368,"Plant-parasitic nematodes significantly reduce the yield and quality of a wide range of crops, world-wide. Although recently quantified descriptions of these losses are difficult to obtain, average yield losses to nematode parasitism in the world&#39;s major crops has been estimated to average 10-14% annually (Sasser and Freckman 1987). Annual crop losses in the US have been estimated to range from minimal for some commodities in some regions to an approximate maximum of 15% in others (Koenning et al, 1999).The research in this proposal addresses important agricultural crop management issues as identified by the REE Advisory Board. In the Report on Agriculture Research Needs of Commodity Crops, the REE Advisory Board states that sustainable, efficient production of these staples (including cotton, soybean, and peanut) is critical to the US food supply and economy, and that  productive efficiency  must be a top priority in order to meet the demands of a growing population in the US and the world. They further list as top priorities, nematode resistance in cotton and improved varieties and disease resistance in peanut. Many farmers have relied on fumigant and non-fumigant pesticides to control plant-parasitic nematodes, but most of the non-fumigant nematicides are no longer available, and application of most soil fumigants now involves significant additional application restrictions and requirements. If the research in this proposal is not conducted, growers will experience greater production costs and yield losses. Nematode-resistant crops can lower production costs by reducing nematicide applications, while at the same time improve yield. Reduction in nematicide use will also reduce risks of environmental contamination and potential adverse effects on public health.Host resistance to nematodes and other plant pests and pathogens is often cited as the preferred method of pest management (Cook and Starr, 2006), but some parasitic nematodes are able to adapt quickly to resistant cultivars and overcome the resistance (Vuong et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013), and incorporating nematode resistance into superior genetic backgrounds for yield and quality attributes can be difficult (Starr et al., 2002). Nematode-resistant germplasm has been deployed in various crop plants (Concibido et al., 2004; Brucker et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2011; Starr et al., 2002), but with the narrow genetic basis for this resistance, new sources of host resistance are urgently needed. Nematode resistance is also almost always limited to a single nematode species, and is even sometimes limited to one or more specific  host races . Crop production in the South frequently involves fields infested with multiple economically important plant-parasitic nematode biotypes that can adapt to nematode management practices, including crop rotations and host resistance (Starr et al., 2002).For these reasons, resistance should be integrated into nematode management systems that include other control tactics in order to successfully manage the entire community of plant parasitic nematodes in commercial fields. These other tactics could include cropping systems (crop rotation and/or use of cover crops) and nematode management agents (NMA), which can include synthetic pesticides as well as biocontrol agents. Crop rotation, cover crops and soil amendments have been increasingly studied for their ability to suppress nematode population densities (Lu, et al., 2005), and considerable research is also being conducted on biofumigation and other methods to produce compounds that reduce preplant nematode populations (Zasada et al, 2010). Compounds applied to control other soilborne pathogens have been found, more recently, to also possess significant and useful nematicidal activity (Faske and Hurd, 2014). There have also been significant advances in the detection, identification, and use of biological agents that suppress nematodes (Timper, 2011). However, there has been very little research on integrating these other practices, particularly cultural and biological practices, with host-plant resistance. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the combined use of host resistance with cover crops, commercially available biological control agents, and other new NMAs, to control plant-parasitic nematodes.Through this proposed regional project, there will be on-going scientist to scientist integration of research and outreach to accelerate progress. There are common crops that are vulnerable across states with programs that are locally specific; by sharing information on a timely basis what is learned at one location can have a significant effect on programs in other locations.

Furthermore, pathogens can also adapt to chemical means of control. Adequate management of resistance and chemical controls thus is a function of the pathogen population structure. Genomic technology allows for efficient tracking of pathogen populations that in turn should be able to inform farmers and seed companies so that adequate varieties can be planted each season. Our hypothesis is that different strains of pathogens of field crops contain distinct repertoires of pathogenesis proteins that result in advantageous interaction under the appropriate conditions. We plan to survey diverse varieties of corn, soybean and wheat for the presence of major pathogen strains. Then we will extract RNA and identify pathogenesis proteins.

1374,"Enhanced adaptation and mitigation of weeds is a growing threat to agriculture. Weeds, such as junglerice, have readily acquired resistance alleles and genetic mechanisms allowing them to sustain herbicide application, compete with the crop, and even mimic the crop. More interestingly, their abiotic stress response systems (drought tolerance, submergence, heat/temperature tolerance, etc.,) are often elite in comparison, because of longer periods of selection in the local environments. These genes, pathways, and expression networks and how these intersect are currently profound gaps in our understanding of how adaptive genetics of weed species intersects with environment and management practices. Improving crop production systems by tailoring the genetics of breeding germplasms for specific environments and studying the crop AND the surrounding weeds, is a sustainable solution to meet the growing challenges of agriculture and global sustainability.Because chemicals are highly effective in managing weeds, it has become the most popular option of weed control. However, with constant usage of herbicides in row crops, vegetable, and turf industry, very often these labeled herbicides cause significant injury on the crop itself, resulting in major yield loss. One of the good examples is tomato (Lypersicon esculentum), which is grown on over 444 acres across 627 farms in Mississippi (USDA, 2012), and although the crop is primarily grown in a plasticulture system (Pan et al., 1999), weeds are still a major problem in tomato production. Major weeds in tomato are yellow nutsedge, purple nutsedge, large crabgrass, and Palmer amaranth (Webster 2002). Among these weeds, yellow and purple nutsedge are the most problematic, causing significant yield losses and decreased fruit quality. Herbicide options in tomato are limited, and only a few are highly effective on nutsedge. These few herbicides that are labeled in tomato, show significant injury on the crop. Moreover, injury from herbicides drifted to greenhouse tomatoes leads to deformed fruits and yield reduction. Therefore, developing crops having tolerance to already labeled herbicides, and to herbicides that can potentially be drifted will improve quality and yield of the crop, and at the same time provide effective weed control.Row crops most commonly grown in Mississippi are cotton, soybean, corn, rice; while some commonly grown vegetables are tomato, sweet potato, and cucumber (USDA, 2012). In all of these crops, weed management has always been a major challenge to the growers. And with the introduction of herbicide-resistant crops technology, weeds are continuously exposed to selection pressure that results in weeds adapting to herbicide stress. Moreover, with the changing cropping systems that came along with the herbicide resistant technology, weeds have also found a way to adapt to the changes, thus rendering the herbicide-resistance technology ineffective. A survey conducted to determine how weed complexes have changed over time with change in management practices, showed that most of the weeds have evolved growth requirements and herbicide tolerances similar to the crop they infest (Loux and Berry 1991; McWhorter 1993). It would therefore be interesting to study how long the weeds take to evolve resistance to a particular herbicide. This will allow us to predict the time it takes herbicide-resistance technology to become ineffective since its commercialization. The objectives of the proposal will be to (1) develop a rapid assay to detect herbicide resistant weeds populations (non-destructive), identify mechanism of resistance, characterize competitive traits, biotic and biotic stress tolerance in weeds; (2) study the evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds; (3) develop herbicide tolerant crops.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The specific objectives are to 1) understand how excess consumption of vegetable oils high in linoleic acid contributes to brain disorders, and 2) develop sustainable ways of generating low linoleic acid oils. The expected outcome is a clarification on the detrimental effects of excess linoleic acid intake on brain disorders, and the development of sustainably made low linoleic acid oils, as a means to reduce overall population exposure to excess linoleic acid through vegetable oils.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1376,"Wheat is one of the world&#39;s most important crops, providing a significant portion of the foodcalories that humans directly consume in both developed and developing countries. It also is one of the world&#39;s most versatile crop plants, growing in a wide range of climatic regions and producing more types of food than any other grain crop.Threats to wheat production come from an array of phylogenetically diverse organisms, including plant pathogens, nematodes, mites, and insects. Relative to other major crops like corn, Zea mays L., and soybeans Glycine max (L.) Merr., wheat is unusual in that biotic stress is managed to a larger extent by deploying cultivars that are protected by Resistance genes. Resistance gene-protected wheat cultivars are expected to play an even bigger role in the future, when plant breeders reap the benefits of decades-long progress in molecular biology and genomics.One thing that is lackingis an understanding of how crop species integrate the diverse defense responses they require to survive attack by their many parasites. Every crop species is attacked by a large set of phylogenetically diverse parasites, which differ in how and when they attack, what they take from the plant, and their evolutionary potential for adaptation. As we learn more and more about the sensory and signaling abilities of plants, it only gets harder to understand how plants make sense of all of this information about their parasites and decide what to do. One plant for which we are beginning to understand integrated responses to biotic stress is the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., which has, by far, the best molecular research tools.If we are to feed the 9.6 billion people expected to inhabit the Earth in 2050, research efforts similar to that now occurring for Arabidopsis must begin for major crop species, especially those crops that are not being protected from biotic stress by traits that are genetically modified. In a recently published review in the Journal of Experimental Botany (Harris et al. 2015), we made the argument that wheat is a strong candidate for such a research initiative. Briefly, the argument was that wheat 1) is critical for feeding the world&#39;s current and future populations, 2) is not currently grown as a genetically modified organism and therefore still relies on non-GM traits for protection against biotic stress, 3) has a foundation of knowledge about its immune system, including 479 Resistance (R) genes, and 4) R gene-mediated defense protects against a range of phylogenetically diverse and economically important parasites, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, insects, and mites. Our review papersignaled the launch of a research initiative to understand how wheat integrates its immune responses to biotic stress, beginning with a focus on R gene-mediated defense. Research will focus on two economically important groups of plant parasites:insects and fungal pathogens. The Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say)is a good choicebecause it shares many features with plant pathogens, in particular fungal pathogens.On the plant pathogen side, we chose fungal pathogens because of: 1) their economic importance, 2) extensive local scientific expertise, both at North Dakota State University and the Cereal Research Unit at ARS-USDA, and 3) readily available tools, including near-isogenic lines with resistance to Puccinia triticina Erikss.

1377,"This project primarily serves growers of specialty crops and processors. Specialty crops are those that are grown in small acreage relative to major crops (apples, canola, corn, cotton, grain sorghum, grapes, rice, oranges, soybean, sunflower, turf, peanuts, potatoes, sugarcane, tomato, tobacco, and wheat). Specialty crops encompass minor use fruits, herbs and spices, tree nuts, ornamentals, and minor use vegetables. Because of their small acreage, and the large expense in registering pesticides, there is hardly no economic incentive for biological or chemical pesticide companies to develop the necessary database required for registration of their products on specialty crops. The need for pesticide registration in specialty crops and minor uses led to the formation of what used to be called the Interregional Project #4, or the IR-4 Project. Today, the Specialty Crops and Minor Use Program has expanded to also include pesticides needed to protect public health such as control of mosquitoes and ticks. Including all secondary impacts, the IR-4 Project is anticipated to support research and industry sales to support 104,650 U.S. jobs and increases annual gross domestic product by $7.3 billion (Miller and Leschewski 2012).The IR-4 project facilitates the examination of pesticide ingredients, crops and locations where pesticides will be used, the manner of use, and potential impact on consumers and nontarget organisms. The project helps ensure that any pesticide registered for specialty crops fall below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) allowed by EPA for food and feed. Recently, the IR-4 Project has provided about 50% of field and residue data for EPA&#39;s annual work plan and new clearances. About 70 - 80% of IR-4 Project&#39;s effort supports the registration of reduced-risk pesticides, thereby reducing the risk to human and environmental health relative to existing, or recently de-registered products (Viray and Hollingworth 2009; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2001a). Reduced risk pesticides are applied at lower rates than the older compounds; thus, volume of chemicals uses in fruit and vegetable production.The IR-4 Project has three programs: 1) Food, 2) Ornamental Horticulture, and 3) Biopesticides and Organic Support. Minor-use food crops (vegetables, melons, fruits, and tree nuts) comprise about 25% of total agricultural food crop production, worth about $33 billion annually.

1378,"The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an important crop in several regions of the United States. Demand for dry and snap beans is expected to remain strong or increase as consumers search for healthy alternatives in their diet and there are greater numbers of citizens in the U.S. with a culinary tradition of consuming beans. In order to compete with other commodities such as soybeans and maize, dry bean seed yields need to continue to increase. More efficient use of inputs such as water and nitrogen is needed to reduce production costs and to preserve scarce resources. Numerous abiotic and biotic stresses can threaten both dry and snap bean production. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases are among the main production constraints, whereas drought, heat, soil mineral deficiencies, and short growing seasons reduce productivity and contribute to a yield-gap between on-farm and potential seed yield in many production areas. A multi-state collaborative research project for common bean is needed because many constraints are shared among bean production regions in the U.S. Collaborative research promotes efficiency, accelerates genetic progress, avoids duplication of work and conserves economic and physical resources. Collaborators are more likely to share information that can have broad impact. Communication during the formative stages of research allows for emerging information and shared experience to improve study design. New cultivars can be selected to have wider adaptation and more durable resistance to pathogen variability and environmental fluctuations that occur year to year.

1380,"The rationale of this project is based on the fact that since the 2012 spring drought, many farmers in Kentucky and the southeastern U.S. have invested in irrigation systems for producing corn, soybean and wheat in order to overcome crop water stress during short or extended periods of drought. The know-how of irrigation management, i.e., when to turn an irrigation system on and how much water to apply is so far mostly based on experience, and less on actual measurements. Moreover, in our region of interest, soils are known for their pronounced spatial variability. This fact implies, that the amount of irrigation water that may be appropriate in one spot may be completely wrong and insufficient in another spot. In other words, the right amount of water in one zone of the field may cause air-deficiency and therefore yield decrease in another more clayey zone in the field, or even loss of water through rapid deep drainage and leaching of plant nutrients. Each one of these negative consequences cause damage, either economically for the farmer or environmentally or both.Modern technology in irrigation allows site-specific irrigation through GPS-based pivots, and GIS-based soil survey and soil water monitoring. In our region, it is essential to apply irrigation water site-specifically in order to minimize environmental damage and maximize profitability of irrigation.Observations of different soil and crop properties across the field will be taken according to state-of-the-art geospatial and temporal monitoring. One of the benefits of this approach is the fact that it is different from classical agricultural experimentation, but focused on diagnosing spatial and temporal processes, in order to convert research results directly into management decision support.The ultimate goal is effectively surveying soil and biomass production processes and their variability at the field scale in order to incorporate this knowledge in prediction and management.

1381,"Ohio producers have planted 3.7 million acres of corn and 4.7 million acres of soybeans annually over the last five years, accounting for over 80% of the total acreage farmed each year (USDA-NASS, 2015) indicating their importance to Ohio agricultural production. Improving the tolerance of these crops to environmental stress (i.e., drought, flooding, extreme temperature) is paramount to ensuring the competitive ability of producers to compete in production markets nationally and internationally. Current crop yield losses due to abiotic stress are estimated to range from 40 to 65% of the maximum potential yield (Bray et al., 2000), and may become more severe with improved genetic yield potential and more frequent incidence of environmental stress (Morton et al., 2015). Therefore, there is a critical need to determine key management practices that can improve cropping system resiliency to increased environmental variability. Multiple field and greenhouse experiments are planned to be conducted to evaluate how management practices, such as variety selection and crop input use, can influence crop resiliency to environmental stress. Factors to be evaluated may include biomass production, yield potential, grain yield and quality as appropriate based on the specific objective of the experiment. Stresses evaluated may include (but are not limited to) drought, cold, flood, and heat.

1383,"Producers in the Mississippi Delta are continually confronted with management decisions that affect the profitability and sustainability of their commercial farming operations. Declining profit margins as result of continued increases in the cost of agricultural inputs (especially seed, fertilizer, and pesticides) make it important to optimize production with the least input. In just the last decade, escalating land prices and land rents have tightened the margins even more. Of the many agricultural inputs required, sound fertilizer practices offer the largest profit potential for producers. Environmental stewardship and sustainability are often mentioned with nutrients and nutrient management. When nutrients are not taken up by the target plants and leave the field, the result could be excess nutrients in water supplies and the dangers associated with that. Producers are generally the most concerned environmentalist since they live of the land and make their living from the land they farm. Cost-conscious producers are continually seeking ways to decrease total production costs without sacrificing productivity, yet remaining competitive in the marketplace. New technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Variable Rate Technology (VRT), and genetically modified organisms (GMO&#39;s) have become common occurrences in the vocabulary of today&#39;s producer. The once science fiction concept of tractors and combines driving themselves is no longer science fiction but is readily available on today&#39;s equipment. The next step of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV&#39;s) and their use in agriculture is developing rapidly.The International Plant Nutrition Institute&#39;s (IPNI) 4-R Nutrient Stewardship program is the basis for renewed interest in nutrient management. Proper fertilizer rates applied at the right time in the rate place utilizing the right source offers producers the solution for optimum yields with the least impact on the environment. Soil testing is the tool that producers can use to optimize fertilizer needs but is also essential in the assessment of nutrient levels. Rotations and modified cropping sequences have been common since the earliest records of crop production and continue to gain importance in today&#39;s economy. The nation&#39;s concern for clean air and water make it imperative that every effort be made to reduce non-point source pollution by decreasing run-off from agricultural lands. With the unprecedented increase in fuel cost in the last decade and the continuing shift to more non-petroleum based fuels, corn and soybean production remains at all-time highs. Corn acreage was 89 million acres (36 million hectares); soybean, 85 million acres (34 million hectares); and cotton continues to decline to 9 million acres (3.6 million hectares) in the US in 2015.This research project will be oriented toward examining and defining Best Management Practices (BMP&#39;s) for cotton, corn, and soybean involving N, P, K, and S fertilizer utilization. These crops are being grown in rotations while twin-row planting patterns have become common for corn and soybean across the Midsouth. Major equipment companies have invested in twin-row production planters across the region and continue to make improvements. Auto-guidance for equipment is now common and has aided in the shift to larger equipment and twin-row systems. Crop yields continue to increase, leading to increased nutrient removal and an even greater need for fertilizer applications. As the bio-fuels industry continues to develop, plant residues are viewed as a potential source of cellulosic feed stocks. As residues are removed, additional nutrients are also removed lending to a further reduction in plant-available nutrients in soil and a potential decrease in soil carbon (organic matter).The adoption of new technology including GPS, GIS and yield monitors make it possible to evaluate spatial variability in crops and the mechanisms to assess yield variability as it is related to soil characteristics. However, often the variability is associated with multiple factors that cannot be separated. The crop mix for today&#39;s landscape in the Mississippi Delta has changed greatly in the past decade with grain bins replacing cotton gins and hopper bottom grain trucks replacing module haulers. The Delta producer is shifting with technology and demand.To address the growing issues of the time, multi-year field studies will be established or continued on the Delta Research and Extension Center or in producer fields or both. These studies will be characterized by the treatments involved and on specific soils that are identified through Web Soil Survey. Multiple years will be used in order to account for environmental conditions that vary from year to year. These studies will also be replicated in the field four to six times in order to assess infield variability. Cultural practices will be maintained uniformly across the study unless it is a component of the treatments. The studies will follow established protocols that will be established before the study is initiated. For harvest, the center two rows will usually be harvested with grab samples taken at the time of harvest to determine harvest moisture, bushel test weight, and seed index for grain crops. A grab sample will also be collected at cotton harvest to determine lint percent by ginning the collected sample through a 10-saw micro-gin. The collected data will be summarized and treatment differences determined with appropriate statistical procedures. In many cases, the economic impact of a treatment or practice will also be determined since sometimes a practice may increase yield but the yield increase does not offset the cost of the practice.The overall purpose for the research proposal is to gain information and knowledge through sound research techniques that can be used by producers to increase their profitability while sustaining the land and the environment.

1384,"Plant pathogens are a primary factor limiting agricultural production and food security (Boyd, et al. 2013). In the U.S. alone, annual crop losses due to pathogen infection and disease are estimated at &gt;$60B (Pinstrup-Andersen 2001). In Michigan, field crops including soybean, corn, seed corn, wheat, and dry bean are planted on a total of 5.6 million acres and represent a value of $2.7 billion dollars. Some recent examples of disease impacts on Michigan field crops include the soybean white mold epidemic of 2014 which significantly impacted production, with an estimated 8% of the crop destroyed, representing $50 million dollars of lost revenue, not including the cost of preventative measures; Goss&#39;s wilt of corn - Michigan produces 20% of the world corn seed supply, the recent movement of the bacterial disease Goss&#39;s wilt into the area has already impacted production as positive seed lots cannot be exported out of the country. If the disease continues to gain a foot hold the impact will increase substantially; Head scab of wheat - Michigan produces a significant quantity of soft white winter wheat used in baked goods which has a 50% lower tolerance to mycotoxins (1 ppm) than other market classes. Fusarium head scab is an annual threat to wheat production, not only in terms of yield loss, but also quality, and in particular the production of mycotoxins. Managing head scab and mycotoxin levels is of the utmost importance to Michigan wheat producers, to avoid rejection of crops or severe dockages; Dry bean diseases - Michigan is second in dry bean production in the U.S. but is impacted annually by root rots and white mold, with an estimated combined annual cost to growers of $4.5 million (Cramer 2015). In order to minimize losses to disease it is essential to identify and characterize the causal agents and populations, identify key drivers of disease, and understand interaction with the host and the environment. The research proposed in this project is aimed at developing short and long-term solutions for field crop disease management. Traditional and cutting edge techniques will be utilized to address questions to ultimately improve disease management. This research aligns with the AgBioResearch mission by improving food, energy and natural resource security and sustainability which will benefit growers and the community in Michigan, across the U.S. and the globe.

1387,"Michigan field crop rotations, the Midwest corn belt and related row crop systems around the globe are reliant on substantial inputs to optimize productivity. The requirement for frequent and high doses of soluble nutrients is most apparent in crops grown on Alfisols and other coarse soils that inherently have low to moderate organic matter levels and limited nutrient supply capacity. Concerns are growing regarding the production costs associated with high input row cropping, and the environmental costs that put water and air quality at risk. Reliance on application of inorganic fertilizers as the primary source of fertility has long-term environmental consequences. Loading agricultural systems with reactive nitrogen and soluble phosphorus (P) has been shown to play a role in groundwater contamination, hypoxia related issues and, potentially, global climate change (McIsaac et al., 2002). Discussions with farmers and community members around Michigan have highlighted the need for scientifically-based information on practical systems and management practices that can enhance nutrient efficiency, thus reducing fertilizer requirements while maintaining economically viable levels of production.Soil quality is another challenge facing field crop producers in Michigan that is closely related to managing nutrients in a sustainable manner. Soybean growers for example have prioritized research on cover crops, tillage and management practices that enhance soil quality, stand establishment and soil productivity, as shown by GREEEN industry priorities. This is in keeping with the national United Soybean Board interests as well (http://unitedsoybean.org/article/soybean-farmers-attest-to-cover-crop-benefits/). Farmers are looking to optimize returns to inputs and build yield potential over time, which requires improved understanding of processes that enhance soil organic matter, aggregation, and nutrient efficiency. Sustainable soil management is a central focus of long-term research experimentation underway at the MSU Kellogg Biological Station. Findings include the importance of winter cover as a means to enhance soil biology, and build soil carbon as well as nutrient availability. Enhanced cropping system nutrient efficiency can be achieved through biological nitrogen fixation, and access to sparingly soluble phosphorus pools (Gallaher and Snapp, 2013). Further, the incorporation of cover crop residues is a practice that can temporarily immobilize and reduce nutrient losses, but only if sufficient synchrony of nutrient supply and crop demand is maintained (McSwiney et al., 2010; Pang and Letey, 2000; Snapp and Borden, 2005). The complexity of integrating cover crops in real world farming includes field topographical variability, crop rotation complexity, as well as different types of tillage and timing of field operations in a variable climate (Munoz, et al., 2014; Senthilkumar et al., 2009). Developing practical winter-hardy cover crops and dual usage crops such as forage crops (i.e., alfalfa, rye, ryegrass and intermediate wheatgrass) managed as cover crops is of increasing interest to farmers in recent years, with important implications for economically viable cover crop utilization (Snapp et al., 2005). Zonal tillage management such as strip tillage and ridge tillage are of emerging interest as well, facilitating the incorporation of cover crops into field crop production by developing zones where seedlings thrive from other zones where nutrient immobilization and potential disease issues may arise, related to residue decomposition timing (Williams et al., in press).The beneficiaries of this project include the farmers, rural communities and consumers in Michigan, and the Great Lakes region. Improved understanding of the biological and chemical principles involved in integrated soil management will lead to recommendations that apply not just to this region, but to producers on coarse soils everywhere. Access to information on cover crop performance will help farmers enhance soil organic matter, grow healthier crops and optimize resource conservation for lower cost farming. Ensuring effective stand establishment for vigorous, high yielding crops is a particularly important goal to producers. Environmental benefits will accrue through improving efficiency of nitrogen use, enhanced infiltration and storage of water. Improved soil quality as well as reduced reliance on fossil fuels for food production is an important outcome from this project over the long run.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1388,"Drought is one of the most common environmental stresses which reduce crop yield and product quality, costing billions of dollars of economic losses to agronomic and horticultural crop producers. Such great loss can be exemplified by the heat and drought stress in 2007 in TN, which caused 50-70% soybean yield loss, and the current century drought in California, which has caused fighting of water use for agriculture or for urban use. Even a short, mild drought during the critical pot-filling or fruit-setting or expansion stages may reduce yield by 10-20%. Many public universities and private seed and biotech companies have invested billions of dollars to breed stress tolerant crop varieties and identify stress tolerance genes. A limited number of genetically engineered crops, however, have been developed or under field tests for commercial release. Therefore, it would be highly desirable and challenging to understand the drought tolerance in crop plants or other specialty plants that may utilize water much more efficiently, such as plants with crassulacean acid metabolism. Understanding the water use efficiency can help to design new crops through synthetic biology approaches.There are several kinds of bioenergy crops, cellulosic crops, like herbaceous switchgrass, woody, short-rotation plants like poplar and willow, and biodiesel crop like soybean (Summerville et al., 2010). These crops are not only important as potential bioenergy crops, but also they are regular oil crop, like soybean, forestry tree like poplar. Switchgrass is also very important forage and ecologically important prairie grass species. One of the primary requirement of growing biomass crops is not to compete for food production, therefore being able to grow in marginal lands where water is always scare, is one of the major prerequisites (Ye et al., 2011). In this Hatch project, we will focus on developing drought tolerant two types of bioenergy crops, biodiesel crop soybean, woody plant, Populus, and understanding the mechanisms of the high water use efficiency in CAM plant (Borland et al., 2009).",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
1389,"Extreme weather, high salinity and plant diseases are major limiting factors for plant growth and crop productivity. If crops can be reconditioned by beneficial microbes to better cope with stress, agricultural production can be increased significantly. Plant pathogenic fungi cause considerable yield loss annually. Viruses infecting fungi, i.e. mycoviruses, have great potential in controlling soil-borne plant pathogenic fungi, and may play important roles in increasing adaptation to abiotic stresses, and regulating soil nutrient cycling. It is reported that mycoviruses were found not only in fungi, but also in plant, animal, and environmental samples, including soil. Four broad research goals will be pursued.Address questions about the roles of viromes in the interactions with fungi directly and indirectly associated with crop plants. Previously, using the infectious clone of a mycovirus,SsHV2L, to probe Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, datashowed that S. sclerotiorum has robust RNA silencing pathways.Therefore, it is now possible to develop a virus-induced gene silencing system to target an important functional gene related to fungal pathogenicity. Targets of interest are the loci controlling anastomosis between different mycelial compatibility groups, because this is one of the two strategies besides RNA silencing for the fungus to prevent spreading of the virus. Further, corresponding degradome analyses confirmedseveral microRNA candidates, a fraction of which expressed differentially between the healthy and infected isolate. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum microRNAs affected by mycovirus infection that we predicted could also have plant targets, resulting in a shift in plant immune responses. Therefore, selected miRNA encoding genes will be deleted by a CRISPR/Cas9 system for filamentous fungi. Immunoprecipitation of Arabidopsis AGOs from S. sclerotiorum (w/ and w/o SsHV2L viral infection)-infected Arabidopsis will be sequenced to determine the effect of viral infection on plant immunity. Further, changes in chromatin marks associated with changes in small RNA accumulations will be tested to confirm that RNA-silencing of viral infection involved in reorganization of genome-nuclear lamina that would explain the observed positionally-dependent responses. Besides pathogenic fungi,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play an important role in carbon and nitrogen cycling, and they have been shown to be infected by viruses. Yet, the effect of virus infection on AMF&#39;s role in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate cycling is unknown. We recently screened soybean leaf-associated viromes and identified at least 23 nearly full length mycoviral genomes. Using the same approach, I propose to screen root-associated viromes aiming to establish a plant-mycorrhizal fungi-virus system for mechanistic study and for manipulation of soil processes. Differences in phosphate and nitrogen uptake of AMF were observed even within the same species, suggesting that there could be viruses hosted by AMF that affect their functions. I propose to screen AMF isolates and complete selected genome sequences performing rapid amplification of cDNA ends for constructing infectious clones.Develop gemycircularviruses as biopesticides for fungal pathogens. Mycoviruses hold great potential in controlling plant pathogenic fungi. The goal of this project is to develop methods to efficiently deliver debilitating mycoviruses in the field. The objectives include: 1) evaluating the feasibility of expressing in transgenic plants a proven mycovirus biopesticide, and another related but uncharacterized mycovirus triggered by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infection; 2) comparing in vitro expression systems for production of self-assembled virions as biopesticides; 3) optimizing the conditions for scale-up of the production of the biopesticides. Proposed mycovirus candidates include a recently discovered ssDNA mycovirus, named as soybean leaf-associated gemycircularvirus 1 (SlaGemV1; KT598248) and a demonstrated field-effective biopesticide, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum hypovirulence associated DNA virus 1 (SsHADV1; NC_03116, KM598382~4). SlaGemV1 was recently discovered via a metatranscriptomic search of soybean leaves infected by fugal pathogens in Southern Illinois that is 55% identical to SsHADV1 in the amino acid sequence of the replicase. SsHADV1 has been shown to be effective either as a suspension of virus-infected hyphal fragments or purified virus particles applied directly on fungal hyphal mats or on plant leaves. To attain the proposed objectives, steps taken will include: 1) confirming the bioactivity of the clones by transfecting S. sclerotiorum with infectious clones of SlaGemV1 and SsHADV1; 2) transform Arabidopsis thaliana with constructs derived from the infectious clones to express both of the ssDNA viruses; 3) express and assemble the mycoviruses in Agrobacterium and yeast based-system.Address fundamental questions of rhizospheric soil and plant microbiomes associated with disease suppressive soil. An understanding of rhizospheric soil microbiomes and AMF&#39;s priming effect on soil organic matter decomposition could lead to novel strategies for forming an adaptive and mitigating approach in response to climate change. Currently, there are few labs that combine a mass balance approach and metagenomic/metatranscriptomic approaches to determine the microbes responsible for specific soil processes. Modulating of the soil processes under the preset knowledge about the key microbial players or functions helps increase predictability of the outcome.During my graduate studies I examined how disease suppression of soil differs when subjected to field treatments. One observation that I and other plant pathologists have made is that yield response does not always correlate to disease suppression. I discovered that manure amendments in pasture plots for organic transition increased the yield in spite of promoting a minor disease. I further determined that microbial community composition, assessed by ARISA, and pseudomonads from bulk soil do not correlate with yield response, suggesting that rhizospheric soil is where all the activities happen. As my continuing interest is in disease suppressive soil, I am supervising my former advisor&#39;s graduate student in investigating the effect of tillage and cover crops on 16S bacterial and archaeal populations from rhizospheric soil and root endophytes in their phylogenetic and functional composition, specifically related to nitrogen cycling. Primers being used besides targeting 16S, also include fungal ITS, ammonia monooxygenase for bacteria and archaeal nitrous oxide reductases, and ammonia generating nitrite reductase functional genes. I am curious whether rhizospheric microbes in any of these categories respond to tillage and cover crop treatments resulting in disease suppression and yield. The first year of results showed a significant tillage effect on 16S bacterial population with Verrucomicrobia increased for chisel plowed plots and Cyanobacteria in ridge tilled plots where sudden death syndrome (SDS) of soybeans is suppressed. Cyanobacteria are known for nitrogen fixation, and it would be interesting to determine their direct contribution to disease suppression in SDS and the association with nitrogen cycling. I propose to expand such investigation with data from precision agriculture in SD to help determine the factors contributing to suppressive soil. Greenhouse trials growing different cover crops using the same field soils to find out the differences in general disease suppression and microbial community composition. Two undergraduate students at SDSU supervised by me will be analyzing the data for ITS and nitrogen-cycling genes, respectively. Further collaboration will be established for looking into the effect of soil fertility on plant diseases.?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1390,"Plant-parasitic nematodes engage in a wide variety of sophisticated biotrophic interactions with their hosts through the formation of specialized feeding structures (Kyndt et al., 2013). Syncytia and giant cells are the feeding sites formed by cyst and root-knot nematodes, respectively, and initiation and formation of these feeding sites are associated with dramatic gene expression changes. A key feature of plant parasitism by cyst and root-knot nematodes is the injection of effector proteins into host root cells through their stylets. Stylet secretions are produced in nematode esophageal gland cells, and manipulate a wide range of cellular processes to mediate the transition of normal root cells into specialized feeding sites. Our knowledge of these nematode effector repertoires is expanding due to recent technical advances in sequencing and isolating mRNA obtained specifically from whole esophageal gland cells (Maier et al., 2013). Although the exact functional roles of most nematode effectors remain elusive, recent research has revealed some of their fundamental roles in nematode infection (Hewezi et al., 2013). Global gene expression studies of plant responses to nematode infection has provided sequence information on various gene functional categories that can be targeted for generating resistance (reviewed by Escobar et al., 2011). Several genes involved in biosynthesis of multiple secondary metabolites constitute a significant portion of the nematode-regulated genes. Plants respond to invading pathogens by producing an array of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial functions (Dixon, 2001; Pichersky and Gershenzon, 2002). Unlike primary metabolites, secondary metabolites are not directly involved in the normal development, or reproduction of the plants, but they frequently play an important role in plant immunity by controlling the entry and/or development of the pathogens into plant cells and tissues (Dixon, 2001; Bednarek, 2012). Thus, manipulating the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites may provide novel solutions for controlling plant-parasitic nematodes.Transcriptome analysis alone, however, is insufficient for assigning potential roles to the genes differentially expressed in nematode parasitism. Functional characterization of these genes by reverse genetic approaches to modify their transcript level (by overexpression and RNAi, respectively) is required to elucidate their functional role in parasitism. Individually assaying hundreds to thousands of differentially expressed genes without any selection criteria would be extremely difficult and labor-intensive, but co-expression analyses provide a means to select and prioritize genes of interest for detailed function analysis. Genes showing similar expression patterns under diverse conditions often have similar or associated functions. The biological function of genes can be predicted based on co-expression networks (Usadel et al, 2009). Furthermore, gene co-expression networks will provide a system view of how host plants employ a genome-wide response to nematode infection, and hence main hubs with high connectivity relationships can be selected for in-depth functional analysis.Genome-wide expression profiling studies also provided convincing evidence that gene silencing might be essential for successful parasitism by cyst and root-knot nematodes (reviewed by Hewezi and Baum 2014). Microarray analysis of plant response to root-knot nematodes revealed that host gene silencing is an active mechanism associated with successful parasitism (Jammes et al., 2005; Fuller et al., 2007; Barcala et al., 2010; Portillo et al., 2013). Importantly, gene down-regulation was found to constitute up to two-thirds of the differentially expressed genes. This substantial gene silencing was found not only in the early developing giant cells, but also in mature feeding sites, indicating that continued gene suppression is associated with giant-cell initiation and maturation. The early stages of syncytium initiation and formation have also been associated with significant gene silencing (reviewed by Hewezi and Baum 2014). Interestingly, comparing gene expression changes between susceptible and resistant interaction between soybean and soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines revealed that gene up-regulation was associated with the resistant interactions, while gene down-regulation was associated with the susceptible interactions (Klink et al., 2007 and 2009; Kandoth et al, 2011). The molecular mechanisms underlying this active gene expression change are not completely understood. However, recent studies point to key roles of small RNA pathways in controlling gene expression of nematode-infected host cells, both at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (Hewezi et al., 2008; Hewezi et al., 2012). Thus, understanding how parasitic nematodes exploit silencing pathways to manipulate host gene expression to mediate susceptibility may provide opportunities to interfere with this regulation and hence render host plants resistant.Thousands of pathogenic viruses have been isolated from different organisms, including insects, with a few being used effectively as bio-control agents against the pests. However, only 8 viruses have been isolated from all nematodes globally. Taking advantage of the contemporary sciences of Virology and Genomics to identify viruses affecting naturally SCN with will generate opportunities for development of new bio-nematicide agents for management.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1391,"Seed treatments have been the most convenient and economical way to protect a wide variety of crops from pests. Cruiser &reg; 5FS (thiamethoxam, Syngenta Crop Protection) and Gaucho 600 Flowable (imidacloprid, Bayer CropScience) are neonicotinoid insecticide seed treatments that are registered for use on wheat, corn, and soybeans, though the rate varies by crop and pest targeted. These insecticides move into the soil from treated seed and can be persistent. In the mid-Atlantic, it is common to have a three year rotation of grain crops, starting with full season soybean, which is followed by fall planted wheat, then double-crop soybeans, and finally corn. Because seed treatments are so widely used, neonicotinoid treatments used in consecutive crops in the same field can result in higher soil concentrations than use in a single year alone. Repeated use of neonicotinoid treated seed from year to year can result in pest resistance development as well as potential negative impacts on beneficial organisms. Neonicotinoid drenches have been found to have non-target impacts on soil microorganisms including earthworms, beneficial microbes, and beneficial invertebrates. Not only can neonicotinoids have impacts on soil communities, but they may also impact above ground invertebrate communities including beneficial parasitoids and predators. Neonicotinoid insecticides have systemic properties and are quickly taken up from the soil by growing plant material in both the target crop as well as non-target weedy plants. Winter annual flowers (e.g., yellow rocket, chickweed, and shepard&#39;s purse) may take up neonicotinoids after the planting of winter wheat that has been seed treated. This may be a route for non-target exposure to pollinators. We propose to test the impact of thiamethoxam and imidacloprid treated wheat, soybean, and corn seeds in a back-to-back three year rotation on a wide range of non-target organisms. Specific objectives include determining whether treated seeds have an impact on (1) beneficial and pestiferous soil organisms including invertebrates and microorganisms, and (2) beneficial and pestiferous foliar invertebrates. Additionally, we will (3) determine whether winter annual flowers contain neonicotinoid residue after planting these seed treated grains. This study has the added value of allowing us to measure (4) the effect of repeated use of neonicotinoid seed treatments during the crop rotations that occur in mid-Atlantic grain production.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1392,"Soybean is one of the most important crop species in Virginia and the United States (http://vasoybean.com/) and accounts for over 30% of the crop growing area (http://soystats.com). In the state of Virginia, soybeans are grown on over half a million acres (600,000 acres in 2014) and theworth exceeds $200 million annually.Soybean seeds are a major source of protein and oil, and have been widely used in food production and animal feeding (Barrett 2006). Although the productivity of soybeans has been steadily increasing over the past 30 years, significant challenges remain in the future improvement of the productivity under ever-changing environmental conditions (Deshmukh et al. 2014). The development of new genomic technologies, play akey role in global food security and sustainable agriculture (Michael and VanBuren 2015). In contrast to traditional molecular biology techniques, where a small number of genes, proteins or metabolites are analyzed simultaneously, genomic technologies allow scientists to generate data at the whole genome scale.This has the potential to advance systematic understanding of biological mechanisms and significantly accelerate crop improvement. For example, genome sequencing can provide tens of thousands of genetic markers that enhances the power of marker-assisted breeding (Morrell, Buckler, and Ross-Ibarra 2011; Deshmukh et al. 2014). Transcriptome profiling with RNA sequencing can quantify changes of all genes for a given species, allowing the identification of key genes torespondto stress or other environmental conditions (Huang et al. 2014; Rodrigues et al. 2015; Wakasa et al. 2014).During the past few years, the cost of obtaining genomic information using next generation sequencing technology has reduced dramatically (Edwards, Batley, and Snowdon 2013). Because of this, genomic information such as reference genome sequences, single nucleotide polymorphisms, epigenomic modifications, and transcriptome profiles, have become readily available for many crop species. The challenge is how to translate the  big data  into knowledge of gene functions and genetic variation, and to apply such knowledge to facilitate a mechanical understandingof crop improvement. Bioinformatics and computational biology, play a fundamental role in this process. Using tools of statistical inference and machine learning, bioinformatics is the principled approach for data mining on genomics data to identify genes and genetic variations that underlie traits of economical importance. For example, RNAseq and genome re-sequencing data, have been used to identify genes involved in regulation of seed oil content (Goettel et al. 2014) or seed development (Fan et al. 2013). In the past few decades, most gene functions and molecular mechanisms in plants, have been characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana (Krishnakumar et al. 2015), a model plant species. As compared to Arabidopsis, genetic experiments for crops are typically more time consuming (Edwards, Batley, and Snowdon 2013). Unlike traditional genetic experiments, genomic experiments such as RNA sequencing are fast and can now be routinely performed in a variety of crops species. However, crop genomes are typically more complex than Arabidopsis, thus new bioinformatics tools and databases are needed to help breeders and other plant scientists to analyze and interpret genomic data in order to better understand the information embedded in such data. One of the main functions of these tools will be to compare crop species and Arabidopsis in order to identify key genes and pathways that are conserved and involved in important biological processes, such as seed filling, seed germination, disease resistance, and drought/flood tolerance.In the next five years, my lab will focus on building bioinformatic platforms (Figure 1) that enable scientists to extract information from comparative genomic data and to facilitate crop improvement. We will use soybean (Glycine max) as a model system to build our bioinformatics resources and pipelines. We will focus on three biological processes: seed development, stress tolerance and microbial interactions. Seed development is the key process that is related to the product quality of soybeans. Environmental stresses such as drought and flood are major abiotic factors that negatively impact soybean productivity. As a legume species, soybean-microbial interactions are crucial for the process of nitrogen fixation and determines the protein content of soybean seeds. Many research groups at Virginia Tech as well as in other institutions have studied these biological processes, and have already generated ample amount of sequencing data for soybean and Arabidopsis. We will use these existing data in our research. The bioinformatics platform developed in this project can be easily extended to analyze data from other crop species such as maize, rice and wheat.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

1395,"In Puerto Rico, 50% of operational cost of milk production is feed related. This justifies cropping systems research to produce feed in support ruminant livestock farming. Experiment Station research identified two soybean lines for grain or hay production and also adapted to the agroecosystem of the island. The use of soybean for grain or hay in an integrated cropping-livestock farming system could benefit animal feed production and reduce feed costs for the livestock industry. Our long-term goal is to increase soybean acreage expansion by promoting the use of soybean as grain and hay crop. Whole soybeans roasted and incorporated in livestock rations can also increase the nutritional value of feed diets. The objectives are: i. Evaluate agronomic performance of soybean-corn-sorghum-sunflower rotation systems at two locations (Isabela and Lajas agricultural substations) for grain and hay production; ii. Assess effect of roasted soybean inclusion in small ruminants on weight gains and milk production, iii. Compare and establish appropriate balanced rations using roasted soybeans-corn-sorghum-sunflower either as grains or silage for dairy cows in Lajas (stakeholder farms) and Camuy-Quebradillas area (stakeholder farms); iv. Determine wether soybean production is profitable in the different agro-ecosystems of Puerto Rico, and v. Promote this information in quarterly and annual educational outreach on use of dual-purpose soybean in livestock production systems. Studies repeated yearly will be conducted in conjunction with Experiment Station Research Scientists, Agriculture Extension Service personnel and stakeholders. Results will be published in the Journal of Agriculture University of Puerto Rico and other related journals. Knowledge developed will be used to prodcue a tech-pac for training and stakeholder use. Research will be focused on developing the use of integrated cropping-livestock suited for local agro-ecosystems and improve livestock efficiency.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1396,"Water resources, both surface water as well as ground water, are vital to Nebraska&#39;s agriculture. For example, Nebraska ranks as the fourth state in the nation on ground water use in agriculture and first in the nation on irrigated acreage. In 2012, Nebraska was ranked 3rd and 5th in the nation in corn and soybean production, respectively. Considering that one of three Nebraskans work in ag-related jobs, water and agricultural activities are closely tied from a socioeconomic perspective. Unfortunately, in response to irrigation water withdrawals, groundwater levels have declined significantly in several major irrigated areas of the state. Also, groundwater decline can have impacts on streamflow which is important for endangered species and interstate compacts. This factor contributes to the challenge of water, agricultural, and ecosystems sustainability in the state. In consequence, the predictability of productivity of the agro-ecosystem and the consequent preparedness for change in water states is based on our ability to diagnose, forecast, and predict current and future environmental states including water availability and crop production.A key to achieving water and agricultural resources sustainability is to understand the interactions among climate, water availability and water uses in agro-ecosystems. However, human impacts on a natural dynamic equilibrium (or a gradual return to it) of the Earth-life&#39;s support system jeopardize efforts to exercise a sustainable development. Rockstrom et al. (2009) identify some of these impacts through eight planetary limits, three of which have exceeded the limits (biodiversity, nitrogen cycle, and climate change) and another three are on their way to do so (land use changes, global freshwater, and ocean acidification). Loss of biodiversity, extensive use of nitrogen, and land-use changes, all are closely related to the expansion and intensification of agricultural activities and reduction of ecosystem services. Also, a changing environment characterized by climate and land-use changes has posed important challenges to identify the pathways to sustain food production and ecosystem services with variable water availability. In the first case, the IPCC attributed climate change to human activities related with fossil fuel combustion at an unprecedented level of confidence (IPCC, 2013), which is leading to more extreme hydrometeorological events (flood and drought), both linked to an increasing global temperature and temporal variability in precipitation. In the second case, land-use changes mainly as a product of agriculture&#39;s expansion over large areas has contributed to regional changes in precipitation patterns, which have reached to more than 700,000km2 (3.5 times the size of Nebraska) in less than 25 years in places such as the Amazon (Arima et al 2011). It is expected that an additional 450 million ha will be converted to cropland by 2050 (Rockstrom 2007).All the processes above are interrelated influencing the spatial distribution and temporal variability of water availability, crop production, and ecosystem services across scales. In order to characterize the multi-dimensionality of water-related challenges the Global Water Project (http://thewaterproject.org/) developed a framework where exchanges of water between physical, biological/biogeochemical, and socioeconomic components of the Global Water System (GWS) contribute to regulate the dynamics of the water cycle. Under this framework, understanding the relationships between components of the GWS and the inherent effect of local processes on the global water-cycle dynamics (and vice versa) advances the science and technologic development toward providing more food at higher levels of water productivity.Sustainability is defined by Griggs et al. (2013) as  Economy serving society within Earth-life&#39;s support system . In water- and crop-management this definition can be interpreted as a reduction in poverty while environment and economic wealth are maintained. Thus water sustainable development is engineered to anticipate change and facilitate the achievement of water sustainability through improvements in planning, designing, and management of water resources (Loucks, 2000). In this context, sustainable development can be seen as a pathway that tracks how water (or other environmental) states can be prolonged to ultimately achieve sustainability of water and agricultural resources. These pathways, sinuous or straight, are the result of integrating processes that drive the GWS and ultimately define an spatial and temporal representation of sustainability achievement.The multi-dimensionality of the relationships defining sustainable development of water and agricultural resources can be seen as mass and energy fluxes forced by climate and regulated by human activities along the water continuum from the atmosphere to the aquifer. The water continuum from field to global scales integrates processes that regulate water supply/demand. We aim to better understand how these processes (naturally driven or anthropogenically affected) may change over time influencing future water availability and crop production.At field-scale (producers, land/water managers) a diagnostic research on water management includes irrigation scheduling, deficit irrigation (Martin et al., 2010), tillage practices, and drainage. In Nebraska conservation tillage has enjoyed significant adoption rates, and a growing number of producers are using soil water sensors and ET-gages through the influence of the Nebraska Agricultural Water Management Network (NAWMN), UNL Extension, and in some cases industry. However, due to the high spatial variability of soil water, there is a need for meso-scale soil water measurement to provide field average soil water. Despite research and extension efforts, very few producers take the time to calculate their own soil water balance. An online tool that utilizes a soil water balance and a crop growth model is available for soybeans (SoySim), but an equivalent tool needs to be developed for corn.At the sub-field scale, precision agriculture has provided producers the opportunity to manage inputs spatially, including fertilizer, plant population, hybrid, and water. Variable rate irrigation (VRI) technology provides an opportunity to prevent over-application and/or under-application of water, but best management practices are not yet well defined and the benefits of VRI are not well quantified. Previous research has included development of the technology (Kranz et al., 2012), correlating spatial variability in soil water extraction with soil electrical conductivity (EC) (Rudnick &amp; Irmak, 2014), soil water sensor location determined by ET and elevation (Pan et al., 2013) potential energy and water savings (Hillyer and Higins, 2014), and modeling and decision support (McCarthy et al., 2014).

1397,"The typical Iowa corn-soybean rotation is detrimental to the ecological sustainability of Iowa&#39;s soils and agriculture. Current summer annual crop rotations often 1) leave soil bare and unprotected from erosion and losses of organic matter and nutrients during fall, winter, and spring and 2) have little biodiversity. The lack of biodiversity leads to issues with pest management, labor distribution through the growing season, and economics and profitability. The purpose of this research project is to increase crop species diversity on the Iowa farming landscape. This will be achieved by developing longer crop rotations that include summer and winter annual species as well as perennial species. Oilseed crops such as canola and cereal grains such as wheat exhibiting summer and winter annual life cycles as well as perennial legumes such as red clover could possibly fit into an Iowa crop rotation, providing growers with alternative options. Additionally, the inclusion of summer and winter annual crop species in rotations increases the potential of economically viable double-cropping scenarios. The inclusion of species with different life cycles such as these can also serve to improve cropping systems by increasing the amount of ground cover throughout the year and help disturb life cycles of problematic weed species. Incorporating multiple species into a crop rotation may also improve yields of other crops such as corn and improve a farmer&#39;s economic stability, while at the same time reduce the ecological footprint as a result historical land cultivation. The potential to reduce the amount of off-farm, synthetic inputs also exists when longer, more diverse crop rotations that include legumes are employed. Before growers can reap the benefits of alternative crop rotations, the ecological and economical viability of &#39;alternative/non-corn/soybean&#39; crops and double-cropping systems must be evaluated with a strong emphasis on making any information as a result of this research readily available to growers. This study investigates the agronomic and economic potential of planting winter canola into full sesaon soybeans with the intent of harvesting high soybeans yields while seeding winter canola at optimum planting dates for Iowa. In order to increase adoption of alternative crops, it is critical that yield trials be established that can identifythe yield potential of winter canola varieties that are most suited to Iowa climate.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1398,"Northeastern U.S. agriculture is characterized by a complex mosaic of numerous small farms nested in heterogeneous, often urbanizing landscapes. This agriculture is placed within mountainous and forested areas with significant topographic relief, resulting in complex and unique spatial variability at multiple scales. Nearly 60% of the land is forested, 11% of the land is in crops, and it is in this non-forested land that agriculture is concentrated and co-existing with urbanization. These farms are among the oldest intensively farmed areas in the U.S., often with 200 or more years of farming history. Most of the farm acreage is in field and forage crop production, in part to support the strong animal agriculture in the state. Many of the farms are multigenerational, and they often integrate higher value fruit and vegetable agriculture, and some have become certified organic operations, allowing them to charge a premium for their products. In a time of vertical integration and increasing farm size, the contribution from this diverse agricultural mosaic can be too-easily overlooked. Interestingly, however, it is in this northeastern mosaic where diversified small farms are being sustained, and crop diversity ranks among the highest in the nation (Pfleeger et al. 2006). The integration of large acreage field and forage crops with higher value production (fruits, veggies, organic), rapid access to markets, and a strong generational tie to the farms helps farms persist and enter new markets. This diversified and integrated agriculture also creates value-added production which helps sustain agriculture and jobs within local environments, and sustains family farms. To support this industry, we need to advance environmentally sound invertebrate (insects, mites, slugs, and other pest species) management practices that are economically feasible, effective, improve farm-worker safety, and relevant to conventional and organic growers. Pest management practices that meet these goals are based on an understanding of local pest population, community ecology in these agroecosystems, and migratory pests that may arrive. Understanding species composition, densities, trophic roles, and bottom-up and top-down factors that influence abundance of key pest species and effectiveness of beneficial species, along with phenology to determine the time of life stages, are all critical components of applying insect ecology to pest management. This research contributes towards sustaining farms in the northeast by enhancing our understanding of insect populations and community dynamics of both pest and beneficial species, including natural enemies and wild pollinators, in northeastern field, forage, vegetable, and vineyard agroecosystems.Field and forage crop production dominate Pennsylvania agriculture with about 4 million acres of corn, soybean, alfalfa, and grass hay supporting a vibrant livestock business raising dairy cows, beef cattle, swines, poultry, among other animal species. For good reason Pennsylvania is known as a dairy state (we have around 7000 dairies) but the other diverse animals raised on Pennsylvania farms need feed and forage also. By some estimates, as much as 100% of the conventional corn production in Pennsylvania receives insecticides each year, while about 50% of soybean acreage does (Douglas and Tooker 2015). It is clear that most of this insecticide use is preventative and much of it could be avoided if growers relied on scouting and using the framework of Integrated Pest Management to direct any insecticide usage. Vegetables are grown commercially on &gt; 4,300 Pennsylvanian farms that produce over 30 crops, and the state ranks in the top 10 in production of sweet corn, several species of Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae, and processing snap beans. Sweet corn dominates diversified fresh-market farms: it is grown on approximately 75% of these farms. About 85% of the acreage is chemically treated for control of a complex of lepidopterans, but resistance to several relevant insecticide options is now common in the US. Cucurbits rank high: Pennsylvania now ranks second or third in pumpkin production and a diverse array of other cucurbits are produced. Grapes are grown on over 14,000 acres of land in Pennsylvania, ranking the state fourth nationally in grape production and eighth larges in wine production. These crops are chemically treated for multiple species of insects that vector pathogens, increasingly with systemic neonicotinoids that can negatively influence pollinators and natural enemy species (Henry et al. 2012, Whitehorn et al. 2012, Douglas et al. 2015). At least 5 newly invasive species are now causing dramatic changes in management practices. Transgenic cultivars that are genetically modified to be insect resistant are commercially available for field corn, sweet corn and squash, more approaching the marketplace pending further research, and seed- and transplant-based technologies are increasing. Reliance on pesticides, however, is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain. Over 500 arthropods are resistant to insecticides, including two relevant to northeastern agroecosystems with field resistant to transgenes (Storer et al. 2010, Gassmann et al. 2011), and non-target and pollution effects are getting harder to ignore (Hladik et al. 2014; Douglas et al. 2015).

1399,"Following market reforms three decades ago, China&#39;s agricultural policy has undergone a fundamental transformation and now involves a wide array of policy instruments that range from output and input subsidies to public infrastructure expenditures. Chinese agricultural policies have shifted from farm taxation, typical of developing countries, to farm subsidies and direct payments more typical of developed countries. Because the People&#39;s Republic of China is the world&#39;s largest importer, producer, and consumer of agricultural products, its policy changes have significant impact on world markets, including the United States. This highlights the need to better understand the drivers of policy changes in China. Japan is another important trade partner of the United States. The country was one of the top five U.S. export markets for wheat, soybeans and corn in both 2014 and 2015. It is also one of the largest beef importing countries in the world. Japan currently has Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with fifteen countries. If Japan signs a similar EPA agreement with the United States, there could be substantial gains for the U.S. due to the lower or zero tariff rates on the imports from U.S. The proposed research will quantitatively investigate the determinants of the levels of agricultural subsidies in China as well as the effects of EPAs on Japanese agricultural imports in the last three decades.

1400,"U.S. food security and farm incomes depend on the continued advancement of the science of crop health and disease management. As climate change brings more extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods; as pressure increases on water and soil resources; as new farm management practices, such as cover crops, are recommended and implemented - more needs to be known about how these environmental pressures and new farm management practices are affecting plant- and soil-associated organisms, including both beneficial and pathogenic microbes.Healthy plants rely on the metabolic activities of soil microorganisms in a variety of ways including, for example, transforming nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous into forms that are essential for growing healthy plants capable of thwarting diseases. Plant diseases are the result of an interaction of microorganisms with a host plant when environmental conditions are conducive for infection and disease development. These interactions have direct implications for the choice of cropping and disease management practices.Using a combination of laboratory research and field experiments, we will investigate the role of cover crops, crop rotations, seed treatments, and insect management practices on microbial communities of plants and soils. In addition, we will examine the role of environment, plants, and associated organisms on crop health and management. This new knowledge is expected to inform strategies for best utilizing cover crops, crop rotations and insect management practices for enhanced crop productivity and environmental sustainability of corn and soybean production in the Midwestern U.S.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1401,"In 2015, South Dakota was ranked 6th harvested soybean acres (5,120,000),6th for harvested wheat acres (2,236,000), and 2nd for harvested sunflower acres (662,000) (NASS 2016). During 2015 South Dakota was ranked 7th in the U.S. for soybeanproduction (235,520,000 bushels), 6th for wheat production (103,406,000 bushels), and 1st forsunflower production (1,230,040,000 lbs). When the annual production of these crops is compared between 2013 and 2015 there was a 12% increase for soybean, a 9.7% increase for wheat, and a 21% increase for sunflower (NASS 2016). As the harvested acres and observed yields of soybean, wheat, and sunflower continue to increase, there is also an increased need for improved management recommendations for the insect pests of these crops. One strategy that has been employed is the use of insecticide seed treatments, and as a result their use in South Dakota has been steadily increasing (USGS 2016). Soybean, wheat, and sunflower productivity is often negatively affected by early season soil dwelling and also foliar feeding insect pests. Due to a limited selection of products available for management of these insect pests, and the systemic nature and ease of use associated with insecticide seed treatments, they are often used for insectmanagement. The insecticide active ingredients used for seed treatments for soybean, wheat, andsunflower are exclusively neonicotinoids.Insecticide seed treatments are used on approximately 31% of soybean acres across the U.S., however, it is believed that in areas of the Midwest they are used on as much as 73% of the planted soybean acres (Douglas and Tooker 2015). Although these insecticide products are applied to seed that is planted on millions of acres of cropland there are limited use recommendations available, and as a result they are often used prophylactically (Douglas and Tooker 2015). Concerns regarding the value of insecticide seed treatments for soybean in the Midwest have been a topic of discussion since 2014 when a report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was released. The Biological and Economic Analysis Division (BEAD) of the EPA determined that the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments in soybean most likely provided farmers with a $0/acre benefit, and at most $6/acre benefit (EPA 2014). However, an analysis of the same data by AgInformatics, LLC determined that the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments provide a net yield benefit of 2.8%(approximately $10.60/acre) when compared to untreated soybean (Mitchell 2014). In their report, the EPA BEAD also stated that according to surveys of soybean farmers the insect pests that were being managed through the use of insecticide seed treatments included soybean aphids and bean leaf beetles (EPA 2014). Although they are major commodities, there is limited data available regarding the use of insecticide seed treatments for wheat and sunflower production.Identifying early season above-ground insect pests is relatively easy, and relies on observing the insect or signs of defoliation. However, identification of belowground insect pests can be difficult and as a result they are often overlooked and ignored. The early season insect pests associated with soybean include wireworm, seedcorn maggots, white grubs, and bean leaf beetles (Bailey et al. 2015). Early season pests of both spring and winter wheat include bird cherry oat aphid, English grain aphid, greenbug, Hessian fly, and wireworms (Dyer at al. 2012, Hunger et al. 2012). An additional concern, aside from yield losses due to direct feeding is that the three aphid species that feed on wheat are also competent vectors of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). Exploration of the impact of insecticide seed treatments on the incidence of BYDV in wheat is necessary. For sunflower, early season insect pests include wireworms, seedcorn maggots, striped flea beetle, and sunflower beetle (Knodel and Charlet 2007). While this list does account for bean leaf beetles as an early season pest, it does not account for soybean aphids due to their late season arrival in soybean. The contradiction between the EPA&#39;s survey data and the known early season insect pests of soybean are likely due to a lack of extension and outreach from state universities. Also, if this discrepancy exists for one crop such as soybean, it likely exists for other crops including wheat and sunflower. Although insecticide seed treatments are labeled for wheat and sunflower there is limited data available regarding their efficacy and benefit to farmers in the U.S., and especially in South Dakota.Therefore, it is critical that the use of insecticide seed treatments is explored in soybean, wheat and sunflower in South Dakota to determine their benefit for farmers. In addition, for each crop itwill also be imperative to explore factors (e.g., planting date, seeding density, soil type, weatherconditions) to determine when insecticide seed treatments provide the greatest economic benefit to farmers. Through these efforts, management recommendations for insecticideuse on soybean, wheat, and sunflower will be developed.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1402,"Growing a diverse selection of crops can expand the small farmers markets and offset commodity price swings. Profits will not depend exclusively on any one market example, such as corn or soy beans. Therefore, strategic diversification improves the overall economic picture of the small farmer. However, help is needed to determine which alternative crop would be the best. The project aims to identify and test novel native and exotic plants which have non-conventional uses like medicinal plants, anti-bacterial and anti-allergic properties. Apiary could be a multi-pronged benefit to the small farmer and aid the diversification. It not only produces honey wax and propolis, but also enhances pollination and increases fruit tree production. Small animals for fiber production could also add to the diversification, such as the fiber yielding English Angora rabbit. The Ohio climate is ideal for Angora rabbits and the ease with which it is grown makes it an ideal product for diversification on an animal farm. In order to make the small farmer sustainable, it is essential to conserve natural prairies and wetland in the area. Ninety percent (90%) of the native prairies and wetlands are lost to land-use pattern changes in Ohio; therefore, what remains has to be carefully conserved and managed in order them to play a role in the environment. Natural wetlands, apart from cleaning up the water and providing a stock of underground water, also harbor rare plants and animals that aid in the sustainability of the farmer.This project proposes to develop methods to measure the biological integrity of the wetlands through long-term monitoring. It is envisaged to expand the research capability of CSU inorder to 1) develop novel plant-based products and suggest alternative crops for small farmers. 2) identify varieties of rabbits for fiber and 3) develop winter-hardy, mite-resistant honey bees.

Production and quality potentials are limited by numerous biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic factors include the genetic potential of the crop as well as numerous insects and diseases. Abiotic limitations are attributable primarily to water and temperature. Historically, most emphasis on the development of improved grain sorghums has come from the Great Plains states. Recent interest in utilizing the low production cost, drought resistance, and tolerance to less than optimal soil conditions of grain sorghum has renewed interest in this crop in the Mid-South and Southeast. Specifically in Louisiana, the shallow hardpan soils of the northeastern part of the state are particularly susceptible to drought conditions and grain sorghum is an attractive fit. Furthermore, as a rotational crop, grain sorghum has value in managing weeds by rotating herbicide chemistry, in managing nematodes that attack cotton and soybeans, and in improving soil properties. This proposal looks to capitalize upon this opportunity through the establishment of a grain sorghum breeding program targeted to these environments. The overall aim of the project is to develop high yielding grain sorghum inbred lines and hybrids adapted to Louisiana and the humid Southeast.

1405,"Soybean and sorghum are important crops in the United States. They are good sources of bioactive compounds with potential health promoting properties. United States is considered the top producer and exporter of soybean and sorghum in the world. A plethora of report suggest that consumption of soybean is associated with reduction of risk to certain diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have shown potential applications of sorghum and sorghum bioactives in management of human diseases including diabetes and thromboembolism. One potential source of bioactive compound in soybean and sorghum is protein. Protein, when digested, can lead to production of peptides with certain biological activity. Soybean contains naturally occurring bioactive peptide called lunasin with reported health benefits. To date, the importance of protease inhibitors on the stability of lunasin against digestion is not yet completely understood. This proposal is seeking to define the role of Bowman-Birk inhibitor and Kunitz trypsin inhibitor on the stability of lunasin and generation of peptideswith potential health benefits. On the other hand, the application of sorghum as a source of functional food ingredient in the US has not been explored completely. Hence this project is seeking to develop sorghum proteins as functional food ingredient. Currently, the use of sorghum in the food industry is limited as sorghum proteins are indigestible. We are developing a pre-treatment process that will lead to production of sorghum proteins with improved digestibility. To study this program, sorghum proteins will be fractionated and pre-treated with enzymes and ultrasonication. The resulting pre-treated sorghum proteins will be subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion to see if pre-treatment improves the digestibility of sorghum proteins. The goal is to produce a functional food ingredient from sorghum proteins with improved digestibility to further increase food applications of this important crop in the US.

1408,"The world needs more seafood, yet the ocean&#39;s wild fish stocks simply cannot meet this burgeoning demand. Globally, 85% of our commercial stocks have already been fished to their biological limit. These heavily exploited wild marine fish stocks are under increasing pressure, with growing global population (projected to reach 9 billion by 2050, including concurrent expansion of the middle class by some 3 billion consumers), wider recognition of the health benefits of seafood, and increasing affluence of many developing countries. Without a significant change in management approaches, wild fisheries have been projected to totally collapse by 2048. The only possible way to meet the global demand for high&shy;quality seafood without causing such a collapse is through aquaculture. Because a greater proportion of this growing demand is directed towards higher&shy;quality marine fish, we believe that much of the solution to the world&#39;s seafood needs lies with open ocean mariculture.The one remaining constraint to allow responsible, sustainable scale&shy;up of open ocean mariculture to meet the growing demand for seafood - and the one remaining valid concern of the environmental community with aquaculture generally &shy; is the ?continuing reliance of aquacultured marine fish on wild fish resources as feedstuff. Fishmeal and fish oil resources (largely derived from wild fisheries of sardines, menhaden and anchovies) face growing pressure, and aquaculture&#39;s expansion is the primary driving force.Kyphosids are classified as  true  herbivores and are known, through gut content analysis studies, to consume a wide variety of algal types including red, brown, and green algae. An exceptionally long hind&shy;gut in the digestive tract makes kyphosids well suited for plant digestion. Some of the algal species that kyphosids consume are troublesome invasive species to Hawai&#39;i and other parts of the world. Harvesting and utilizing these algae as future fish food ingredients could help control these harmful species. At a minimum, kyphosids should be able to digest agricultural grains, such as soybean meal, wheat and corn products, in less expensive, less processed forms.

1409,"Agriculture has seen rapid development in both the quantity and quality of food production; however, the presence of pests and disease on crops can hamper the quality of agricultural pro-duce and can have a devastating effect on a farmer&#39;s bottom line.To combat the risk of pest infestations and disease, crop producers rely on a process known as crop scouting. Field-based crop scouting entails walking and surveying crop fields for yield reducing pests (insects, weeds, and diseases) and determining when control strategies must be taken.Typically, scouting is performed by either the farm operator or a contract service provided by local farm co-operatives or crop consulting businesses. The crop scouts hired by these contract service providers are often college interns trained through brief  scouting schools  and then sent into fields equipped with a paper-based scouting report and manuals to use for field pest identifi-cation. This traditional approach of crop scouting is cumbersome, time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to inaccurate pest identification.As smartphones and tablets are becoming more entrenched in the daily life of agricultural production, mobile-based scouting software apps have emerged. Though these apps provide a more user-friendly system to record and manage field data, pest identification remains ineffi-cient, usually accomplished by answering dozens of questions. There is a critical need for auto-mated techniques to improve a user&#39;s scouting experience by making the path to identifying weeds, insects, or crop disorders easier, faster, and far more intuitive than at present.Allyke proposes VIRTUOSO (Visual Recognition of Pests for Crop Scouting), an image analysis technology for automatically identifying pests (insects, weeds, and diseases) during field-based crop scouting. VIRTUOSO accelerates the tedious, manual process of pest identifica-tion. Rather than scouring through large field pest identification manuals or answering dozens of often ambiguous questions posed by a mobile crop scouting app, VIRTUOSO helps crop scouts by automatically identifying the pest or crop disease from a photograph. VIRTUOSO uses ma-chine learning to learn a hierarchy of features that unveil salient feature patterns and hidden structure in the data. Each layer leads to progressively more abstract features at higher levels of the hierarchy. As a result, the learned representations are richer than existing handcrafted image features, making it easier to extract useful data when building classifiers or other predictors.Allyke has partnered with ScoutPro, a leading provider of mobile agricultural apps for crop scouting. ScoutPro has already established a critical mass of users for corn and soybean crop scouting applications. VIRTUOSO will be a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) with a RESTful application programming interface (API). When integrated with ScoutPro&#39;s apps, we hypothesize that VIRTUOSO will not only improve scouting efficiency, but also the accuracy of the pest identification. It may also mean scouting happens more regularly, given the ease. Farmers will have a real-time understanding of crop pest pressures and gain the ability to make decisions more effectively, whether marketing their product, managing their risk, or just understanding the crop pest issues impacting crop production.The proposed innovation will not only represent a substantial breakthrough through the effec-tive use of  Big Data  within agriculture and the USDA, but also other application domains where large image datasets are prevalent, including social media, retail, robotics, and medicine. It will enable the automatic derivation of analysis products that allow practitioners to quickly ana-lyze data from new domains while greatly minimizing human effort.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1410,"The U.S. is the largest wheat exporter globally, yet the competitiveness of U.S. wheat, both globally and domestically, is declining significantly. Planted acreage is down thirty percent since the 1980s, in large part due to competition from other crops with higher returns. Net returns to farmers from wheat are consistently half or less than that from corn and soy. Further, the rate of growth in wheat yield has stalled and historically has grown at one fourth that of corn (USDA ERS). The Economic Research Service posits that genetic improvement of wheat has been slower due to the complexity of the wheat genome and the lower value capture opportunities for the private sector from investments in research (USDA Wheat Baseline 2012-21). The competitiveness of U.S. wheat will depend upon reversing these trends, including stimulating yield growth rates through private sector investment.With the aim of increasing yield in wheat, we have used TILLING, a reverse genetics tool, to identify novel alleles of candidate wheat yield genes in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. These alleles will be evaluated for the ability to alter wheat architecture and improve yield in the greenhouse and field during the scope of this proposal. Following successful field trials, Arcadia will license these technologies for commercialization through one or more of our current wheat partners. As a non-GM technology, products from TILLING can rapidly advance to commercialization and do not face market or regulatory restrictions. With a conservative 5% increase in yield, the yearly value creation to the U.S. farmer is estimated at over $30/hectare. In addition, the value of higher yielding wheat varieties to a seed company arising from this research in the U.S. alone is more than $40 million annually. In summary, by incorporating favorable alleles of plant architecture genes into a commercial wheat breeding program we believe we can make a significant contribution to improving yield in this vital food crop.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1411,"This project will develop and qualify a system that is capable of treating soybean farming operations where susceptibility to SCN is the primary yield limiting pest. Soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines; SCN) is the major pathogen of soybean causing over $1 billion in crop losses annually. SCN is now considered endemic to North America and is spreading as more acres of land are planted in soybean. Widely prevalent strategies for SCN management include crop rotation and the use of resistant soybean cultivars. These approaches have met with only limited success in reducing the populations of parasitic nematodes in the field. The recent loss of SCN resistance in Ohio-grown soybean highlights the importance of generating new methods for SCN control such as biocontrol. Examples of biocontrol with nematicidal activity are found in the scientific literature including numerous strains of bacteria. However, commercial applications by the large seed companies are limited to spore-forming Bacillus strains. While these spore-formers have some limited ability to survive conventional on-seed application processes and supply chain conditions, they can be limited in their effectiveness against target pests. Environmental stress and abuse associated with manufacturing and distribution typically results in microorganism death and/or dormancy, which decrease viability and physiological activity of the microorganism at the time of application. Thus, current microbial products have decreased effectiveness and reliability.3Bar Biologics is creating a disruptive new system to deliver beneficial microorganisms - a low cost, disposable bioreactor that protects the microorganisms until the farmer is ready to activate the product prior to application. On-site growth of the beneficial microorganisms short-cuts the conventional supply chain, resulting in fresher, more viable microorganisms delivered to the field. This bioreactor opens up the potential for farmers to apply more effective microorganism strains with SCN control capability.The work plan addresses three technical objectives to create a functional prototype for commercialization of strains with demonstrated activity on SCN, to i) maximize cellular yields in the device with a number of proven beneficial strains, ii) characterize stability and compatibility of new formulations, and iii) evaluate efficacy against SCN in the field.This project is directly aligned with USDA NIFA Challenge Area 1) Global Food Security, and Priority 8.2.4) to research biobased approaches for plant protection against abiotic and biotic stresses.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1412,"Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and EPA Deputy Administrator Stan Meilburg recently announced (9/16/15) the first ever national food waste reduction goal, callling for a reduction of 50% by 2030. The United States enjoys the most productive and abundant supply on earth but too much of the food goes to waste  says Tom Vilsack. By reducing wasted food in landfills, we cut harmful methane emissions that fuel climate change, conserve our natural resources, and protect our planet for future generations  says EPA Administrator Gina McCarty.Food waste is the single largest component of solid waste in US landfills. The EPA estimates this amounts to 34 million tons with an extimated cost of $1.3 billion (Schwab, 2013). While there are multiple efforts to reduce and recycle food waste, only 3% is recycled (EPA, 2012). These food wastes are lost at multiple levels of the food supply and consumption chain.Therefore, it is clear that food waste is an increasing concern.The EPA has published the Food Waste Hierarchy (EPA 2012) that identifies best practices for managing food waste. After source reduction and reuse feeding hungry people, the highest recycling priority is converting food waste to animal feed. This is ahead of industrial recycling options such as anaerobic digestion, composting, and ahead of landfills.Feed is the largest single cost item for livestock and poultry production, accounting for 60% to 70% of the total cost in many years (Naylor, 2005). The demand for feed corn has been impacted by the use of corn for ethanol raising the cost of feed for livestock producers and adding to the volatility of prices.Our proposal will prove the feasibilty of diverting food waste to animal feed. This will offer hog producers a viable nutritionally beneficial alternative to corn and soybean meal.Our mobile modular food waste processor (MMFWP) is a patent pending vessel that collects food waste from food waste generators. The food wastecollected and contained in the MMFWP tank is delivered to a central location, the tank with the food waste still contained within is unloaded from the vehicle, and the tank hooked up to a heat transfer unit. Through a thermal process, the food waste is dehydrated to a level of 12% or less eliminating the potential for pathogen regrowth and allowing for a shelf life.In this thermal process, the pathogens are killed while not degrading the nutritional content of the food waste.The patent pending MMFWP has been built as a prototype and successfully operated.The goal of the proposal in Phase 1 is:1) To validate to hog producers that converting food waste to animal feed with the technology applied by the MMFWP has equivalent if not superior nutritional benefits compared to soybean meal and corn. This is critical to the business model by ensuring an outlet for the animal feed. 2) To validate that this nutritional benefit is indeed digestible by swine even after the thermal processing. Again necessary to give confidence to hog producers that the output has been proven to be an acceptable source of animal feed. This then supports the economics of the business model dependent on the feed market for the sale of the output.3) To establish the bench mark price of the output. Pricing the output is critical to building a viable commercial operation.For this proposal, arrangements have been made to collect food waste from three generators and process the food waste utilizing the MMFWP:1) Fish distributor/processor (fish waste)2) Produce distributor/processor (fruitand vegetable waste)3) Grocery store (mixed food wastes). A good representation of the heterogenity of food waste expected from generators such as restaurants andcafeterias. It will be a broad mix of waste from the deli (both hot &amp; cold), butcher department, fruits and vegetables, bakery and dairy.The proposal includes critical research performed by the the University of Minneaota Department of Animal Science under the direction of Dr. Gerald Shurson and Dr. Pedro Urriola both of whom are swine specialists.THe processed food waste (output) will be transported to the University of Minnesota Southern Research Center in Waseca, Minnesota. At this site, through established testing methods, 36 pigs will be fed the output. Targeted nutritional components will be analyzed for digestibility of the processed food waste by swine.Preliminary results from operating the MMFWP have shown the nutritional content of the output is comparable to corn and soy bean meal. With the proposed research, we will demonstrate that the processed food waste and the nutritional content of the output is also digestible by swine. This is critical in satisfying any concerns from hog producers that processed food waste can be a viable alternative to current feeding diets.The impact could be considerable:1) The University of Minnesota Department of Animal Science estimates 125 million market pigs couldbe fed on food waste (Dr. Pedro Urriola, 2015) making a significant reduction in the pressure of planting corn and soy beans for feeding these pigs.2) Food waste could now be viewed as a resource with economic benefits. Eliminating landfilling and contributing to a cleaner environment.3) Once digestibility is proven and the benchmark pricing for the output is established, the potential commercial application is promising. The MMFWP is designed to easily scale to meet the market sizes of any metro area, to easily add capacity as the supply of food waste and demand for animal feed grows. The system has a relatively low capital cost compared to current alternatives such as anaerobic digesters and composting facilities and will cost no more than a single refuse truck. Our process produces an animal feed that will be nutritionally benefical to swine and pathogen free. It will be dried to allow for a shelf life and the ability to ship to hog producers regardless of location.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1413,"With global aquaculture production poised to double in the next 20 years the need for sustainable, cost effective feed inputs will be greater than ever - and soybean-based feeds can be part of the solution. Unfortunately, soy feeds use remains limited due to the presence of anti-nutritional factors including undigested oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose, lectins that damage the intestinal lining, and phytate that binds to and prevents the uptake of proteins and essential cations. This is particularly prevalent for high-value carnivorous species such as salmon, char and trout where feed rations can only contain as little as 8% soy meal. Over Phase I of the project, we have identified and characterized at the molecular level allelic series of nonsense and missense mutations in the genes directly responsible for the synthesis of the targeted anti-nutritional factors. We have grown a collection of selected mutants carrying homozygous mutation for each allele of interest. In Phase II, we will fully phenotype the selected homozygotes and isolate the lines with best growth habits as source material for genetic crosses. Genetic crosses will be performed to combine mutated alleles to produce lines with: a single low anti-nutritional trait (low lectin, low oligosaccharides, low phytate), or to combine two, or finally three anti-nutritional traits (low lectin + low oligosaccharides + lower phytate). The effects of each mutation alone or in combination will be evaluated for agronomic performance. The transfer of the traits into elite varieties would start as soon as the phenotype for each trait has been assessed. By the end of Phase II we will produce enough product for a fish feeding study.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1414,"The current dependence of grouper and tuna aquaculture on  wet fish  diets poses challenges for the long term viability and scalability of such aquaculture in the U.S. and internationally. There is a recognized need for alternative feed formulations (those including agricultural oils and proteins, such as soybean meal, soy protein concentrate, wheat and corn gluten, canola, poultry and other animal processing by-products, microalgae, etc.), but these top-end predators are often highly averse to eating conventional hard, extruded pellets; and, in aquaculture, are often fed a diet of  trash fish  bycatch or whole fresh/frozen forage fisheries products such as sardines or pilchards. Continued reliance on these limited, price-volatile, wild-caught  wet fish  resources present a critical constraint to the sustainable expansion of high-end marine aquaculture and its ability to produce healthy, efficiently grown, desirable fish for a growing and increasingly prosperous global population. Kampachi Farms has sought to resolve this issue by adapting the USDA-developed  Formulated Sardine  - a fibrous, high-moisture, soft extruded strip of formulated feed which more closely mimics the texture of natural fish - to high-end marine fish such as groupers and tunas. By switching to a formulated diet, sustainable, scalable agricultural oils and proteins can be incorporated into the diets of these high-value fish, rendering their expanded commercial production both more economically attractive to investors, and more environmentally sound.Phase I research thoroughly demonstrated the feasibility of this concept by conducting palatability and grow-out trials to determine if Formulated Sardines would be accepted by high-value marine carnivores and generate acceptable growth rates attractive to commercial culture. Several experimental formulations of Formulated Sardines were developed and manufactured by USDA ARS fish nutritionist Dr. Frederic Barrows, including the early deployment of a 100% fishmeal-free blend, which became the focus of grow-out trials during this study. All experimental diets were formulated to be nutritionally suitable for the two species tested: the relatively sedentary Giant Grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) and the more active kampachi (Seriola rivoliana). Growth, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and feed waste metrics were compared between populations of both species fed wet fish diets, pelleted diets and Formulated Sardines. The results of these trials were promising, with Formulated Sardines accepted by both grouper and yellowtail at comparable rates to their standard feeds, producing no significant differences in growth performance or FCR. The fact that these results were attained with a 0% fishmeal formulation, months to years ahead of when that development was expected, only underscores the Formulated Sardine feed format&#39;s potential for commercial utility in the culture of high-value marine finfish such as grouper and tuna. The apparent palatability of these diets in Grouper and Yellowtail studies also suggests several additional areas across the hatchery production cycles of these species where Formulated Sardine-type diets could provide significant advantages over traditional feeds.Kampachi Farms therefore proposes, through this Phase II research, to bring this novel aquafeed format closer to commercial viability by expanding into trials with Pacific Bluefin and Yellowfin Tunas, assessing its efficacy in specialty formulated broodstock diets, and determining the effectiveness of a derivative soft  crumble  product in accelerating weaning of highly prey-selective, difficult-to-rear marine finfish larvae onto formulated feeds.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1415,"Texas ranks first in number of farms and third in total agricultural production in the U.S. However, the state lags behind in organic crop production. The low rate of adoption of organic farming for grain crops such as corn and sorghum has been a major bottleneck for expansion of the organic livestock sector in this state. The specific goals of this study are based on our interactions with farmers and other stakeholders in the region. Collectively, these discussions have shaped the goals and objectives of the project. Our goals are: (1) Conduct research and on-farm demonstrations in a partnership between scientists and stakeholders for greater understanding of the influence of tillage and cover cropping on greenhouse gas emissions, weed dynamics, water-yield relations, and soil health, (2) Develop best management practices that optimize both agricultural profitability and ecosystem services in transitioning cropping systems (corn, grain sorghum, and soybeans), (3) Determine the current level of cognitive understanding and related beliefs, attitudes, and opinions on transitioning to organic systems and create a model for educational and outreach activities, and (4) Develop an educational and outreach program for efficient transfer of project results to the various stakeholders and organize training efforts on the certification process, farm plan development, environmental benefits, and best management strategies while transitioning to organic production.

1416,"Demand for organic feed exceeds supply, resulting in the need to facilitate production while maintaining environmental quality, beneficial processes and natural cycles. Overwintering cover crops in annual crop rotations promote soil conservation and natural enemies of pests, but little is known about cover crop effects on an often over-looked natural enemy - insect pathogens. We are investigating the effects of cover crops and soil characteristics on the novel interactions among the fungus, Metarhizium, an endemic disease-causing organisms of insects and plant-protective plant-associate, with crops and cover crops in an organic corn-soybean-wheat cropping system. Our objectives include: 1) characterize Metarhizium isolates from on-going organic research-station and on-farm experiments; 2) determine the ability of naturally-occuring isolates to form a relationships with cash crops and selected cover crops; 3) determine effects of Metarhizium infection of plants in a model system of corn, Zea mays, black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon; and Cochliobolus heterostrophus, the causal agent of southern corn leaf blight; and 4) determine the effect of plant-associated Metarhizium on the expression of key defense genes that protect plants from crop pests and diseases. Information from this research will be incorporated into evaluated Extension materials and activities to strengthen the capacity of Extension and other agricultural professionals to serve organic growers, and into undergraduate curricula.

Product taste, quality and appearance, b. Environmental responses and tolerances, d. Pest and disease management, including resistance to pests and disease resulting in reduced application management strategies. We will investigate the feasibility of R gene pyramiding for durable resistance.2. Identify and address threats from pests and diseases (20%). The proposed work includes the use of molecular markers to investigate genetic diversity among isolates of Anisogramma anomala, the causal fungus of eastern filbert blight (EFB). We will also collect Corylus germplasm, evaluate accessions for response to EFB inoculation, and study the inheritance of resistance from our native Corylus americana.Note that production is the primary system, although components address the consumer and markets system (human nutrition and health, vitality of rural communities).Critical stakeholder needs addressed and long-term goals. Hazelnuts are a profitable, high-value, low input, sustainable crop for which steadily increasing world demand now exceeds supply and stakeholders (from producers through consumers) show a significant desire for expanded US production. However, susceptibility to eastern filbert blight (EFB) caused by the fungus Anisogramma anomala and the limited climatic adaptation of existing cultivars severely limit production in the eastern and Midwestern regions and threaten the sustainability of current production in Oregon. The genetic resources and knowledge to overcome these limiting factors now exist. This SREP  Center of Excellence  project leverages substantial resources and prior investments to develop genomic tools for hazelnut (Approach 1), study gene expression following EFB inoculation (Approach 2), map dominant R genes and study R gene Genomic tools, genetic resources, and outreach to expand commercial U.S. hazelnut production - 7 pyramids and resistance in Corylus americana (Approach 3), enhance Corylus americana germplasm collections (Approach 4), improve knowledge of the pathogen A. anomala (Approach 5), identify superior cultivars and pollenizers (Approach 6), and bolster and implement strategic, coordinated outreach efforts (Approach 7) to address these limiting factors in a targeted, effective, and comprehensive way with longterm goals that include: a) the expanded planting of hazelnut as a food crop, b) the development of new economic options for producers and entrepreneurs, and c) the improvement of national food security by enhancing crop, farm system, and product diversity, adaptation to climatic fluctuations, and improved disease resistance.Outreach plan. Our outreach plan (Approach 7, pg. 27) will directly engage new and existing stakeholder groups and address stakeholder concerns and needs that are related but vary across three climatic zones: the Pacific Northwest where commercial production now exists and is rapidly expanding; the temperate  Fruit Belt  region of the eastern US, where new EFB-resistant cultivars are expected to be released in 3-4 years; and the Midwest and Great Plains, where new hybrids are in the process of being identified with superior nut quality, yield, and adaptation to demanding climates. We will use comprehensive, coordinated, and innovative high-touch, high-tech outreach approaches for education and training activities in the three regions bolstered by demonstration trials and new cooperator field trials, including field tours and  edutainment  events, social media campaigns, stakeholder trainings, and webinars, with publications and presentations focused on the translation of new knowledge and practical applications to engage new and existing local, regional, and national partner stakeholder groups. The Oregon industry has many newcomers who need educational programs. In the Fruit Belt, an emphasis will be placed on  train-the-trainer  meetings early in the project to rapidly disseminate knowledge in support of the first cultivar releases for the region (to be made during this grant period). Targeted, comprehensive, and coordinated national outreach efforts will also be made through the PI institution&#39;s web resources and social media, including the Arbor Day Foundation&#39;s extensive national membership and related partner connections via their educational website devoted to hybrid hazelnuts and a print newsletter that reaches one million people per year, and a hybrid hazelnut membership program with 80,000 members.Potential economic, social, and environmental benefits. Extensive and strong national/international markets (currently $3.26 billion) exist for hazelnut products and powerful environmental and economic benefits (for producers and rural communities) would be generated by large-scale production of hybrid hazelnuts in the US. Hazelnuts are an ideal choice to integrate into profitable, sustainable agricultural or agroforestry production systems, and are family-friendly for small producers focused on local food issues. Hazelnuts could become a  third crop  in the Midwest and Great Plains (along with corn and soybeans), and have considerable value as a specialty crop in eastern states (Fruit Belt region). Environmental benefits of hazelnut production include reduced runoff and soil erosion, enhanced water quality, relatively few inputs of fertilizers and pesticides, improved wildlife habitats, and increased carbon sequestration - impacts that benefit farm families and residents of both rural and urban communities. Further, they can be grown without irrigation in many regions and do not require bees for pollination. Hazelnut kernels are widely recognized for their health promoting effects, have a long storage life, and have robust local-to-international markets for a variety of value-added products. The economic potential of hazelnut is documented by Oregon&#39;s annual acreage increase (3,000 acres since 2009), world annual production (870,000 metric tons/year), the wholesale price/pound of dry, unshelled nuts ($1.70) and the world annual hazelnut revenue ($3.26 billion). Across the central states, many producers looking to diversify their operations beyond corn and soybeans have shown intense interest in hazelnuts. Ten-year average yields of superior selections grown in field trials in NE indicate that net returns from hybrid hazelnuts will likely compete very well with or exceed returns from agronomic crops.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1418,"U.S. soybean production (US$34.5 billion production value) is threatened by various insect and disease pests. Effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs for these pests depends largely on scouting to guide decision making on application of management tactics. However, costs associated with traditional pest scouting can be a deterent to implementation of IPM, and result in increased economic, environmental and human-health costs. To increase the efficiency of scouting, and consequently the adoption of IPM, we propose research to develop  remote scouting  for soybean pests by utilizing spectral sensors deployed on UAS to assess and distinguish pest infestations in soybean fields. In particular, our research will focus on three important pests (soybean aphid, brown stem rot and sudden death syndrome) of soybean production in the north central U.S. We propose a two-year, multistate project to develop and validate models for assessing and distinguising infestetations by these pests using UAS-based spectral reflectance data and compare the precision and cost of remote scouting to traditional ground-based scouting for soybean pests.

1419,"High throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP), the use of holistic and large-scale approaches to collect plant phenotypic information, bears the promise to spark a new green revolution. It will be an important part of the solution to the global food security challenge by 2050 when the world population is likely to exceed 9.7 billion. As the current state of the art in HTPP, digital imaging greatly enhances our ability to capture plant phenotypes. However, the disadvantage of digital imaging is also obvious. Phenotypes are measured in terms of image pixel count or pixel intensity. These image data, by themselves, convey little information of biological relevance. To maximize the utility of the image data, they have to be analyzed and interpreted jointly with manually measured plant physiological or chemical traits, which are still slow and expensive to collect. The overall goal of this project is to develop next generation plant phenotyping robots to enable autonomous and in vivo (and human-like) plant physiological and chemical trait measurements. The phenotyping robots will greatly improve the throughput and capacity, and at the same time substantially reduce the cost of plant phenotyping.The overall goal of the plant phenotyping robot will be realized with three research thrusts. Firstly, novel robotic grippers that integrate specialized plant sensors will be designed and developed. Two specific plant sensors being considered are (i) a Y-shape bifurcating fiber optics sensing head for a variety of optically sensed plant physiological and chemical traits, and (ii) a leaf porometer for stomatal conductance measurement. Secondly, a novel robotic vision system that combines a RGB camera and a Time-of-Flight 3D depth camera will be constructed. Novel Image processing algorithms will be developed for plant leaf segmentation and localization. The algorithm will also rank the most suitable plant leaves for automated sensing, and calculate the approaching vector of the robotic gripper for successful leaf grasping and sensing. Thirdly, the developed plant phenotyping robot will be tested in the high throughput imaging greenhouse at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Different corn and soybean lines with known susceptibility to water and nutrient stresses will be used to demonstrate and validate the throughput, accuracy and capacity of the phenotyping robot.The plant phenotyping robots will be a critical enabling technology to advance the science of plant phenomics and allow better genomics - phenomics analysis for trait discovery and crop improvement, which is an indispensable part of the overall solution to the long term food and energy security problems facing our society.This project will create an interdisciplinary environment where the graduate and undergrad students will receive training in both plant science and engineering robotics. The undergrads will be employed to work on the project through BSE-PIE, a program initiated by the team to attract students with engineering background to conduct research on plant phenotyping. Using the material from this project, the PIs will develop new course modules to expose students to this new frontier of automated plant phenotyping.

1422,"Rice is life--a staple food for more than half of humanity. Globally, rice production must increase in accordance with the population growth of developing nations to ensure food security for nine billion people by 2050 in the face of increasing extreme weather events, including heavy precipitation. Flooding is a frequent natural disaster, in 2015 alone, crop damage from floods amounted to over $471 million in the U.S. While the loss in rice production due to flash flooding alone exceeds $1 billion each year in Asia. Furthermore, there is evidence of an association between weather variables, including rainfall and repeated floods, and poor child health and development due to malnutrition at the household level. Deploying high-yielding submergence tolerant rice is one of the best measures to mitigate flooding impacts. The prior identification of Sub1 (SUB1A), a single gene that improves the tolerance of rice to submergence has benefited millions of farmers. Sub1 confers tolerance to submergence via a quiescence strategy, where the plant limits growth under submergence to conserve energy which helps the plant regrow after de-submergence. Varieties bred to possess Sub1 now provide significant yield preservation in farmers&#39; fields when flooding occurs during the vegetative stage. However, areas with repeated, severe and prolonged flooding require varieties that have higher levels of submergence tolerance. This project seeks new tolerance genes that are complementary to SUB1 to further increase yields in flood-prone areas. A second major quantitative trait locus that has the potential to enhance submergence tolerance, qSUB8.1, has been identified from a genetic mapping population that already posseses SUB1. We propose to identify the key gene(s) of qSUB8.1 and investigate how its works to provide submergence tolerance in conjunction with SUB1A. The major outcome will be knowledge of functional gene(s) that improve the survival of rice of a serious flood. This will aid improvement of flooding survival strategies to flood-sensitive crops including maize and soybean.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1423,"Higher growing season temperatures associated with global climate change will challenge future agricultural production. Multiple physiological or metabolic mechanisms are involved in crop responses to high temperature. Parsing different mechanisms through experiments and then incorporating them into process-based models will allow better predictions of the future impact of rising temperatures on agricultural production and will identify promising targets for adaptation. In this project, we aim to quantify mechanisms of high temperature impacts on soybean yield at the whole plant level, combining the temperature free-air controlled enhancement (T-FACE) experiment and a newly developed crop modeling framework (CLM-APSIM). We consider the following major processes: (1) direct temperature effects on photosynthesis and respiration; (2) acceleration of the crop growth rate and shortening of the growing season; (3) direct heat stress effects on reproductive stages, including number of flowers and pods produced and aborted; and (4) high-temperature induced increase of atmospheric water demands. Infrared heating arrays will be used to heat three soybean varieties (maturity groups II, III, IV) representing the major groups planted across the Midwest for two growing seasons, and multiple physiological and biochemical measurements will be taken simultaneously. We will then use the experiment results to improve and calibrate the CLM-APSIM model at the site level. Using the calibrated model, we will attribute the historical yield loss due to increase temperature to different physiological mechanisms. Finally, we will use CLM-APSIM to project crop yield for the whole Corn Belt under the various climate scenarios, and quantify the contribution of each mechanism. The team includes plant physiologists and a crop modeler, with rich experience in the proposed experiments and modeling.

1424,"High grain yields are typically associated with high profit margins, however, abiotic environmental stress and biotic stress from disease, insect and weeds often reduce yields. This challenge lends itself to investigations of alternative cropping systems that are more resilient to stress and create diverse outputs that could optimize profit margins. In light of this, many farmers have interest to incorporate cover cropping into their cropping system for the various agronomic and potential economic benefits, but one of the primary challenges of cover crop integration is timely establishment. Using soybean and cereal rye/oat as a model, we propose a novel cropping system that could optimize the agronomic and economic benefits of a corn/soybean rotation with cover cropping. To optimize our proposed cropping system, we will test the yield potential of four soybean maturity groups and four varieties within each maturity group. As each maturity group reaches harvest maturity, a mixture of cereal rye and oat will be planted. Our hypothesis is that soybean yield trade-offs from shorter-season maturity groups could be offset by the increased cover crop/forage production providing an agronomic and benefit to the entire cropping system. Research objectives include: Objective 1: Identify differences in soybean yield potential across maturity group cultivars for different environments in the North-Central Midwest and Northern Midsouth; Objective 2: Characterize impacts of an integrated soybean/cover crop system on weed management, forage production, soybean seedling pathogens, soybean cyst nematode, and arthropod interactions; Objective 3: Determine the role of beneficial/antagonistic microbial communities impact on soil health, yield, and disease through metagenomics analysis; Objective 4: Substantiate economic efficiency of integrating cover crops into different soybean maturity groups. Research will be conducted over two years at seven unique sites across Nebraska (4 sites), Ohio (2 sites), and Kentucky (1 site). Our proposed research directly addresses two of the USDA AFRI Foundational Knowledge of Agricultural Production System program priorities. First, by incorporating multiple management components such as soybean maturity group selection and cover cropping we intend to enhance plant (cropping system) resilience to resistant weeds, nematodes, soil-borne pathogens, and arthropods. Further, we will investigate how this influences productivity through economic analysis and cropping system modeling. Second, proposed research will investigate how changes to production system management or optimizing soybean maturity groups with cover cropping will influence soil microbial communities impacting soil health through metagenomics analysis.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1425,"Major agricultural production systems lack crop diversity and organic amendments. Sustainability of low diversity systems is threatened by lower yields, increased weed and disease pressure, poorer soil health and detrimental environmental impacts. Cropping systems utilizing extended rotations and organic amendments can reduce threats from pests and crop diseases. However, an understanding of the key factors and mechanisms that drive these benefits is critically lacking. The long-term goal of this project is to generate a comprehensive, systems-level understanding of how specific agricultural practices can yield environmentally and economically sustainable agricultural benefits. Our research will be based on a long-term, field experiment where acorn-soybean system with increased crop diversity andorganic amendments has been shown to increase crop productivity, improve soil health, and suppress an importantdisease, soybeansudden death syndrome. We will utilize a novel combination of molecular analyses, in-field measurements, and bioassays, to assess how oats and manure amendments influence the soil and plant microbial communities, pathogen density, and disease suppression. We will compare soil and root microbial communities and soil physical-chemical properties among the different cropping systems and analyze their contribution to the beneficial effects of the different cropping systems. In addition, we will conduct smaller scale experiments to isolate the effects of oat crops and composted manure amendments on the changes observed. We will also conduct an economic analysis to compare the profitability of the diversified systems with the conventional system used in combination with a seed treatment. Upon completion of our project we will have: i) identified the shifts in microbial communities associated with disease suppression and overall crop health; ii) advanced understanding of the key crop management components that contribute to enhanced crop productivity and increased crop resilience to disease, and iii) furthered understanding of the economic sustainability of this cropping system approach.

1426,"Legumes (e.g., peas, soybean) are an agriculturally and ecologically important plant group. They are different from the majority of plant species because they have beneficial associations with a particular type of bacteria in their roots. These bacteria (from the genus Rhizobium) are capable of converting atmospheric nitrogen to a form that plants can use through a process called nitrogen fixation. When the plants die, some of this additional nitrogen is returned to the soil leading to higher soil fertility. Farmers have known this for years: they rotate nitrogen-fixing and non-fixing species in their fields to improve crop and fiber production. However, the ability to access additional nitrogen through these bacteria has a cost. Plants give the bacteria sugar in exchange for this nitrogen. Some legume species (facultative fixers) have the ability to terminate the bacterial colonies when they are growing in fertile soil, which allows the plant to use that sugar for other functions like growth and reproduction. Some legume species (obligate fixers) cannot adjust the relationship with their bacterial partners and this may have wide-reaching effects on leaf and root physiology. This project will identify legume species with facultative and obligate fixation strategies and examine how fixation strategy relates to a number of leaf and root physiological processes. Facultative fixers, by optimally regulating fixation to match nutritional demand, should align more with current models of leaf economics and plant carbon gain than obligate fixers and have higher performance under conditions of high soil fertility. Twenty-four legume species will be grown in a greenhouse setting and a suite of leaf, root, and plant-level traits will be measured. Obligate fixers should have lower rates of photosynthesis and growth and higher root respiratory costs. Understanding how nitrogen fixation strategies influence plant performance has strong implications for agriculture and agroforestry by paving the way for genetic improvements to maximize productivity by improving the efficiency of nitrogen use by legumes.

1427,"Soybean has been traditionally used for making nutritious foods in East Asia for thousands of years. World food-grade soybean market is growing rapidly. It has been estimated about 7-10% of US soybean are used for food making. The market growth presents an opportunity for soybean farmers due to a higher premium, and necessitates the breeding and production of high-quality specialty soybean that possess high protein content and unique protein composition to compete in the international market. In addition to being a major ingredient for making delicious foods, soybeans provide cheap sources of high-quality dietary protein and oil. Soy is a healthy food since its isoflavones can reduce postmenopausal syndromes, heart diseases and cancers. Worldwide, there is a need for increasing protein to reduce protein under-nutrition. There is a strong need to continue to search for soybean varieties with quality improvement to enhance food, nutritional and health characteristics. The A3 peptide, which is present in the major storage protein, has been proven to be quantitatively related the firmness of tofu products in our laboratory.

Although the infeed materials can be pasteurized prior to spray drying, pathogens, such as Salmonella, can survive, establish niches, grow, and eventually contaminate the food product. Nevertheless, this complex process has been significantly under-researched about how to reduce the biological hazards. Prior studies have shown the evidence of microbial cross-contamination into spray dried powders as recent massive recalls (in 2016) of milk powders tainted withSalmonellaclearly shows the importance and necessityof this type of study. The proposed project will be the first attempt to combine the physics, engineering, and microbiology to reduce biological hazards in spray dried powders byassessing the entire spray drying process holistically. Overall, the integrated process model can be utilized by food manufacturers to ensure the microbial safety of their products via validating, verifying, and predicting the microbial risks associated with spray drying technology.

1429,"Managing water for agriculture under future climate conditions will require adaptation measures in order to maintain or increase existing productivity. In regions such as the U.S. Corn Belt, where precipitation has historically been well distributed through the growing season, an increase in rainfall intensity will lead to less infiltration and more runoff, while summer droughts will intensify crop water. This increased volatility of precipitation is expected to negatively impact corn and soybean yields.Climate change adaptation technology that increases water storage in the agricultural landscape can increase resiliency to both water excess and water scarcity. Drainage water recycling (DWR), in which runoff and drainage water are stored in ponds during the non-growing season and irrigated back onto crops in the summer when crop water use is high, is a capital-intensive yet effective practice that would increase resiliency of agriculture to climate change. It would improve agricultural water use by reducing groundwater withdrawals for irrigation while simultaneously reducing nutrient losses to downstream waters. However, only a small portion of farmers have adopted this practice.One barrier to adoption of climate change adaptation technology like DWR may be the belief held by 59% of farmers that climate change is not occurring or it is primarily a natural cycle that they have little control over, or the belief held by 89% of farmers that there is too much uncertainty about the impacts of climate change to justify changing their agricultural practices (Morton et al., in review).A second possible barrier is that farmers do not yet know what climate change adaptation technology options are available or effective. To address this potential barrier due to lack of knowledge, USDA NIFA has funded numerous research and extension projects over the last six years to develop and disseminate knowledge on effective climate change adaptation. Three coordinated agricultural projects that have received more than $60 million to focus on agriculture and climate change, and dozens of smaller projects that have created extensive extension networks for disseminating adaptation strategies. The Transforming Drainage project is working to advance DWR and similar water storage technologies. Yet despite this substantial public investment in increasing knowledge of adaptation technologies, adoption remains low.A third possible barrier applies to farmers who do believe that climate change is real, that it will affect their future crop yields, and that effective adaptation technologies are available. These farmers may calculate subsidized crop insurance is a more economical risk management strategy that adoption of climate change adaptation technologies like DWR, and therefore decide not to adopt. This project focuses on this third barrier, and will investigate the substitution potential of subsidized crop insurance and the climate change adaptation technology of DWR in order to better understand decisions and behavior connected to agricultural water use. We propose a first attempt to unravel the intermingling of producer decisions related to mitigating the potential downside risks of climate change through a water storage and use technology like drainage water recycling. DWR and crop insurance are potential substitutes, and government incentives directed toward adoption of one will act as a disincentive to the other. Our project will determine the degree of the substitution effect for DWR as an example of an effective, but capital-intensive, climate change adaptation technology.Determining this substitution effect will involve linking sociological, economic, and technical understanding of producers&#39; underlying attitudes and decision processes to their adoption response. Technical and associated sunk costs of DWR implementation will be identified in conjunction with the current requirements for participating in crop insurance. Producers&#39; decision process and behavior related to drainage water recycling and crop insurance will be determined from survey responses. We will supplement this behavior determination with an economic feasibility of DWR considering producers with and without crop insurance. In a real options framework, the increase in the option value will be determined for producers with crop insurance. The magnitude of this option value change determines the degree of the drainage water recycling/insurance substitution effect. Possible government mechanisms for reducing the retarding effect of crop insurance on DWR adoption will then be considered, which may take the form of reduced crop-insurance subsidies for producers who choose not to adopt, or modifications to subsidies for adoption. Such government mechanisms will be developed in the light of producers&#39; attitudes toward DWR and crop insurance elicited from survey responses and the impact these mechanisms have on the option value to adopt DWR with and without crop insurance.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Local, state, and national response mechanisms are in place toquickly respond to these situations and help mitigate unforeseen consequences while protectingpublic and environmental health. Unfortunately, response assets at every level can quickly becomeoverwhelmed and may require surge or redundant capacity. The Food and Drug Administration FoodEmergency Response Network (FDA FERN) is one system in place that is comprised of both federaland state laboratories that bring personnel, supplies, equipment, and expertise together to enablefood and food product analyses during these situations. Many laboratories are volunteer laboratories,but 14 member laboratories have entered cooperative agreements for chemistry analysis and arenow referred to as FERN cCAP Laboratories. The Arkansas Department of Health-Arkansas PublicHealth Laboratory (ADH-PHL) became a FERN cCAP Laboratory in 2009 and has built a strongfoundation for food chemical analyses, method development, and emergency response.ADH-PHL provides a state-of-the-art laboratory environment for maintaining the Arkansas FERNChemistry Laboratory. Dedicated laboratory space, technical expertise, quality management systems,ISO 17025 accreditation as well as additional support staff, instrumentation, and space are availableif necessary. The entire laboratory staff has experience in the four key project areas of GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, and ELISA. ADH-PHL also partners with other federal response networks managed bythe Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency where ADH-PHL hasexercised and utilized the Incident Command Center within the state as well as nationally. Thisknowledge is crucial for mitigating large scale crises where food safety and human health isendangered.The Arkansas FERN Chemistry Laboratory continues to work to expand and enhance the capabilitiesof FERN by working closely with other cCAP laboratories and FDA. The laboratory is fully staffed,continues to cross-train, and validates FERN testing methods on GC-MS, LC-MS, ICP-MS, andELISA platforms. The laboratory continues to participate in all proficiency tests provided by FDA andhas exercised its response capabilities by developing new methods to successfully participate inthese proficiency tests. The laboratory participates in all technical and programmatic meetings, whichincludes conference calls. Currently, FERN analysts are actively involved in two, large, multi-laboratory method validations.

1431,"AbstractParenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) is a significant complication of prolonged parenteralnutrition. An estimated 50,000 infants are at risk to develop PNAC each year in the United States. Thedisease is particularly common in premature infants and those who undergo major gastrointestinal operationsin the neonatal period. PNAC is associated with a 50% risk of sepsis and a mortality rate as high as 20% to30%. Studies have shown that soybean-based fat emulsions have a direct causative effect on thedevelopment of cholestasis and its progression to liver failure but this product remains the only FDA-approvedintravenous lipid available in the United States. Given these two factors, several strategies have beenundertaken to minimize the deleterious effects of soybean-based fat emulsions on the liver. One promisingapproach is the administration of a lower dose of the IV fat emulsion as both a treatment and preventativeapproach for PNAC. While IV fat emulsion dose reduction appears to offer substantial benefit in the treatmentand prevention of PNAC in infants in small, retrospective evaluations, data from well-controlled clinical studiesare not available. Several questions regarding IV fat emulsion dose reduction remain. Specifically, the timingof dose reduction and the optimal dose have not been elucidated. The overall long-term safety of thesestrategies in this population remain unknown particularly as they relate to neurodevelopmental outcomes.Limiting the dose of IV fat emulsion may have a negative effect on essential fatty acid levels which in turn mayaffect neurologic and behavioral development as essential fatty acids are crucial during brain development inthe neonatal period. Little data exist regarding the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonatestreated with IV fat emulsion dose reduction.This study will evaluate the hypothesis that a lower dose of IV fat emulsion will prevent and/or reducethe severity of PNAC when compared to a standard dose of IV fat emulsion without having negativeeffects on growth or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Study subjects will include surgical neonates who willbe dependent on parenteral nutrition for a prolonged period of time. Subjects will be enrolled in a prospective,randomized multi-center trial comparing IV fat emulsion given at a standard (3 g/kg/day) or reduced (1g/kg/day) dose.

1433,"To keep pace with the demands of a growing global population, innovations are needed to meet the unprecedented challenge of producing more food in intensively cultivated regions with less energy and lower environmental impacts. In this project, researchers from the biophysical, socioeconomic, and computational sciences investigate two types of innovations using data from the northern U.S. Corn Belt. First, a novel oilseed crop, winter camelina, is being studied for its potential incorporation into existing corn-soybean rotations to produce a new supply of biodiesel energy while lowering water resource impacts and creating positive ecological benefits. Second, emerging systems of sustainability certification are being studied for their potential to lead to broad-scale adoption of this new cropping system. Detailed computational models are being evaluated and applied for systems-level assessments of two innovations: developing novel approaches to influence beneficial land use, and accounting for energy and environmental impacts within food supply chains. Because of the importance of the project results on the local economy, outreach activities are targeted towards the rural community, policy makers, the general public, and local watershed planners. Although this project focuses on the Northern Corn Belt, the approaches used in the research could be adopted to achieve beneficial outcomes for food, energy, and water systems elsewhere. This research project I scomprised of four overlapping and interdependent research teams. The biophysical research team conducts cropping systems studies of corn-soybean in rotation with winter camelina at two Minnesota research stations. Experimental treatments vary by winter timing of planting and harvest and fertilization rates. Meteorological data along with soil, water, and crops data is being collected to develop management strategies for producers and to calibrate and evaluate the crop models that will be used. The socioeconomic research team collects data from surveys and randomized control trials to study the forces determining whether, and by whom, new cropping systems are likely to be adopted under different policy and market conditions. Of particular interest is the role of incentives from certification programs, including the feedback effects of using producer data for peer benchmarking. The data science team applies novel deep learning computational approaches to identify crops, including winter cover crops, from satellite imagery. Study plots for the biophysical plots provides training data for crop identification and the final statewide datasets are being incorporated in the socioeconomic analysis.

1434,"Phosphorus is an element that, along with nitrogen and potassium, has enabled large increases in food production in the U.S. and globally. Phosphorus is mined from natural deposits, but these deposits are diminishing. Contemporary reports indicate that there is a pending phosphorus crisis, as global supplies dwindle and demand for food increases. Currently, the utilization of phosphorus for fertilizer is energy intensive and expensive. Phosphorus supply is limited, and its recovery from food and other wastes and water bodies is virtually non-existent. Traditionally, agricultural production has been optimized with little or no consideration of the losses of phosphorus beyond its use in producing crops. This practice leads to large energy needs for fertilizer production and for treatment of phosphorus waste in agricultural run-off, and food and animal wastes. The other side to this problem is that some phosphorus applied to agricultural fields is lost to lakes and rivers causing considerable environmental damage. These phosphorus issues significantly influence our food, energy, and water (FEW) systems. Two key approaches to achieve sustainable phosphorus management are agriculture fertilization systems that more efficiently use phosphorous for plant growth and systems that recover phosphorus from food and animal wastes and from biowastes in contaminated water. Unfortunately, we do not have suitable recovery systems due to technological limitations and economic and infrastructure constraints. This project aims to develop an integrated and sustainable management structure that can simultaneously address the major technical challenges in biowaste management and agriculture fertilization systems. This management structure will enable recovery of phosphorous, energy, and water, thus increasing resource use efficiency and providing a new source of phosphorus for agricultural food production. This project integrates novel technologies in multiple fields, including hydrothermal treatment, anaerobic digestion, membrane distillation, struvite production, and magnetic nanoparticle separation to collect and recycle more phosphorous as struvite. The various systems are being analyzed and optimized to fit a number of waste-stream settings in order to reduce overall energy input. This approach offers many benefits such as reduced waste volume, decontamination of pathogens, as well as the production of clean water, energy, and slow release fertilizers. The method is also sufficiently flexible to accommodate different biowaste feedstocks and tunable to produce different recycled nutrient, energy, and water products, sustainable with low resource and energy input, and scalable to suit different levels of management needs. This system is being developed and tested at bench scale, up-scaled to prototype level, and optimized through systems modeling. Crop utilization efficiency and soil retention of the produced struvite fertilizers are being evaluated by growing corn, soybean, and wheat in both potted greenhouse experiments and in field trials. In order to identify the costs and benefits of these combined waste and fertilization management techniques, the researchers are performing a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the phosphorous removed from the various waste streams and recycled for agricultural applications.  This analysis includes an evaluation of the phosphorous recovery and recycling efficiency, examination of the overall energy balance of the systems, a cost estimation of the systems, and an environmental assessment of the system. The project is combining student and postdoctoral researcher training with undergraduate education and promoting STEM research in underrepresented groups and K-12 education on integrated approaches to promote sustainable communities.

1435,"The lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) - the part of the atmosphere extending ~300 m from Earth's surface - undergoes rapid transitions with nocturnal cooling, resulting in rapidly evolving temporal and spatial properties of coherent eddies. Using a unique and highly instrumented observation region, this project will observe these variations (eddies) in detail. One set of in-situ and remote sensing instruments will be sited inside a 200-turbine wind farm (forced turbulence) and another set ~22 km away in a matched landscape of natural turbulence. The research team will build on prior modeling and measurement experience to produce new understanding of the boundary layer by comparing forced and natural turbulence.Intellectual Merit:The innovativeness of this study derives from the fact that turbulence generated by turbines or other landscape structures has a distinctly different spectral signature and subsequent distinct influence on atmospheric exchange processes than do natural landscapes, such as fields of corn/soybean. Coherent eddies, known to be the central feature of the ABL, are not represented correctly by Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST). The high-resolution in situ measurements will provide a physical alternativeto MOST for stable conditions, which in turn will improve the skill of weather forecasts and simulations, particularly under stably stratified conditions. The project has three objectives: Objective 1. Characterize anisotropic and large coherent turbulence eddies (natural and forced) by use of a high-resolution near-surface turbulence-measurement tower, strategically placed two tall towers, and a sodar. How are they initiated during and after the early evening transition (EET)? What are the contributing factors to energy conservation as the ABL evolves under stably stratified conditions? Objective 2. Employ multi-resolution decomposition (MRD) and wavelet transform methods to identify events of coherent structures that show minimal low frequency (e.g., mesoscale) compared to high frequency (local turbulence) influences on turbulent covariances. How can these methods help refine descriptions of surface fluxes driven purely by local turbulence from those influenced by uniquely forced (turbines) or mesoscale (e.g., gravity waves, surface heterogeneities, and terrain) influences? Objective 3. Combine measurements and analyses of Objectives 1 and 2, together with mesoscale and LES simulations with WRF and other models, to develop new understanding of coherent eddy evolution and the role of turbulent potential energy (TPE) near the surface in response to radiative changes in the EET of the ABL. What is the model sensitivity to the relative magnitudes of TKE and TPE under various levels of stratification? What principles should guide the choice of coherent eddy length scales for simulating flow in stable stratification?Broader Impacts:1) Improved Scientific Understanding from this research will have broad scientific, societal and economic ramifications.

1438,"During the last 20 years Brazil became a major producer and exporter of soybeans and corn mainly by expanding cropping into its Amazon rainforest and savanna woodlands. Brazil is now second only to the United States and its goal is to double agricultural production to meet increasing global demands. This project investigates how water and energy may be affected by, and potentially limit, further agricultural intensification. The project will consist of three main parts. The first part will be farm-scale field experiments to evaluate how more intensive crop management influences emissions of greenhouse gases from soils, water quality and habitats in streams, and demands for energy. The second part will investigate how the distributions of crops within this agricultural frontier region respond to farm management decisions, government policies, global greenhouse gas concentrations, and climate. The final part will use computer models to investigate the potential responses of the food production system, the water cycle, and energy use and demand to changing climate and different potential pathways of agricultural intensification. This proposal addresses the globally important issue of how to conserve the rich biodiversity of Amazon forests and Cerrado woodlands, maintain a stable climate, and contribute to global food security. It will provide new knowledge about the implications of the intensification of soybeans and other crops for regional climate, the quality of water and stream habitats in tropical watersheds, and energy production. Results will be transmitted to policymakers and producers in Brazil through direct communication with state and federal government agencies; a 10-week immersion Policy Lab in which US and Brazilian graduate students will use science from this project to create policy papers; and direct interactions with a major Brazilian soybean producing company to study crop management options.This project evaluates the tradeoffs inherent in balancing increased food production ? and its associated demands for water, energy, and land ? with the conservation of the Amazon and Cerrado environments of Brazil, the Earth?s largest remaining tropical forests and woodlands. The overarching question is whether this balance can be achieved through rapid and sustained intensification of food production on already cleared lands. Achieving this transition, while avoiding the environmental costs associated with intensive agriculture in other regions, and minimizing vulnerability to a changing climate, is one of the world?s greatest food, water, and energy challenges. This project will develop new understanding of how increased food production will impact and depend upon water, nutrient, and energy. It will advance the development of state-of-the art prognostic computational models of tropical meteorology, ecology, hydrology, and cropping to analyze the impacts of deforestation, agricultural intensification, and increasing greenhouse gasses on mesoscale convection, total and seasonal rainfall, land surface, forest health, and crop production temperature. It will lead to more accurate predictions of the downstream effects of intensive agriculture that will be relevant across tropical South America where the least information is available and greatest agricultural land transformations on Earth now occur. This project will contribute to the development of new fine-scale climate modeling and a tropical crop version of the Community Land Model 5, one of the most widely used land surface models. Data from this project will be made widely available using the cyberinfrastructure built by NSF and other federal agencies for sharing and moving large amounts of data. It will advance understanding of climatic thresholds for tropical crops, the vulnerability of crops to climate extremes, and how those will change in the future as cropping intensifies and expands.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1439,"Soybean is a major crop with the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiosis with soil bacteria. Legumes like soybean annually fix 60 million metric tons of nitrogen, which have a fertilizer replacement value of $7- 10 billion. A long-term goal of N2 fixation research is to transfer the symbiotic ability of legumes to non-legume crops like corn or tomato. However, there are gaps in our understanding of the complex events that occur after the bacteria penetrate the root. These gaps are hindering efforts to engineer nitrogen fixation into non-legumes. Hence, the main objective of this project is to elucidate the initial events that take place during the formation of structures that mediate the movement of bacteria through the root. This project will use high-resolution methods to characterize macromolecular events at a single-cell level. The experimental data will be analyzed with sophisticated modeling tools to improve our understanding of the first events of the legume-bacterial interactions that lead to symbiosis. The knowledge gained will support efforts to transfer the rhizobial symbiosis to non-leguminous plants. In addition to the research mission, the project will create new programs to provide transformative elementary education, as well as training programs for the professional development of middle school and high school teachers. Finally, this project will develop an innovative Sophomore Bioinformatics/Plant Science program to provide integrated training in plant research and bioinformatics.Data integration and system modeling of complex biological processes require detailed, functional genomic data, preferably obtained in a cell-specific way in order to avoid the effects of signal dilution due to the presence of non-responding cells. The long-term goal of this project is to further basic understanding of the agronomically important soybean N2 fixing symbiosis. A unique focus of this project is the ability to sample and analyze the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome at a single-cell resolution. These methods, as well as sophisticated data analysis and modeling tools, will be applied to the intermediate stages of soybean nodulation; specifically, the infection thread progression and bacterial release into nodule cells. These are key events in nodule formation/function that remain largely undefined. The data generated will be used to construct predictive, computational models of the plant response to rhizobial infection thread initiation and growth. The knowledge gained from this research, together with precision breeding techniques, will be instrumental to improving soybean quality and meeting the growing demand for food and fuel expected in the forthcoming years. Moreover, filling in the gaps in our understanding of the rhizobial-legume infection process will be critical to ongoing efforts to transfer this symbiosis to non-leguminous plants (e.g., maize).

1440,"Deforestation has multiple socioenvironmental impacts including land conflict, increasing rural income inequality, biodiversity loss, and hydrological changes.  New conservation policies developed by the private sector are being applied to global supply chains to tackle the challenge of deforestation in the tropics through zero-deforestation commitments.  Yet there is limited knowledge about the impact of these policies or the enabling conditions that may promote their effectiveness.  This project will provide new knowledge on the complex global telecouplings and public-private governance interactions of how zero-deforestation commitments influence land cover change.  The research will enhance our fundamental understanding about the conditions under which zero-deforestation commitments lead to ecosystem conservation.  The research will directly inform public and private environmental policy as well as civil society efforts toward tropical forest conservation. Through open data sharing and archiving, this project will contribute to improving transparency in food supply chains.This research will study the soy, oil palm, and cattle industries in multiple regions globally and analyze how the socioeconomic and agro-ecological variation across these regions differentially influence outcomes associated with zero-deforestation commitments.  The research will investigate four core questions: 1) Are zero-deforestation policies being applied in the most urgent locations of deforestation? 2) How do corporate zero-deforestation policies interact with public policies to influence agricultural profits and inhibit local incentives to deforest? 3) How do differences in timelines and forest definitions in these policies influence land cover outcomes? and 4) To what degree does leakage of land cover change to other regions offset local reductions in deforestation?  To answer these questions the investigators will collect and synthesize a comprehensive dataset of land cover maps, supply chain commitments, sourcing behaviors, trade flows, and producer costs of compliance or noncompliance with supply chain commitments.  A model will be developed to assess the regional land cover outcomes at a high spatial resolution.  Outcomes from this model with be coupled with existing regional models and a global trade model to evaluate impacts of regional commodity-specific commitments on other commodities and biomes.  The broader implications of this research will help establish the conditions under which zero-deforestation commitments are likely to achieve ecosystem conservation, and inform the development of effective policy mixes across the private and public sectors.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1441,"Non-technical descriptionThe viruses in soils, sediments, and water environments infect microbes and impact the ecosystems.  While there is a high-level understanding of viral impacts on ecosystems, the details of the viral-microbe interactions are largely unknown. The ability to predict the biological and ecological features, or phenome, of any particular virus-microbe system based on DNA sequence alone is highly limited. This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII Track-2 FEC) award seeks to advance the ability to predict the phenomic features of the viruses of microbes (VoMs) from genomic data. A collaborative team of researchers from Delaware, Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Hawaii will study viruses that infect marine and freshwater phytoplankton, and viruses that infect a bacterial group that forms a symbiosis with important legume crops, most notably, soybean. Collectively, global phytoplankton populations are responsible for creating vast stores of biomass that support the nutritional needs of larger aquatic organisms. In this process phytoplankton sustain half of the oxygen within the atmosphere.  Enhanced understanding of genome to phenome links within phytoplankton viruses will aid in improving models that predict the impacts of excess carbon and nutrients on ecosystems.  Within the food supply chain, legumes, soybeans in particular, are an extraordinarily important source of plant protein supporting the nutritional needs of billions of people.  Better understanding of genome to phenome connections for viruses infecting bacterial symbionts of legumes could eventually lead to new technologies for improving the productivity of critical agronomic crops such as soybean.  The project team includes faculty, postdocs and students who will engage in collaborative research and share methodologies, best practices, and results through workshops and meetings.  Four early career faculty will be mentored by six other well-established faculty investigators.  The entire project team will prepare educational materials and provide summer camp opportunities for middle and elementary schools students.Technical descriptionThis RII Track-2 FEC award is for a collaborative effort among University of Delaware, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, University of Hawaii, and Roger Williams University.  The planned research seeks to connect genomic features of viruses of microbes (VoMs) with phenotypic life-history traits and use these connections to advance scientific understanding of the role of VoMs in ecosystems.  The project team will test several genome to phoneme hypotheses in VoMs, focusing on phenomic features such as host range, burst size, latent period and infectivity.  An integrated high-throughput approach including emulsion-droplet microfluidic technologies, next generation sequencing, and bioinformatics, will be used to study viral-host systems representative of picophytoplankton, eukaryotic phytoplankton, and diazotrophic bacteria.  The project team will collect samples across environmental gradients from soybean fields, tropical oceans, and lakes, hypothesized to select for different VoM phenomic traits.  The researchers will build a new bioinformatics analysis tool known as the Viral Informatics Rulebook for Genome Organization ? VIRGO and incorporated it into an existing community resource for bioinformatic annotation of viral metagenomes known as the Viral Informatics Resource fOr Metagenome Exploration (VIROME).  Four early-career faculty members engaged in this project will be mentored by successful mid and later career faculty.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Minnesota, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Aaron Lorenz.Efforts to increase soybean yield and quality are challenged by the limited genetic diversity available within each maturity zone.  However, an increase in this diversity could be achieved if genomic methodologies and tools were developed to enable the utilization of elite genetic variation that has previously been isolated by maturity differences.  The broadened available genetic diversity will enable an increase in food production, necessary to sustain the growing world population.  The project training will equip the Fellow with expertise in statistical genomics and quantitative genetics.

1445,"Emulsion-based delivery systems are widely applicable to a range of commercial applications (including pharmaceutical drug delivery, enhanced oil recovery, personal care products, and food processing) because these advanced material systems enable the delivery and controlled release of valuable active compounds. Coalescence (a destabilization process where two liquid droplets merge to form single, larger droplet) is an undesirable limiting factor for implementing these delivery systems within the foregoing commercial applications. Therefore, systematic investigations which improve current understanding of the dynamic processes that lead to droplet coalescence are crucially important. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Patrick Spicer, an Associate Professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia and a noted expert on the production of shaped and targeted droplet delivery systems.The objective of this EAPSI project is to elucidate how nanoparticle-surfactant mixtures adsorbed to oil-water interfaces impact the interfacial rheology and observed coalescence behavior between neighboring oil-in-water droplets. It has been hypothesized that the presence of surfactants in Pickering (particle stabilized) emulsions can significantly modify particle interactions at the oil-water interface and thus improve an emulsion's resistance to coalescence dynamics. This theory will be explored for oil-in-water Pickering emulsions stabilized by silica nanoparticles (~500 nm dia.) and lecithin (one of the most widely used surfactants for the delivery of active compounds). Characterization of the co-adsorption and interfacial rheology of silica nanoparticles and lecithin molecules at the oil-water interface will be studied using pendant drop tensiometry procedures developed at Purdue University.

1446,"Non-technical:Mutually-beneficial interactions between plants and microbes are integral aspects of Earth's ecosystems. These mutualisms are important for stabilizing pristine natural communities, restoring degraded environments, and plant productivity in agricultural systems. Rhizobial bacteria (rhizobia) benefit leguminous host plants (peas, beans, soybean) by fixing atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms, essentially fertilizing their plant hosts. As a result, legumes are high in nitrogen and provide an abundant source of plant-derived protein. Rhizobial strains, however, are diverse in nature and vary quite a bit in partner quality, or the level of benefits they provide to the plant host. This project focuses on a genetic model system (the legume Medicago truncatula and its partner bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti) to investigate the range of partner quality variation and its underlying molecular basis in rhizobia, integrating various approaches including whole-genome DNA sequencing, gene expression, and metabolomics. These techniques provide insight into the genetic determinants and cellular-level metabolism that characterizes highly-beneficial interactions, versus low-quality interactions that are less beneficial for plant hosts. Understanding what determines partner quality at a mechanistic level is critical foundational knowledge that informs efforts to engineer the plant microbiome as part of plant improvement programs and sustainable crop production. Moreover a basic understanding of what determines partner quality is important for understanding how mutualisms evolve through time and how crucial mutualisms persist in current environments. This project provides biological and computational training at the undergraduate and graduate level, provides internships for local community college students, and generates online outreach and analysis tools.Technical:Mutualists in nature vary widely in partner quality, often with important implications for natural and managed systems, yet the molecular basis of mutualist partner quality variation is not well-understood. Recently studies have demonstrated mutualism decline in response to environmental changes, resulting from dis-association of partners, ecological shifts towards less-mutualistic species, or evolutionary decreases in mean partner quality. A predictive understanding of mutualisms is needed to understand their coevolution, persistence, and potential decline. This project will integrate natural genetic variation with physiological and molecular traits into symbiosis networks to uncover the genetic and molecular architecture underlying the mutualism between the rhizobium Ensifer (Sinorhizobium) meliloti and its host plant Medicago truncatula. The central hypothesis is that naturally-occurring variation can be used to better resolve the genetic regulation of plant and rhizobium metabolic pathways that contribute to high-quality symbiosis. This project integrates rhizobium genome-wide nucleotide variation with both rhizobia and host plant phenotypic and molecular traits to address the molecular basis of rhizobium partner quality (how much rhizobia benefit their plant hosts), a trait relevant to both natural and managed ecosystems. Network analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic data will result in comparative models of high and low quality symbiosis, enabling gene-to-trait predictions for the ecologically- and evolutionarily- important symbiosis between leguminous plants and nitrogen-fixing rhizobium bacteria. Hypotheses generated by network analysis will be validated in both rhizobia and host plant systems for physiological and molecular phenotypes underlying important partner quality traits.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1447,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the production of enhanced-nutrition soybeans that have high levels of protein for use in aquafeed. Meat and fish consumption is rapidly growing due to increased world population and affluence. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector. Small wild-caught fish are used for aquaculture feed. Wild-caught fish harvests have not changed in 25 years and overfishing small fish jeopardizes the marine ecosystem. Aquafeed producers are turning to soy-based protein to replace fishmeal but soy-based proteins lack taurine and are deficient in methionine, two important nutrients for fish. To meet fish nutritional requirements, producers supplement soy-based aquafeed with synthetic taurine and methionine. In addition to added costs, synthetic taurine and methionine are produced from hazardous substances, and synthetic taurine has been shown to contain arsenic. Successful development of enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would reduce the amount of supplemental nutrients required in aquafeed, a $2.2B global annual cost predicted for 2020, and could save aquafeed producers 20% of their additive feed costs. Enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would be an economical, healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly and secure source of taurine and methionine for the rapidly growing aquaculture industry.This SBIR Phase II project will use a biotechnology approach to increase the essential nutrients in soybean seeds for use in aquafeed. Many aquafeed producers use plant-based protein, primarily from soybean, as a replacement for fishmeal. However, plants lack some nutrients required for normal fish growth and development. Taurine and methionine, two nutrients either lacking or limited in soybean, are supplemented to soy-based aquafeed, thus increasing feed-production costs. The goal of this project is to increase the levels of taurine and methionine produced in the seeds of a commercial-grade, high-protein soybean variety that has high feed digestibility. Molecular and biochemical methods will be used to identify soybean seeds with: (1) taurine and high methionine levels; (2) uncompromised quality and viability; (3) unaffected levels of other nutrients; (4) normal to higher-than-normal protein content; and (5) low levels of nondigestible compounds. The anticipated results are the production of soybean seeds with a minimum of 0.2% taurine (dry seed weight) and at least 50% more total methionine compared with control seeds.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Objective 2: Characterize the potential transfer of soil lead, arsenic, and other trace elements by vegetable crops grown on element enriched urban and orchard soils and develop methods to prevent this transfer. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 3: Characterize genetic resources and inheritance of grain Cd to reduce cadmium in durum wheat, flax and soybean. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 4: Evaluate information about the risk from Cd in foods to support public decisions for foods of both plant and animal origin. (C1; PS 1.F). The ultimate goals of this Project Plan are to improve the science about risk of heavy metals in soils and crops in order to obtain improved regulatory limits for Cd in crops under Codex, and the information needed to provide improved advice about the risk of Pb in urban garden soils and crops. Essentially all human Cd disease from soil Cd has resulted from paddy rice grown on fields contaminated by mining or smelter emissions. Garden vegetables and other grains have not been found to induce Cd disease in highly exposed populations who grow crops on highly Cd+Zn contaminated soils. Some Europeans want to set crop Cd limits based on attainable levels rather than on the basis of potential risk to consumers. Such non-risk based standards will harm U.S. growers of durum wheat, sunflower kernels, flax, soybean, and some other crops. If crops must contain lower levels of Cd to win importation by other nations, both soil treatments, selection of soil series which produce lower Cd crops, and improved cultivars which accumulate lower amounts of Cd will contribute to growers needs. Providing a clear technical basis for the bioavailability of Cd in different crops appears to be the central issue which could change the demand for lower limits for crop Cd, and protect growers from unnecessary costs to produce lower Cd crops which may have no benefit. Only animal feeding tests can provide valid information about the bioavailability of crop Cd to animals, and the concentrations fed must represent levels in foods rather than toxic levels fed in most previous research. Because Zn is usually greatly increased in crops (except rice) when Cd is increased, the presence of Zn may substantially reduce the bioavailability of crop Cd, alleviating presumed risk of crop Cd. Because commercial carrots were found with higher than normal Pb concentrations when grown on historic orchard soils, U.S.-FDA requested that ARS examine the basis for carrot Pb accumulation and to learn if agricultural amendments can reduce carrot Pb when they are grown on high Pb soils. Certain root crops have xylem elements growing through the edible storage root, so if Pb is trapped within the xylem during normal growth of the crop, it will be in the edible root. But such Pb might have much lower bioavailability than the Pb-acetate used to establish diet Pb risk; 2-10% of food Pb is absorbed, while 60-80% of soluble Pb in water is absorbed by human volunteers.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Local, state, and national response mechanisms are in place toquickly respond to these situations and help mitigate unforeseen consequences while protectingpublic and environmental health. Unfortunately, response assets at every level can quickly becomeoverwhelmed and may require surge or redundant capacity. The Food and Drug Administration FoodEmergency Response Network (FDA FERN) is one system in place that is comprised of both federaland state laboratories that bring personnel, supplies, equipment, and expertise together to enablefood and food product analyses during these situations. Many laboratories are volunteer laboratories,but 14 member laboratories have entered cooperative agreements for chemistry analysis and arenow referred to as FERN cCAP Laboratories. The Arkansas Department of Health-Arkansas PublicHealth Laboratory (ADH-PHL) became a FERN cCAP Laboratory in 2009 and has built a strongfoundation for food chemical analyses, method development, and emergency response.ADH-PHL provides a state-of-the-art laboratory environment for maintaining the Arkansas FERNChemistry Laboratory.

1510,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project will be increasing the economic competitiveness of the U.S. by increasing the output from commercial farms and increasing the production of related industries that rely on agricultural crops. This project will result in a new fertilizer that can be used to increase the harvest yields of soybeans and corn by at least 10% and possibly up to 25%. An increase in yields per acre will allow over 500,000 farmers to grow and sell more food from their land and to turn unprofitable years into profitable ones. This will bring more money into rural communities and increase the economic competitiveness of America?s farmer. Increasing agricultural production affects more than farmers, it also affects industries worth $992B that rely on food production. This proposal targets corn and soybeans because they are grown on approximately 180M acres in the U.S. (this is larger than the size of Texas) and generate over $92B in revenue each year. Finally, this project will increase the food safety of the U.S. by increasing the amount of food grown on land already dedicated to farming. The proposed project is the optimization and demonstration of a new fertilizer to increase the harvest yields of corn and soybeans. This novel fertilizer will be fabricated from natural chemicals and biocompatible, biodegradable polymers already used in agriculture. The formulation of the proposed novel fertilizer will be optimized and tested each year by growing crops of soybeans and corn in commercial fields and investigating the effect on yield of different loadings of fertilizer. The industrial partner will spread the proposed fertilizer using commercial farming equipment and grow corn and soybean plants under identical conditions as farmers. These studies are designed to assess whether the proposed fertilizer will increase the harvest yields and provide necessary data that will be provided to the Iowa Department of Agriculture to gain permission to sell the fertilizer commercially. At the completion of this grant the proposed fertilizer will be optimized for corn and soybeans and, hopefully, demonstrated to increase their harvest yields by 10 to 25%.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

An oral presentation of the main findings and conclusions will be delivered in a final workshop with interviewees and other stakeholders in Argentina.This study will test, refine, and synthesize existing theories of the co-production of activism and expertise within different types of conflicts and settings. Given the potential importance and complexity of the cooperation of environmental movements and environmental sciences, there is a need for research that explores this interaction within a broader scope than most case- study-based research. The study will bring together two theories about expert activism and expertise that have never been brought into conversation, and in doing so it will develop a symmetrical-network theory of expert activism. It will also implement a new symmetrical network-organizational approach to data collection and analysis, and it will test theoretical ideas developed in the US in a fundamentally different national setting in the global South. These innovations will deepen understanding of expert-movement interpenetration and the broader dynamics of knowledge production within environmental conflicts. The results will help environmental health experts and environmental movements to better coordinate their efforts to produce and mobilize different types of knowledge towards solving pressing environmental health problems unrecognized or silenced by the governments.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1512,"Plant oils are a renewable source of food, fuels, and chemicals; world output of plant oils must double by 2030 to meet projected demand. A major source of plant oils comes from seeds. While research has yielded improvements in seed oil quantity and quality, there are tradeoffs for other seed attributes such as protein content and yield. For example, plants that are bred or engineered to produce high seed oil often have decreased protein content or make fewer seeds. The molecular mechanism driving such tradeoffs remains unclear and creates a barrier for making improved crops with specific amounts of oil and protein content. This project seeks to unravel the genetic and molecular mechanisms related to the tradeoffs between oil, protein content, seed size, and seed set in order to enhance seed oil content of crops. By using an integrated approach, this project will investigate biochemical steps used by seeds to prioritize protein or oil production. Using this knowledge, this project will generate plants with improved seed oil production. In addition, this project promotes STEM education using the science of seed oils to train tomorrow's scientists as well as develops a science literacy program using hands-on research experience for students who are training to become future STEM teachers. The scientific and educational outcomes of this project will have broad impacts for both research and society through improved oil production in crop plants.Quantitative, comparative profiling of high-oil soybean, Camelina, and Arabidopsis will reveal the coordinated metabolic response to de-regulated de novo FAS. These findings will reveal the next metabolic constraint for engineering seed oil content, discover new genes involved in acyl lipid metabolism, and provide the plant lipid community with characterized, high-oil germplasm for gene stacking and comparative genomics. This project will integrate comparative transcriptomics, proteomics, and translatomics during three stages of seed development of FAS-engineered, high-oil plants to develop correlative and kinetic models to make metabolic predictions, and discover coregulated gene networks. Flux analyses and clustering models will be used to link high-oil germplasm to causal effects within combined central and lipid metabolic networks and used to make hypotheses for next-generation crop improvements. Aspects of in vivo FAS rates, the uncoupling of FAS from TAG synthesis that can lead to futile cycles of FAS and breakdown; and acyl fluxes through the lipid metabolic network will be investigated to elucidate new bottlenecks for TAG accumulation as a result of de-regulating FAS. Web resources (fatplants.net) developed as a part of this project will serve to educate the community and provide an interactive tool to integrate metabolism and gene regulation Integrated tools are necessary to inspire tomorrow's scientists and engineers and enable multidisciplinary training of all ages. This project will also develop a hands-on science literacy program for future educators of science and technology (Sci-FEST) and high school science teaching modules on plant metabolism and biotechnology will be created by the program participants.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1513,"Advances in sequencing DNA have led to an unprecedented increase in our understanding of microbial diversity, yet we lack a clear picture of how functional traits relate to organismal diversity, or to the gene content found in their genomes. Because of this, it is not clear how similar in DNA sequence two organisms need to be for us to call them the same thing. This has important consequences when making ecological inferences. The researchers have developed a novel way to rapidly determine which microbes grow well under different environmental conditions by following the frequency of unique  barcodes  that have been genetically inserted into a panel of 96 natural isolates of bacteria that naturally grow on plant leaves. The researchers will also be able to track how different strains of microbes assemble into communities, which will illuminate which ones can stably coexist. The work will ultimately shed light on the phylogenetic conservation of traits, association of those traits to changes in the genome, and how much these traits influence genetic exchange across microbes. Outreach to K-12 students will result in a greater appreciation by the public of microbial genetic and functional diversity.Researchers will focus on the genus Methylobacterium, a collection of >50 named species well known for use of plant-derived methanol as one of their growth substrates. This team recently uncovered that Methylobacterium stimulates growth of soybeans when lanthanides are present; thus, there is opportunity to connect community diversity with an important ecosystem function. The team's novel barcoding system will accomplish two things not possible with traditional 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing: elimination of PCR bias, and the ability to track dozens of isolates simultaneously in any mixture, even if they have identical 16S rRNA. This proposal leverages data to develop a picture of the genus Methylobacterium at unprecedented depth and efficiency to examine the phylogenetic conservation of traits, associate traits to changes in genome content, and ask how much these traits influence genetic exchange across the genus. Ultimately, this can establish whether an abundant group of strains with identical 16S rRNA sequences represents a single cloud of successful genomes that are ecologically neutral with regard to each other, or a panel of ecologically diverse strains that have evolved distinct traits that permit coexistence.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

1517,"This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Cynthia Holland is  Evolution of Secondary Herbivore Defense Metabolite Biosynthesis from Primary Metabolism in the non-model Crucifer Erysimum (wallflower).  The host institution for the fellowship is the Boyce Thompson Institute and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Georg Jander and Lukas Mueller.To protect themselves against insect herbivores, plants have evolved a wide variety of chemical defenses. One class of plant defensive metabolites, known as cardiac glycosides, is found in at least twelve plant families and works by slowing the contractions and increasing the pumping force of the predator's heart. Despite the therapeutic use of these compounds in treating arrhythmias and congestive heart failure, a complete pathway for cardiac glycoside biosynthesis is not known for any plant species. This project will use the cardiac glycoside-producing wormseed wallflower (Erysimum cheiranthoides) to identify the biosynthetic pathway genes for these compounds. These results will contribute to the understanding of the evolution of defensive chemicals in other plant species, including important crops such as maize, soybean, and wheat. Training objectives include metabolomics, genetics, gene expression technologies and bioinformatics. Broader impacts include introducing underrepresented students to genomics and chemical ecology research via mentoring through an NSF-funded REU program, outreach to high school students at an urban high school in Yonkers (NY) and the development of laboratory kits for middle- and high-school teachers in rural New York.As a rapidly-growing, self-pollinating annual, E. cheiranthoides is an excellent model system for investigating the evolution of a new metabolic pathway for the production of cardenolides, a class of cardiac glycosides involved in herbivore defense. Modification of ubiquitous biosynthetic pathways of endogenous plant steroids, e.g. brassinosteroids, has likely been repeatedly selected for in the course of evolution to generate similar anti-herbivore toxins. This research will identify expansion and neofunctionalization of the enzyme families in E. cheiranthoides that normally contribute to primary metabolism in other crucifer species. Erysimum homologs of known cardenolide biosynthetic genes from other species will be identified using genome assemblies and characterized using structure-function-sequence analysis. Missing genes in the cardenolide pathway will be discovered through comparative metabolomics, transcriptomics, genomics, and forward genetic screens. Finally, the ecological  escape from herbivory  hypothesis will be tested by examining the role of cardenolides in host-insect interactions. Results from this research will be shared through publications, presentations at conferences, and inclusion in www.erysimum.org, a wallflower-specific website which will serve as a publicly accessible repository for all data related to this project.Keywords: biosynthesis biochemistry, plant biotic stress, comparative genomicsThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1518,"Sphingolipids are the most abundant lipid component of the membrane that surrounds plant cells. This membrane separates the plant cell from the surrounding environment. Sphingolipid composition is important for the plant's ability to survive variable growth conditions, such as drought and freezing, and to fight infection from pathogenic fungi and bacteria. Plant cells vary the amount of sphingolipid synthesized depending on environmental conditions. This project examines how plants make the required amount of sphingolipid for optimal growth. If there is too little sphingolipid, the plant's cells will not be able to grow and the presence of excess sphingolipid can trigger cell death. This project shows how sphingolipid metabolism is regulated and generates a computer model to predict the regulation of sphingolipid levels in plants. Regulation of sphingolipid metabolism is investigated under optimal growth conditions and in response to pathogen infection. The results of this project will enable plant breeders and biotechnologists to predictably alter sphingolipid metabolism in crops, such as corn and soybean. With the knowledge derived from this project plant breeders will be able to maintain plant productivity in response to drought, soil salinity, pathogenic fungi and bacteria and other environmental challenges. The project engages high school and undergraduate students in sphingolipid research to advance STEM education. Graduate student participants are trained broadly in the convergence of computation with experimentation to address significant biological questions.The project addresses fundamental gaps in knowledge of sphingolipid metabolic regulation in plants and its impact on biotic stress responses by integrating computational modeling with experimental approaches. Relative contributions of biosynthetic and catabolic reactions for sphingolipid metabolic regulation are determined through a kinetic model derived from metabolic flux analyses of wild-type and mutant plants exposed to biotic stresses. An extensive toolbox of plant mutants and engineered yeast strains are used for biochemical and genetic studies aimed at understanding mechanisms through which orosomucoid-like proteins function as central regulators. These regulators control the amounts and types of sphingolipids produced in response to biological stresses. Findings from these studies contribute to iterative kinetic model improvement through design-build-test-refine cycles for a more quantitative and mechanistic understanding of sphingolipid metabolic regulation in plants. The project also advances the study of plant sphingolipids through development of a web portal that contains information on sphingolipid structural diversity, metabolism, function, and analysis and disseminates project-derived metabolic models.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1519,"This project is broadly focused on understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which aggressive, broad host range plant pathogens are able to cause disease on diverse groups of plants. The specific focus is on the fungal plant pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the cause of white mold disease in soybean, sunflower, cole crops, pulse crops and a variety of others. In total, this agricultural pathogen infects over 600 plant species and accounts for an estimated $200 million in annual economic loss in the U.S. Market losses can be extremely high when disease outbreaks occur on a large scale; the U.S. soybean stem rot outbreak in 2009, for instance, directly reduced harvests by approximately $560 million. In the field, diseases caused by S. sclerotiorum are challenging to control for the lack of resistant cultivars effective against this pathogen and the long survival properties of the fungus. In Florida, losses occurring in crops of green bean, carrot, Brassica carinata, bell pepper and cabbage are of perennial concern. This research addresses the need to elucidate the genetically based mechanisms of S. sclerotiorum that are required for its aggressiveness and the genetic factors from the host that account for susceptibility or resistance to the pathogen. This information is fundamentally important for the long-term purpose of developing effective disease control strategies against this devastating fungal pathogen. This research will have the broader impact of training undergraduates recruited from the University of Florida Undergraduate Research Minority Participation Program in molecular genetic techniques using cutting edge tools for genome manipulation. This project aims to elucidate factors that underlie the establishment of basic compatibility in broad host range necrotrophic pathogens. The working model is that these pathogens, exemplified by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, utilize a two-phase strategy for establishing basic compatibility and host colonization. From this model two hypotheses are possible.The first hypothesis is that basic host-pathogen compatibility across a broad range of hosts is established by pathogen targeting of universally conserved host targets (e.g., MED16). The alternative, but not mutually exclusive, hypothesis is that these pathogens have evolved and utilize independent virulence factors and effectors for different hosts to overcome host-specific defenses (e.g., glucosinolates). One discovery-based and two targeted Specific Objectives will test these hypotheses. The first is to create and phenotype gene-specific loss-of-function mutations for select members of the predicted S. sclerotiorum secretome chosen from transcriptome data. The second objective is to characterize the pathway of Arabidopsis Mediator complex subunit 16 (MED16) protein modification and degradation to understand its role in broad host range necrotrophic pathogen susceptibility and resistance. The final objective is to determine the role of MED16 degradation in host susceptibility to S. sclerotiorum and other broad host range necrotrophic pathogens. Plant disease resistance to this class of pathogens lags behind the understanding of other classes of host-pathogen interactions. The genetically complex nature of these interactions is a major factor limiting understanding. Utilizing new molecular genetic tools and genomic resources, the proposed research will establish greater mechanistic understanding of broad host range necrotrophic pathogen-host compatibility.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1520,"This award by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Chemistry Division supports work by Professor Amanda Nienow at Gustavus Adolphus College. She is examining chemical reactions of the herbicide dicamba. Although dicamba has been on the market for over thirty years, it is being used more often on agricultural fields now as new genetically-modified soybean plants can tolerate dicamba. The 2017 growing season saw the first use of these soybeans in the US - and by the end of the summer, there were thousands of complaints from farmers on land adjacent to fields. Herbicide drifting through the air appeared to be causing crop damage in down-wind fields. In this project, environmental systems (for example, water or air based systems) are examined to understand how dicamba changes through reactions with other compounds in the environment and through interactions with sunlight. In addition, this project provides research opportunities for undergraduate students, which prepares them to enter the workforce or graduate or professional schools. These students will also help develop and institute a  Chemistry Night  for regional high school students. The team also collaborates with international partners in France.The photochemistry and reactivity of the chlorinated herbicide dicamba and the impact of additives in formulated agricultural products is being examined from several angles. These include heterogeneous photochemistry on the surface of epicuticular waxes and leaves, gas-phase photochemistry, and heterogeneous reactivity with hydroxyl radical, the primary gas-phase oxidant. The influence of surfactants and inactive ingredients in the commercial formulation of dicamba on these reactions is examined. The results may provide insight into the photodegradation and oxidation mechanisms and (photo)products of dicamba. This research enhances the current understanding of the environmental chemistry of dicamba. This work also provides new methods to examine the photolysis of chemicals sorbed to surfaces and heterogeneous reactions with gas-phase oxidants.

1521,"The specific interactions of plants with various soil microorganisms throughout their life cycle play important roles in plant growth and survival in nature. Being sessile organisms, plants are directly affected by the continuous but predictable changes in environmental conditions. This includes the 24-hour light/dark cycle according to which plants adjust their various physiological processes. To ensure successful interaction, plants influence the profile and possibly the biology of certain groups of soil microorganisms such that they stay in synchrony with the daily changes in the plant physiological processes. A better understanding of this dynamic regulation would provide valuable information towards understanding the mechanisms and processes through which some soil microbes successfully interact with plant roots. Since the summation of the daily plant interactions with the soil microbes is the basis for their long-term benefits on the plants, understanding these daily interactions at the molecular level is important. The manipulation of these daily interactions through plant breeding may allow for improved plant productivity through efficient interaction with certain natural microbes, reducing the dependency of agricultural operations on expensive synthetic fertilizers. This project also provides valuable opportunities to engage undergraduate and high-school students in scientific research and introduce them to the natural and sustainable approaches of food production. The microbiome has profound effect on a host's health and nutritional status. In animals, light and the host's circadian clock, a cell-autonomous internal biological timekeeper that generates roughly 24-hour rhythms in many metabolic and physiological processes, regulate host-microbiome interactions. The first aim of this research is to study the roles of the Arabidopsis thaliana's circadian clock on its interaction with the bacterial microbiome in the endosphere (inhabiting the root interior) using a metagenomic approach. The plant circadian clock will be disrupted environmentally and genetically. The 24-hour fluctuations in the endospheric and soil bacterial profiles will be determined by sequencing bacterial 16S-ribosomal (r) genes at both the DNA and RNA level to better understand the role of the circadian clock regulation. The second aim is to identify the root and bacterial pathways underlying this dynamic interaction using a metatranscriptomic approach. Both root and bacterial transcriptomes will be depleted of ribosomal RNAs and sequenced to identify possible mechanisms and processes through which some endospheric bacteria interact with Arabidopsis roots. The third aim is to investigate the role of daily bacterial fluctuations on plant performance using a physiological approach. Soils will be conditioned by growing Arabidopsis, tomato, and soybean plants in normal light/dark cycles or prolonged constant light for two generations. The performance of Arabidopsis, tomato, and soybean plants on these conditioned soils will be assessed by weekly measurements of total leaf diameter and petiole length, plant height, chlorophyll content, and stomatal conductance.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Rebecca Povilus is  Identifying Deeply Conserved Patterns of Epigenetic Modification and Imprinting during Seed Development . The host institution for the fellowship is the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Mary Gehring.Seeds are important for humans; seeds make up most of our diets and are a key part of the ecosystems that we depend on. Understanding what factors influence seed development is necessary to improve seed crops (such as wheat, corn, rice, and soybean), as well as to ensure the production of viable offspring when re-introducing genetic diversity into inbred crop varieties. Only recently have technologies and systems been available to elucidate the role that epigenetic modifications (chemical changes to DNA bases and to associated DNA-packaging proteins) play during plant reproduction. While epigenetic modifications have been shown to be important for seed development in a small number of distantly related plant species, the actual patterns and effects of epigenetic modification appear to vary substantially between species. To predict how broadly epigenome-based technologies for crop improvement and plant breeding can be applied, the patterns of epigenetic modifications that are fundamental to all flowering plants, or are specific to particular lineages must be determined. This project will provide an otherwise lacking foundation for understanding how the role that epigenetic processes play during reproduction has evolved across flowering plants. To do so, epigenetic modifications and their association with gene expression during seed development will be identified in the emerging model system Nymphaea thermarum, a member of one of the most ancient flowering plant lineages. Training objectives include genomics, epigenomics and bioinformatics. Broader impacts include outreach to local school teachers through the Whitehead Partner program and the development and distribution of a module for early-science education that explores the importance of biodiversity and basic research to agriculture and food security. This module will be presented as part of the Arnold Arboretum Summer Institute, and will be available at https://nthermarum.weebly.com/.The goal of this project is to understand epigenetic modification and its impact on gene expression during seed development. Specific objectives include 1) determining the dynamics of epigenetic modification during reproductive development in N. thermarum through immunolocalization of methylated DNA and histone marks, methylation-sensitive DNA sequencing and chromatin profiling and 2) identifying genes that are maternally- or paternally-imprinted during early embryo and endosperm development using hybrid crosses and tissue specific gene expression analysis. By comparing results from Nymphaea to information from model species, deeply conserved patterns of epigenetic modifications and imprinted gene expression will be distinguished from those that are derived within either monocots (such cereal crops) or eudicots (such as Arabidopsis). Results of this project will be published on open-access pre-print servers and peer-reviewed journals, and information will be available on the website https://nthermarum.weebly.com/.Keywords: seed development, embryo, endosperm, epigenetics, Nymphaea, comparative genomics and epigenomicsThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1523,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a protein replacement for soy-based marine animal diets to improve yield through effective nutrition and enhanced animal welfare. Aquafeeds represent >50% of the cost of production, and losses due to mortality can be as high as 50% in certain commercial species. A novel feed ingredient that contains immuno-nutritional properties to address these inefficiencies could be considered a game-changer to the industry. Fish are the most resource-efficient sources of animal protein, a healthy source of food for people, and will be one of the ways to address food security. As the surface of the planet is greater than two-thirds ocean, one estimate suggests, if managed properly, just 2% of this vast resource could produce enough food for all of mankind. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to expand previous studies that suggested a novel single cell protein (SCP) is a significant candidate to serve as a fishmeal alternative. In addition, SCP also may contain functional properties that improve growth performance and survival. The SCP tested previously supported improved feed conversion ratios (FCR) as compared to conventional diets, while at the same time, statistically relevant improvements in survival of carnivorous fish and shrimp. It also was observed that SCP relieved secondary disease complications associated with diets, such as gastro-enteritis. With hundreds of marketable species in aquaculture, and an industry that is just 50 years old, the collective understanding of aquatic animal nutrition is in its infancy.

1524,"Chemotaxis enables motile bacteria to move away from harmful and towards beneficial chemicals. One unique group of motile soil bacteria are rhizobia, which can live freely in the soil, as well as engage in specific symbiotic relationships with leguminous plants such as peas, soy beans, and alfalfa. This symbiosis supplies the host plant with nitrogen, which is the most limiting nutrient for plant growth. The process of chemotaxis in the model rhizobium Sinorhizobium meliloti allows the organism to recognize its host, which improves the symbiotic relationship, and consequently, enhances plant growth. The PI discovered multiple and diverse chemoreceptors in S. meliloti, which are used to sense chemical compounds. However, little is known about the attractant spectrum or the specificity of rhizobial chemoreceptors. The overarching goal of this project is to characterize the specific adaptations of S. meliloti chemoreception to the range of host-derived attractants. Results from this research will transform our current concepts of bacterial behavior in soil through discovery of emergent properties of legume-rhizobia interactions. Chemotaxis of the soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti is a critical prerequisite for the establishment of its symbiotic relationship with alfalfa. The discovery of a new type of bacterial chemotaxis, namely attraction to plant-borne betaines, and the identification of the rhizobial chemoreceptor for these compounds expands our understanding of plant-bacteria communication. The results of this research will open avenues for developing novel and innovative strategies to enhance chemoreception in the symbiotic bacterium S. meliloti, which will increase symbiotic efficiency, result in higher level of nitrogen fixation, and may ultimately increase crop yields. This project can directly benefit future agricultural and environmental issues by reducing the use of chemical fertilizers. Broader Impacts activities will involve the interdisciplinary training of graduate students. The team is committed to mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, especially underrepresented minorities and women. Public outreach activities include hands-on demonstrations for elementary and high school students, both on- and off-campus, and involvement of high school students in research.Using the Alfalfa-S. meliloti interaction as a model system, the investigators aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that govern legume-rhizobia communications. Understanding these mechanisms could open important new avenues for addressing daunting agricultural and environmental issues. This research will characterize S. meliloti chemoreceptors for which functional understanding is lacking. In an orthogonal approach, the investigators will define the nature of plant-derived compounds responsible for the recruitment of S. meliloti to the host rhizosphere. The composition of compounds exuded by plants into the rhizosphere has specifically evolved to attract symbiotic microbes to the roots of their corresponding hosts. First, the investigators propose to characterize the diverse phytochemicals secreted by the S. meliloti host alfalfa using mass-spectrometric metabolome analysis and quantitative chemotaxis assays. This study will uncover the S. meliloti attractome and establish the contributions of individual compounds to chemotaxis. Second, they propose to identify receptor ligands for individual chemoreceptors and determine receptor-ligand interaction through behavioral, genetic, biochemical, and structural analyses. The already highly advanced biochemical and structural characterization of McpX serves as blueprint for these analyses. The proposed research will advance our knowledge of the role of exuded root metabolites in the dialogue between plants and microbes.The Project is jointly funded by Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (CDF Cluster) and Integrative Organismal Systems (PBI Cluster), with additional support provided by the Directorate's Rule of Life Venture Fund.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
1525,"The Food-Energy-Water (FEW) Nexus, from a global perspective, can be described as the interconnected resource systems of food, energy, and water. As the world's population expands to the expected 9 billion by 2050, there will be a need to balance difference resources across these three systems to obtain different user goals without putting undue strain on the ecosystems that provide these resources. The goal of this project is to develop FEW Nexus solutions for regions where bioenergy crop production competes with animal feed production for land, water, and energy sources. Due to the increased demand for ethanol from corn production, there is less land for animal feed production. Farmers will often use distiller's dried grains with other grain waste products to supplement animal diets. However, this feed is not digested efficiently by swine and poultry, leading to wasted nutrients and nutrient run-off to surface waters. The Hu research group at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, in collaboration with Chinese partners at the Dalian University of Technology, Guangxi University, Beijing Technology and Business University, and Beijing Normal University, propose to develop a fungal fermentation step during corn-ethanol processing to convert corn stillage, along with other agricultural residues, to animal feed that can be better utilized by swine and poultry. This step will ultimately reduce energy costs for the corn-ethanol production process and mitigate impacts to the interconnected FEW systems of bioenergy production and animal feed production. By testing various agricultural residues, the researchers will identify different opportunities for nutrient enhancement for swine and poultry feed which will lead to more efficient digestion by these animals and reduce nutrient run-off from incompletely digested feed.Through the whole conversion of corn and selected agricultural residues, the principal investigator's research group, in collaboration with 4 Chinese universities, will support both the biofuel and feed production industries in interconnected food-energy-water (FEW) systems. Livestock with monogastric diets are typically fed with corn stillage, a by-product of the corn-ethanol fermentation process to reduce the cost of ethanol production. While suitable as feed for monogastric livestock, this stillage is not easy to digest. The inefficiency of stillage digestion leads lower nutrient uptake by livestock and, subsequently, the increase of nutrient run-off from animal waste. The researchers plan to study methods to improve the digestibility of this feed through fungal fermentation of this stillage, along with other residues such as rapeseed meal, during integration with corn ethanol production. First, they will evaluate the digestion efficiency of these co-products in comparison to traditional diets of corn-soybean meal and untreated corn-stillage diets to determine the best combinations of stillage and residues. Once the optimized feed mixture(s) is/are identified, life cycle analyses and techno-economic analyses will be used to identify the potential economic and environmental impacts of the new diets from synthesis to digestion and waste treatment. The research could benefit bioenergy production in both the US and China by lowering the cost and the environmental impact of corn ethanol production through the development of a higher-value byproduct of corn ethanol fermentation. The researchers plan to engage the Hmong community, an underrepresented Asian community, through community outreach, high school programs, and summer camps designed to inform these stakeholders of ways to increase their corn ethanol production income while benefiting the environment and reducing strain on the local FEW Nexus.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

Yau (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)Successful completion of this project to study the photothermal flowering gene regulatory network in soybean will provide a systematic understanding of genetic networks associated with a plant's response to environmental signals, and ultimately allow plant improvement towards enhanced adaptation to fluctuating environments while improving yield. This work will provide novel algorithmic methods and bioinformatics pipelines for network inference and enhance development of fundamental knowledge in plant biology and bioinformatics. Finally, mathematical network models obtained through this work will lay the foundation for development of in silico systems to examine and predict plant performance under various environments. This project enhances integration of two very different fields of research in Crop Sciences and Engineering, and provides outstanding training opportunities for postdoctoral researchers and graduate, undergraduate and high school students in interdisciplinary research involving molecular genetic, biochemical, systems biology, and modeling approaches. Undergraduate students will be recruited from underrepresented groups and routinely involve in lab activities. The project will also organize and hold a summer camp for local high school students who will have the opportunity to conduct a summer research project on crop genetics and improvement. A growing concern in the world is the changes in crop performance associated with global climate change. In soybean, flowering transition is regulated by the interaction between photoperiods and temperature, known as photothermal effects. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of photothermal flowering in soybean, the project will employ interdisciplinary approaches including: 1) elucidation of global gene expression patterns underlying photothermal flowering of soybean, 2) identification of key transcription factor-target interactions and protein-protein interactions of more than 20 transcription factors in the photothermal flowering gene network, 3) reverse engineering of the photothermal flowering gene network using transcriptome and interactome data as well as other biological side information by developing algorithmic methods and pipelines for network inference, and 4) mathematical modeling of the photothermal flowering gene network to provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms accounting for the genetic interactions and their functions, and biological relevance of genetic interactions implemented in the photothermal flowering gene network.

Both GSE and MTEcontain high levels of polyphenols that are structurally distinct with strong antioxidant properties, and eachagent has been shown to exert antineoplastic effects against lung cancer. Preliminary data using combinationsof GSE and MTE shows exciting, unequivocal synergistic anticancer effects against lung pre- and cancer cellsin vitro. We therefore hypothesize that oral administration of combinations of leucoselect phytosome (LP), astandardized GSE, and siliphos, a standardized MTE, both complexed with soy phospholipids into phytosomesto enhance bioavailability, will synergistically inhibit lung cancer growth, invasion, and induce apoptosis invarious human lung cancer xenograft models, via favorable modulations of mechanisms associated with lungtumorigenesis/promotion. To test these hypotheses, we will determine their pharmacokinetics (PK) andpharmacodynamics (PD). We will also determine the utility of biospecimens, such as snap, fresh frozen lungtissue homogenates, as surrogate model systems to monitor the bioavailability and bioactivity of oraladministration of these agents to the target organ. Furthermore, the mechanistic effects of the combinationswill be assessed systematically with cancer relevant, pathway specific gene expressions and microRNA(miRNA) real time PCR arrays, and correlated to functional significance. Three specific aims are proposed:Aim 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), PK/PD, and anti-cancer effects of LP with siliphosin murine models. A dose range finding study will be conducted in nude mice given varying dose combinationsvia oral gavage to establish MTD. Blood and lung samples will be obtained to determine PK of GSE, MTE andmetabolites as surrogate markers of bioavailability of GSE and MTE. Aim 1.1. To determine the bioactivity oforal LP and siliphos using a novel co-culture system of frozen mouse lung homogenates with human lungneoplastic cells. Bioactivity in the lungs will be assessed by co-culturing lung tissue homogenates from control(water) vs. drug treated mice with human lung cancer and precancerous cell lines. The effects of varying dosecombinations on proliferation and apoptosis in co-cultured cells will be correlated to GSE, MTE and metaboliteslevels. Aim 2: To determine the anti-cancer effects of combinations of LP and siliphos on various types ofhuman lung cancer xenograft mouse models. Based on MTD findings, varying dose combinations will be givenvia oral gavage to mice bearing a variety of human lung tumor xenografts for up to 8 weeks with serialcollections of plasma, lung tissues and tumor xenografts from each treatment group.

1579,"AbstractParenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) is a significant complication of prolonged parenteralnutrition. An estimated 50,000 infants are at risk to develop PNAC each year in the United States. Thedisease is particularly common in premature infants and those who undergo major gastrointestinal operationsin the neonatal period. PNAC is associated with a 50% risk of sepsis and a mortality rate as high as 20% to30%. Studies have shown that soybean-based fat emulsions have a direct causative effect on thedevelopment of cholestasis and its progression to liver failure but this product remains the only FDA-approvedintravenous lipid available in the United States. Given these two factors, several strategies have beenundertaken to minimize the deleterious effects of soybean-based fat emulsions on the liver. One promisingapproach is the administration of a lower dose of the IV fat emulsion as both a treatment and preventativeapproach for PNAC. While IV fat emulsion dose reduction appears to offer substantial benefit in the treatmentand prevention of PNAC in infants in small, retrospective evaluations, data from well-controlled clinical studiesare not available. Several questions regarding IV fat emulsion dose reduction remain. Specifically, the timingof dose reduction and the optimal dose have not been elucidated. The overall long-term safety of thesestrategies in this population remain unknown particularly as they relate to neurodevelopmental outcomes.Limiting the dose of IV fat emulsion may have a negative effect on essential fatty acid levels which in turn mayaffect neurologic and behavioral development as essential fatty acids are crucial during brain development inthe neonatal period. Little data exist regarding the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonatestreated with IV fat emulsion dose reduction.This study will evaluate the hypothesis that a lower dose of IV fat emulsion will prevent and/or reducethe severity of PNAC when compared to a standard dose of IV fat emulsion without having negativeeffects on growth or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Study subjects will include surgical neonates who willbe dependent on parenteral nutrition for a prolonged period of time.
