0,"Military and industrial activities have resulted in soils contaminated with   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and   trinitrotoluene (TNT). These contaminated soils pose a risk to surface and ground   water and require remediation. Excavation followed by landfilling or incineration   are costly methods and may be impractical when large volumes of soil are contaminated.   Phytoremediation, the use of plants to remove contaminants and/or to stimulate   microbial degradation of contaminants in the rhizosphere, is a cost-effective   alternative for remediation of recalcitrant hydrocarbon contaminated soils.   The main purpose of this research was, 1. to determine the effectiveness of   phytoremediation compared to a fallow bioremediation treatment, 2. to calibrate   and validate a recently developed phytoremediation model that is designed to   predict the effectiveness of warm and cool season grasses upon remediation of   soil contaminated with PAHs, PCBs, and TNT. To achieve these purposes, laboratory,   greenhouse and field experiments were conducted. Column lysimeters were constructed   and the lysimeters were filled with uncontaminated Weswood silt loam soil that   was mixed with TNT, PBB and PAH to a target concentration of 10 mg of each contaminant   per kg of soil. Five lysimeter treatments, 1. Eastern Gamagrass, 2. Annual rye   grass, 3. Gamagrass and Annual rye rotation, 4. bare soil, and 5. Gamagrass   (with uncontaminated soil) were randomly allotted. Each treatment had four replicates.   The weather, soil moisture content, and irrigation amounts were monitored for   the entire project period. Soil, root, and herbage samples were sampled at five   times during three growing seasons. The concentrations of TNT, PBBs, and PAH   in the soil, roots, and herbage as well as microbial biomass and root properties   were measured to determine the phytoremediation effects of Eastern Gamagrass   and Annual rye grass. The amount of the three contaminants that were dissipated   due to the effect of the plant roots was also determined. A mechanistic model   was modified to consider resultant plant contamination and effects of various   environmental factors. The model was then validated and calibrated using field   data.There were two primary objectives of the proposed research: 1. To evaluate   the effectiveness of a warm season grass (Eastern Gamagrass) followed by a cool   season prairie grass (Annual ryegrass) in the phytoremediation of soil contaminated   with common recalcitrant organic pollutants; namely a mixture of a PBB, a PAH,   and TNT. This involved field lysimeter studies and greenhouse column experiments.2.   To use the field and greenhouse data to calibrate and validate a recently developed   bioremediation model that is capable of simulating the removal and degradation   of organic chemicals from the soil by plant roots and their rhizosphere. The   specific objectives of the research were:1. To determine the amounts of chrysene,   2,2&AElig;,5,5&AElig;-tetrabromobipheny, and TNT that were extracted by a warm   season grass (Eastern Gamagrass) and a cool season grass (Annual rye grass)   grown individually and in rotation during three growing seasons.2. To quantify   the concentration of 2,2&AElig;,5,5&AElig;-tetrabromobipheny, chrysene, and   TNT in the leachate from soil lysimeters.3. To quantify the dissipation of 2,2&AElig;,5,5&AElig;-tetrabromobipheny,   chrysene, and TNT in soil columns.4. To validate and calibrate an existing phytoremediation   computer model that simulates organic contaminant transport and root uptake   from soils.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
1,"Phytoremediation is the use of green plants to remove, contain, or render harmless environmental contaminants (Cunningham and Berti, 1993). This project is an innovative effort to optimize agronomic practices critical to cleaning up polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from refinery waste disposal sites using native plant species in managed systems. Several researchers have adopted phytoremediation as an alternative to more expensive and labor-intensive engineering controls (soil washing, chemical addition) to treat refinery waste sites (declared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as Superfund sites). Phytoremediation essentially has progressed in two directions: Using non-native species that are shown to survive toxic environments and at the same time reduce contamination with a concomitant biomass growth (managed systems). Allowing native species to naturally revegetate the contaminated sites.Non-native species have the advantage of aggressively degrading contaminants, and at the same time supporting large biomass. A 50% reduction in total petroleum hydrocarbons was observed over 21 months using rye grass on a refinery waste site in southeast Texas (Nedunuri, et al., 2000). However, these species must be carefully managed, requiring frequent irrigation, fertilizer application, and pesticide/herbicide additions. These may well be targeted species for phytoremediation; however, by themselves, non-native species cannot restore the natural ecosystem. The non-native species also may disturb natural plant succession in the vicinity of the contamination. Allowing native species to naturally revegetate is an attractive proposition, since it saves on the cost of restoration and management. If natural revegetation can remediate a site similar to a managed system and establishes a plant community comparable to that existing in the vicinity, the outcome will be both site remediation and ecological restoration (Henry and Shann, 2004; Jodi Shann, personal communication). However, it is not certain whether native species can tolerate such harsh and abruptly introduced toxic environments. Comparisons of ecological recovery through plant invasion and succession on sites contaminated with organic pollutants have shown biodiversity differences of recovering plant communities (Olson and Fletcher, 2000). In situations where native species can encroach into contaminated areas, they may take longer to establish, since contamination in several of these Superfund sites exceeds plant tolerance levels.Both native and non-native species have shown promise in degrading contaminants and at the same time have the limitations indicated above. Therefore, our rationale has been that the success with either approach depends not only on the plant&rsquo;s ability to survive, adapt, and succeed in degrading contaminants at Superfund sites, but also on how one can best optimize conditions conducive to plant growth using agronomic practices. These agronomic practices can include soil tillage/using non-tilled soils, soil amendments, surfactants, fertilizer addition, irrigation, and pesticide addition. The research focused on optimization of agronomic practices typically used to promote remediation efforts at organic contaminated sites. A holistic approach to these efforts should also include site restoration to the natural ecological community prevailing in the region surrounding the contaminated sites. Attempts are underway to remediate a PAH-contaminated site to a prairie grassland using species native to Ohio that may subsequently undergo natural succession to mesophytic forest. Many clean up efforts so far have only addressed site remediation and used species targeted for waste reduction. These species may not promote natural community succession quintessential to site res",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2,"Objective(s): Quantify the impact of agricultural practices and environmental changes on surface/atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases (GHG) in order to develop farming systems that reduce global warming potential (GWP) and promote soil C sequestration; Develop farming systems that permit the removal of biomass for energy production while protecting soil resources; Identify and overcome agronomic impediments to the adoption of farming practices, such as reduced tillage, cover crops, and companion crops, that are developed to reduce GWP and permit stover harvest.Approach:We will participate in a multi-location effort to identify farming practices that will help slow the increase in atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases CO2, N2O, and CCH4.  Our approach will include continuous, field-scale measurement of the surface/atmosphere exchange of all three gases in three adjacent fields under different management.  Parallel plot-scale studies will be conducted with chamber-based gas exchange measurements to permit testing of a broader variety of tillage, nitrogen (N) fertility, and rotation strategies.  In the second principal area of inquiry, we, again in cooperation with other ARS locations, will examine the soil sustainability of harvesting corn stover for ethanol production.  Our goal is to test the hypothesis that cover or companion crops can fill the role of the removed stover in supplying carbon (C) compounds to maintain soil organic matter.  We will explore the use of forage digestibility analyses to characterize the quality and quantity of C compounds contained in corn stover and in cereal rye, kura clover, and selected other cover crops.  The third component of this project will focus on identifying and correcting practical, agronomic impediments to adoption of the practices mentioned above.  In the upper Midwest, the major hindrance to wider use of cover crops, companion crops, and reduced tillage has been the perception that they will reduce the yield of the subsequent crop, due to such factors as cold, compacted spring seed bed conditions and adverse effects on N availability.  We will test and refine theories describing near-surface heat and water flow and develop sensors to more easily measure soil bulk density.  We will also conduct plot-scale studies of the effects of reduced tillage and cover crops on N losses by leaching and gaseous emissions.  The results of this research will facilitate the development of better reduced tillage and cover crop systems for northern soils.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
3,"Objective(s): Determine the effect of manure application on soil N and P cycling, manure pathogen fate and transport and organic C storage in soil using two and three year rotations with cover crops and different tillage systems. A. Determine the effect of cover crops on the fate of nutrients applied in swine manure by measuring (a) cover crop N and P uptake and leaching, (b) cover crop survival after manure application, and (c) losses of N2O from manured fields with and without a cover crop.B. Determine the effect of alternative swine manure application methods on nutrient fate and bacterial transport in systems with and without cover crops.  1) Determine effect of application method (surface application with disking versus low disturbance injection) on crop and cover crop uptake of N and P.2) Determine retention and form of 15N-manure after application to soil.3) Determine the distribution of bioavailable P in the root zone after manure application.4) Determine loss of N, P and E. coli in runoff. C. Determine the effects of composted animal manure, tillage and their interaction on C and N cycling in extended corn-soybean rotations containing small grains and/or legumes.1) Determine the effects of application of composted animal manure on soil and crop C and N within a corn-soybean-winter wheat/red clover rotation under three tillage treatments (fall moldboard plow, fall chisel plow, and no-tillage).2) Determine the contribution of N from composted animal manure to plant available N within corn-soybean rotations.Approach:This research examines the use of a rye-oat cover crop to increase manure nutrient retention and to prevent losses of nutrients and fecal bacteria in runoff.  The research tests the feasibility of this concept and provides an initial demonstration of this practice to selected growers.  If successful the research would form the foundation for field-scale testing and the development of guidelines for producers. Cover crops have been previously shown to be effective in preventing erosion and nitrate leaching, thus they have the potential to mitigate the off-site effects of manure application.  Cover crops in the Midwest are established following soybean harvest in October or early November.  Swine manure is also applied at this time either as a surface application or by injection.  Manure application causes considerable disturbance, thus cover crop survival and function will be assessed.  Furthermore, the effects of conventional and low disturbance manure injection equipment will be compared with respect N and P retention and cover crop survival.  This research would evaluate the cover crop uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus. The ability of cover crops to mitigate runoff losses of nutrients and fecal bacteria will also be examined in rainfall simulation experiments.  In addition, we will determine the effects of composted manure on nitrogen utilization by corn in a rotational cropping system.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
4,"Objective(s): 1. Assess the dissipation, fate and transport of commonly used broadcast herbicides and fungicides in soil as a function of tillage management.2. Quantify the affect of cropping and tillage systems on soil organic carbon, specifically how changes in soil organic carbon impacts pesticide and nitrogen dynamics, erosion mechanics, sediment generation, and carbon loss associated with extreme events.  This objective contributes to the CLR GRACEnet project.3. Measure hydrologic components (rainfall, runoff, infiltration, soil water content and redistribution following rainfall and irrigation, lateral subsurface flow, plant water use and evapotranspiration so that differences in plant water use and evapotranspiration so that differnces in plant available water as a function of cropping, tillage systems, soil compaction, and rooting density can be quantified.4. Assess the effeciveness of poultry litter as a nutrient source and as a soil amendment in intensely row cropped systems managed to conventional and strip tillage.  Specifically, assess the environmental costs and benefits associated with the use of poultry litter as a nutrient source compared to conventional fertilizer.Approach:Plots located at a UGA research farm in Tift County, GA (N 31o 26', W 83o 35') will be a primary resource for all aspects of the study. Plots were established in 1998 by dividing a 1.8-ha parcel into six 0.15-ha and one 0.4-ha sub-plots.  Since study inception the three 0.15-ha plots on the northern side of the area have been maintained under conventional tillage management. This involves discing, ripping and bedding each spring leaving a residue free seed bed for planting. The other three 0.15-ha plots have been in strip-tillage. In this case crops are planted into 15-cm wide strips tilled into cover crop residue mulch. Rye (Secale cearale L.) cover crops sown each fall on all plots are killed each spring with herbicides. The 0.4-ha plot at the top of the slope was divided equally across the slope by the two tillage practices. It has and will continue to be used for rainfall simulation investigations. During construction, each of the 0.15-ha plots was surrounded by a 0.6 m earthen berm that directs surface flow to metal H-flumes installed at the downslope corners of each plot. Flumes were equipped with pressure transducers and rating curves were developed. Flow (as a function of changes in pressure) is recorded during runoff events. Flow weighted samples are also collected using autosamplers. Additionally two separate loops of 15-cm diameter tile drain were installed at the surface of the argillic horizon with one loop surrounding the 3 strip- and one the 3 conventional-tillage 0.15-ha plots.  H-flumes were installed on tile outlets to measure flow and refrigerated autosamplers are currently being installed so that water samples can be systematically collected for pesticide and nutrient analysis. Monitoring wells were also constructed at up- and downgradient locations of each plot so that shallow groundwater hydraulics and water quality could be monitored. A climate station at the site continuously measures precipitation, wind speed and direction, relative humidity, air temperature, vapor pressure, and solar radiation. Data are used to estimate crop evapotranspiration rates.  Calibration on the instruments will be checked every year.  Evapotranspiration estimates will be used to develop hydrologic budgets for the crops grown at the site and to make comparisons to the evapotranspiration rates calculated from stem-flow measurements.  A solid set irrigation system capable of applying uniformly water to each plot was installed for the study.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

Refine and use agricultural system models to predict the impact of cover crops on crop yield, hydrology, and water quality in tile-drained fields under the different climate and soil conditions in the Midwest Corn Belt.Approach:For objective one, a five-year field study at several sites will evaluate the effectiveness of water table management on nitrate losses and crop yield in subsurface drained agricultural fields.  Essentially, the outlets for subsurface drains in corn-soybean production fields will be raised to within 0.30 m of the surface from harvest until March 15 each year, lowered to 1.2 m from March 15 to June 1, and then raised to 0.60 m from June 1 to harvest.  Measurements will be taken of crop growth, N uptake, and yield; nitrate concentration and load in drainage water; N inputs and outputs; soil organic and inorganic N compounds; and percolation, drainage, and lateral flow.  The agricultural systems model, Root Zone Water Quality Model, will be parameterized to account for the impact of water table management on crop yield, hydrology, and water quality in the tile-drained experimental field.  The model will then be used to predict the impact of water table management under different management scenarios, locations, and climate variations.  For objective two, a five year field study will compare the effectiveness of two small grain winter cover crop systems and in-field wood-chip bioreactors in reducing nitrate losses to subsurface drainage systems in agricultural fields.  An oat and a rye small grain winter cover crop will be planted each in a subsurface drained corn-soybean field.  Additionally, in other treatment plots trenches filled with wood chips will parallel subsurface drainage tiles, such that water moving to the tiles will pass through the wood chip trenches.  Measurements will be taken of crop growth, N uptake, and yield; nitrate concentration and load in drainage water; N inputs and outputs; soil organic and inorganic N compounds; and percolation, drainage, and lateral flow.  The agricultural systems model, Root Zone Water Quality Model, will be parameterized to account for the impact of cover crops on crop yield, hydrology, and water quality in the tile-drained experimental field.

7,"Rice blast disease is caused by a fungus, and is one of the most economically important and destructive diseases of rice and related grasses, including barley, rye and pearl millet. Worldwide, this disease results in major epidemics and yield losses of rice. The utility of two historically important strategies for defeating the rice blast fungus, chemical pesticides and naturally occurring resistance in rice, is severely limited by the fungus' ability to overcome these strategies, rendering them ineffective. If we can pinpoint exactly how the fungus infects, grows within, and reproduces in its host plants, we can more accurately design novel disease control strategies. The ultimate goal of our project is to contribute knowledge towards understanding how the rice blast fungus infects its host plants. A successful infection of the host results from the fungus moving smoothly from one infective life cycle stage to the next, which can only be accomplished by careful control over the expression of its genes. There are several levels of gene control in many organisms ranging from humans to fruit flies. We will specifically target one of these levels, called small RNAs, in the rice blast fungus. Small RNAs are short stretches of nucleic acids that can `match' the sequence of specific genes within a genome. Extensive research on small RNAs has revealed that, along with other jobs, these tiny molecules can control whether a gene will be turned on or off; small RNAs represent a sort of `fine-tuning' mechanism for gene regulation. Thus far, little is known about small RNAs in filamentous fungi, particularly plant parasites; our study aims to fill in these gaps. To do this, we are using several approaches that complement each other; the first approach is genetic and involves `breaking' genes in the fungus that, based on their DNA sequences, might be involved in producing small RNAs. Once we have generated these mutants, we can see whether the small RNAs have disappeared, and what effect this has on growth of the fungus and its ability to infect host plants. Because small RNAs can control gene expression, we will look at expression of all fungal genes when small RNAs are gone (i.e. the mutants). What effect will a lack of small RNAs have on gene expression? What types of genes will be most effected? We can achieve this goal by using microarray technology; microarrays are microscope slides that contain every gene from our fungus. We will put the genetic complement from several of the mutants onto these slides, read the slides using a special scanner, and analyze the data; this data will tell us how genes change when small RNAs are no longer present. Finally, we will sequence small RNAs from the fungus under different environmental conditions, including wild type growth conditions, nutrient starvation, and while infecting the host plant. This will tell us quantity and type of small RNAs produced under different conditions. Together, these three approaches will provide a comprehensive survey into the roles of small RNAs- we will be able to see how they impact gene regulation of the fungus, and how this ties into growth and virulence.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

11,"Objective(s): A major goal of wheat improvement is to identify, isolate, and characterize genes and gene complexes that control value-added traits that can be introduced into commercial cultivars to improve production. Historically, once such gene complexes were identified and characterized they were manipulated into a hexaploid wheat background for improved production. Once the options for trait improvement genes in the available wheat germplasm were exhausted wheat geneticists turned to other members of the Triticeae tribe (cereals) as desirable genetic resources for trait exploitation. However, to date only a few gene complexes from non-wheat related species and genera have been characterized, manipulated and introduced into wheat. The lack of advancement in this area results from an undesirable linkage drag, resulting in low yields, that is associated with the transference of gene complexes from related species. This laboratory has developed methods for the efficient transferring of value-added gene complexes, without linkage drag, from rye into wheat for wheat improvement. This project will utilize these previously developed technologies of chromosomal centric-break and fusion translocations to transfer the value added traits of disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance from rye and wheat-rye hybrids (triticales) to commercially useful hexaploid wheat cultivars. In particular the project will focus on 1. Identifying novel genetic elements associated with resistance to new strains of stem rust linked to rye chromosome 1R within local and world stock collections of triticales and spring ryes for transfer into hexaploid wheat, and 2. Identifying, characterizing and transferring novel genetic elements, regardless of chromosomal location, for resistance to stem and leaf rusts and tolerance to low pH and saline soils for transfer into hexaploid wheat.

13,"Vegetable producers face a growing array of economic and biological constraints including rising labor and energy costs, declining soil health, expansion of pest problems and an increased incidence of extreme weather events. Current energy-intensive vegetable production systems have well-known negative effects on the environment and have also detracted significantly from the economic viability of farming given rising fuel costs. Dependence on energy use can be reduced through adoption of reduced tillage systems and by replacing synthetic fertilizer inputs with nitrogen-fixing and nutrient scavenging cover crops. However, adoption of the systems is constrained by their complex and sometimes negative effects on management of pests. Weeds are particularly problematic in vegetable production and are often a major obstacle to adoption of alternative systems. The objectives of this research are to 1) optimize reduced tillage production systems and evaluate their impact on weed and nutrient management as well as yield and quality of vegetable crops; 2) identify low-cost strategies for integrating energy-saving cover crops into vegetable production systems; and 3) determine the impact of alternative cropping systems and environmental conditions on weed population dynamics and weed management in vegetable crops. Field, greenhouse, and growth chamber studies will be conducted to meet these objectives. Specific cropping systems to be examined in field studies include rye living- mulch in asparagus, and strip-tillage in snap beans and sweet corn production. Laboratory and growth chamber studies will examine the impact of changes in nitrogen dynamics on weed and vegetable seed germination and growth. Results from this research will be disseminated through a variety of forums including written publications in journals, newsletters and web-based bulletins, as well as oral presentations at grower meetings, workshops and scientific conferences.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
14,"Invasive species threaten agricultural productivity and public health, and may further destabilize the species composition of certain native ecosystems. An invading species' population, by definition, must advance from its point of introduction. Consequently, ecologists and conservation biologists seek a predictive understanding of a successful invader's pattern of spatial growth. The proposed research will address biological invasion as a front moving, with some random variation, through a two-dimensional environment. Both the theory and experimentation will explicitly consider an ecologically superior invader competing with a native, resident species. Details of the model for spatially clustered growth of the two species permit application of the theory of kinetic roughening, developed in statistical physics, to predict the quantitative behavior of the invasion process. The results generate novel hypotheses concerning both the velocity of the invasive front's advance and the relative position of the furthest invasive incursion into the resident's habitat. Expected values of these quantities depend on the length of the invading front; hence they depend predictably on the linear size of the habitat invaded. Once results for a constant physical environment have been identified, spatial competition in a time-varying environment will be investigated. Field experiments, using a rye grass-clover system, will be used to test hypotheses generated by the models.A greater understanding of links between individual-level interactions and a population's spatial growth will increase our ability to predict how invasive species, emerging infections, and evolutionary adaptations spread across ecological landscapes.

EE is thought to be mediated by both IgE and non-IgE mediated food allergy.  The majority of patients with EE (50-80%) are atopic based on the co-existence of EE with atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and/or asthma.  In addition, the vast majority of EE patients have food allergen specific IgE based on immediate hypersensitivity skin tests or measurement of allergen specific IgE in blood.  Approximately 75% of EE subjects had increased total IgE levels.  Approximately two thirds of children with EE have positive immediate hypersensitivity skin tests to at least one food allergen.  The mean number of positive food immediate hypersensitivity skin tests ranges from 3-6 positive tests per subject with EE.  The most common foods reported to be positive in EE by skin immediate hypersensitivity skin test included common food allergens (i.e. peanut, egg, milk, soy, wheat) as well as beans, rye, and beef.  Dietary therapy is considered an effective therapy in children diagnosed with EE.Objective/Hypothesis:  Although studies of the genetics of EE are in their infancy, the importance of genes to the development of EE has been demonstrated in studies showing an important association of EE with a SNP in the eotaxin-3 gene, a chemokine gene important to eosinophil chemotaxis into tissues such as the esophagus.  In this study, we are particularly interested in identifying genes in EE linked to a significant complication of EE namely esophageal stricture formation.  Esophageal stricture formation is a significant complication of EE resulting in food impactions and emergency room visits.  Thus, identifying genes which contribute to esophageal remodeling and esophageal stricture formation may lead to biomarkers to detect patients at risk of this complication, as well as potential novel therapies.Specific Aims:  The focus of the genetic studies in EE, we have proposed has two specific aims: 1)  Does expression of TGF-b and the TGF-b TT genotype promote the development of remodeling in EE? 2)  Does inhibition of AMCase reduce the development of eosinophilic inflammation, OVA food allergen specific IgE, and esophageal remodeling in egg induced EE ?Study Design:  We will characterize SNPs in two candidate genes of esophageal remodeling (TGF-b, acidic chitinase) in patients with EE (n= 200), as well as in controls (n= 200) matched for age, gender, and ethnic background.  Levels of esophageal remodeling and expression of TGF-b and acidic chitinase will be quantitated in esophageal biopsies.  The importance of TGF-b and acidic chitinase to the development of egg-induced remodeling of the esophagus will be studied in a mouse model in which either TGF-b signaling is inhibited or acidic chitinase activity is neutralized.Impact:  This study focuses on increasing our understanding of two genes associated with remodeling and stricture formation in the esophagus in EE.

17,"Stem rust is a major disease of cereal crops (wheat, barley, oat and rye) as well as important grasses including timothy, tall fescue and perennial ryegrass. Historically, stem rust has been controlled by introducing resistance genes in commercial cultivars. However, epidemics have occurred and are caused by a race shift in the pathogen population. The latest threat arose in 1999 when a new highly virulent strain, Ug99 (race TTKSK) was identified in Uganda and has since spread into Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen and recently Iran. Ug99 and its variants threaten most of the barley and wheat grown worldwide. The research proposed herein will initiate the work of identifying and characterizing avirulence genes in stem rust races. Once the avirulence genes and proteins are identified and characterized it will allow better understanding of how stem rust races shift their virulence/avirulence characteristics and provide knowledge for developing genes that confer long-term durable resistance.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

21,"Currently, corn ethanol provides 3% of the US gasoline supply but consumes 30% of US corn crop, increasing the price of corn. Therefore, cellulosic ethanol from waste biomass would be an ideal source for ethanol production but would require development of new technology. We have recently produced several biomass degrading enzymes in tobacco chloroplasts. Based on three cuttings of tobacco in one year, 49, 64 and 10,751 million units of three important enzymes can be obtained each year. Based on enzyme activity observed in plant crude extracts, there is no need for purification. Therefore, excluding processing cost, enzymes could be produced 1000-3000 fold less expensive than current commercial recombinant enzymes. We have demonstrated for the first time that plant-derived enzyme cocktails enhanced hydrolysis of wood or citrus peel, releasing more fermentable sugars than commercial cocktails. Therefore, in this project, we propose to express in tobacco chloroplasts different classes of biomass degrading enzymes including endoglucanases, exoglucanases, lipases, pectate lyases, xylanases, acetyl xylan esterases, beta glucosidases, mannannase, lignin peroxidase, arabinofuranosidase, etc from bacterial and fungal genes. We will also express enzymes that increase their access for enhanced hydrolysis like cutinase and swollenin (expansin). Enzyme cocktails will be optimized to hydrolyze a variety of waste biomass including corn stover, rye straw, wood pulp, switchgrass, sugar cane bagasse or citrus peel to release fermentable sugars. Commercial production of recombinant enzymes in fermentation systems is limited by both higher cost and lower production capacity. Both these concerns will be addressed by chloroplast-derived enzyme cocktails. &#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
22,"(A) IPM Coordination - We will maintain a coordinated IPM effort and use these efforts to leverage funding from other sources. Current programs will be maintained that result in increased profits to producers and reduced environmental impacts. New innovative IPM programs will include new clientele and incorporate higher level IPM technologies. (B) Agronomic Crops - New sampling guidelines and treatment thresholds will be adopted by producers resulting in improved decision making and reduced losses from insect and disease pests on up to 10,000 acres of soybeans. New fact sheets will be developed to help growers not involved in the demonstrations better manage these insect and disease pests. A new focus on SCN education will be used by seed companies to further their development of SCN resistant varieties for Delaware. It will also result in improved nematode management and reduced crop losses through soil sampling and increased use of crop rotation on up to 30,000 acres of soybeans. New threshold and disease forecasting information will help wheat growers make better insect and disease management decisions resulting in improved crop quality and yield on 20% of the statewide acreage. Clients will improve their knowledge of the emerging/reemerging pests and the integrated pest management methods that are most appropriate to avoid economic losses. (C) Vegetables- Cucurbit programs can result in reduced sprays for insects and diseases; increased worker safety and a two fold reduction in the amount of active ingredients in the environment when using seed treatments compared to at planting insecticide; and improved timing of fungicide applications and prevention of economic losses from downy mildew in pickling cucumbers. Producers will increase the adoption of cover crops (particularly cereal rye) on 30% for no-till pumpkin acreage by improving weed control through use of the shielded sprayer. Although the overall success of the soil health program cannot be easily measured in a one year period, it is expected that 25-50 vegetable growers will adopt these practices on farm as a result of this program initiative.

23,"Objective(s): The overall objective is to refine and improve existing simulation models for corn and potato by developing new, and improving existing functional relationships between physiological processes and nutrients in the soil and plant tissues.  Results of this research will be used to address existing knowledge gaps in the models.  The modified models will be evaluated by testing simulated responses at plant component and whole plant levels. The specific sub-objectives are to improve simulation of the above- and below-ground potato and corn processes in the areas of: (1) water and nutrient stress effects on growth, development, morphology, and yield, and (2) response of root growth and activity (water and nutrient uptake) to soil nutrients (N, P and K), and water.  The model and new components will be evaluated using experimental data.  The potato and corn models, along with a rye cover crop model and existing models for soybean and corn, will then be used for assessment of the environmental consequences of agricultural management practices on carbon sequestration and nutrient balances.  These practices include fertilizer applications, rotations, and cover crops.Approach:Mechanistic models for soybean (GLYCIM), cotton (GOSSYM), corn (MAIZSIM) and potato (SPUDSIM) have been developed in previous projects by this group. The proposed research will broaden the capabilities of the corn and potato models by utilizing data from experiments carried out in unique, state-of-the-art sun-lit growth chambers and field plots. Short and long term experiments will be employed to test hypotheses and develop algorithms for plant processes to be used in the computer models. Data collected by collaborators will be used to test and evaluate the models. A simple Rye model will be developed to simulate a cover crop during the fall-winter season. A computer graphical user interface will be developed using components from the existing software program, GUICS, to allow a user to simulate long term crop rotations over multiple growing seasons. Advanced data management capabilities will be added to the interface to help with interpretation and management of input and output data.  Tools for weather generation and estimation of soil hydraulic properties will be added to the interface to provide a wide range of environmental conditions for assessment.

Approach:Hypothesis 1.A û High-residue conservation tillage systems save water in Coastal Plain corn production while maintaining or improving productivity.  Soil, plant and remotely sensed data are quantified in irrigated corn-cotton-peanut rotations at Camilla and Tifton, GA with U of GA scientists to evaluate variable tillage, residue, and irrigation regimes. Ground based and remotely sensed data provide instantaneous and non-destructive spatial measures of crop response. Treatments are: conventional tillage (CT) no cover crop and strip-till (ST) with rye, and irrigation treatments: (1) no-irrigation; (2) full irrigation, maintaining soil water tension above 30 mb; (3) irrigation beginning at V10; and (4) irrigation beginning at V14.Hypothesis 1.B ûPasture management strategies designed to maintain nutrients (N and P) in the rooting zone and/or remove nutrients through harvested products will increase profitability and decrease N and P losses to streams in Piedmont systems.  Systems are evaluated on-farm using eight Piedmont stream-side fields.

Soil chemical (C, N, and P) and physical properties, water quality data (N & P) upstream, downstream, and surface runoff, are combined with agronomic costs to estimate environmental impact.Hypothesis 2 û Grazing winter cover crops in a conservation system will impact cotton production and economic return, and negatively affect soil properties influencing water quality and water and nutrient availability.  the winter rye cover crop is grazed in the spring and compared to fields that are not grazed. Cotton is planted in May and spatially delineated areas are sampled for biomass, plant height, and nutrient status at first bloom and mid-bloom to determine grazing and landscape effects.

While farmers may consider moving to an organic system, continuity of economic viability during the transition from conventional to organic farming systems is a serious challenge. There is little scientific, organic-based information for farmers as they choose among the options available for the build-up of soil organic matter, maintenance of soil fertility, crops and cultivars, and disease and insect pest management practices. Improved understanding of the processes that occur during the transition to mature organic production systems is necessary to ensure the economic success of organic farming systems.Replacing 5305-21620-011-00D (9.08).",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
26,"Plants differ in their capacity to grow at and survive low temperatures. At one extreme are tropical-climate cereals such as maize and rice that suffer chilling injury when exposed to 10C for an extended period; while at the other extreme are the temperate-climate cereals such as wheat, barley, and rye that are capable of surviving the temperate-climate winter. This ability to survive the temperate-climate winter is known as winter hardiness. Two key genetic loci are now known to affect winter hardiness, Frost Resistance-1 (FR-1) and FR-2. The FR-1 locus is tightly linked to VRN-1, a gene that determines whether these cereal plants require an extended period of low, nonfreezing temperatures to induce flowering, while FR-2 encompasses a cluster of genes encoding C-Repeat Binding Factor (CBF) proteins, which are DNA binding proteins that activate genetic and biochemical pathways conferring freezing tolerance. A question of fundamental importance in the quest to understand how these cereals survive freezing temperatures is whether FR 1 and VRN 1 are the manifestation of the same gene, or are the affects of two tightly-linked and inseparable genes. Recent studies also indicate that VRN-1/FR-1 is a negative regulator of the CBF genes at FR-2 suggesting that an important aspect of winter hardiness is mediated not only by these two loci but through interactions between them. Multiple lines of evidence also suggest that FR-1 and FR-2 affect drought tolerance, a trait much more difficult to measure, quantify, and breed for than low temperature tolerance. Goals of the work proposed here are (1) to better understand the nature of the interaction between VRN-1/FR-1 and FR-2, (2) to gain greater insight into the regulation of the CBF genes at FR-2 in the absence of the negative affects of VRN-1/FR-1, (3) and to integrate this information with a more complete structural analysis of the FR-2 locus. These studies will contribute fundamental knowledge that will allow for the enhanced productivity of cereal plants through increased tolerances to freezing and drought conditions.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
27,"With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is renewing support for the work of Professor James B. Gloer of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa. With his collaborators, Patrick F. Dowd and Donald T. Wicklow of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Professor Gloer is isolating new natural organic compounds from fungi. The project will continue this distinctive research program in fungal natural products chemistry. Primary focus will be placed on chemical studies of mycoparasitic/fungicolous fungi, and on fungal endophytes that occur in cereal crop plants. Mycoparasitic/fungicolous fungi attack and colonize other fungi in nature. Invasion by these colonists often involves antibiosis toward the host, and therefore, such colonists may be valuable, underexplored sources of natural antifungal agents. Results from prior NSF support provide strong evidence for the validity of this hypothesis. Efforts during the proposed grant period will focus on completion of the studies of a collection of nearly 800 diverse fungal colonists obtained from varied microclimates found on the island of Hawaii. A second direction follows from the discovery that isolates of widespread corn endophytes produce natural products of various types that show antagonistic activity against other, competing fungi encountered in corn plants, including important disease-causing and mycotoxin-producing species. Studies of the occurrence and significance of these metabolites will continue, and will be expanded to include fungi from other crop plants (rye, wheat, barley, sorghum), and a limited number of prairie grasses, in search of further metabolites that show similar biological effects and potential significance. In both projects, the search for new chemistry is guided by assays for activity against two important fungal species and/or an agriculturally important insect pest. An assay for Hsp90 activity will also be included based on a discovery in the most recent grant period that a common corn endophyte produces a potent inhibitor of Hsp90 function. Many new bioactive natural products have been discovered through these hypothesis-guided studies, and further success is expected because of the relatively unexplored nature of these fungal groups. Antifungal and antiinsectan agents are of potential practical value to society in agriculture and medicine, and can also be valuable as tools to assist in discovery of new modes of action. Findings from this project are also expected to contribute to fundamental scientific knowledge in other disciplines, including fungal ecology, taxonomy, biodiversity, crop/food science, and evolutionary biology.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

29,"This project will address several issues related to identifying and mitigating constraints that are limiting more widespread adoption of diverse no-till rotations in the States of South Dakota, North Dakota, and Nebraska. There is a policy/marketing component that will survey farmers in all three States and define quantitatively factors that producer's identify as those keeping them from using diverse crop rotation no-till systems. A second component will involve animal scientist that will explore the potential use of diverse crops for livestock feed. These projects will specifically consider peas as feed for dairy and range cattle, pea forage for growing beef cattle, and cold-pressed oilseed (camelina) meal as a source of protein and energy in swine diets. Utilizing the products of these crops locally or on the farm minimizes transportation costs. The last component will consider the potential of optimizing the inter-crop fallow periods. Treatments will evaluate the potential of using inter-crop fallow periods to grow cover-crops that utilize the excess water to compete with weeds, sequester or fix nitrogen, enhance microbial activity, and encourage beneficial insects. The potential of using these crops as a forage resource will also be examined. These systems will be evaluated across the moisture gradient of the humid and arid parts of the Northern Great Plains. Plant breeders will evaluate cultivars and germplasm of oats, rye, millet, and legumes for their potential as a inter-crop cover crop.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
30,"Crops compete with weeds. The goal in all production systems is to tip the competitive balance to favor the crop over the weed. The choice of crop variety is of utmost importance in this battle. If a variety is  competitive  it will emerge well under stressful conditions, capture moisture, light, and available nutrients, suppress weeds, and be tolerant of insect pests and diseases. For centuries plant breeders have been selecting for varieties that have the highest yields under pest-free and nutrient-rich conditions. Organic farmers need varieties that perform well under their production systems which may differ in nutrient availability and pest pressure compared with conventional systems. In conventional production systems navy bean cultivars yield more than black bean cultivars. However, black beans produced greater yields than navy beans in organic trials. These yield differences in dry bean class and variety may in part be due to differences in nitrogen fixation and uptake by bean root systems. Nitrogen availability in organic systems is largely dependent on the crop rotation, including the planting of cover crops. Red clover is a common cover crop which when tilled into the soil supplies an available form of nitrogen for the following crop. Rye and oilseed radish are not legumes, but both may increase nitrogen availability to dry beans by mineralization of nitrogen during the summer months. By researching the incorporation of cover crops into organic dry bean production systems we will determine which cover crop (or lack thereof) supports the nodulation and uptake of nitrogen for optimum seed yield in organic dry bean production systems. Including cover crops prior to planting dry beans may help in weed suppression. Some cover crops such as cereal rye suppress germinating weed seedlings due to release of allelopathic compounds. However, weed suppression by these compounds is short-lived and therefore producers must manage emerging weeds by other means, including rotary hoeing and cultivation. The vigor of the dry bean variety is very important because it is difficult to cultivate weeds when the crop is not growing vigorously. Furthermore, cover crop residues may assist or hinder weed management by mechanical methods in the weeks following dry bean planting. On-farm trials will provide much needed information on how to manage weeds in cover crop/no cover crop residue situations in organic dry bean production. Organic dry bean producers must also manage insect and disease pests. In this regard cover crops can be either a help or a hindrance. For example,  Colonel  oilseed radish is a well known variety that suppresses nematode pests. On the other hand, if beans are planted too close to the incorporation of a cover crop insects like seed corn maggot can become a problem. Western bean cutworm is a relatively new pest that is of concern to all dry bean producers. It is currently unclear what role dry bean variety and cover crops play in negating or enhancing the infestation of this pest.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
31,"Vast areas of semiarid rangelands in the western U.S. are severely disturbed, frequently burned, increasingly eroded, and subsequently infested with troublesome weeds such as cheatgrass, medusahead rye, and others. Reseeding these disturbed rangelands with genetically improved plant materials that are competitive enough (seedling establishment and persistence) to replace existing undesirable vegetation is often the most plausible and economically feasible way to reclaim such sites. With the increased emphasis on establishing a biologically diverse ecosystem of native and introduced plant materials on these disturbed sites, there is a need for improved native grasses and legumes that can compete with invasive weeds. Within the native grasses, little effort has focused on their breeding, selection, and cultivar development. Until improved native plant materials have been developed that are competitive with invasive weeds, easy to establish, and persistent, it is critical to continue to improve introduced plant materials with increased seedling vigor and drought and defoliation tolerance with increased persistence. Failure to do so will result in increased fire frequency, loss of soil structure, increased soil erosion, and economically unproductive rangelands. Attaining the objectives will generate improved and economically available plant materials that will provide rangeland and pasture managers with critically important plants required to improve forage availability, renovate disturbed areas, reduce soil erosion, and generally improve water quality.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Data collected by the author (Shaik, S 2007a) from historical census of agriculture and the National Agricultural Statistical Services reveals that the number of farms in North Dakota has declined from 74,400 in 1910 to 30,300 in 2006. The corresponding acreage amount of farms in North Dakota increased from 28,427 thousand acres to 39,400 thousand acres leading to an increase in farm size from 382 acres to 1,300 acres. A century ago, North Dakota was overwhelmingly a wheat state; today the leading crops are oil crops. According to North Dakota Agricultural Statistical Service publication, the state ranks first in the production of barley, durum wheat, spring wheat, all dry edible beans, pinto beans, navy beans, sunflower, canola, flaxseed, oats, dry edible peas. It ranks second in all wheat, lentils and honey, third in sugar beets and rye; fourth in potatoes, and tenth in soybeans. The farm receipts increased from 0.257 billion nominal dollars in 1924 to 3.98 billion nominal dollars in 2006. During the same time period, the crop and livestock receipts increased from 0.197 and 0.60 billion nominal dollars to 3.089 and 0.897 billion nominal dollars respectively. These changes in North Dakota due to technological improvements, farm programs, farm crop insurance programs and public investments will be quantified for the fourteen (including the 2008 farm bill) major farm bills since 1933.

33,"Winter annual cover crops, winter rye (Secale cereale) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa roth.), can reduce weed density and build soil health in organic production systems. There is considerable interest in integrating cover crops and reduced tillage with organic vegetable production; but few studies have been conducted in regions with short growing seasons and cool soils such as the upper Midwest. We evaluated no-tillage production of tomato, zucchini, cauliflower, and bell pepper planted into winter rye, hairy vetch, and a winter rye-hairy vetch mixture that were mechanically suppressed with a roller-crimper at two locations in Minnesota. Average marketable yields of tomato, zucchini, and bell pepper in the cover crops were reduced 58-87%, 27-75% and 62-92%, respectively, compared to a no-cover control. Winter rye and the mixture reduced average annual weed density at St. Paul by 96% for 8-10 weeks after rolling (WAR) and hairy vetch mulch had 80% control for 2-8 WAR; while at Lamberton, there was no consistent effect of cover treatments on weed populations. Winter rye and the mixture had higher average residue biomass (5.3 and 5.7 Mg&#8901;ha-1) than hairy vetch (3.0 Mg&#8901;ha-1) throughout the season while hairy vetch consistently had higher tissue N concentration. Cover crop mulches reduced soil temperature by 2.9 degrees to 5.7 degrees C compared to a no-cover control for 4-5 weeks after planting which delayed vegetable growth and could have contributed to poorer yields in the cover crop mulches. In addition, low levels of soil N (<10 mg N kg-1) in the top 15 cm in under all cover crop mulches likely resulted in nutrient deficiency symptoms and reduced vegetable yields. Spring rolled winter annual cover crops show promise for controlling annual weeds in organic no-tillage systems, but there is need to reduce the impact of the rolled over crops on the yield of organic vegetables in the upper Midwest.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

The objectives of the proposed project will be to simulate runoff, sediment and nutrient losses from the watersheds associated with different land uses comprising pasture, woodland, cropland, and to perform long-term scenario analysis to implement the best management practices (BMPs) for improving soil and water quality, and enhancing crop yield. Experimental site, located at the North Appalachian Experimental Watershed (NAEW), Coshocton-Ohio, and Muskingum River Watershed in Ohio.

38,"The United States (US) is the world's fifth largest producer of watermelons. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, the state of Georgia is ranked second in the US for watermelon production (9,700 ha harvested; $76 million in crop value) and third for cantaloupe (2000 ha harvested; $51 million crop value). Within the state of Georgia, watermelons and cantaloupes are the 1st and 9th most valuable vegetable crops. Successful weed management is vital to the production of quality watermelons and cantaloupes. Weeds compete with crops for light, space, nutrients and water, which, in turn reduce yields. Currently, fumigants (including methyl bromide) are the primary means of managing weedy pests, with Palmer amaranth and nutsedge being the greatest weedy challenges. As methyl bromide is being removed from the market, it is critical that an integrated program using both chemical and cultural control that is economically sustainable be developed. Cover crops can suppress weeds by serving as a physical barrier to emergence, by inhibiting germination via reduced light transmittance and, sometimes, allelopathic effects, and by preventing herbicide loss through runoff and leaching. These efforts are designed to help growers eliminate the use of methyl bromide, reduce the need of other fumigants, and adopt economically sustainable systems using rye cover crop residue and herbicides.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
39,"The long term goal of this project is to eliminate insect pests from the US food and feed supply with a sensor device, minimize exposure of humans and animals to residual chemicals or insecticides, and reduce financial losses due to grain damage. The lesser grain borer (LGB) is a devastating, long-lived pest of stored wheat, corn and other cereal grains in the US and other parts of the world. Adults and larvae are voracious feeders causing damaged kernels, insect fragments in milled products, powdery residues (frass), a characteristic pungent odor, price discounts, and possible rejection of commodity. The LGB can penetrate many types of packaging material including seed sacks in addition to sound grain. Grain production, storage, and processing are important industries. More than 12 billion bushels of corn and wheat are grown in the US each year with a value exceeding $25 billion. Additionally, over a billion bushels of barley, oats, rice, rye, and sorghum are grown each year with a value over $3 billion. It has been estimated that 5-10% of stored grain in developed countries and 35% of stored grain in developing countries is lost to insect damage. Because of the extensive reach of this insect, there is also very broad societal benefit in achieving widespread use of effective sensors for detecting the insects early. Estimates of the cost of grain loss due to insect, mold, and mycotoxin damage to the 15 billion bushels of grain stored in the US each year have ranged from $500 million to more than $1 billion. Domestic flour millers have a low tolerance for live insects: their presence signs of insect feeding can result in grain rejection. Rejection produces additional fumigation and transportation expenses, as much as 10-20% of the grain value. The foundation of a successful integrated pest management (IPM) program is an effective monitoring system. SDC declares that it can provide that foundation with its sensor device. SDC has two objectives in this proposal: 1) Modify the preliminary prototype device for LGB detection, using basic and applied knowledge, and compare its performance and efficacy with current methods in a field test and 2) Demonstrate uniqueness and the concentration levels of marker pheromones associated with infestations of the LGB. SDC's hypothesis is that specific organic volatiles can be good markers to differentiate insects infesting stored crops from other harmless emanations, e.g. gases associated with normal crop odor, or other MVOCs. Marker biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from this insect, the aggregation pheromones dominicalene 1 and dominicalene 2, are found in sufficient concentrations in the headspace in enclosures containing these insects to permit detection with SDC's highly sensitive and selective sensor device. SDC is confident that this work will result in a complete sensor device that can be used effectively to detect BVOCs from lesser grain borers, relate those BVOCs to LGB infestation size, and provide the information needed by farmers and elevator operators to take action to prevent infestation growth in our food and feed supply.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
40,"The Comparison of Biofuel Cropping Systems (COBS) project at Iowa State University is designed to provide a quantitative, side-by-side comparison of annual- and perennial-based bioenergy cropping systems. By comparing perennial species that are well adapted to the North Central region with corn-based cropping systems, this project is centered on bioenergy crops that may become high-impact feedstocks at a national scale, that is, feedstocks with the agronomically sustainable potential for production of at least 100 million dry metric tonnes per year. Perennial crops are less dependent than annual crops on energy-intensive inputs, such as nitrogen fertilizer and herbicides, and more resilient to climate stress, such as drought and flooding. The results of this research will have significant implications for evaluating carbon cycling in the production of bioenergy feedstocks as well as the potential for bioenergy cropping systems to be part of the country's agricultural strategies to adapt to climate change and to mitigate the effects of climate change in vulnerable parts of agricultural ecosystems. The feedstock production systems compared in a replicated field study include: continuous corn grown for grain and stover (with and without a winter cover crop), a multi-species mixture of perennial prairie plants (with and without fertilizer addition), and a conventional corn-soybean cash grain rotation for baseline comparison. Our working hypotheses are that (1) mixtures of perennial species used for biofuel feedstocks may result in greater net carbon storage and lower export of excess nutrients than corn-based feedstock production systems, and (2) cover crops such as rye will reduce net carbon and nutrient losses from corn production systems. The theme of the proposed research is to explore interactions among (1) land management for agricultural production; and (2) greenhouse gas fluxes and net carbon sequestration (or loss) as a result of land use decisions. Our end-to-end study will monitor fundamental chemical, biological, and physical processes in soil and then use those observations to support end-user decision tools.

41,"NY dairy producers and consultants have been asking us to conduct this research for several years as they gained knowledge in nutrient management and potential N loss pathways through our collaborative work these past 7 years. The cover crop surveys being conducted at the moment indicate the need for on-farm work on N dynamics of cover crops as one of the top questions related to cover crop use. Species comparisons will be conducted at three research farms using rye, triticale, tillage radishes and oats. In addition, two dairy producers will implement trials on their farms. With them, we will develop an implementation scheme and sampling protocol and producers and their advisors will participate in data collection. Producers will be featured in fact sheets and popular press publications. Consultants and CCE educators will be involved in selecting farms and field sites for this effort and participate in data collection and research findings dissemination. If optimum corn yield can be obtained at lower N application rates for corn following a cover crop, this will reduce costs to producers by at least $20 to $30/acre, and presents a corresponding reduction of losses of N to the environment (through capture of end-of-season nitrate and slow release of N from cover crop decomposition in the spring), as well as reduce reliance on fossil fuel needed to produce, distribute and apply N fertilizer. In addition, expansion of the acreage in cover crops will enhance soil conservation and reduce risk of soil erosion. We expect to publish numerous extension articles and talks, establish a webpage within the Cornell Nutrient Management Spear Program website (http://nmsp.cals.cornell.edu) with updates on the project, and develop postcards with final results, etc. with the expectation to reach at least 75% of the corn growers in the state and impact their decision making in future years.

Approach: Field experiments will be conducted at three locations, each using 3 treatments: zero, intermediate, and full stover removal. We will measure soil organic carbon (SOC) changes and gas exchange. Research will also be conducted at the UMNÆs Rosemount Research and Outreach Center (ROC) and on private farm fields in MN. Research at Rosemount will take place in two 20 ha fields with similar soil types, one managed as a conventional corn-soybean rotation; the other in a corn-soybean rotation, but with winter rye cover crop seeded by helicopter in late summer. Latent and sensible heat flux and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 will be measured by eddy covariance. Yield and ancillary soil, physiological and micrometeorological variables will also be measured for 4-years. Soil sampling for SOC analysis will be conducted biennially. Data will be used to test a model of rye production and water use (RyeGro). Field research will also be conducted at Rosemount MN and Arlington WI, supplemented by greenhouse research in St. Paul.

Biochar will be applied at 20,000 lb ac-1. Three other biochar treatments, derived from macadamia nut, wood pellet, and lump hardwood charcoal, will also be evaluated. Biochar production temperatures will be varied according to constant heating time and thermal time equivalency tests. Experiments will be conducted to examine impact of post-processing of biochar by thermally or chemically activation. All biochars will be analyzed for elemental composition, surface area, thermal stability, and CEC. Incubations will assess the impacts of biochar amendments on GHG production. For the greenhouse studies, 5 different specialty crops will be investigated with respect to biochar impacts on germination, growth, and uptake of volatile chemicals. Lab incubation experiments will be conducted to evaluate the inhibition of ammonium and nitrite oxidation rate due to the presence of free ammonia and free nitrous acid. Three different soils used for corn production in MN, IA, and eastern Canada will be examined.

Each main plot will first be randomly sub-divided by N rate so that each subplot will receive the same total N rate during the growing season, with N rate levels of 0, 7.5, 15, 20 and 25 g N m-2. Each N rate treatment will then be randomly sub-divided into two timing treatment sub-subplots consisting of (a) a single pre-plant urea application, or (b) two split post-plant urea applications.

45,"Objective(s): Identify factors, such as soil properties and plant species, that influence microbial community structure and function in order to develop management systems that optimize ecosystem services and maximize sustainability.  Approach: A.  Eight Maryland soils were chosen that varied in pH, texture, organic C, and land use. After collection soils were sieved and maintained at field moisture levels at 4 ?C. Soil water potential curves were determined. Soils were incubated in Mason jars under controlled conditions to systematically vary soil moisture, soil temperature, soil pH, soil texture, and amendments with organic amendments. Soil samples are analyzed for microbial community structure by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. B. Using the same soils as in (A), a variety of crop and weed seeds will be planted in each soil in pots, using 1 plant species per pot in a full factorial of plant species x soil with 6 replicates. Crop plant species will include cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), while weed species will include smooth pigweed (Amaranthus hybridus), and giant foxtail (Setaria faberi). Soil and rhizosphere samples will be analyzed by TRFLP, PLFA, and pyrosequencing. C. We have a collection of 20 air-dried soils, collected in Maryland, that vary in pH, soil texture, and land use. Cucumber seeds will be planted in each soil and seedlings grown to select soils that will support cucumber growth with minimal disease. A subset of 8 soils will be chosen that maximize variation in pH and texture.  Cucumber seeds will be planted in pots filled with these soils with and without prior seed inoculation with the biocontrol agent Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5.  Colony forming units (CFU) of an antibiotic (rifampicin) resistant mutant of Pf5 will be determined by dilution-plating onto selective media containing rifampicin.  As the cucumber plants grow rhizosphere soil samples (six replicates per treatment) will be taken and used directly to determine the population density  of Pf-5 and frozen at -20 ?C for analysis of rhizosphere community structure by TRFLP, PLFA, and pyrosequencing.  D. We are collaborating with ARS scientists in a variety of locations, including Beltsville, MD; Watkinsville, Georgia; Brookings, South Dakota; Morris, MN; Prosser, WA; and Urbana, IL.  They are using rye and/or vetch cover crops as part of their management systems. Bulk soil samples (0-15 cm depth) from three to four replicate plots, with treatments including rye, vetch, and bare soil, are being sent to us twice annually ( spring and fall) and being stored at -20 ?C.

46,"Objective(s): 1) Quantify the effects of soil management practices and amendments, including humic substances, to enhance soil organic matter and carbon and nitrogen dynamics for improving soil productivity. 2) Measure the impact of soil management practices that will increase soil aggregation, reduce compaction, affect crusting, and minimize trace gas exchange processes within Midwestern soils for enhanced soil productivity and environmental quality. 3) Develop sustainable biofuel feedstock production systems using soil quality assessment tools to ensure the practices sustain productivity and protect soil, water and air resources.  Approach: Biochemical analyses will be used to distinguish between labile and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter to improve the knowledge base regarding the effects of residue management on short-term soil processes (nutrient cycling, soil structure, and crust formation) and long-term carbon sequestration. This basic knowledge will then be applied to current production problems associated with providing sustainable supplies of bioenergy feedstock and enhancing grain yields to help meet ever-increasing food and feed demands. Utilizing corn, soybean, and small grain (i.e. rice, rye, and wheat) cropping systems, soil management practices to increase corn growth and grain yield will be evaluated in multiple field experiments. Various single-pass corn stover harvest and crop management strategies, cover crops, crop rotations, and tillage intensity will provide the crop production systems within which soil quality will be measured and the chemical nature and cycling of soil organic matter fractions will be quantified using seasonal analyses of amino acids, amino sugars, carbohydrates, phenols, and fatty acids. Effects of soil aeration on the decomposition of crop residues and the subsequent quality of soil organic matter, efficiency of nitrogen (N) cycling, and crop grain yield will be quantified in these experiments. The soil biochemical measurements coupled with soil physical process measurements will be used to augment the knowledge base related to soil quality assessment at plot scales for potential extension to field scale assessments. Project results will quantify the effects of crop residue management on soil physical and biochemical properties contributing to economic yields and long-term sustainability of major cereal cropping systems, leading to improved soil management practices.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
47,"PI: Joseph Kieber (University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill)CoPIs: G. Eric Schaller (Dartmouth College) and Ann Loraine (University of North Carolina - Charlotte)Cytokinins are plant hormones that regulate many traits of agricultural importance, including the control of grain size and yield. In this project, genomic approaches will be used to uncover how cytokinin regulates growth and development in rice, using this plant species as a model to understand the regulation of grain size and yield in all cereals. Computational approaches will be used to interrogate and integrate the datasets generated by these studies. It is expected that these studies will illuminate the role of cytokinins in panicle development, and will provide specific information on how cytokinins regulate grain development in an agriculturally important crop. Because of conservation of gene sequence among cereals, information obtained from the study of rice may be applied to other agriculturally important species such as maize, wheat, barley, rye, and sorghum. This project will enhance the infrastructure of research and education by providing training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers. A computation workshop will broaden the ability of the research community to use genomics resources. In addition, through partnerships with local groups including the Montshire Museum of Science (http://montshire.org/), programs aimed at fostering science education in grades K-12 will be created and maintained.

48,"Producing healthy food for the expected 9 billion people without harming the environment is one of the society's grand global challenges. Ecosystem services provided by the soil food web are the basis of sustainability in all terrestrial ecosystems, but these webs in agroecosystems are degraded, short and dominated by opportunists at the entry level. Organic farming systems enhance soil quality and biodiversity, but data on their impact on environmental outcomes are lacking. Here we propose to fill this knowledge gap by evaluating the impact of a novel combination of no-till, multi-functional cover crops, and organic amendments as tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O) and NH3 volatilization, increase carbon sequestration and N and P accumulation, reduce nutrient losses by soil erosion and leaching, increase soil food web structural and functional diversity, increase energy flow in soil ecosystems, decrease weed and insect pressure, and enhance natural biocontrol activity in a corn-soybeans-spelt rotation on long-term organic farms and transitioning experimental plots fully equipped with run-off and leaching facilities. Multi-functional cover crops will include winter pea and crimson clover (N-fixers), oats and cereal rye (weed suppressors) and oilseed radish (reactive N and P recycler, compaction alleviator, and disease minimizer) and organic amendment will be the mined Zeolite (reactive N trapper).

Objective 2: Analyze replication of Tomato spotted wilt virus in the plant host and thrips vector through quantification of replicative forms of the virion during infection. Objective 3: Quantify the aster yellows phytoplasma load in the leafhopper, determine the relationship of AYp load to successful transmission of disease to the carrot host, and use this information to improve detection of the aster yellows phytoplasma in the insect under field conditions.Approach:For Objective 1: Our initial microarray analysis identified approximately 1200 genes that are regulated by GacS/GacA. During this project period, we will analyze the affect of bacterial growth conditions on gene expression including varying pH, iron availability and liquid vs. solid media. High quality RNA will be prepared using our standard bacterial protocol. RNAs will be used to probe commercially available genomic expression arrays containing oligo DNA markers for all 3,840 genes within the B728a genome. The vendor performs standardized hybridization protocols, with the chip data processed by the SY using proprietary software. Changes in gene expression will be confirmed using real-time RT-qPCR. Genes that show differential expression under the various growth conditions will be mutated and their effect on plant virulence determined.For Objective 2: We developed real-time RT-qPCR primers to quantify the total RNA species produced by Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). We will use primers specific to non-coding regions to determine the amount of virion and virion complementary RNA. The mRNAs of TSWV are capped but not poly(A) tailed. We will use methods that specifically enrich capped mRNA to distinguish between the mRNA, virion RNA, and virion-complementary RNA produced by TSWV infection. The viral RNA will be quantified by real-time RT-qPCR using our standard protocols. Expression of TSWV mRNAs during plant infection will be compared to the expression of these RNAs during infection of the insect vector, thrips. The virus is only acquired by 1st instar larval thrips. We will quantify TSWV replication and gene expression in populations of larval and adult thrips.For Objective 3: We will use primers to two aster yellows phytoplasma (AYp) gene sequences and an aster leafhopper (ALH) gene sequence as a target for amplification of the aster leafhopper chromosomal DNA. The presence of phytoplasma in plant and insect tissue extracts will be detected using traditional PCR or nested PCR reactions. AYp copies per insect will be determined with both AYp specific primer pairs using real-time qPCR. We will also determine AYp copies per cp6 chromosomal marker to access the utility of using a chromosomal marker instead of copies per insect as standardization. Our objectives are to measure the increase of AYp copy number in ALH over time, examine AYp copy number differences between male and female insects, and determine the phytoplasma levels required for successful AYp transmission. For transmission analysis, ALH will be given a 48-hour acquisition access period on an AYp-infected Chinese aster (Callistephus chinensis) followed by transfer to rye seedlings to allow for the propagation of the phytoplasma within the leafhoppers. Leafhopper individuals will be clipped to healthy aster plants and given a 24-hour inoculation access period (IAP). Disease will be assessed visually on individual aster plants at 20 and 30 days post-IAP and aster petioles will be assayed for the presence of AYp by nested PCR.

50,"Since the inception of the State of ND in 1889, agriculture has been the foundation of the state's economy. Data collected by the author (Shaik, S 2007a) from historical census of agriculture and the National Agricultural Statistical Services reveals that the number of farms in North Dakota has declined from 74,400 in 1910 to 30,300 in 2006. The corresponding acreage amount of farms in North Dakota increased from 28,427 thousand acres to 39,400 thousand acres leading to an increase in farm size from 382 acres to 1,300 acres. A century ago, North Dakota was overwhelmingly a wheat state; today the leading crops are oil crops. According to North Dakota Agricultural Statistical Service publication, the state ranks first in the production of barley, durum wheat, spring wheat, all dry edible beans, pinto beans, navy beans, sunflower, canola, flaxseed, oats, dry edible peas. It ranks second in all wheat, lentils and honey, third in sugar beets and rye; fourth in potatoes, and tenth in soybeans. The farm receipts increased from 0.257 billion nominal dollars in 1924 to 3.98 billion nominal dollars in 2006. During the same time period, the crop and livestock receipts increased from 0.197 and 0.60 billion nominal dollars to 3.089 and 0.897 billion nominal dollars respectively. These changes in North Dakota due to technological improvements, farm programs, farm crop insurance programs and public investments will be quantified for the fourteen (including the 2008 farm bill) major farm bills since 1933.

We will work cooperatively with plant breeders to develop cultivars and germplasm with desirable agronomic traits and a high level of nematode resistance.  Plant material will be selected for resistance using traditional and marker-assisted selection.  However, we cannot rely exclusively on host-plant resistance for managing nematodes.

Biological control organisms are being marketed for use in cotton and peanut, and also occur naturally in fields.  We will explore the effect of crop production practices (tillage, fumigation, cultivar, and cover crops) on these antagonistic organisms with the goal of conserving or enhancing their activity against nematodes.

55,"Field crops are an important foundation for the Montana agricultural industry and revenue totaled $2.4 billion in 2011. The most significant crop in Montana was wheat (5.4 million acres, $1.4 billion) followed by barley (760k acres, $159 million). Our grain goes not only to support the livestock industry in Montana, but also for the export market. Plant diseases occur on every crop, and many threaten plant yield, quality, and sometimes human health. My project seeks to provide practical disease management options for crops grown in Montana. I will focus on the use of fungicides to control foliar pathogens and the role of viruses in our cropping systems. In 2011 the results of my research were used to save farmers in Montana $100 million in crop losses due to stripe rust throughout the state, and $500,000 in crop losses in Pondera County due to wheat viruses. Fungicides are very useful tools for disease control, but recent marketing for plant health benefit applications without disease in cereal crops may cause the development of disease organisms that cannot be killed by these chemicals (fungicide resistance), as has been seen in Europe. In addition, the economic benefit of spraying fungicides in an arid environment such as Montana is questionable when significant moisture is required for most fungal diseases to grow and infect plants. In the last 5 years I have rarely seen a yield benefit to fungicide application. We will likely see an increase in the number of acres to which a fungicide is applied where the economic benefit of that application is questionable. This project will continue on-farm fungicide trials, measuring disease and resulting yields. The information I provide growers and agricultural professionals via my extension activities including fact sheets, AgAlerts, presentations, field days, and media appearances will be used on farms and contribute to the economic viability of Montana cropping systems. I will also focus my efforts on include wheat viruses. Cereal viruses represent a growing and complex threat to the sustainability of the cereal cropping system. The wheat curl mite vectors multiple viruses among grassy weeds and cereal crops. Moreover, although wheat, barley, corn, oats, rye are all susceptible to viruses including Wheat streak mosaic virus, the impact of the more recently identified Wheat mosaic virus and Triticum mosaic virus are unknown. Understanding the spread of cereal viruses is critical as no effective chemical (acaracide) or genetics-based (plant breeding) management options exist. This project will result in a greater understanding of the susceptibility of wheat varieties to WSMV strains from across the Great Plains of the United States. This will assist wheat breeders in variety selection for resistance against WSMV. Farmers at high risk for WSMV may choose varieties with resistance to viruses to reduce disease losses. This is particularly relevant in southern states, where early planting and grazing of winter wheat facilitates the pathogen survival in green plant material.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
56,"Michigan is the third most diverse agricultural production system in the U.S. Field crops are the most important commodity group in the state in terms of total crop acreage (at 6.5 million acres, 97% of the total), number of growers, and farm income, contributing over $4 billion in production value. Eight of the top ten commodities in Michigan are field crops, or dependent on field crops (livestock, egg production). Corn is the leading crop in the state in acreage (2.5 million acres) and cash value, followed by soybean (1.9 million acres). Unlike neighboring corn-belt states driven by corn and beans, Michigan grows a diversity of field crops, ranking first in several types of dry beans and fourth in sugarbeets. Other field crops include alfalfa, pasture, and other forages; small grains such as wheat, barley, oats, and rye. With the global demand for grain for direct consumption and livestock feed, as well as for biofuels, crop prices are at a high and field crop acreage is expanding in the state. Invasive species were and continue to be a major problem in the U.S. Michigan is a potential hot-spot for insect introductions, home to Great Lakes shipping ports, airports in Detroit and Chicago with non-stop flights to Asia, and a diverse crop base vulnerable to colonization by many species. Other invaders, foreign and native, are expanding in their range into Michigan. Thus producers are presented with new challenges from both foreign-invasive and native-invasive species that increase in pest status or range. Established and new insect invaders are now responsible for the majority of insect-caused yield and quality loss in Michigan field crops, influencing pest management decisions, driving insecticide use and reducing profitability. Tied in with invasive species is the issue of climate change. For some field crop insect pests, damage is getting worse and the damage period is growing longer during the season. A reality in field crop production is the use of biotechnology, specifically genetically modified crops with herbicide resistance or Bt insecticide toxin. According to the USDA Economic Research Service, 86% of the corn, and 91% of the soybean, acres in Michigan were transgenic in the 2012 planting season. Because universities have little role in the development of this technology, land grant entomologists are viewed as neutral observers and thus have an important role to play in education and making public statements. A by-product of the introduction of Bt crops is overuse. Growers plant hybrids expressing insecticides that they don't need, exposing insect populations to traits year-after-year. This is antithetical to the principles of integrated pest management, because it increases the chance for resistance. This project concentrates on understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive species, climate change and use of technology.

57,"The temperate grasses include economically important crops such as wheat, oat, rye, and barley. These grasses provide more than 20% of the caloric intake for the human population. The ability of these crops to flower at the appropriate time, is critical not only for the plant&#39;s reproductive success, but also to maximize grain production for human consumption. The plant&#39;s capacity to target flowering-time to the optimal seasonal window requires the coordination of two main environmental seasonal signals: day length (photoperiod), and long exposures to cold temperature (vernalization). Additional local environmental signals, such as drought and salinity stresses, or nutrient availability, also affect flowering-time. A precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the coordination of these seasonal and local environmental signals is required to engineer cereal varieties adapted to a changing environment - in particular global warming. This is exceptionally urgent in crop plants, where fundamental research into flower-time lags behind that of popular plant model systems (i.e. Arabidopsis). A direct translation of the information from model systems to the temperate grasses is not always possible because the vernalization and photoperiod responses in these two plant lineages evolved independently using different types of genes, resulting in very different flowering-time regulatory pathways. Thus, research efforts dedicated to investigating flowering-time in the temperate cereals must be carried out if we are to understand flowering-time in these crop plants. Recent studies in wheat have shown specific components of the flowering-time pathway to associate with a distinct family of proteins known as Nuclear Factor Y proteins (NF-Y). These proteins have been extensively studied in mammals and fungi where they exist as three individual gene subunits (NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC) that form a trimeric protein complex that regulates multiple genes. Interestingly, in plants, there has been an unprecedented expansion of these NF-Y gene families, where ~10 copies for each subunit are present. This increase in NF-Y gene number, together with their interactions with the flowering-time components, has the potential to generate a vast number of molecular combinations, providing a flexible system to integrate the many environmental signals involved in the regulation of flowering-time. However, the functional role of the different NF-Y genes in regulating flowering-time in the temperate cereals has not been studied so far. This is problematic because these genes play a central role in the integration of different environmental signals. This research uses a diploid temperate grass (barley) to elucidate the specific roles of the NF-YB proteins in the integration of photoperiod, vernalization and stress signals in the flowering-time pathway.

Seeds and associated information will be distributed on request to scientists. 2) Conduct genetic characterizations and phenotypic evaluations of wheat, barley, oats, rye, and other small grains and related wild species for priority genetic and agronomic traits. Apply the preceding knowledge to genetic resource acquisition and curation of selected taxa. Ploidy levels of wheat landraces and wild species of wheat, barley, and oats will be verified. Characterization data will be completed for key descriptors in wheat, barley, and oats. Kernel hardness will be determined for accessions of common bread wheat. 3) Identify and genetically characterize host-plant resistance to the virulent stem rust race Ug99 from NSGC wheat accessions.  Approach: Established procedures will be followed to maintain all NSGC germplasm accessions, with special attention to seed preparation and planting, plant pathogen monitoring, harvest, and laboratory processing. Seed of NSGC accessions are held in medium-term storage under controlled temperature (5-6 C) and relative humidity (25%). Inventory records, including quantity of seed on hand, viability, and date of last regeneration, are maintained in GRIN. Accessions will be scheduled for regeneration based on a priority matrix. Seed will be provided to the NCGRP for safety back up. Standard procedures for GRIN Order Processing will be followed. Distributions outside of the US will follow phytosanitary requirements of the recipient country, including import permits, phytosanitary certificates, and additional declarations. USDA-APHIS will be consulted regularly for the latest information on seed export. The ploidy analyses will be conducted with the Partec CyFlow Ploidy Analyser® following protocols from the manufacturer and modifications developed locally for more efficient analyses of small grains species.

Kernel hardness analyses will be performed with the Perten® Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS 4100), which is the wheat industry standard and is supported by USDA-Federal Grain Inspection Service. To identify new sources of resistance to the Ug99 lineage of Pgt, winter habit wheat landraces from the NSGC will be screened. Because field testing capacity at Njoro, Kenya is limited, the accessions will first be tested for adult plant resistance to US races in field trials St. Paul, MN in cooperation with an ARS scientist at the USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory (CDL). Accessions with resistance to the US races will then be tested as adult plants in the field for resistance to Ug99 and its variants in the USDA nursery in Kenya.   Accessions showing resistance in one Kenya test will be re-tested to confirm results and tested for seedling resistance to race TTKSK at the CDL. To map resistance to the Ug99 lineage of Pgt in spring wheat landraces and ascertain the relationship to known sources of resistance, mapping populations will be developed from crosses previously made with the susceptible spring line LMPG-6. Mapping populations will be generated either through single seed descent to the F6 generation or through doubled haploid (DH) production. At least 150 DH lines or recombinant inbred lines (RIL) per cross will be generated. The lines will be evaluated for adult plant resistance in the USDA nursery in Kenya and as seedlings against race TTKSK at the CDL.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
59,"This investigation concerns the role of common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs)  fungus interconnections among plant root systems  in plant competition belowground.  CMNs are formed by generally beneficial, root-inhabiting fungi called  arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi .  Plants feed these fungi some of the sugar they produce by photosynthesis, and in return, the fungi take up and provide the plants with key mineral nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen.  Once connected to a host plant's roots, the fungi forage throughout the soil and may encounter root systems of other plant species with which they additionally associate without preference, creating a network.  The major question this raises is whether all plants connected to the network share mineral nutrients equitably or if mycorrhizal fungi disproportionately donate mineral nutrients to host plant species that provide them the most sugar.  The researchers utilize tallgrass prairie species for their research, Big Bluestem and Canada Wild Rye. Tallgrass prairie is an endangered ecosystem in North America and prairie restorations often involve sowing the study species together.  Understanding how CMNs affect interactions between these plant species might inform restoration management practices such as tillage, which can disrupt CMNs.  Besides its relevance to prairie restoration, this research will engage Miami inner-city middle school students and university undergraduates from underrepresented groups.  The researchers will investigate competition as mediated by CMNs between a tallgrass prairie dominant grass, Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and a less common species, Canada Wild Rye (Elymus canadensis).  If Big Bluestem is able to obtain mineral nutrients disproportionately and thereby suppress the growth of Canada Wild Rye, then CMNs may contribute to Big Bluestem's dominance, influencing prairie community composition. The researchers will utilize a rotated conetainer method in the greenhouse to isolate and reveal the effects of CMNsby severing them. The proposed work will determine the effects of CMNs on the relative strengthsof intra- and interspecific competition and consequent size hierarchy development. The studentwill investigate if large carbon donation to CMNs elicits high mineral nutrient transfer frommycorrhizal fungi by using carbon stable isotope ratios to compare carbon supplied by theseC4 and C3 grasses to their leaf mineral nutrient contents in monoculture and mixture. Finally,if severing CMNs alters the fungus community on root systems, this will be investigated through DNA barcoding.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Although there is wide variation in maize resistance to herbivory, very little is known about the underlying genetic basis of these differences among maize cultivars. Genetic mapping, transcript profiling, insect bioassays, and biochemical approaches will be used to identify maize herbivore resistance genes. A particular focus area of this project will be the identification of biosynthetic and regulatory genes contributing to the production and transport of benzoxazinoids, a class of secondary metabolites with important defensive functions in maize, wheat, rye, wild barley, and other grasses. Research involving maize benzoxazinoid metabolism will provide a tractable model system for studying these agriculturally and ecologically important plant metabolites. Genetic mapping using a panel of diverse maize inbred lines will identify novel genes contributing to aphid and caterpillar resistance. Given the wide array of pests and pathogens against which maize plants protect themselves, there are likely to be interactions among the identified defense pathways. Defensive synergies and tradeoffs will be detected by comparing the genomic locations and biochemical functions of the identified maize genes that contribute to natural variation in herbivore resistance.  This project will lead to the identification of previously unknown maize genes that influence plant-herbivore interactions. Potential metabolic limitations and tradeoffs in maize defense against different classes of insect herbivores will be documented. It is anticipated that these expected results will open up new opportunities for using molecular breeding and transgenic approaches to improve herbivore resistance in maize, the most important agricultural crop in the United States. Research conducted through this project will help to train a new generation of students and postdocs for future careers in academia, industry, or government service. International research exchanges with the European ERA-CAPS (http://www.eracaps.org/) companion project entitled  Biosynthesis, transport and exudation of 1,4-benzoxazin-3-ones as determinants of plant biotic interactions (BENZEX)  will enhance the training of students and postdocs.  Experiments involving maize-herbivore interactions will be fully integrated into an established education and outreach program at the Boyce Thompson Institute. Undergraduate students from throughout the United States will be recruited to be part of a ten-week summer internship program. In one-week training sessions, biology teachers from under-resourced schools will develop new plant science modules for their classes. Experimental kits for conducting caterpillar-feeding assays in local science classrooms will not only provide students with hands-on research experience, but also generate new information about the mechanisms of maize defense against insect herbivory.  All data and resources generated through this project will be publicly accessible.  A major output of this project will be a publicly available toolkit for studying the role of benzoxazinoids in maize defense against herbivores and pathogens. Seeds of near-isogenic lines and mutants will be deposited in the Maize Genetics Cooperation stock center, DNA clones will be available upon request and assay methods will be published in scientific journals.  All DNA sequences will be deposited in public databases such as the NCBI SRA, Gramene, and MaizeGDB. Metabolite and metabolomics data will be deposited at METLIN (http://metlin.scripps.edu/).

61,"The wheat tribe, Triticeae, comprises about 350 grass species, including wheat, barley, and rye. Genetic exchange among species has played a major role in the group?s complicated evolutionary history, so a clear understanding of the relationships among species remains elusive. In species that exchange genetic material, the genomes can be mosaics derived from multiple sources, and as a result, evolutionary relationships inferred from genetic data can differ depending on which portion of the genome is used for the inference. Gene exchange has been convincingly implicated in the Triticeae, but the extent is still unknown. This research addresses the question by applying a genome-wide approach, sampling large numbers of short DNA sequences from throughout the entire genome from a broad sample of Triticeae species. The density of genome sampling, combined with the ability to determine the genomic location of the sampled sequences, will lead to a better assessment of the extent of genetic exchange, including which species are involved, and which regions of the genome are most affected.The results of this work will be informative to Triticeae breeders who rely on the processes of hybridization and gene exchange as tools for crop improvement. The methods of data analysis developed in this project will be useful for studies of other groups of organisms that undergo gene exchange. The funding will support training for one graduate student, along with discussion groups and training for a selected group of undergraduates from Olive-Harvey College, a minority-serving two-year college in Chicago.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
62,"The use of no-till cover crops and green manures impact soil microbial communities, but their influence on specific microbial community functions, such as nutrient cycling, plant growth promotion, phytopathogen and human pathogen suppression, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, remains unclear. We lack the scientific knowledge to understand how to best exploit these systems for our agricultural and environmental gain. As growers adopt organic practices and transition land from conventional management, it is crucial that they take advantage of the benefits of cover crops. In this study, we will assess the effect of four green manure no-till cover crop systems - hairy vetch, clover, hairy vetch+rye, clover+rye - on soil functions during cultivation of various muskmelon (cantaloupe) cultivars, a valuable crop susceptible to both plant diseases and colonization by human foodborne pathogens. We will adopt a multidisciplinary approach, integrating molecular microbiology to compare soil microbial and functional gene diversity, horticulture, phytopathology, food safety microbiology, entomology and food quality, to achieve our goals. A strong outreach program will develop new educational resources that extend research-based knowledge. These resources will be available locally in addition to the eOrganic site through collaboration with eXtension. We will conduct local demonstrations to train growers and extension educators in practices that reduce disease and food safety risks on muskmelon grown on land transitioning to organic production. Through this project, we will contribute to ORG&#39;s goals by assessing microbial ecosystem services of cover crop systems, evaluating production practices for muskmelons - including food safety, while developing a strong outreach program.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
63,"In a limited number of farm fields where winter wheat, triticale or cereal rye were harvested as forage in the spring of 2011, yields of 2-4 tons of DM/acre in the spring were achieved, even when fall biomass accumulation was small (Kilcer et al., 2012; Ketterings et al., 2013). Similarly, work by Long et al. (2012) showed a triticale yield that exceeded 2 tons of DM/acre. The crude protein (CP) levels of the forages typically exceeded 10%, and for triticale, often exceeding 13%, resulting in 70-120 lbs N/acre removal with harvest of the winter cereals. These data suggest N addition at greenup is needed, which was also shown in initial field trials conducted in the spring of 2013, where the zero N plots in the N rate studies were clearly distinguishable from plots that had received N at green-up. Research is needed to determine the economic optimum N rate at green-up for these winter cereals grown as forages for manured and non-manured fields.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
64,"Plants differ in their capacity to grow at and survive low temperatures. At one extreme are tropical-climate cereals such as maize and rice that suffer chilling injury when exposed to 10oC. At the other extreme are the temperate-climate cereals including barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum spp.), and rye (Secale cereal) capable of surviving the temperate-climate winter. This ability to survive the temperate-climate winter is known as winter hardiness. Wheat, barley, and rye are generally classified as being of either a winter or a spring growth habit. Spring growth habit types are inherently reproductively competent and are typically sown in the spring. In comparison, winter growth habit types are sown in the autumn. They grow vegetatively for a short period before overwintering and then develop reproductively the following spring. If spring-sown they fail to properly develop reproductively. Spring and winter growth habit types also differ from one another in their ability to survive the temperate-climate winter. Typically winter growth habit types are able to survive colder temperatures than spring types and have greater winter hardiness. Winter genotypes are often preferred because they are capable of returning yields 40% greater than that of their spring counterparts. Winter genotypes are also much more efficient at making use of available water due to an extended vegetative growth phase and a much more extensive root system over spring genotypes. In Ohio and other states of the East North Central Midwest, winter barley and winter wheats are essential components in the crop rotation cycle with maize and soybean. Spring types have not been recommended for Ohio as conditions early in the spring are erratic leading to unpredictable and generally poor yields. Recent studies in wheat and barley have led to the identification of several key factors underlying the molecular basis of winter hardiness. These studies also reveal that expression of the genes underlying these factors are themselves affected by developmental programming inherent to the genetic makeup of the plant, and by environmental factors. Moreover, current data strongly supports the premise that the key factors act antagonistic to one another. It is these phenomena and the genetic basis underlying them that I am working to better understand. A goal of the work proposed here is to gain greater insight into their regulation, to better understand the nature of this interaction between the factors, and how their regulation is affected by the environment. These studies will contribute fundamental knowledge that can be used to enhance the productivity and freezing tolerance of cereal plants.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
65,"The beef and dairy industry in Florida represents an annual gross income of US$ 1 billion. Horse industry also contributes largely for the State economy. Forages grazed or conserved as hay, haylage, or silage are an important component and generate income for different stakeholders. Grasslands in Florida are estimated at 4.6 million hectares supporting 1.2 million head of beef cattle and other livestock (Blount, 2013). Sustaining this industry and increasing its profitability while protecting Florida&acute;s environment is a challenge ahead of us.Cattle production systems in Florida are based on grazing operation on warm-season grasses (e.g. bahiagrass, bermudagrass, limpograss), cool-season annual grasses (e.g. annual ryegrass or mixtures such as rye/ryegrass), and hay production from warm-season grass fields. These systems are highly dependent on N fertilization. Improved pastures, mainly bahiagrass and bermudagrass, occupy 1.5 million hectares in Florida. Considering that approximately 20% of this area is currently fertilized with 60 kg N/ha, current N fertilizer expenses by farmers is US$ 27.7 million dollars. Developing year-round cow-calf production systems based on grass-legume mixtures will not only reduce the need for N fertilizer, but also has potential to increase current productivity of unfertilized systems by at least 20%. Current productivity of unfertilized systems is 1.2 ha per cow-calf pair. Increasing forage productivity by 20% on these 1.2 million hectares would allow either increasing the herd size and profitability of Florida cattlemen or maintaining the current productivity and release pasture area for other agricultural activities.Off-farms inputs such as fossil fuel, equipment, seeds, and purchased feed increases cost of farming operations and may reduce producer profitability. Strategies to reduce off-farm inputs will be tested and include stockpiled forage, cool-season forages with self-reseeding potential, biological N fixation by grass-legume associations or grass association with N-fixing organisms. Reducing N fertilizer also has potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, contributing for reduction in global warming. Industrial N fertilizer is manufactured using high energy inputs from natural gas, a fossil fuel. Thus, N fertilizer has a high carbon footprint not only because of its manufacturing phase, but also because of increased N2O emissions when applied to the field. This multi-state, multi-site, multi-disciplinary research and outreach project will address year-round cattle production systems less dependents on N fertilizers. Cool-season and warm-season mixtures of grass-legumes will be evaluated under different environments. After selecting the best mixtures, animal performance data will be assessed in year-round cattle production systems based on grass-legume mixtures vs. N fertilized grass. Carbon footprint from different forage production systems will be assessed and management practices will be proposed in order to reduce GHG emissions from these systems. Reduction in cattle production costs, increasing cattle productivity in unfertilized grass pastures, and lowering GHG emissions to the environment will be the major benefits for the society. Decision support tools directed to extension faculties, producers, and allied livestock industry is an expected outcome of this project.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
66,"Nutritional management affects beef cattle growth, reproductive performance, animal health, and can also influence the impact that beef cattle may have on the landscape. In order to feed animals to meet their nutritional needs it is critical to know the nutritional value of plants. Plants&#39; nutritional value varies seasonally and geographically due to different soil types and climate. Therefore, the use of values from one state does not provide accurate and precise information regarding quality of the same plant in another. Furthermore, information on the nutritional value of some specific plant species found in the state of Nevada such as kochia, cheatgrass, coyote willow, crested wheatgrass, meadow brome, and Great Basin wild rye are mostly inexistent in the scientific literature. The goal of this project is to characterize the nutritional value of plants commonly found in the state of Nevada that may have potential as feed for beef cattle. The findings of these studies will provide cattle producers and extension agents with scientifically sound information on which plants can be used by cattle and how much of that particular plant can be safely used. Moreover, producers and extension agents will have the tools to better formulate diets to meet cattle nutritional needs throughout the year, which will lead to better production and profits. These management decisions will also have a positive impact on the environment because 1) land will be more efficiently used and; 2) because threatened areas will be more safely protected.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
67,"Objective(s): The overall objective is to refine and improve existing simulation models for corn and potato by developing new, and improving existing, functional relationships between physiological processes and nutrients in the soil and plant tissues. Results of this research will be used to address existing knowledge gaps in the models especially with respect to carbon, water, and temperature interactions. The modified models will be evaluated by testing simulated responses at plant component and whole plant levels. The potato and corn models, along with a rye cover crop model, and existing models for soybean and corn, will then be used for assessment of the environmental consequences of agricultural management practices on carbon sequestration and nutrient balances. These practices include fertilizer applications, rotations, and cover crops. The specific sub-objectives are 1) to improve simulation of the above- and below-ground potato and corn processes in the areas of: (a) water and nutrient stress effects on growth, development, morphology, and yield, (b) response of root growth and activity (water and nutrient uptake) to soil nutrients (N, P and K), and, c) evaluate the new model components using experimental data; and, 2) intercompare crop and economic models and foster improvements in these models to increase their capability to utilize data from climate scenarios as part of AgMIP.Approach:   Mechanistic models for soybean (GLYCIM), cotton (GOSSYM), corn (MAIZSIM), and potato (SPUDSIM), have been developed in previous projects by this group. The proposed research will broaden the capabilities of the corn and potato models by utilizing data from experiments carried out in unique, state-of-the-art sun-lit growth chambers and field plots. Short and long term experiments will be employed to test hypotheses and develop algorithms for plant processes to be used in the computer models. Data collected by collaborators will be used to test and evaluate the models. A simple Rye model will be developed to simulate a cover crop during the fall-winter season. A computer graphical user interface will be developed using components from the existing software program, GUICS, to allow a user to simulate long term crop rotations over multiple growing seasons. Advanced data management capabilities will be added to the interface to help with interpretation and management of input and output data. Tools for weather generation and estimation of soil hydraulic properties will be added to the interface to provide a wide range of environmental conditions for assessment. All crop models will be used within the new interface to assess the environmental and economic impacts of climate change on carbon sequestration, and nitrogen and water balances for relevant production systems.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
68,"Objective(s): Organic farmers on the Central Coast of California produce a large proportion of the high-value, cool-season vegetables and strawberries for the U.S. Most farmers here lease their land and must produce several crops on each field annually to remain profitable. This limits the opportunity to include cover crops in rotations. The primary focus of this project is to produce information, management tools, and technologies to help farmers integrate cover crops and compost into intensive vegetable and strawberry production systems, maximize the benefits from cover cropping, and reduce production costs.    The main objective of this project is to develop ecologically-based soil management strategies that enhance soil quality, nutrient cycling, pest and disease management, and profitability, and reduce off-farm inputs, organic vegetable and strawberry production systems. The subobjectives are as follows:   1. Evaluate the effects of cover cropping frequency and compost on soil quality, vegetable and strawberry yields, soil borne disease, and system profitability. 2. Evaluate the effects of a legume-rye mixture versus non-legume cover crops on vegetable and strawberry yields. 3. Evaluate the effects of cover crop seeding rates on weed density and weed management costs in subsequent vegetable and strawberry crops grown in rotational sequences. 4. Identify pathogens causing emerging bacterial diseases of organic vegetables and small fruit.  Approach: The first three sub objectives will be addressed using unpublished data collected during the first 10 years of the Salinas Organic Cropping Systems (SOCS) experiment, and with additional laboratory analyses on archived soil samples using standard proceedures. During the next 5 years, experiment will continue with a less intense management phase to provide the team with the time to analyze and understand the existing data before deciding if the experiment should be terminated or continued. Furthermore, a complete analysis of unpublished data from the first 10 years is essential to provide insights into potential modifications to the existing treatments, and to formulate meaningful questions to be addressed if a new long-term study is initiated.  The following hypotheses will be tested for the first three subobjectives outlined above. - Soil quality will be higher in systems where cover crops are used annually than in systems where they are used only quadrennially.   - Soil quality will be higher in systems that receive compost annually than systems that only receive cover crops. - Vegetable and strawberry yields will be higher in systems where cover crops are used annually than in systems where they are used only quadrennially.  - Vegetable and strawberry yields will be higher in systems that receive compost annually than systems that only receive cover crops.  - Profits will be higher in systems where cover crops are used annually than in systems where they are used only quadrennially.   - Profits will be higher in systems that receive compost annually than systems that only receive cover crops.  - Verticillium microsclerotia counts will be higher in systems that receive legume-rye cover crops than systems with non-legume cover crops. - Vegetable and strawberry yields will be higher following legume versus non-legume cover crops. - Weed density will be lower in vegetable and strawberry systems where cover crops were planted at relatively high seeding rates over several years, than when using lower seeding rates. - Weed management cost during vegetable and strawberry production will be lower in rotations where cover crops were planted at relatively high seeding rates over several years, than when using lower seeding rates.  The results from this SOCS experiment will be communicated to stakeholders by publications and presentations. The results from the first 10 years may indicate that there would be value in collecting additional field data or conducting additional analyses of archived soil samples. If this occurs we will modify our plan to collect this additional data with our existing collaborators or seek additional collaborations as needed.   The fourth sub objective will be achieved by soliciting samples of new diseases from organic fields. Samples will be analyzed with standard methods to identify the bacterial pathogens. The results will be reported to the growers through publications and presentations. If samples are not submitted, work will be conducted to resolve the etiology of diseases from organic systems for which isolates have been obtained but research has not proceeded.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
69,"Whole grain brown rice, rice bran, and dry beans are inexpensive, healthy staple foods with low U.S. consumption. Numerous evidences exist for promoting increased consumption of brown rice and dry beans for chronic disease prevention , yet prospective evaluation of health outcomes remains difficult due to lack of reliable dietary intake biomarkers. Our completed, short-term feeding studies with fixed amounts of rice bran and navy beans in children with elevated cholesterol and adult colorectal cancer survivors provide a novel opportunity for assessing dietary biomarkers of intake. Rice and beans merit biomarkers for nutritional assessment without reliance on self-reported intakes for whole grains and legumes during nutrition assessments as wheat, barley, rye and soybeans have been studied in dietary patterns and for relationships with disease risk. A major challenge with validating dietary biomarkers is that an elevated level of consumption is often required for reliable quantification, and emerging evidence supports that the overall dietary pattern (e.g. vegetarian, omnivore) can influence the profile of metabolites detected. The identification and validation of dietary biomarkers using metabolomics is an emerging field of investigation with broad-spectrum applications of health importance, and is the major focus of the research strategy for developing rice bran and navy bean biomarkers in children and adults herein.

70,"Increasing soil carbon in soils is important for climate change mitigation, but alsoin theimprovement ofsoil characteristics that help farmers be more resilient and sustainable. Most of the physical protection of soil carbon occurs at small scale within chunks of soil known as soil aggregates. However, it is very difficult to learn about the processes that go on at that scaleas most modern techniques are destructive, allowing for only one type of analysis per aggregate, which are known to be highly variable. Through the use of computed micro-tomography, a technique similar to a medical CT scan, images of the soil aggregates can be obtained while preserving the aggregates for other destructive analysis, in this case, stable carbon isotope analysis.By taking advantage ofthe natural isotope signature difference between corn and annual rye grass in conjunction with computed micro-tomography images, this research will further the understanding of how soil aggregates physicallyprotect soil carbon as it relates to aggregate pores and pore structure when farmers utilize cover crops.

71,"In much of the southeastern United States, beef cattle production is a major enterprise. In Louisiana, the cattle industry had a value of $663 million in 2013, up 18% over 2012 (LSU AgCenter, 2014). Cattle and calves rank second only to poultry which is the largest animal industry in the state. Cow-calf producers in the United States typically market calves at weaning; most of these calves are born during the late-winter and or spring and consequently weaned in the fall. In general, producers have small numbers of cows (less than 100) and 90% of the calves weigh below 230 kg at weaning, leaving them with very little marketing opportunities for those calves. Only some producers have enough calves to market in a truck load (21,800 kg). Marketing alliances between small and medium size producers have had some success. For several weather-related reasons (drought, excessive cold/snowfall) in different areas of the country, cattle prices have been at an all-time high in recent years and have made a fresh weaned calf a valuable commodity, although analysts indicate that these times are not going to last and the cattle cycle will go back to  normal  by 2016. Regardless of the actual conditions, large economic benefits exist for beef cow-calf producers to retain ownership after weaning by growing calves to a heavier sale weight prior to finishing. Over the past two decades more cattle producers have been retaining ownership of their calves through the stocker phase, and in some cases, through the finishing phase as well (McKinnon, 2001; Rathwell, 2000). In addition, an increased number of summer row crop farmers are grazing stockers on winter cover crops, which include annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) and small grains. Each year, several million calves graze cool-season pastures in the Southeastern United States to add valuable weight as stocker calves. Utilization of cool-season annual forages is one of the primary venues for growing these calves in this region of the country.In Louisiana there is the chance to grow abundant forage resources. Warm season perennial grasses primarily bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) and bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) sometimes associated with dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum) are the  core  of perennial forages. Annual (sorghum-sudan hybrids [Sorghum sp.], pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum]) summer grasses can complement these resources. In winter, cool season annual grasses (rye [Secale cereale], annual ryegrass) or legumes especially Trifolium sp such as ball (T. nigrescens L.), crimson (T. incarnatum), berseem (T. alexandrium), and white (T. repens) clover among others can be successfully planted. Even though these many species can fit into the different ecoregions of the SE, they are the warm season perennial grasses that have been traditionally the forage base for beef cattle systems. Around them and depending on production objectives there are more (or less) intensive systems. The intensive use of greater nutritive value pastures are usually pursued with classes of cattle that demand them such as stockers (steers and heifers) and forage-fed finishing programs. In spring-calving systems having cool season pastures is a major advantage providing nutritive value to the diet of highly demanding cows around parturition and through the first few months of lactation when nutrient demands are at their peak (NRC, 2000). The use of mixed swards (grasses and legumes) is an attractive alternative for producers because: 1) ruminants show preference for a rich (more than one component) diet (Scaglia and Boland, 2014a), and 2) legumes can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, hence reducing the need for fertilizer.All these pastures, however, do not provide adequate year round supply of feed or an adequate nutritive composition. There are a few alternatives to extend the grazing season and try to reduce hay feeding periods, also called  transition periods  or  gap periods . These periods (usually May-June and October-December) of the year with these limitations are usually complemented with stockpiled or conserved forages, which, depending on the nutrient requirements of the animal, may or may not need to be supplemented. Forage brassica crops such as turnip, swede, rape, and kale can be spring seeded to supplement pastures in August and September or summer seeded to extend the grazing season in November and December. Due to the increase use of cover crops in the Northeast, Midwest and upper Midwest of the US, producers in the SE became familiar with other forage alternatives that can be used for grazing. Forage brassica crops such as turnip, swede, rape, and kale are annual crops that are highly productive and digestible and can be grazed 80 to 150 days after seeding, depending on the species. In addition, crude protein levels are high, varying from 15 to 25 percent in the herbage and 8 to 15 percent in the roots, depending on the level of nitrogen fertilization and weather conditions. Despite these advantages these forages require appropriate management not only for their own productivity but also for the grazing animals. Brassica crops can cause health disorders in grazing animals if not managed properly. The main disorders are bloat, atypical pneumonia, nitrate poisoning, hemolytic anemia (mainly with kale), hypothyroidism, and polioencephalomalacia (Hall and Jung, 2008).All around the US and Louisiana is no exception, there is a trend showing that consumers demand for  organic  or  natural  foods is increasing sharply. In recent years (up to 2012), there was annual growth in sales of 24 and 39% for natural and organic meats, respectively. Grass-fed beef is within these niche markets and its relevance has been noted by the USDA. In September 2013, The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#39;s (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) announced a new Market News report that covers grass fed beef (USDA-AMS, 2013). Furthermore, on April 2014 the USDA Grass Fed Program for Small and Very Small (SVS) Producers was presented as a verification tool for SVS producers to certify that animals meet the requirements of the AMS Grass (Forage) Fed Marketing Claim Standard. For this program, USDA is targeting producers that market 49 cattle or less each year (USDA-AMS, 2014). Adding to this trend, consumers are more inclined to support locally produced products, commercialized in farmers markets, favoring localized economies which by end result will strengthen the community&#39;s economy.

73,"Dairy is an important agricultural sector in the U.S. and Wisconsin. Milking cows need quality feed, such as corn silage. However, long-term environmental and economic sustainability of silage production is problematic since all above ground biomass is harvested, leaving soils susceptible to erosion and productivity decreases due to reduced surface residue cover and carbon inputs to the soil. Additionally, producers favor manure application to fields after silage harvest given the timeliness in preparation for the winter season, but this can present a challenge for phosphorus (P) management given the greater risk for erosion and nutrient runoff. Consequently, using no-tillage and cover crops in silage production can help enhance soil health, long-term productivity, and reduce environmental impacts. Further, spring harvest of the cover crop presents an opportunity to increase feed availability and an incentive for cover crop adoption. This project aims to: 1) determine the impact of using cereal rye as a cover crop and no-tillage on sediment and P losses from corn silage production, 2) link soil health to water quality and crop productivity, and 3) identify drivers and barriers for adoption of cover crop use by farmers. Findings could provide an alternative for increasing forage production and environmental enhancement. The specific goals of this project align well withthe new objectives for NC-1178&#39;s seventh phase (i.e. this phase, 2014-2019), whichare to; 1) evaluate the impact of intensifying agroecosystems inputs (e.g., cover crops, perennial crops) on maintaining/enhancing soil organic C, soil quality, productivity and the environment, and 2) assess management effects (e.g., crop residue removal, tillage) on soil organic C, GHG emissions, soil erosion, and productivity. The overall goal of this work is to determine the impact of cover crop use and tillage on soil erosion, nutrient losses in runoff, productivity, and soil quality in corn silage production systems.

79,"Michigan field crop rotations, the Midwest corn belt and related row crop systems around the globe are reliant on substantial inputs to optimize productivity. The requirement for frequent and high doses of soluble nutrients is most apparent in crops grown on Alfisols and other coarse soils that inherently have low to moderate organic matter levels and limited nutrient supply capacity. Concerns are growing regarding the production costs associated with high input row cropping, and the environmental costs that put water and air quality at risk. Reliance on application of inorganic fertilizers as the primary source of fertility has long-term environmental consequences. Loading agricultural systems with reactive nitrogen and soluble phosphorus (P) has been shown to play a role in groundwater contamination, hypoxia related issues and, potentially, global climate change (McIsaac et al., 2002). Discussions with farmers and community members around Michigan have highlighted the need for scientifically-based information on practical systems and management practices that can enhance nutrient efficiency, thus reducing fertilizer requirements while maintaining economically viable levels of production.Soil quality is another challenge facing field crop producers in Michigan that is closely related to managing nutrients in a sustainable manner. Soybean growers for example have prioritized research on cover crops, tillage and management practices that enhance soil quality, stand establishment and soil productivity, as shown by GREEEN industry priorities. This is in keeping with the national United Soybean Board interests as well (http://unitedsoybean.org/article/soybean-farmers-attest-to-cover-crop-benefits/). Farmers are looking to optimize returns to inputs and build yield potential over time, which requires improved understanding of processes that enhance soil organic matter, aggregation, and nutrient efficiency. Sustainable soil management is a central focus of long-term research experimentation underway at the MSU Kellogg Biological Station. Findings include the importance of winter cover as a means to enhance soil biology, and build soil carbon as well as nutrient availability. Enhanced cropping system nutrient efficiency can be achieved through biological nitrogen fixation, and access to sparingly soluble phosphorus pools (Gallaher and Snapp, 2013). Further, the incorporation of cover crop residues is a practice that can temporarily immobilize and reduce nutrient losses, but only if sufficient synchrony of nutrient supply and crop demand is maintained (McSwiney et al., 2010; Pang and Letey, 2000; Snapp and Borden, 2005). The complexity of integrating cover crops in real world farming includes field topographical variability, crop rotation complexity, as well as different types of tillage and timing of field operations in a variable climate (Munoz, et al., 2014; Senthilkumar et al., 2009). Developing practical winter-hardy cover crops and dual usage crops such as forage crops (i.e., alfalfa, rye, ryegrass and intermediate wheatgrass) managed as cover crops is of increasing interest to farmers in recent years, with important implications for economically viable cover crop utilization (Snapp et al., 2005). Zonal tillage management such as strip tillage and ridge tillage are of emerging interest as well, facilitating the incorporation of cover crops into field crop production by developing zones where seedlings thrive from other zones where nutrient immobilization and potential disease issues may arise, related to residue decomposition timing (Williams et al., in press).The beneficiaries of this project include the farmers, rural communities and consumers in Michigan, and the Great Lakes region. Improved understanding of the biological and chemical principles involved in integrated soil management will lead to recommendations that apply not just to this region, but to producers on coarse soils everywhere. Access to information on cover crop performance will help farmers enhance soil organic matter, grow healthier crops and optimize resource conservation for lower cost farming. Ensuring effective stand establishment for vigorous, high yielding crops is a particularly important goal to producers. Environmental benefits will accrue through improving efficiency of nitrogen use, enhanced infiltration and storage of water. Improved soil quality as well as reduced reliance on fossil fuels for food production is an important outcome from this project over the long run.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
80,"Surface topography plays an important role in soil moisture dynamics and plant growth. For example, the distribution of runoff water across an agricultural field following a high intensity rainfall event is determined by topography, and areas of persistently higher or lower soil moisture than the field average are the result. These differences in water content then create different conditions for microbial activity, decomposition of organic material, and water and nutrient uptake by plant roots. Whether these conditions are favorable for plant growth depends on a combination of soil properties (which are also correlated with topography) and precipitation during the growing season. Introducing cover crops into row-crop agricultural systems is known to provide multiple benefits, such as weed suppression, erosion control, an increase in soil organic C, and a reduction of N losses via surface runoff or leaching (Reeves, 1994; Dabney et al., 2001). Among cover crop species, winter rye is arguably one of the most commonly used in cold climate of the US North Central region. However, besides the benefits described above, rye is also known to have potential negative effects. Examples are its allelopathic effect on corn, N immobilization and reduction of available water by rye at the start of the growing season, as well as difficulties with controlling rye termination. While management strategies have been suggested to offset these effects (Eckert, 1988; Ewing et al., 1991), the practical recommendations have been developed primarily based on evidence from small experimental plots located on leveled terrain, thus without taking either topographical or soil variability into account. An added complication is relatively short duration of most field experiments with cover crops, resulting in only a limited range of weather conditions under which performance of cover crops has been experimentally tested and examined. Therefore, the ensuing recommendations may not be optimal for topographically diverse agricultural fields and for extreme weather patterns. However, a continuously growing interest in precision agriculture and the application of cover crops demonstrates the need for new, scientifically-based cover crop growing and managing strategies that take site-specific elements such as topography into account. Moreover, the new strategies must uphold not only under the typical weather scenarios but under new reality of weather extremes of a changing climate. Modeling has been extensively implemented for predicting corn growth (Sadler and Russell, 1997; Sadler et al., 2000; Thorp et al., 2008) and N losses in the presence of cover crops (Abrahamson et al., 2005; Feyereisen et al., 2006a, 2006b; Malone et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008; Yeo et al., 2014), as well as for assessments of the impact of climate change on crop production (Alexandrov and Hoogenboom, 2001; Rao, 2002; Dhungana et al., 2006; White et al., 2011). While crop models are inherently one-dimensional by nature, they have been successfully integrated into GIS to account for spatial variability of key input variables. Some examples are (1) Agricultural and Environmental Geographic Information System for Microsoft Windows (AEGIS/WIN) (Engel et al., 1997), which coupled CERES crop growth models within a DSSAT framework to a GIS system, and (2) Agricultural System Modeling (AgSimGIS) integrated the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) (Ahuja et al., 2000) into a GIS framework (Ascough II et al., 2004). At this time, however, there are no models available that are capable of coupling three-dimensional hydrological processes to crop processes. Instead, current models function as a spatial collection of one-dimensional models, where the hydrology of point A does not affect processes at point B. Our approach, however, would allow us to bridge this &#39;gap&#39; by creating a model framework in which these spatial effects are possible.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
81,"High grain yields are typically associated with high profit margins, however, abiotic environmental stress and biotic stress from disease, insect and weeds often reduce yields. This challenge lends itself to investigations of alternative cropping systems that are more resilient to stress and create diverse outputs that could optimize profit margins. In light of this, many farmers have interest to incorporate cover cropping into their cropping system for the various agronomic and potential economic benefits, but one of the primary challenges of cover crop integration is timely establishment. Using soybean and cereal rye/oat as a model, we propose a novel cropping system that could optimize the agronomic and economic benefits of a corn/soybean rotation with cover cropping. To optimize our proposed cropping system, we will test the yield potential of four soybean maturity groups and four varieties within each maturity group. As each maturity group reaches harvest maturity, a mixture of cereal rye and oat will be planted. Our hypothesis is that soybean yield trade-offs from shorter-season maturity groups could be offset by the increased cover crop/forage production providing an agronomic and benefit to the entire cropping system. Research objectives include: Objective 1: Identify differences in soybean yield potential across maturity group cultivars for different environments in the North-Central Midwest and Northern Midsouth; Objective 2: Characterize impacts of an integrated soybean/cover crop system on weed management, forage production, soybean seedling pathogens, soybean cyst nematode, and arthropod interactions; Objective 3: Determine the role of beneficial/antagonistic microbial communities impact on soil health, yield, and disease through metagenomics analysis; Objective 4: Substantiate economic efficiency of integrating cover crops into different soybean maturity groups. Research will be conducted over two years at seven unique sites across Nebraska (4 sites), Ohio (2 sites), and Kentucky (1 site). Our proposed research directly addresses two of the USDA AFRI Foundational Knowledge of Agricultural Production System program priorities. First, by incorporating multiple management components such as soybean maturity group selection and cover cropping we intend to enhance plant (cropping system) resilience to resistant weeds, nematodes, soil-borne pathogens, and arthropods. Further, we will investigate how this influences productivity through economic analysis and cropping system modeling. Second, proposed research will investigate how changes to production system management or optimizing soybean maturity groups with cover cropping will influence soil microbial communities impacting soil health through metagenomics analysis.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

85,"PROGRAM SUMMARYThe current Official US Standards for Grains regulatory guidelines for ergot contamination ingrains is a crude measurement and determines the percentage of ergot sclerotia in a sample,with ergoty grain defined as > 0.05% sclerotia in wheat, > 0.1% sclerotia in barley, oats, andtriticale, and > 0.3% sclerotia in rye (CFR Title 7). The European Union Scientific Panel onContaminants in the Food Chain concluded that a consistent relationship between the alkaloidconcentration in the sclerotia and total ergot alkaloid concentration could not be established(EFSA 2005). No country has limits for individual ergot alkaloids in food or feed. Several recentfactors have increased ergot invasion in crops, including no-till farming practices leaving thevegetation and ergot sclerotia on the soil surface for increased infection rates, the move toorganic farming and avoiding fungicides, and the dramatic weather patterns with huge rainfallsthat enhance increased Claviceps purpurea invasion of cereals and grasses in thespring/summer.No US veterinary diagnostic laboratory is providing a validated ergot alkaloid analysis of cerealgrains and grasses by LC/MS/MS for the main Claviceps ergot alkaloids, the ergopeptines (-ines, biologically active) include ergotamine, ergosine, ergocristine, ergocryptine, andergocornine, and their diastereomers the ergopeptinines (-inines, biologically inactive). Innature, ergopeptinines always accompany ergopeptines, and during storage of raw materialsover time or improper storage, more ergopeptinines may form. The conversion of -ines to -ininescan be rapid under certain laboratory conditions and -inines can be reactivated to -ines undercertain conditions. Therefore, both epimers have to be determined for ergot alkaloidcontamination of foods and feeds (Krska and Crews).This proposal is to develop and validate a sensitive LC/MS/MS method for ergpopeptines,ergotamine, ergosine, ergocristine, ergocryptine and ergocornine, and their -inines in cerealgrains of wheat, barley, rye and grasses. The inclusion of a grass matrix for ergot alkaloidanalysis by LC/MS/MS is not commonly addressed in any method but is extremely important forveterinary livestock exposures. The analytical range of detection chosen for the assay, 20 to8000 ug/kg, represents veterinary toxicological important data for interpretation of animal feedand food contamination.RELEVANCEThe LC/MS/MS analytical method for ergopeptines and ergopeptinines in small cereals andgrasses will provide chemical analysis of potentially contaminated feed to be used for foodanimals or sold into the food chain. The current US Official Grain Standards of determiningpercentage contamination by ergot sclerotia in cereal grains is often inaccurate and ignores thegreat variation of alkaloid content in individual sclerotia. The increased use of no-till farmingand leaving vegetation and sclerotia on the soil surface for the successive crops, consumerdesire to utilize organic foods without chemicals, and dramatic weather events will tend toincrease the incidence of Claviceps purpurea in cereal crops and grasses and exposure to ergotalkaloids.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
