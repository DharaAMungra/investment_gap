Also included with this is the necessary infrastructure such as securing adequate water to the tanks and electrical and lighting for rearing and handling of the fish. Approach:This research will benefit fish farmers, grain farmers and assist in protecting the environment by reducing nutrients in hatchery effluents, and reducing exploitation of ocean fisheries.  A series of plant-based feeds will be eveloped, replacing fish meal, and containing the proper balance of essential nutrients.  New cultivars of barley and oats will be evaluated as a fish feed ingredient along with alternate crops such as flax, sunflower and safflower.  A breeding program will be used to develop new strains of rainbow trout that are better able to utilize plant-based feeds, grow faster and more efficiently and have improved product quality characteristics.

Dr. Keshun Liu:  Use 4 approaches to address this problem.  1) evaluate and further process protein-rich by-products of  current ethanol or beta-glucan production, 2) develop modified and novel methods to fractionate grain proteins for trout feed ingredients, 3) evaluate and process current improved cultivars of barley and oats, such as low-phyate cultivars for making fish feed ingredients, and 4) select and breed new cultivars of barleys and oats with enhanced composition through collaborating with plant scientist at the ARS, Aberdeen ID (Project # 5366-21000-024-00D). Dr. Frederic Barrows:  Solid substrate culture (SSC) has been proven to be an effective method for fungal production on a commercial scale.  The effectiveness of this approach is due to the relatively low capital costs and low energy costs.  This approach has not been used for the development of animal feeds before, but preliminary studies are quite promising. Utilizing different organisms and different blends of grains, a variety of products will be produced. Dr. Kenneth Overturf:  Genetic selection programs for trout have been initiated at the NCCCWA and at the HFCES (through Aberdeen).  The goal of the HFCES program is to select fish with an enhanced ability to utilize a plant based feed more efficiently.  The goal of the NCCCWA is to select trout for superior growth performance.

The research tests the feasibility of this concept and provides an initial demonstration of this practice to selected growers.  If successful the research would form the foundation for field-scale testing and the development of guidelines for producers. Cover crops have been previously shown to be effective in preventing erosion and nitrate leaching, thus they have the potential to mitigate the off-site effects of manure application.  Cover crops in the Midwest are established following soybean harvest in October or early November.  Swine manure is also applied at this time either as a surface application or by injection.  Manure application causes considerable disturbance, thus cover crop survival and function will be assessed.  Furthermore, the effects of conventional and low disturbance manure injection equipment will be compared with respect N and P retention and cover crop survival.  This research would evaluate the cover crop uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus. The ability of cover crops to mitigate runoff losses of nutrients and fecal bacteria will also be examined in rainfall simulation experiments.

14,"Objective(s): Objective 1.   Identify the key isozymes involved in avenanthramide biosynthesis and evaluate their role in determining the levels and types of avenanthramides produced in planta.  Avenanthramides are polyphenolic alkaloids found uniquely in oat.  They result from conjugation of one of three major phenylpropanoids and 5-hydroxy-anthranilic acid.  The composition and quantities of avenanthramides in the oat seed tends to be highly variable within cultivars and between growing environments.  Some of this variability likely results from differential expression of isozymes of key enzymes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway. Objective 2.   Determine the physiological effect of avenanthramides in mammals by producing pure compounds for collaborative research with nutrition scientists.  Studies on the nutritional effects of avenanthramides can require hundreds of milligrams of pure authentic compound.  Synthesis of these natural products is the only practical means to provide these quantities free from other naturally occurring metabolites.  We are exploring innovative methods to facilitate laboratory scale synthesis and purification of the avenanthramides.  Objective 3.  Evaluate oat and barley germplasm for antioxidants and other phytonutrients.  Determine the contents of protein, oil, beta-glucan, and certain phytochemicals in oat and barley germplasm from the National Small Grains Collections and from collaborating researchers.  This objective is part of a larger ARS objective to characterize the national collections so that they will become more useful to researchers.  Develop improved oat and barley germplasm by enhancing for higher concentrations of specific phytochemicals.  This will be done by collaborating with plant breeders, who do not have the capability for measuring these compounds in large numbers of samples.  Approach:The overarching rationale for these experiments is to determine the role of specific isozymes of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and / or 4-coumaryl CoA ligase (4-CL) in avenanthramide biosynthesis, and their relation to the biosynthesis of specific forms of avenanthramides.  Although, a number of plant DNA sequences corresponding to both PAL and 4-CL are found in GenBank, currently there are none from oat.  It is expected that, like most plants, oat will possess multiple isozymes of PAL and 4-CL, thus it is important to determine how many genes are present in oat and to obtain DNA sequence information for these isozyme.  These data will allow development of isozyme specific probes to evaluate expression of the target genes over the course of seed maturation and in different plant organs in field grown oats. Although a route to the synthesis of avenanthramides is available, this method is cumbersome and time-consuming.  We have found the use of the peptide coupling reagent benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexaflurophosphate (BOP) to be effective in the synthesis of avenanthramides.  We will also explore the use of other peptide coupling reagents for their utility in avenanthramide synthesis.  The synthesized avenanthramides are being used, in collaboration with nutrition scientists at the USDA Jean Mayer Laboratory of Human Nutrition (Tufts University) and at the University of Wisconsin, Department of Kinesiology, to evaluate the effects of avenanthramides in mammalian systems.  Oat and barley germplasm will be evaluated for the content of other phytochemical constituents that may have physiological effects, and for unusually high concentrations of known phytochemicals.  Entries from the National Small Grains Collections, elite nurseries, and selections from collaborating plant breeders will be analyzed for various constituents, including protein, oil, beta-glucan, and phytochemicals.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
15,"Objective(s): 1. Establish benchmark transcriptome profiles induced by uterine stress during gestation that are predictive of altered physiological mechanisms in key organs critical to the piglet immune and metabolic stress responses.  2. Identify critical gene(s), gene products, and their mechanism of action in the stress response of piglets associated with morbidity, growth rate, and body composition.  2.A. Identify key secretory proteins that are regulated by stress in the preweaning pig. 2.B. Identify key secretory proteins produced by adipose tissue that are regulated by stress in the preweaning pig.  3. Develop comprehensive in vitro models to analyze the mechanistic role of select, important developmental or metabolic factors in mediating the organismÆs response to stresses via functional genomic approaches.  3.A. Determine the physiological mechanisms of key stress-regulatory proteins that regulate nutrient partitioning in the liver and adipose tissue.  3.B. Characterize the role of trophectoderm-derived estrogen as a modulator of ôprogrammedö set points that determines the development potential of the peri-implantation embryo.  4. Define the repertoire of biomarkers that may be predictive of neonatal growth potential by using models of induced metabolic stress.Approach:High preweaning mortality or impaired stress-related growth of live-born piglets continue to be major problems that negatively impact commercial swine production.  Piglets exhibiting decreased vitality are at greater risk of morbidity or death and a decreased growth rate extending the farrow-to-market time, which results in increased producer costs.  Considering embryo development as a continuum, it is plausible that abnormal piglet development and loss through adulthood is a consequence of aberrant embryonic/uterine development.   This research will identify physiological mechanisms modulating piglet stress responses to pinpoint targets for interventions to improve ôat riskö piglet survival.  The research addresses three elemental issues 1) elucidation of the relationship between developmental perturbations and etiology of abnormal postnatal stress responses, 2) paucity of predictive screening tools for ôat riskö neonates, and 3) lack of interventions to ameliorate postnatal development of ôat riskö piglets.  The impact of the uterine milieu on alterations of key physiological mechanisms that modulate stress response in metabolic or immune organs will be evaluated by comparative transcriptomic analysis between induced intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), i.e. runting, and control concepti.  To identify postnatal stress responses that are disrupted and persist ex utero as a consequence of in utero growth retardation or parturition complications and detect compensatory mechanisms, the gene expression of key metabolic and immune tissues from growth retarded piglets, (induced IUGR or spontaneous IUGR) and piglets exhibiting decreased vitality will be assessed by in-depth proteomic or transcriptomic analyses throughout the preweaning period.  Functional analyses utilizing in vitro model systems and technologies, such as RNAi, will evaluate the mechanistic role of specific stress-related factors/pathways that are identified in metabolically important tissues.  The relevance of putative stress-related factors/pathways will be assessed in vivo, employing distinct models of induced metabolic stress.   The knowledge acquired will enable 1) the discovery of new biomarkers indicative of metabolic or immune stress response, 2) the identification physiological mechanisms/factors that can be targeted to develop new improved interventions that decrease mortality and days to market of ôat riskö piglets and 3) the establishment of public ôsystems biologyö database for specific gestational and environmental stresses.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

The research emphasis will be on barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses, Fusarium head blight (scab), and leaf rust. 2. Develop a virus-induced gene silencing system (VIGS) as a tool to determine gene function in cereal crops.  3. Use the VIGs system to determine which cereal genes identified are essential in resistance and susceptibility responses (resistance pathway components). 4. Develop useful DNA markers for improvement of viral and fungal resistance.a.	Develop markers for the genes verified to encode resistance pathway components in for use in Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS).b.	Generate and characterize SSR-enriched libraries from oat.c.	Identify DNA markers linked to the wheatgrass-derived Bdv3 and FHB resistance for MAS in wheat.Approach:Barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (YDV) are causing significant losses to small grain production.  Fungal pathogens, such as Fusarium head blight and cereal rusts continue to cause major damage and losses.  Development of genetic resistance in small grains to these pathogens is hindered by the lack of information about mechanisms that confer host-plant resistance and the lack of linked DNA markers to assist in the development of improved germplasm.  Our approach will be to use new and existing molecular genetic methods such as gene expression arrays, transient gene silencing and to develop an improved understanding of the genetic and biochemical mechanisms that can confer host-plant resistance disease resistance and utilize this information to develop new strategies for enhancing genetic resistance to cereal viral and fungal diseases.

Both chemical and tissue structure development of alfalfa stems will be examined. Smooth bromegrass selected for divergent ferulate cross-linking and Klason lignin concentrations in immature leaves will be tested to determine if the differences observed in young leaves for cross-linking and effects on digestibility are maintained during maturation and in stems. The relationship of ferulate cross-linking of lignin to cell wall polysaccharides on fiber digestibility will be studied in cool-season (orchardgrass and reed canarygrass) and warm-season (switchgrass, bermudagrass, and bahia grass) grasses to determine how general this response is among forage grasses. The accuracy of the Australian shear force system for predicting forage intake by cattle and/or sheep will be determined for alfalfa, switchgrass, bermudagrass, and oat hays.

19,"This colloquium funded by the Science and Society Program addresses the question of what is Hippocratic about the Hippocratics.  For more than two millennia the Hippocratic Oath has served to guide physicians and reassure patients that the power of medical knowledge would be used for the good, but even doctors who swear by the Oath have at best a hazy idea of what is  Hippocratic  about it.  Scholars of ancient medicine use the term to refer to a group of about 70 medical treatises from the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. which were collected in antiquity under the name Hippocrates (a collection which is now referred to as the Hippocratic Corpus), though even at the time it was recognized that they were not all written by the same man.  The authors of the Corpus argue with each other over theories, therapies, pharmacy and even ethics.  There has been a great deal of scholarly activity documenting and explaining these differences but to date very little attention has been paid to what it is that the treatises have in common that led to them being selected for the Corpus.  It is not simply a rational or scientific approach to medicine - the belief that all diseases arise from processes in the physical world which conform to natural immutable laws and that patients can be treated and cured within these laws without recourse to the supernatural - because we have examples of authors who shared these rational beliefs yet were excluded from the Corpus.  By focusing on similarities and groupings within the Corpus the Colloquium will elucidate concepts of collegiality, collaboration and progress present at the very earliest stages of the medical profession to balance the current picture of egotistical competition.These issues are of interest to many members of the medical and wider community, especially in the areas of ethics and therapy.  The Hippocratic Oath is still cited in debates on abortion and euthanasia without many people beyond the scholarly community knowing that the prohibitions in the ancient Oath are not, on the surface at least, a blanket condemnation of these practices.  Moreover the Oath also contains a prohibition against surgery, which is obviously not applicable to modern medicine and was equally irrelevant to almost all the authors of the Hippocratic Corpus.  If some provisions of the original Oath can be ignored what, if any, is the relevance of the document to modern doctors?  In the context of the Colloquium it will be seen that the same question was applicable to physicians who practiced two and a half millennia ago and will strengthen the historical identity of the medical profession.The Colloquium is a triennial conference that has been meeting since 1972.  This is the first time any US institution has received the invitation to host.  The Colloquium will be a three-day conference held at the University of Texas.  The topic will be addressed in about 30 scholarly papers with ample time for questions and discussion from the audience after each paper.  The presenters will come primarily from the US and Europe, but there will also be representatives from Canada, Asia, Australasia and South Africa.

In spite of their importance, planthopper expertise is very limited, and information (particularly pertaining to North America) is scattered in an obscure and technical primary scientific literature. This project will develop an online information system and rapid identification tools available to all users, although particularly directed at USDA- APHIS-PPQ port inspectors and state identifiers. The identification tools will allow recognition of all 322 native North American delphacid planthoppers, plus 42 potentially invasive species using Lucid3 expert system software, which is specifically designed for development of online identification tools. An interactive morphology guide will assist users with technical terminology. As part of project, two students will be trained in systematic entomology through investigations of the problematic genus Delphacodes. Student projects will include investigating species definitions, developing identification tools, and a morphological and molecular phylogenetic investigation. Student projects will assist in the development of online resources by developing new identification tools and providing technical input to the online information system.

Trials for both grain sorghum and wheat will establish cultural practices that improve drainage and provide optimal growing conditions for plant growth and development, particularly on the poorly-drained Mississippi River alluvial soils. Also, optimum seeding rates for both grain sorghum and wheat will be determined based on cultural practice. Hopefully, this will establish lower optimal seeding rates than are currently being used by producers. Selecting the most adaptable hybrid/variety is a critical component of any production system. The best hybrid/variety may vary depending on factors such as locale and soil type. The sensitivity of different grain sorghum hybrids to the accumulation of aflatoxin will be determined.

About ten million acres of land are devoted to planting of wheat, oats, and triticale varieties in Texas under challenging biotic and abiotic stresses conditions. The goal of our program is to design winter wheat, oat, and triticale cultivars for specific adaptation areas and management programs in Texas. Focus will be on the Blaklands, southern, and central Texas. Our program will collaborate with a parallel center of excellence at Amarillo and Vernon Texas on breeding and research of winter wheat and triticale. Our main breeding objectives are to increase yield and yield stability, improve biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, and enhance end-use quality. Our program will also work on increasing genetic diversity and improve selection efficiency. Early generation development will be done using traditional crossing techniques in greenhouse environments at College Station and Amarillo.

29,"Shoreline erosion is a severe problem in all coastal states of United States of America. Similarly, frequent hurricanes result in several farm lands unsuitable for cultivation due to the intrusion of sea water. Among various abiotic stresses, salinity and heavy metals severely affect the growth and production of the wetland species and rice of Louisiana. Hence, there is need to understand the basis of abiotic stress tolerance in marsh grass species (e.g., smooth cordgrass) for their further improvement and also design new rice varieties, whcih can grow in salt afflicted soil. Besides, it is necessary to understand the diversity and relatedness among different smooth cordgrass and sea oats (dune grass) at the genetic level. The knowledge generated would be useful for developing superior population in the caostal wetland restoration. Most current and sophisticated cutting-edge tools will be used in this study (1) to understand the salt tolerance of smooth cordgrass using rice as a model plant, (2) to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of smooth cordgrass and sea oats, and (3) to understand the heavy metal extraction by smooth cordgrass.

30,"Since Deng Xiaoping's economic reform in the 1980s, the Chinese state has extended and intensified its economic development agenda, trying to shape its citizens to become rational market actors who prioritize commodity production. In Tibetan pastoral areas, this takes the form of efforts to develop the livestock industry by encouraging herders to intensify production. As a result, Tibetan herders have become involved in selling ever-larger numbers of yaks to Han and Chinese Muslim traders. However, reforms also allowed a measure of religious freedom. In the past five years, many lamas (religious leaders) have become concerned about the mass sale of livestock for slaughter, because the Buddhist principle of cause-and-effect suggests that killing is a serious sin to be avoided.  Ph.D. student Fnu Gaerrang, under the supervision of doctoral advisor Dr. Emily Yeh at University of Colorado at Boulder will conduct research on how the lamas, using their tremendous influence and authority, have initiated an anti-slaughter movement, persuading people to take oaths to stop selling livestock for slaughter - precisely the opposite of what the state suggests they must do to become  developed.  Many Tibetan herders have participated in these movements, even though their livelihoods depend heavily on the sale of animal products. Despite loss of income, many claim that their lives are better off. By examining this paradox of why herders feel better off even though their income has decreased, this research project investigates how Tibetan herders and lamas negotiate the imperatives of state and market to articulate their own understanding of development. It explores the relationship between Tibetan Buddhist revival, new economic reforms, and the cultural transformation of Tibetan herders in the market economy since 1980s. The research will use mixed methods, including household surveys, in-depth, semi-structured interviews, analysis of texts and visual media, and participation observation, over a period of 12 months in Tibetan areas of China's Sichuan province.The project makes several theoretical and empirical contributions. By examining the role of Tibetan Buddhism in development, first, it will contribute to analyses of the role of religious idioms in the negotiation of development.  Second, it will contribute to our understanding of the intersection between globalized free market/free trade, and global religious revival. In addition, through a focus on ethnographic and other field-based research methods rather than analysis of canonical texts, the project develops a geographical approach to the study of Tibetan Buddhism. The research project will also have significant broader impacts. In the context of Chinese assimilative economic development in Tibet that is imposing an increasing threat to Tibetan cultural identity, the examination by this project of the responses of Tibetan lamas and herders to state economic projects has practical implications for how Tibetan culture can be sustained as China continues to grow as an economic power. The co-PI will communicate project findings through publication in Chinese and Tibetan. The analysis of the tension between Chinese state development and Tibetan Buddhism will provide policymakers with a new way of thinking about the integration of the economic development with cultural sustainability.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Along with other members of the grass family, these plants provide the majority of the calories humans eat, either directly as grains or indirectly as meat and milk produced by grazing animals. Unfortunately, these important grasses are plagued by several families of plant viruses, including the barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses, which damage cereal grain production worldwide.  These viruses also harm wild grasses and can advance the spread of invasive species in nature.  How have influential viruses like these emerged and what factors have contributed to their spread and diversification? To find clues about virus history, the project team will recover and analyze genetic sequences of old viruses preserved within historical collections of dried plants around the world.

34,"This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2009. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Mary M. Guisinger is  Using plant plastid genomes as the model system to develop bioinformatic tools for characterizing genome evolution.  This research is being conducted at the University of California-Berkeley under the sponsorships of Drs. Chelsea Specht and Rasmus Nielsen. Biology is moving into the post-genomics era.  In the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of genome data pubicly available; however, this has led to a bottleneck in terms of analyses. Over 100 land plant plastid (chloroplast) genomes are currently available on GenBank, and this is largely due to their relatively small size, conserved nature, and the development of inexpensive, high-throughput sequencing methods. Crop plants, especially members of the plant order Poales (including the grasses, i.e. wheat, maize, rice, oats, sorghum, sugarcane, and barley), have received particular attention. Several plant nuclear genomes have been sequenced, including rice, and projects are in progress to sequence six additional grass nuclear genomes. Ongoing genome sequencing projects promise to provide an avalanche of data available for researchers. This project is creating tools to automate the examination of rates and patterns of genome evolution using the Poales as a model system. Plastid genome data provide a densely sampled and phylogenetically resolved framework for developing and testing these new methods. The training objectives include developing computational and programming skills and enhancing the understanding of molecular evolution, plant biology, and bioinformatics. Broader impacts include utilizing an interdisciplinary approach leading to collaboration with researchers in the fields of biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
35,"Background:  Breast cancer is one of the major causes of premature death in women; however, the combination of early detection coupled with improved treatment has significantly increased survival from this disease.  Antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors are highly effective endocrine therapies for treating early stage estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer.  Later stage or less differentiated ER-negative breast cancers are more aggressive; patient survival is relatively low; and various therapeutic regimes are less effective.  Epidermal growth factors receptors (EGFRs) are receptor tyrosine kinases overexpressed in many cancers, and EGFR2 (ErbB2/HER2/neu) is an oncogene overexpressed in 20-30% of all breast cancers.  ErbB2-positive tumors tend to be aggressive with poor prognosis for patient survival, and the recombinant monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) has been used as a single agent and in combination therapy for successfully treating patients with breast tumors overexpressing ErbB2.  However, treatment with antibodies such as Herceptin is accompanied by toxic side effects, and there is a need for alternative therapies for targeting ErbB2 in breast cancer.  Studies in this laboratory initially showed that the nonsteroidal antinflammatory drug (NSAID) tolfenamic acid (TA), betulinic acid (BA), and methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18â-olean-1,12-dien-30-oate (CDODA-Me), a synthetic derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid (a bioactive constituent of licorice), repressed specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors and inhibited tumor and cancer cell growth.  However, in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, we observed that TA decreased levels of ErbB2 protein.  Preliminary studies with BA and CDODA-Me also showed that these compounds also decreased ErbB2 protein expression in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.  We also observed that downregulation of ErbB2 was inhibited by cannabinoid 1 (CB1) and CB2 receptor antagonists.Hypothesis:  Therefore, we hypothesize that BA and CDODA-Me represent a novel class of anticancer agents that target downregulation of ErbB2 via activation of the CB1 and CB2 receptors.  This is consistent with overexpression of CB receptors in mammary tumors, and there is also a correlation with ErbB2 expression in human breast tumors.Specific Aims:  Aim 1 will initially focus on BA/CDODA-Me-dependent downregulation of ErbB2 and ErbB2-dependent pathways, and thereby characterize responses downstream from this oncogenic growth factor receptor.  Aim 2 will focus on the role of CB1 and CB2 receptors in mediating BA/CDODA-Me-dependent downregulation of ErbB2 and ErbB2-mediated signaling.  Finally, Aim 3 will investigate the in vivo anticarcinogenic activity of BA and CDODA-Me in athymic nude mouse xenograft and MMTV- ErbB2 overexpressing (breast) mouse models to confirm the in vitro mechanistic studies.Study Design:  The overall study design will focus on the effects of BA and CDODA-Me on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression, ErbB2 and ErbB2-dependent responses and genes, and on upstream ErbB2 regulatory factors PEA3, YY1, and AP-2.  CB and vanilloid receptor antagonists will be used to confirm a role for these receptors, and results of in vitro studies on BA and CDODA-Me will be confirmed in mouse models for breast cancer.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
36,"Recent outbreaks associated with nuts, peanut butter, toasted oats, and vegetables in the U. S. have increased concerns of Salmonella contamination, survival, and infectivity in or on products with reduced water activity. These products may become contaminated with Salmonella at one or more stages of pre-harvest, harvest, processing, or storage. The organism does not normally grow in low-moisture environments but some serovars can survive for prolonged periods. Salmonella encounters a myriad of stressful conditions in the food production chain that can trigger specific and general stress-protection systems that render cells more tolerant to stress and promote persistence in the environment or food. One interesting response to stress is the formation of filaments that can reach >100 I?m in length. Much of the basic biology of filamentation is unknown including triggers, production on foods, survival characteristics, and virulence. The formation of Salmonella filaments is significant to food safety because under favorable conditions the filaments will form septa and divide the filament into multiple, typical cells that can impact estimations of pathogen numbers, the effectiveness of intervention practices (i.e., critical control points), and risk assessments. This proposal will study Stress-Induced Filamentous Salmonella (SIFS) on fruits, nuts, and vegetables and specifically determine there: 1.) pathogen load assessments and persistence on foods, 2) formation and characterization, 3) mitigation measures, 4) infectious dose and virulence. This project will provide fundamental information on stress response in Salmonella that impacts persistence on fruits, nuts, and vegetables and define effective harvest and/or production practices that prevent formation or inactivate these stress-induced cells.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
37,"Stem rust is a major disease of cereal crops (wheat, barley, oat and rye) as well as important grasses including timothy, tall fescue and perennial ryegrass. Historically, stem rust has been controlled by introducing resistance genes in commercial cultivars. However, epidemics have occurred and are caused by a race shift in the pathogen population. The latest threat arose in 1999 when a new highly virulent strain, Ug99 (race TTKSK) was identified in Uganda and has since spread into Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen and recently Iran. Ug99 and its variants threaten most of the barley and wheat grown worldwide. The research proposed herein will initiate the work of identifying and characterizing avirulence genes in stem rust races. Once the avirulence genes and proteins are identified and characterized it will allow better understanding of how stem rust races shift their virulence/avirulence characteristics and provide knowledge for developing genes that confer long-term durable resistance.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

39,"Aflatoxin was discovered in groundnut meal which killed over 10,000 turkeys in England. Poultry are extremely sensitive to aflatoxin B1 with turkeys being more sensitive than chickens. Later research discovered that poultry are the most susceptible food animal species to the toxic effects of aflatoxin. Based on epidemiological data and knowledge of liver biochemistry it is suggested that humans fall somewhere in the middle of this lethality range. Lethality in humans has also been documented. In 1974, nearly 10 per cent of 1,000 patients died from suspected acute aflatoxin poisoning. Aflatoxicosis outbreaks (2004) in eastern Kenya resulted in 317 cases and 125 deaths. Specific medical implications of aflatoxin are related to their carcinogenic properties. Aflatoxin is listed as a Group I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. It is has been demonstrated in animal species to be the most potent liver carcinogen known, and is implicated as a cause of human primary heptatocellular carcinoma. This form of cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in China, Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia and causes at least 250,000 deaths annually worldwide, especially in developing countries. The human body also metabolizes aflatoxin to several compounds including aflatoxin M1 which is secreted in both mother?s milk and urine. Studies in Africa confirm infant exposure to aflatoxin via mother?s milk as well as the ability of aflatoxin in blood to cross the human placenta. Approximately 4.5 billion people around the world are exposed to virtually unregulated amounts of the toxin on a daily basis. The substance is so toxic that it is one of 19 contaminants along with mercury and DDT for which the US Food and Drug Administration imposes strict tolerance levels with only trace amounts allowed. In addition to the health impact of detecting the mycotoxins early, there is a significant economic impact. The Midwest drought in 2005 triggered an outbreak of poisonous aflatoxin at thousands of corn farms, spurring regulators and food companies to greatly expand testing of grain and milk. During the last US drought, many dairies were forced to dump aflatoxin-contaminated milk from cows fed corn contaminated with this toxin. The concern for aflatoxin-contaminated corn led company officials at the Quaker Oats breakfast cereal plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to assay every truckload of corn entering the plant for aflatoxin. The value of this solution is evident by the fact that two major grain storage companies are committed to serve as beta test sites for the product.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

ND is number one in US production of 10 crops - durum wheat and hard red spring wheat, barley, oats, flax, all dry edible beans, dry edible peas, lentils, sunflower, and canola - is third in sugar beet, fourth in potato, and ninth in soybean (ND Ag. Statistics No. 77, 2008). The value of all crops ranges from $ 4 to $ 6.5 billion/year (ND Ag. Statistics No. 77, 2008). Pest problems may severely impact yield and quality any given year, threatening the economy of the state and region, and export capacity. Examples: Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley resulted in several billion dollars loss to the state's economy from 1993-2005 (Nganje et. al., 2004; McMullen, 2005); other pests impact crops each year (Sugarbeet Research and Extension Report, http://www.sbreb.org; ND Crop and Pest Report (http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/aginfo/entomology/ndsucpr/index.htm). ND producers use pesticides as one management tool to combat pest outbreaks. For example, in 2004, 45.4% of cropland was sprayed with herbicides, 2.3% with insecticides, and 5.4% with fungicides (Pesticide Use and Pest Management Practices Survey in ND, 2004). This survey also showed that ND producers increased their use of IPM practices, such as use of field scouting and forecasting models, between 2000 and 2004 surveys. ND has a short growing season and a harsh winter climate. Citizens place high value on urban plantings which can survive the winter and which are relatively free of pest problems. A recent electronic questionnaire about urban IPM needs, sent to extension educators in 8 states of the High Plains region, including ND, indicated that almost 40% of their pest questions. This IPM project addresses those critical needs, by coordinating a statewide IPM program, providing collaborative efforts in pest management education across two states for two key crops, wheat and soybean, by demonstrating the value of integrated strategies for controlling a key disease of wheat, Fusarium head blight, by supporting the valuable resource of the NDSU Diagnostic Lab that services agriculture, homeowners, and the ornamental industry, and by increasing the outreach capabilities of the Urban IPM programs.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

(Pullman)NP216 Cross-location project associated with Pendleton, OR 5356-13210-003-00D(Long).Approach:1A&B.  Several multi-year field studies will be conducted in numerous locations in the low to intermediate rainfall zones to evaluate seeding date, rate, and methodologies for winter and spring canola in order to improve crop establishment. Data collected include seed-zone water, soil profile water storage, weed populations, crop yield, and oil and meal content.1C.  A multi-year study will be conducted in the high-rainfall zone to compare grain yield and wild oat suppressive ability of facultative wheat planted in late fall with that planted in April/May the following spring. Within each time of planting, wheat will be grown non-treated or treated with recommended or half the recommended rate of a wild oat herbicide. Wild oat population and seed production will be measured prior to grain harvest and crop yield and quality (dockage) will be determined. Consumptive water use will be determined with gravimetric soil profile samples before planting and after harvest.1D. Spring forage triticale will be planted in a naturally infested field of Russian thistle in a 2 to 3-year study. Half the plots will be sprayed with a herbicide to control Russian thistle and the weed will be allowed to grow in the remaining plots. Forage quality of the triticale will be analyzed with and without the weed and the total weed and crop biomass will be weighed. Total systems production costs will be determined and crop water use will be calculated.2A&B. Field experiments will be conducted to evaluate the performance of diversified cropping systems in the low, intermediate, and high rainfall zones. A 3-yr rotation of winter wheat, spring canola, and forage winter triticale will be compared to a rotation of winter wheat, spring barley and spring pea in the high rainfall zone while a 3-yr rotation of winter triticale, spring canola, and fallow will be compared to a rotation of winter wheat, spring barley, and fallow in the intermediate rainfall zone. The bioenergy and forage potential of two perennial species grown along stream channels will be evaluated within all rainfall zones. Biomass, grain yield, and economic and risk analyses will provide insight into overall performance.4B.  Specific themes will be defined that can be flexibly used to derive Agroecological Zones (AEZ) based on criteria that are relevant to the question asked. Three basic steps to design and develop relevant AEZ will be used: 1) Generate raster surfaces of biophysical and socio-economic variables through spatial interpolation of data; 2) Generate a spatial framework of AEZ by combining basic raster themes into more integrated variables; and 3) Characterize spatial units in terms of relevant themes such as zones separating commonly practiced cropping systems. After AEZ development, model calibration, and long-term field studies synthesis, what-if scenarios will be developed and current and future cropping systems will be evaluated. In collaboration with scientists directly involved with specific modeling we will apply calibrated models to long-term data sets to corroborate these models under a wide-range of regional conditions.

We showed that vitamin E (E) supplementation enhances T cell function in the aged. In Objective 1-A, we will test the hypothesis that T cell receptor (TCR)-induced signalosomes (combination of protein and lipids that are formed at the site of T cell and antigen presenting cells) exhibit age- and vitamin E (E)-related differences in their patterns of protein and lipid recruitment. We will identify qualitative and quantitative age- and E-related differences in the protein and lipid composition of signalosomes using an enhanced magnetic immunoisolation procedure and highly sensitive and quantitative proteomics and lipidomics methods. In objective 1-B, we will test the hypothesis that higher frequencies of specific cytokine polymorphisms contribute to incidence and severity of respiratory infection (RI) in the aged and that the effect of E on RI is dependent on cytokine genotype. This will be tested using data and DNA samples collected from a 1-year randomized, double-blind, controlled (RTC) study of E supplementation in elderly. In Objective 2 we will test the hypothesis that a long- term calorie restriction (CR) intervention in humans will enhance T cell-mediated function and that the CR- mediated effect is due to intrinsic changes in T cells and/or a reduction in prostaglandin PGE2 production. This hypothesis will be tested utilizing subjects enrolled in the NIA- supported multi-center RTC, CALERIE Phase 2 and determining the effect of CR on T cell subsets proliferation, and intra- and extra-cellular cytokine, and PGE2 levels before, and following 1 and 2 years of 25% CR.

52,"Oats (Avena, sativa L.) are a vital grain and forage crop for South Dakota. According to the USDA's 2007 South Dakota Agricultural Statistics Service report, South Dakotans planted an average of 153,036 hectares between 2003 and 2007. Sixty-four thousand seven hundred and seventy seven hectares were harvested for grain and 88,259 hectares were harvested for forage. In South Dakota, oats are used mainly for feed, forage, companion crop, and/or straw. There are also several markets that lie beyond the borders of South Dakota, though. The racehorse feed industry is an integral out-of-state market. Specialty markets also exist in the form of bird feed, cover crops, forage oats, cosmetics, and antioxidants. In the past, millers considered South Dakota a viable source of oats when environmental conditions prevented optimal yield and quality from being achieved by Canadian growers. The devaluation of the dollar and rising transportation costs increases the potential for milling oats to be purchased from South Dakota. Beyond this, a number of factors indicate that oat production may increase significantly in the foreseeable future: Oats have exceeded $5.00 per bushel for March 2009 delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade. The current local price in the Brookings area is approximately $540 per metric ton. High corn and soybean prices have reduced oat hectares in the corn belt. A significant area of South Dakota is suited for small grain production. Oats are a multi-purpose, low input crop. Yield reductions caused by herbicide carryover have decreased through the increased use of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms). Minimum and no-till farming practices increases the need for a small grain crop to be included in the rotation scheme in order to help break disease and insect pest cycles. The livestock industry has expressed the need for a low-input grain and forage crop. South Dakota's location is in close proximity to the millers and racehorse markets. Cultural research with fungicides and fertility will promote an increase in production. Fungicide options allow the release of high performance lines previously rejected. Markets may evolve with diverse germplasm development. The SDSU oat program's primary strategy is to utilize resources efficiently while creating improved varieties. This will be accomplished by using conventional breeding methods, including modified bulk, mass selection, and single seed descent methods at different generation levels. Because plant breeding is based on probability, program success is increased by evaluating large numbers of diverse crosses, early generation populations, and derived lines. Early generation seed quality selection, disease screening, and generation advancement in the greenhouse cycles rapidly skew populations for desired grain quality and crown rust resistance. Subsequent yield trials of derived lines and seed increases result in varietal release. The value in dollars of a new variety is difficult to estimate. The value isn't limited to the producer, there is an additive effect from producer to ultimately the consumer. New varieties not only benefit South Dakota, surrounding states benefit as well.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
53,"Agricultural practices over the last 100 years have demonstrated that the intense selection imposed by crop monocultures results in the evolution of aggressive pathogen populations with high reproductive rates. In fact, the current difficulty faced by oat growers in the upper Midwest, Canada and world-wide locations is a devastating testament to the strength of selection for reproductive success in P. coronata. Yet, the linkage between agricultural and natural populations, and the importance of natural populations as reservoirs of pathogen variation, remains unexplored even for P. coronata, a pathogen with an apparent broad host range. The historic and current importance of low-input, high yield oat production and the experimental tractability of the system begs further attention. Secondly, as major efforts are mounted to identify new plant species and genotypes for both food and energy production, the problems of pathogen exchange between natural and agricultural systems will be accentuated. For example, switchgrass is promoted for biofuels production with breeding to improve productivity, and for harvest from natural populations. As such efforts continue, natural and agricultural populations will come into more frequent contact, making a better understanding of pathogen exchange between differing host plant communities imperative to sustainable energy production.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
54,"Oklahoma is the second largest producer of winter wheat in the U.S. (NASS 2007). Stored product losses resulting from insect infestation are extensive and are usually associated with the occurrence of internal feeders such as lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica Fabricious) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) and rice weevils (Sitophilus oryzae Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The reasons why psocids have only recently risen to prominence as serious pests of stored grain in Australia are not fully known. However, it has been suggested that the reduction of residual pesticides to treat grain and structures is a major factor (CSIRO GRL 2003). It's also hypothesized that phosphine and other measures currently used are effective against other insect pests (beetles) but not psocids thereby leaving psocids free from competition and predation (CSIRO GRL 2003). It is also suggested that because psocids are highly mobile insects, they will reinvade fumigated grain before other insects; in the absence of competition and predation, psocid population growth is explosive resulting in spectacular outbreaks (CSIRO GRL 2003). In relation to grain shipments for export, psocid infestation can lead to serious financial penalties. Psocid infestations also lead to significant weight losses in stored grain. They suggest that because psocids erode the surface layers of grains and damage is difficult to see, their status as pests is often underestimated. In ition, infestation of seed grain by psocids can lead to reduced seed germination as a result of psocid preference for grain germ (Kucerova 2002). A major source of concern is the finding that psocid infestations in grain storages, grain processing facilities, and product warehouses could exacerbate other stored-product pest problems (Opit, unpublished data). When psocids are present in large numbers, they taint the food on which they are living, thereby deteriorating the quality of stored commodities (Turner 1994, Kucerova 2002). Psocids also spread spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms and their importance as a health hazard stems from this problem (Kucerova 2002). Psocids are persistent pests in grain storages, grain processing facilities, and product warehouses (Rees and Walker 1990). The reasons they are considered stored-product pests have already been stated. Psocids are highly resistant to entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria; this may be due to cuticular fatty amides that decrease hydrophobicity and static charge, thereby reducing adhesion by microorganisms (Turner 1988, Lord and Howard 2004). The study on diet showed that corn, milo, barley, oats, wheat, and rice are all suitable for rapid multiplication of psocid populations (Opit and Throne 2008b). As already mentioned, little research has been conducted on the biology and ecology of stored-product psocids worldwide and this presents a challenge to the development of effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs to mitigate their economic impact. Without user-friendly sampling protocols that can be recommended by extension personnel and county educators, population-based management programs will not gain widespread acceptance.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

56,"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will generate a  light-tagged  reporter phage that can confer a bioluminescent signal to the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. alisalensis. P. syringae pv. alisalensis is the causative agent of bacterial blight, a contagious and damaging disease afflicting cruciferous vegetables. Since the severity of the disease renders the crop unmarketable, it is essential to be able to correctly identify the agent on asymptomatic and diseased plants, and from inoculum reservoirs. The Phase I goal is to develop a bioluminescent reporter phage for the detection of P. syringae pv. alisalensis. The objective is to generate a specific P. syringae pv. alisalensis light-tagged reporter phage and then perform feasibility studies to demonstrate that the light-tagged reporter can be used as a P. syringae pv. alisalensis detection system. The research is expected to generate a viable recombinant reporter phage that can rapidly, sensitively, and specifically confer a bioluminescent signal response, and hence detect P. syringae pv. alisalensis.The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the P. syringae pv. alisalensis diagnostic may help to reduce damage to commercially grown vegetable crops throughout the U.S. Symptoms first appear as small water-soaked flecks on the lower foliage. These flecks or lesions expand and become surrounded by bright yellow borders that eventually coalesce to form large necrotic areas. Bacterial blight infestations can result in crop damage to 60% of the commercial field. P. syringae pv. alisalensis has a broad host range afflicting monocots (California brome, oats), crucifers (cauliflower, broccoli, broccoli raab, brussels sprouts, cabbage, radish, arugula) and tomato. The value of Brassica oleracea vegetables alone (e.g. broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and brussels sprouts) is estimated at $1.3 billion annually in the U.S. Consequently, the economic losses due to bacterial blight are potentially severe. However, to date, there are no commercially available or approved P. syringae pv. alisalensis detection methodologies. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a novel diagnostic kit for the detection of this agriculturally important phytopathogen.

57,"Traditionally, genetic improvement of cereal crops has involved choosing two varieties with desirable characteristics, crossing these to make a hybrid, and then using artificial selection to create descendant plants that maximize these desirable characteristics. This approach has been successful for many years and has resulted in the bountiful wheat, oat and barley harvests that feed the world. Traditional breeding, however, is slow and has largely proceeded with little understanding of the actual genes, genetic pathways, and cellular processes that are targeted by artificial selection. Developing new strategies for crop improvement, that employ either traditional crosses or transgenic approaches, will require us to determine the molecular genetic causes of important trait differences. My research strives to understand the genetic basis of drought and heat stress response in grass crops, in particular by asking how common genes affect, for example, both flowering time and drought stress response. In some cases, common genes control different traits, and breeding strategies that seek to optimize one trait (for example, productivity in a dry climate) inadvertently negatively affect a second trait (for example, productivity in a hot environment). My work aims to identify the genetic basis of these correlations, and to develop breeding strategies that allow us to optimize combinations of desirable agricultural traits, particularly in wheat.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Residents deal with poverty, rural isolation, low educational achievement and cultural dissonance. Lakotas were hunters not farmers or ranchers. According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture (2009), the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation has 463 farms and ranches of which 266 are operated by American Indians. This is 57% whereas the population is 90% Indian. The Reservation is primarily grazing land suitable for cattle, bison and horses but some crops grown include barley, corn, oats, soybeans, sunflower, and wheat. Gross sales were $54,541,000 of which only $17,835,000 was received by American Indian producers. One fourth of the 266 American Indian agricultural producers on the reservation gross less than $10,000 annually and less than a fourth of them gross above $100,000.

Specific objectives for the project period:  Optimize methodologies for the extraction and analysis of soluble oat fiber components; determine environmental variation in the quantity and quality of ▀-glucan as characterized in the first objective in newly developed high ▀-glucan cultivars and other oat cultivars; and determine relationships between oil concentration and ▀-glucan concentration in segregating crosses for these traits, as to how each affects groat breakage during dehulling.Approach:Health benefits derived in humans from the consumption of oats are currently understood to be related to the molecular weight of the soluble fiber component commonly called beta-glucan and the increased viscosity of the gut contents created by high molecular weight beta-glucan. We will develop optimized methodologies for the extraction of beta-glucan in order to evaluate its physical and structural, molecular weight, and viscometric properties. We will collect oats samples, including those from newly developed high soluble fiber cultivars, from replicated plots grown in diverse environments over several years. Then we will use our newly developed methods for the analysis of soluble fiber quality to determine how environment might affect the quality and concentration of beta-glucan, especially in the newly developed high beta-glucan cultivars. Finally, we will test how beta-glucan affects the milling quality of oats. Because beta-glucan is in the cell walls of oats, it is thought to provide a strengthening effect, which reduces groat breakage during dehulling. However, high oil in oats also seems to prevent groat breakage, and currently breeders have been unable to separate the traits of high oil and high beta-glucan in oats. A collaborating genetics program has developed populations of recombinant inbred lines from oat crosses designed to be segregating for high oil and high beta-glucan. We will evaluate the phenotypes of these lines and test their behavior during dehulling to determine the relative roles of oil and beta-glucan in preventing groat breakage during oat milling.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Data collected by the author (Shaik, S 2007a) from historical census of agriculture and the National Agricultural Statistical Services reveals that the number of farms in North Dakota has declined from 74,400 in 1910 to 30,300 in 2006. The corresponding acreage amount of farms in North Dakota increased from 28,427 thousand acres to 39,400 thousand acres leading to an increase in farm size from 382 acres to 1,300 acres. A century ago, North Dakota was overwhelmingly a wheat state; today the leading crops are oil crops. According to North Dakota Agricultural Statistical Service publication, the state ranks first in the production of barley, durum wheat, spring wheat, all dry edible beans, pinto beans, navy beans, sunflower, canola, flaxseed, oats, dry edible peas. It ranks second in all wheat, lentils and honey, third in sugar beets and rye; fourth in potatoes, and tenth in soybeans.

64,"North Dakota has traditionally been ranked either first or second in production of numerous agronomic crops including durum wheat, spring wheat, oat, barley, flaxseed, lentil, dry edible bean, canola, and sunflower. This has resulted in a ranking of third for principal crops harvested, but only a ranking of eleventh in cash receipts for crops, and twenty-eighth in net farm income. Thus, even though producers in North Dakota lead the nation in the production of at least eight crops, they struggle to make a living. The reasons for the low net farm income could include lower yields and higher production costs. However, regardless of the reasons, producers need to discover ways to combat low profit margins per unit of land. Increasing farm size generally is not an option due to high land costs. A viable alternative requiring higher management, but also providing increased income potential, is high-value crop production. These products are typically perishable, of high quality and specific value, and increasingly sold through specialized markets. This production alternative may help diversify farming operations and increase net returns. In addition, numerous communities have developed farmer's markets due to the increase in demand for locally produced food. The United States Department of Agriculture reported that between 1994 and 2006, the number of U.S. farmers' markets more than doubled to over 3,700, and the value of U.S. agricultural products directly sold increased thirty-seven percent from $592 million to $812 million. North Dakota's large diurnal temperature differences during the growing season are ideal for high-quality and high-yielding specialty crops such as vegetables, herbs, and small fruits. Many producers are experimenting with small fruits and vegetables, utilizing limited production information available from nearby states and learning from personal experiences. Sustainable production practices are desperately needed to avoid costly mistakes at a time when financial stability is already a concern. With the introduction of Roundup Ready crops in the 1990's and the explosion in the adoption of glyphosate-resistant crops, the acreage receiving more than one application of glyphosate has increased dramatically nation-wide. Glyphosate label additions allowing pre-harvest applications to several non-glyphosate-resistant crops has further increased the acreage treated with glyphosate. Currently, glyphosate is the largest-selling single crop-protection chemical product in the market. Nontarget injury from glyphosate drift to non-glyphosate-resistant crops has been a concern since the introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops. Most research has shown detrimental effects when drift occurred early in the growing season and that nontarget monocot crops are more sensitive than dicot crops. However, since this chemical is translocated within a plant, there is potential injury to the current season growth as well as tubers used for seed the following year. Potato seed producers as well as commercial producers need to be educated on the potential risks associated with glyphosate applications near a potato field.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
65,"23. Because of the current corn prices increase, swine producers, especially limited resource farmers, will be hard pressed to manage their swine operations effectively. Therefore, alternative feed ingredients that may be locally available may fill in the need created by the current corn price increase. Small grains such as barley, oats, and wheat can be useful feedstuffs in swine feeding programs. The other advantage of considering these alternative feed ingredients is most of them contain a substantial amount of prebiotic factors that facilitates the establishment and proliferation of some of the desirable bacteria in the large intestine of the animals. This could be good news to swine producers if successful to feed antibiotics-free diets -- an issue that is currently gathering momentum from consumers regarding the use of antibiotics in animal feed.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
66,"Objective(s): Identify milling, baking, and pasta processing traits of experimental and advanced lines of hard spring and durum wheat that impact end-use quality and the overall development and release of new commercial cultivars of wheat. Identify specific biochemical components in wheat that are associated with end-use baking quality traits. More specifically, to develop rapid methods to characterize proteins, which are initially important for predicting end-use quality; to determine the variation in free asparagine content in wheat, which is an important precursor for the formation of carcinogenic acrylamide during bread baking and toasting; and to identify the efficacy and impact of sulfur fertilization on end-use baking quality of hard spring wheat. Optimize methodologies for the extraction and analysis of soluble oat fiber components; determine environmental variation in the quantity and quality of ?-glucan as characterized in the first objective in newly developed high ?-glucan cultivars and other oat cultivars; and determine relationships between oil concentration and ?-glucan concentration in segregating crosses for these traits, as to how each affects groat breakage during dehulling.Approach:   Approximately 4000 hard spring and 1000 durum wheat experimental lines will be submitted by Federal, State, and private breeders, and special interest groups on an annual basis and evaluated for end-use quality. Wheat will be obtained from different generations of development in specific breeding programs, which will include early-generation, preliminary, and advanced lines and include commercial cultivars as controls. Measureable end-use quality traits include test weight, size, seed weight, sprout damage, physical evidence of disease, and protein and ash content; milling performance as a function of flour and semolina yield; flour and semolina color, protein, and ash content; dough strength properties; bread baking quality; and pasta processing quality. The Fargo Genotyping Laboratory will identify quantitative trait loci regions associated with end-use quality, primarily kernel and dough strength traits on selected hard spring wheat samples. Research will be conducted on the rapid characterization of protein extracts from wheat and flour by testing two different protein extraction methods. Variation in free asparagine content in wheat lines will be measured. The efficacy and impact of sulfur fertilization on end-use baking quality of hard spring wheat, specifically protein composition and amino acid profiles, will be determined as a function of dough strength characteristics. To develop optimized methodologies for the extraction of beta-glucan from oats, samples of oats will be obtained from replicated plots grown in diverse environments over several years. The newly developed methods for the analysis of soluble fiber quality will be used to determine how environment might affect the quality and concentration of beta-glucan, especially in newly developed high beta-glucan cultivars. Beta-glucan effects on milling quality of oats will also be tested. Because beta-glucan is in the cell walls of oats, it is thought to provide a strengthening effect, which reduces groat breakage during dehulling. However, high oil in oats also seems to prevent groat breakage, and currently breeders have been unable to separate the traits of high oil and high beta-glucan in oats. A collaborating genetics program has developed populations of recombinant inbred lines from oat crosses designed to be segregating for high oil and high beta-glucan. We will evaluate the phenotypes of these lines and test their behavior during dehulling to determine the relative roles of oil and beta-glucan in preventing groat breakage during oat milling.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
67,"The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.This award will support a twenty-four month postdoctoral research fellowship by Dr. Alexis Webb in the laboratory of Dr. Andrew Oates at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, Germany.The periodic formation of somites along the vertebrate body axis is evidence of an oscillator in the developing embryo. In zebrafish this cellular segmentation clock consists of members of the her/hes transcription factor family, which are thought to form a negative feedback loop through transcriptional repression. Static gene expression patterns in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) tissue provide an overview of the process, but are incomplete because oscillations occur in single cells and are dynamic. The host lab has developed live transgenic reporter lines for the cyclic genes her1 and her7 that accurately recapitulate the spatiotemporal phenomena, opening the door to dynamic analysis of the segmentation clock. This reporter line allows continuous monitoring in both the developing zebrafish embryo in vivo and isolated PSM cells in vitro. A tissue and cellular-level analysis of these embryo lines is ongoing, but in order to understand the fundamental properties of the clock, it is necessary to know the behavior of the individual pieces, i.e. the isolated oscillating cells. This research studies current models of the segmentation clock for the first time at the single cell level. The first objective of the project is measurement of dynamic properties of gene expression in single PSM cells dispersed in culture such as frequency, amplitude, relative phase to other cells, and duration of oscillation to determine whether individual PSM cells continue to function as autonomous oscillators in vitro or if additional factors are needed to maintain clock behavior. Second, mutations to the genetic oscillator or manipulations to signaling pathways between cells can further test the necessary and sufficient components within current segmentation clock models.Beyond the project's intellectual merit, this fellowship funds training for a young US researcher to expand her research background into developmental biology, and specifically, zebrafish as a model organism. The host lab will provide an outstanding mentoring environment in a world-renowned research institution. Such knowledge will prove critical as the PI moves forward in her professional development and begins a teaching and research career at small liberal arts college, where model organisms fit into well-rounded science training for undergraduates.

68,"Background:  An extensive body of work supports a fundamental link between inflammation, generation of reactive oxygen species, and multiple sclerosis (MS).  Although the treatment of MS is complicated by a diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations, recent evidence strongly supports the concept that regulatory factors that skew in association with disease severity may serve as potential targets for new therapeutic interventions.  One such regulatory factor is Nrf2, a transcription factor that controls expression of genes encoding important antioxidant response proteins.  Nrf2 is strikingly upregulated in the lesions of MS, suggesting the potential utility of Nrf2 activity as a biomarker of disease and measure of therapeutic response.A family of small molecules known to potently induce Nrf2 (the triterpenoids) is under investigation in our laboratory for their utility in the chemoprevention and treatment of cancer and inflammatory disorders.  Triterpenoids represent a broad category of molecules ubiquitously present in the plant kingdom, and used widely in Asian medicine (usually in the form of herbal extracts).  Oleanolic acid has been most extensively studied and has served as the platform for synthesis of 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) and the CDDO-methyl ester (CDDO-ME) currently in Phase III clinical trials in patients with chronic kidney disease.  In preclinical studies, CDDO-methyl amide (CDDO-MA) was shown to exert neuroprotective effects through potent activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway in several model systems, including a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease.  Our own preliminary data show selected synthetic triterpenoids completely reverse disease in preclinical models of MS (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, EAE).The central hypothesis of this proposal is that exploration of diverse triterpenoids will enable careful dissection of the Nrf2-dependent and -independent pathways mediating triterpenoid neuroprotection and will define a novel class of potent and effective therapeutic and chemopreventive agents for MS.  To address this hypothesis, we pursue a series of three specific aims.  In Aim 1, we will define new classes of neuroprotective triterpenoids through a combination of organic synthesis and natural product isolation.  In Aim 2, we will define structure activity relationships for molecules developed in Aim 1 by evaluating the immunomodulatory properties of our isolated triterpenoids.  A series of in vitro assays will test the capacity of triterpenoids to modulate expression of key inflammatory enzymes in antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocytes in vitro, plus APC/T cell trafficking (including migration into the central nervous system [CNS]) and APC-T cell interactions in vivo.  Finally in Aim 3, we will determine the effectiveness of lead triterpenoids as agents for the treatment and prevention of disease progression in the PLP and MOG EAE models of MS and in a rat model of acute injury and demyelination induced by LysoPhosphatidylCholine (LPC).Innovation and Impact:  The proposed streamlined approach to identifying novel low-abundance triterpenoid natural products is unprecedented and employs innovative mass spectrometry techniques that can be used as a model throughout the natural products isolation field.  This proposal is also innovative in its incorporation of powerful imaging strategies that will enable in situ dynamic immune cell imaging with high spatial  and temporal resolutions.  Our principal collaborator in this effort, Dr. Huang, has successfully utilized 2Photon Laser Scanning Microscopy (2PLSM) as a tool to offer an unprecedented real-time glimpse into how immune cells gain access to the CNS and how effective immune surveillance operates on an individual cellular level within the host.  Through this ongoing collaboration, we will leverage novel in vivo imaging strategies to assess mechanisms through which synthetic triterpenoids may suppress neuroinflammation through modulation of APC-T cell interactions and lymphocyte trafficking into the CNS.  The impact of this work will be extremely high as it (a) opens the door to evaluation of the previously unexplored natural and synthetic triterpenes; (b) initiates a line of investigation into the role of key intermediates in redox metabolism in the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of triterpenes; and (c) establishes a paradigm for isolation, characterization and validation of novel triterpenoids in the neurodegenerative disorders that can be applied more broadly to other disorders, including cancer.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
69,"Low moisture or dry foods do not support bacterial growth, and have been considered relatively safe from contamination with pathogenic bacteria. However, recent outbreaks of salmonellosis linked to low moisture foods (e.g., chocolate, dried milk, almonds, peanut butter, peanut products, toasted oats cereal and dried spices) have demonstrated that this bacterium survives dry conditions very well. Furthermore, Salmonella cells subjected to dry conditions become more heat tolerant. This response has clear implications for food processing when heating is used to kill potential food pathogens making Salmonella an important emerging problem for this food sector. Since iron homeostasis plays a fundamental role in the survival and virulence of Salmonella, its role in bacterial tolerance to stresses has been studied. This study aims at determining and controlling the protective systems in Salmonella that trigger resistance to thermal treatments observed in dry foods. Salmonella resilience to dry conditions and thermal treatments is linked by a common physiological response relying on the iron available. Control of iron concentrations would modulate its resistance to thermal treatments. Specific objectives: 1) Determine the relationship between iron available in cereal and the resistance of Salmonella to thermal inactivation and dryness. 2) Determine the molecular and physical chemical changes induced by changes in the iron availability, temperature, and water activity. 3) Determine the effective combinations of temperature, dryness, iron concentration, and iron chelators to reduce Salmonella presence in dry foods. Approach: Four Salmonella serovars will be inoculated in a toasted oats cereal model and subjected to very low moisture vs. thermal treatments in presence of different iron concentrations, or anaerobic conditions. The effect of similar conditions on genetic status will be determined by advanced molecular and spectroscopy to develop a theoretical model. This model will be employed to design treatments to be tested in dry cereals. Potential impact and expected outcomes: The proposed research will provide information on the factors influencing the emerging problem of thermal treatment resistance of Salmonella in dry foods.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
70,"Pathogens and pests can be the most important constraints on crop yields. They can also poison food supplies by contributing to mycotoxin contamination. Genetic resistance is the preferred solution because of its low cost and ease of deployment but often resistance is futile. The short generation time and large populations of pathogens and pests enable them to evolve new races that overcome resistance. They similarly overcome pesticides. Many biotic threats to US crops are controlled solely by quarantine. Clearly there is a need to understand crop immune systems sufficiently so that stable, artificial immunity can be generated and deployed. In plants the natural sensors that detect infection produce weak signals but these are amplified to an effective level by a poorly understood mechanism. Our project is focused on understanding how the signals are amplified. The amplification mechanism is based on the creation and detection of specific plant peptides. We will study both creation and detection and we will validate our findings by attempting to generate stable, artificial immunity in maize to fungal infection. Validated findings should be broadly applicable to the other grass crops including wheat, rice, sugarcane, barley, oats, switchgrass, and Miscanthus.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
71,"Many smaller scale organic producers that have a variable product mix are always interested in well designed studies that present them with options for the diversification of their farms. These options can include new rotation options (crops) that may contribute to both the fertility of a given rotation plot as well as provide potential new marketing opportunities. Pasture raised organic broiler chickens are an option for both the fertility and marketing components of the previous statement but this can only realistic if the exorbitant cost of organic poultry diets can be reduced. Naked oats is a husk-less oat variety that is gaining in popularity as an ingredient in multi-grain products for human consumption but is also a potential ingredient for incorporation into organic poultry diets. Naked oats are higher in protein than conventional oats and have an amino acid profile that may reduce the proportion of high cost, high protein supplements that are currently needed to produce balanced organic diets. If our hypothesis is correct and naked oats can be used at up to 70-80% of the diet for pasture reared broilers, this becomes a new option for organic producers. They can produce naked oats for incorporation into their own organic poultry diets, custom grow naked oats for other organic poultry producers, or sell the oats for incorporation into organic multi-grain products for human consumption. One other aspect of the poultry portion of the proposed studies will be a detailed comparison of commercial and heritage strain broiler lines for their suitability to both our pasture rearing system and the strain responses to diets containing a high proportion of naked oats. The other objectives of this multi-year is to quantify the contribution of poultry to the fertility pattern within a given plot and variety testing of different Naked oats cultivars.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
72,"This project seeks to add value in to wheat and specialty grain crops, thus substantively increasing their production and enhancing the diversity, profitability, and sustainability of organic farms. Moreover, the methods and techniques developed in this work can be applied to other small grain and specialty crops. This work will involve conducting advanced on-farm research and development that emphasizes observation of, experimentation with, and innovation for organic farms, including animal and crop production and marketing and socioeconomic issues. These issues will include identification of factors reducing yields, efficiency, productivity, economic returns on organic farms and the economic and socioeconomic contributions of organic farming to producers, processors and local communities. For both plant and animal-based organic products, we will develop, improve and evaluate allowable post-harvest handling, processing and food safety practices to reduce toxins and microbial contamination, while increasing shelf-life, quality and other economically important characteristics. Also, this project will strengthen organic seed systems, including seed and transplant production and protection, and plant breeding and selection for organic production. Goals of organic seed systems can include, but are not limited to: disease and pest resistance, stress tolerance, quality and yield improvement, and genetic mechanisms to prevent inadvertent introduction of GMO traits through cross-pollination. Our on-farm research and farm, processing, and marketing case studies will add value a) through production techniques that achieve and maintain high grain quality and b) through processing and identification of high-value varieties/landraces that are well adapted to organic management. An innovative aspect of our work is developing the information necessary to implement breeding for flavor. Another innovative aspect of our work is development of scale-appropriate production and processing options. This work is particularly appropriate for the Northeast region given the large numbers of organic vegetable farmers who are seeking to rotate out of vegetable crops without losing income. Finally, a third innovative component of the project is the collaboration among researchers and farmers in North Dakota, New York, and Pennsylvania. The collaboration will be mutually beneficial. North Dakota organic growers can provide Northeast growers with potentially highly valuable landraces of emmer and heritage spring wheats. In return, the research in the Northeast on developing cost-effective methods of dehulling and processing can be adapted for use with North Dakota organic farmers, who have been constrained in their marketing of food grains by lack of such capacity (S. Zwinger, pers.com). It is also important to note that it is not uncommon for varieties that perform well in either North Dakota or New York to perform well in the other state. In fact, North Dakota and New York have co-released both a spring wheat and a spring oat variety in past years. Consequently, the alliance with NDSU and NPSAS in this project is a natural one that will benefit both regions.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
73,"The long term goal of this project is to eliminate insect pests from the US food and feed supply with a sensor device, minimize exposure of humans and animals to residual chemicals or insecticides, and reduce financial losses due to grain damage. The lesser grain borer (LGB) is a devastating, long-lived pest of stored wheat, corn and other cereal grains in the US and other parts of the world. Adults and larvae are voracious feeders causing damaged kernels, insect fragments in milled products, powdery residues (frass), a characteristic pungent odor, price discounts, and possible rejection of commodity. The LGB can penetrate many types of packaging material including seed sacks in addition to sound grain. Grain production, storage, and processing are important industries. More than 12 billion bushels of corn and wheat are grown in the US each year with a value exceeding $25 billion. Additionally, over a billion bushels of barley, oats, rice, rye, and sorghum are grown each year with a value over $3 billion. It has been estimated that 5-10% of stored grain in developed countries and 35% of stored grain in developing countries is lost to insect damage. Because of the extensive reach of this insect, there is also very broad societal benefit in achieving widespread use of effective sensors for detecting the insects early. Estimates of the cost of grain loss due to insect, mold, and mycotoxin damage to the 15 billion bushels of grain stored in the US each year have ranged from $500 million to more than $1 billion. Domestic flour millers have a low tolerance for live insects: their presence signs of insect feeding can result in grain rejection. Rejection produces additional fumigation and transportation expenses, as much as 10-20% of the grain value. The foundation of a successful integrated pest management (IPM) program is an effective monitoring system. SDC declares that it can provide that foundation with its sensor device. SDC has two objectives in this proposal: 1) Modify the preliminary prototype device for LGB detection, using basic and applied knowledge, and compare its performance and efficacy with current methods in a field test and 2) Demonstrate uniqueness and the concentration levels of marker pheromones associated with infestations of the LGB. SDC's hypothesis is that specific organic volatiles can be good markers to differentiate insects infesting stored crops from other harmless emanations, e.g. gases associated with normal crop odor, or other MVOCs. Marker biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from this insect, the aggregation pheromones dominicalene 1 and dominicalene 2, are found in sufficient concentrations in the headspace in enclosures containing these insects to permit detection with SDC's highly sensitive and selective sensor device. SDC is confident that this work will result in a complete sensor device that can be used effectively to detect BVOCs from lesser grain borers, relate those BVOCs to LGB infestation size, and provide the information needed by farmers and elevator operators to take action to prevent infestation growth in our food and feed supply.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
74,"Objective(s): Objective 1: Identify the key isozymes involved in avenanthramide biosynthesis and evaluate their role in determining the levels and types of avenanthramides produced in planta.Objective 2: Determine the physiological effect of avenanthramides in mammals by producing pure compounds for collaborative research with nutrition scientists. Objective 3: Evaluate oat and barley germplasm for antioxidants and other phytonutrients.Approach:The overarching rationale for these experiments is to determine the role of specific isozymes of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and / or 4-coumaryl CoA ligase (4-CL) in avenanthramide biosynthesis, and their relation to the biosynthesis of specific forms of avenanthramides. Although, a number of plant DNA sequences corresponding to both PAL and 4-CL are found in GenBank, currently there are none from oat. It is expected that, like most plants, oat will possess multiple isozymes of PAL and 4-CL, thus it is important to determine how many genes are present in oat and to obtain DNA sequence information for these isozymes. These data will allow development of isozyme specific probes to evaluate expression of the target genes over the course of seed maturation and in different plant organs in field grown oats. Although a route to the synthesis of avenanthramides is available, this method is cumbersome and time-consuming. We have found the use of the peptide coupling reagent benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexaflurophosphate (BOP) to be effective in the synthesis of avenanthramides. We will also explore the use of other peptide coupling reagents for their utility in avenanthramide synthesis. The synthesized avenanthramides are being used, in collaboration with nutrition scientists at the USDA Jean Mayer Laboratory of Human Nutrition (Tufts University) and at the University of Wisconsin, Department of Kinesiology, to evaluate the effects of avenanthramides in mammalian systems. Oat and barley germplasm will be evaluated for the content of other phytochemical constituents that may have physiological effects, and for unusually high concentrations of known phytochemicals.

75,"Diversification of agricultural production is important for the maintenance of a vibrant rural sector. Canola (spring and winter) could be an important crop to help Michigan diversify its agriculture, complement its cropping systems, and maintain a profitable and vibrant rural sector. Canola has the potential to improve our economy, health, environment and agricultural systems. Oats are an important crop for the diversification and continuing vitality of Michigan's agriculture. Oats are grown both as a grain and a forage crop. They also play key roles in crop rotations to reduce disease, insect and weed buildups, to provide straw for livestock bedding and as a companion crop to establish forage seedings without the use of herbicides. Oat grain has the highest protein levels among temperate cereals and a very desirable amino acid balance for young animals and non-ruminating livestock. In summary, this project will help to identify and test crops for farmers to help them diversify their production systems in terms of economics, labor, environment and social considerations.

77,"We can contribute to stable, environmentally responsible small grains production in North Carolina through the development of wheat, oat and triticale varieties and germplasms with superior agronomic traits, disease and insect resistance, and end-use quality. The average acreage planted to winter wheat and oats in North Carolina is approximately 550,000 acres with a production value of around $130m. Wheat is the most important small grain in the state. Triticale occupies a negligible acreage at present but its potential as a hog and poultry feed warrants research in cultivar development. Three public institutions and two private companies have wheat cultivar development efforts in the southeastern United States, in addition to NCSU. Private efforts in winter wheat mirrors a trend seen in corn and soybeans where investment is being concentrated in the Mississippi delta and Corn Belt states. Many southeastern seed retailers are licensing public developed wheat and oat cultivars on an exclusive basis. To better meet these needs, small grains programs at state universities in NC, SC, GA, FL, and LA formed a cooperative effort (SUNGRAINS) to coordinate cultivar development research and share in royalties. Even before these recent developments, it was widely acknowledged that both public and private cooperation was needed to provide for the needs of the commercial small grain grower and end user. The basic research on breeding methodologies and genetics conducted by the public sector can be exploited by public and private breeders to develop superior cultivars more efficiently or to develop value-added grain types for new market opportunities. The average life of a wheat variety in North Carolina is five seasons. The demise of a typical cultivar results from changes in virulence patterns of the powdery mildew and /or leaf rust fungi. There is a continuous need to provide wheat breeders with new sources of resistance to these pathogens. Four additional pathogens, Fusarium head blight (FHB), stripe rust, Stagonospora blotch (SNB), and stem rust have threatened, or caused serious economic impact, to wheat production during the past five years. It is estimated that over one half of all US wheat cultivars are susceptible to the new Ug99 race of stem rust and a major global initiative is in place to incorporate resistance into wheat cultivar development programs. We can provide new and potentially more stable resistances to these fungi by 1) continuing to introgress new alleles from wild wheat relatives, 2) pyramiding these novel genes with resistance genes currently in the wheat gene pool using molecular markers, and, 3) conduct comprehensive greenhouse and field evaluations annually on advanced generation lines for all six pathogens. A major constraint in winter oat production is winterkilling due to extreme temperatures. We can improve winterhardiness in oat by building on recent work whereby we determined the genetics and associated molecular markers for winter survival component traits.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
78,"Type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes incidence has reached very high levels in the U.S. and continues to increase. This is directly related to the high proportion of the American population that is overweight or obese continues to increase. Reducing the incidence of diabetes in the American population will be a difficult undertaking that will require a multifactorial approach. Clearly, diet will be one factor that will require changing if there is to be a significant impact on diabetes incidence. However, it remains unclear what changes in diet will lead to a reduced incidence. Based on population studies, greater consumption of whole grains have been associated with a lower incidence of diabetes. However, the few experimental studies of the effect of whole grains on factors related to diabetes incidence, such as insulin resistance, have used mixtures of whole grains. There is essentially no information on how individual whole grains may influence the risk of developing diabetes. The first study to be undertaken will examine the effect of different whole grains on the development of diabetes in a well-accepted animal model of type 2 diabetes, the GK rat. Whole wheat, barley, corn, and oat flours will be fed to GK rats for 5 months, a time sufficient to monitor the development of diabetes. These whole grains were chosen because they vary in their content of both viscous dietary fiber and antioxidant capacity. Sources of viscous fiber have been shown to improve glucose control in both normal and diabetic humans. Further, diabetes is well known to be accompanied by an increase in oxidative stress. Thus, by choosing whole grains that vary in viscosity and antioxidant capacity, it may be possible to identify which of these characteristics of the whole grain is important in reducing diabetes incidence. Wheat bran, a component of whole wheat, has generally been found to have little or no influence on glucose control or improvement of lipid metabolism. However, it is possible that processing methods may be able to alter the bran structure in ways that it would be more biologically active. Since bran is an inexpensive food ingredient and has a positive association with consumers, we will investigate how novel processing methods of wheat bran influence its ability to improve glucose control and lipid metabolism, using an animal model of metabolic disease, the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat. Individuals with metabolic disease often progress to type 2 diabetes. These rats developed poor glucose control, elevated cholesterol, and obesity. If feeding processed bran improves these parameters, this would suggest that adding this processed bran to foods may aid in slowing the development of metabolic disease, and therefore reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

80,"The presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in foods is a major public health concern and is a serious threat for the delivery of safe foods by the food industry. In recent years, however, an increasing number of food-borne disease outbreaks have seriously questioned the safety of our food supply systems. Many of those outbreaks have been caused by bacteria that contaminated ready-to-eat foods. Despite the fact that the food industry and the government have implemented a series of actions to prevent contamination, new outbreaks are still frequently reported. Salmonella outbreaks have been linked to a wide variety of food products, but in recent years the occurrence of several multi-state cases related to fresh produce and dry foods have heightened the concern for transmission to these types of products and have exposed weaknesses in our food supply. Some of the implicated foods have included chocolate, dried milk, almonds, peanut butter, peanut products, toasted oats cereal and dried spices. These cases demonstrate that these pathogenic bacteria have a very unique ability to remain viable at conditions of very low moisture for long periods of time. An increased number of outbreaks caused by EHEC O157 have also been linked to fresh produce in particular lettuce and spinach. Since some of the outbreaks with fresh produce were linked to pre-washed product, it suggests that serotype O157 may have unique mechanisms of survival associated with the plant tissue. L. monocytogenes has been a concern in ready-to-eat deli meats, but recent outbreaks linked to the consumption of fresh Hispanic style cheeses have revealed the relatively high risk of transmission via these products. These emerging foodborne challenges require the re-evaluation of current practices and the development of novel strategies to have an impact on preventing more human cases. This project presents a comprehensive and broad approach to address some of these food-pathogen risks. The proposed work may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of pathogen survival to identify intervention methods for control. The findings generated by this project will likely contribute to the advancement of a better understanding of the survival and control of pathogenic bacteria in ready-to-eat foods.

81,"New York agriculture depends on small grains production to provide essential food and feed for the state and the surrounding region. Cornell has the only active small grains breeding program, public or private, located in the northeastern U.S. and our research contributes directly to multiple goals of Cornell Cooperative Extension. Small grains production requires minimal inputs, is environmentally friendly, adaptable to organic production and outputs contribute directly to the economic and nutritional well-being of rural communities. Since 1907, this research project has produced more than 70 small grains cultivars. An effective plant breeding research program contributes to enhancing the productivity of small grains varieties and to meeting the changing needs that are specific to northeast agriculture. Improved small grains cultivars are required for farmers, businesses, processors, and food companies to remain competitive. Improved oat and barley cultivars are critical to the NY dairy industry and NY wheat is marketed as a cash crop for processing into grocery products. Small grains production is also important to crop rotation systems, distribution of labor, and soil and water conservation. Variety development is a long-term activity that requires sustained effort over many years. Farmers depend almost entirely on our public, state-wide variety testing programs for unbiased information about varieties of wheat, oats, and barley. Season-long requirements for seed production and evaluation over multiple years and locations are required to assess adaptation and performance. The NY small grains markets are constantly changing. Consumers&#39; increased preference for healthy food products has increased demand for foods that not only taste good but also help to prevent heart disease and cancer. Specialty markets for spelt, triticale, organically grown cereals, and hard wheat have skyrocketed in recent years and new markets are likely. Locally produced farm products can result in substantial savings to the industry and to New York and help maintain local economic vitality. Without this project, there would be no mechanism for developing or testing small grains varieties in this region. New York farmers would have to depend on varieties and recommendations from other regions that do not accurately reflect New York growing conditions. Disease resistant varieties reduce the use of pesticides and cost to the producer. Winter grains prevent erosion of barren soils and redistribute labor requirements. Crop rotations with vegetables and other field crops reduce incidence of disease and insects resulting in higher yields and the use of fewer pesticides. Consumers are the ultimate beneficiaries of the outputs of this project because the results of this project are healthier, cheaper food products that are produced locally. A healthy farm economy depends on locally adapted, competitive varieties of all crops that in turn contribute to the New York state economy. Outputs link to field crops extension activities around the state. Information from this project is presented annually at field days, agent training schools and seed conferences.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
82,"Oats are recognized as a healthy food for humans and a nutritious feed for livestock. Consumption of oat products as a source of soluble fiber has been demonstrated to provide human health benefits that include reducing blood serum cholesterol levels, improving the ratio of good cholesterol relative to bad cholesterol, and favorably moderating glucose metabolism of individuals with type II diabetes. Since these benefits are directly related to the concentration soluble fiber in the oat grain, efforts to develop oat cultivars with increased yield of grain with higher concentration of soluble fiber will permit processing of oat food products with greater health benefits. Stable production of high quality oats depends on protection from diseases that can be most efficiently accomplished through genetic disease resistance. Consequently, much breeding effort will be directed toward development of high yielding, high quality, disease resistant cultivars. Better breeding methods that improve the efficiency of development of these types of cultivars are necessary to maintain consistent cultivar improvement. Utilization of innovative technology for cultivar improvement requires refinement of this technology for adaptation to oat improvement. The application of improved technology will lead to more efficient production of oat cultivars that provide oat producers with a profitable crop, oat millers with an acceptable commodity, and oat product consumers with an even more nutritionally beneficial food.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
83,"NY dairy producers and consultants have been asking us to conduct this research for several years as they gained knowledge in nutrient management and potential N loss pathways through our collaborative work these past 7 years. The cover crop surveys being conducted at the moment indicate the need for on-farm work on N dynamics of cover crops as one of the top questions related to cover crop use. Species comparisons will be conducted at three research farms using rye, triticale, tillage radishes and oats. In addition, two dairy producers will implement trials on their farms. With them, we will develop an implementation scheme and sampling protocol and producers and their advisors will participate in data collection. Producers will be featured in fact sheets and popular press publications. Consultants and CCE educators will be involved in selecting farms and field sites for this effort and participate in data collection and research findings dissemination. If optimum corn yield can be obtained at lower N application rates for corn following a cover crop, this will reduce costs to producers by at least $20 to $30/acre, and presents a corresponding reduction of losses of N to the environment (through capture of end-of-season nitrate and slow release of N from cover crop decomposition in the spring), as well as reduce reliance on fossil fuel needed to produce, distribute and apply N fertilizer. In addition, expansion of the acreage in cover crops will enhance soil conservation and reduce risk of soil erosion. We expect to publish numerous extension articles and talks, establish a webpage within the Cornell Nutrient Management Spear Program website (http://nmsp.cals.cornell.edu) with updates on the project, and develop postcards with final results, etc. with the expectation to reach at least 75% of the corn growers in the state and impact their decision making in future years. We expect to publish 2 journal articles and in-part support the honor thesis of an Agricultural Sciences undergraduate student (who is currently working on the farmer surveys and laboratory incubation study with various cover crop materials).",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This project develops locally adapted wheat and oat varieties, and assists growers in variety decisions, thereby increasing profitability of small grain production along the Gulf Coast.

85,"Objective(s): 1. Develop cost-effective systems and sensors for rapid and nondestructive measurement of moisture content and density of cereal grains, oilseeds and nuts that can be used in static and dynamic situations (on line and in process applications). 2. Develop a portable system for moisture measurements of shelled and unshelled peanuts that can be used in the field and at peanut grading stations. 3. Improve peanut grading processes by developing a rapid system for nondestructive determination of peanut kernel moisture from measurements on pre-cleaned samples and samples consisting of a mixture of pods and foreign materials. 4. Develop methods for monitoring water migration in almonds and other nuts and its effect on their quality by dielectric and spectroscopic methods.Approach:   Developing a cost-effective microwave system for rapid moisture measurement will require analysis of existing dielectric properties data to determine the optimum frequency and measurement parameters. From these results, microwave components will be specified, assembled into a low-cost rapid prototype, compared to a network analyzer, then calibrated and validated for moisture content of wheat, corn, soybeans, almonds, oats, sorghum, and barley. For peanuts, dielectric properties from 2 to 18 GHz on Runner, Spanish, Valencia, and Virginia will first be collected on shelled and unshelled peanuts. As with the other grains above, these data will then be analyzed to determine the optimum dielectric properties parameters and associated algorithms for a density- and variety-independent measure of peanut moisture content, and a prototype low-cost rapid peanut moisture measurement system will be developed. From these measurements and system development for peanut moisture content of shelled and unshelled peanuts, further development of a system to measure the moisture content of peanut kernels without shelling will be developed. Additional dielectric properties of both the unshelled and shelled kernels will be collected as needed, along with the moisture content of both the shells and the kernels. From these data, moisture algorithms will be developed. Additional dielectric properties measurements on unshelled peanuts with and without foreign material will also be collected for development of moisture models that are also independent of foreign material (trash). Models will be developed for both pod and kernel moisture contents. Besides kernel moisture content, meat content and percentage of foreign material are also important grading parameters. Attempts to correlate the dielectric properties data with these parameters will also be made. For almonds, since no dielectric properties data exists, fundamental dielectric properties measurements of almonds of varying varieties, growing locations in California, and moisture contents will be collected with a network analyzer. Correlations between moisture content and dielectric properties data will be developed. To investigate the dynamics of water migration in the almond kernels, known amounts of water will be sprayed on almond kernels of known moisture content, mixed, and then sealed in a Styrofoam box. The sealed box will then be placed between two horn-lens antennas for free-space measurement of the dielectric properties between 2 and 18 GHz at room temperature. Changes in the dielectric properties will be recorded over time as water moves from the almond surface to water in equilibrium inside the kernels. The next stage will be the use of these dielectric spectroscopic methods to monitor water migration inside the almonds under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature. In this instance, the water will permeate the almonds from the atmosphere for varying relative humidities from 20 to 80% in a controlled environmental chamber. Additionally, measurements will be repeated over varying temperatures from 0 to 50 oC in 5 oC increments.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
86,"Objective(s): Our overall objective is to maintain and improve grain quality and international competitiveness through the application of engineering principles. Most of our work concentrates on measuring properties of single kernels so that they can be segregated or the distribution of properties in a sample can be ascertained, versus measuring the average quality of a bulk sample. In general, the project will include the development of instruments to improve rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) measurement of grain quality at receiving stations, the development of non-destructive and rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) single-kernel sorting systems to improve post-harvest grain quality and similar systems to help grain breeders rapidly select specific traits for improved lines, and improve grain-storage and handling systems. Specific objectives are: 1. Develop sensors and methods to rapidly and accurately quantify attributes such as protein composition, starch composition, end-use quality, toxins, and micronutrients. 1.A. Develop or apply spectroscopic technologies that offer significant improvements over current technologies used to measure traits of single kernels and other biological materials. 1.B. Adapt a previously developed conductance mill for detection of live-insect infestations in wheat in other grains such as corn, rice, barley, and oats, and to dry beans, such as pinto and navy beans. 1.C. Develop procedures for rapid estimation of insect fragments in milled flour from minimally processed whole wheat. 2.Develop rapid single-kernel sorting systems to accurately remove defects such as fungal or insect-damaged grain and to isolate beneficial traits such as white wheat. 2.A. Develop high-speed, low-cost, image-based sorting systems for a variety of grains and legumes. 2.B. Develop Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) -based, single-seed sorting systems for large grains and legumes. 2.C. Investigate applications of single-kernel NIRS technology to select kernels with specific traits. 3. Develop instrumentation, sensors, and systems to improve monitoring, and management of grain storage. 3.A. Develop traceability and identity-preservation techniques for grain handling. 3.B. Develop new stored-grain packing factors for the common grains in trade with known confidence intervals for a complete range of field conditions. 3.C. Investigate insect-pest densities and commingling of insects in grain that causes the spread of an infestation from bucket elevator boots. 3.D. Develop monitoring systems for grain-storage quality management. 3.E. Develop improved, environmentally-friendly insect-pest control methods for stored grain. While the objectives of this project include pre-harvest (seeds) and post-harvest handling of grain, the work is interconnected in that the overall goal is to improve the quality of grain produced in the United States. Instruments developed to assess grain quality will be used to study how grain quality might change during storage and handling. An instrument previously developed by this group to detect insect-infested grain will be used to study the spread of insect infestations and the storability of grain based on insect population levels.Approach:   U.S. farmers grow over 15 billion bushels of corn, wheat, soybeans, and other grains annually to supply the nation and world with food, animal feed, and biofuels. A significant amount of this grain may be stored for a year or more before it is used or processed. Our goal is to improve U.S. grain quality and international competitiveness through the application of engineering principles, specifically to the areas of rapid (inspection results from at least 60 individual kernels per minute) quality measurement and in maintaining quality during storage. Much of our research concentrates on measuring the distribution of quality within samples, and on detecting traits that are present at very low levels. We propose to develop instruments to rapidly (up to 500 kernels/s) measure quality traits for inspection at the first point of grain delivery, for breeders in selecting traits for new lines, and for processors prior to grain buying or processing. We also propose to develop chemical-free technology to control insects and maintain quality during handing and storage.

Sub-Objective 2.1. Evaluate processes such as enzymatic treatment (cellulase, esterase, phytase), sonication, ethanol extraction, and high pressure to increase bioavailability of phytochemicals and fiber, and to improve consistency of composition and bioavailability of samples for in vivo studies. Subobjective 2.2. Test samples identified as bioactive in 1.2 as well as those further processed in 2.1 for their bioavailability. Also characterize phytochemical composition of bioavailable fractions by HPLC. Objective 3. Evaluate a variety of viscous and gelling soluble dietary fibers to produce breads and other cereal products that are high in fiber and micronutrients. Sub-Objective 3.1. Breads and other baked products will be developed from non-gluten whole grains and bran such as corn, rice, oat, barley, rye, quinoa, amaranth in order to increase the diversity of whole grain products available to consumers. Viscous soluble dietary fibers are necessary to replace gluten, but also reduce postprandial glycemic response and plasma cholesterol. Sub-Objective 3.2. Preliminary studies indicate difference in hepatic nutrient metabolism between wheat and barley flours was not accounted for by soluble fiber content. We propose to evaluate a variety of cereal grains and seeds for bioactivity by analyzing expression of hepatic genes representative of metabolism of sterols, bile acids, and fat, and indicators of inflammation.Approach:   Food processing technologies will be applied to release the high concentration of polyphenolic components from the matrices of the skin and bran byproducts of juice, wine, oil and flour production. Polyphenolics will be extracted from these processed matrices by systematic application of food grade solvents into broad classes and a fiber fraction. Mice and hamster models of obesity related diseases will be used to determine the potential of the polyphenolic or fiber fractions to reduce or prevent the characteristics of metabolic diseases. Mechanisms will be investigated through gene expression pathway analysis. Of particular interest is the ability of polyphenolics or fiber to reduce the absorption of lipopolysaccharides that trigger adipose inflammatory responses.

88,"Intellectual Merit:  Plant viruses cause diseases that affect a significant number of food crops world-wide with potentially severe consequences on food supplies and economic conditions. Most viruses 'commandeer' the host cell's protein synthesis machinery to make viral proteins.  Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is one of the two most widespread and economically significant plant viruses, affecting wheat, barley and oat crops worldwide. The aims of this project will advance the basic science of plant viruses, while enabling technologies for the improved control of harmful plant viruses and the engineering of modified viruses for production of high-value  proteins using plants. BYDV contains an unusual RNA structure, a translational enhancer (BTE),  in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA that interacts with a 5' UTR stem loop.  This long-range interaction promotes efficient translation of the viral mRNA by a mechanism that is not yet fully understood.  The project will employ the 3' UTR of BYDV as a model system to elucidate mechanisms of long-range RNA interactions involving 3'UTR elements. The overall goal of the project is to identify the molecular interactions that enable viral mRNA to compete efficiently with the much higher concentrations of cellular RNA for access to ribosomes and translation factors. The three critical steps in the assembly of viral protein synthesis initiation complexes will be investigated: 1) The binding of eIFs (eukaryotic initiation factors) to the viral 3'-BTE; 2) the interaction of ribosomes with viral 3'-BTE and 5'-UTR sequences; and 3) the interaction between viral 3'-BTE and 5'-UTR regions. A library of BYDV mRNAs with varying translational efficiency will be used to determine the correlation between eIF binding and translation, the binding affinity of ribosomes for viral RNA sequences, and the role of the interaction between 3' and 5'-UTRs  in each of these steps. The project will employ a range of biochemical and biophysical techniques to achieve these aims, including ribosome 'toeprint' analysis, direct fluorescence assays, and RNA binding assays analyzed by mass spectroscopic analysis.Broader Impacts:  The significance of the research and the range of experimental approaches employed will provide excellent training opportunities for students, ranging from the high school to the graduate school level, in both biochemical assays and quantitative biophysical measurements. Students at each level will receive appropriate training in molecular biology techniques including expression of cloned proteins, translational assays, and other important biochemical techniques.  Fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry used in this project will provide quantitative and biophysical training for more advanced students. Hunter College recruits and enrolls significant numbers of minority students under-represented in the sciences, and  also sponsors a summer research program for them. Students will be recruited from this program to participate in the research.  Thus, the project will contribute to training a diverse workforce in science and technology. High school teachers will carry out research in the lab during the summers, using quantitative fluorescence measurements to determine equilibrium and thermodynamic properties and enhance their content knowledge of applications of thermodynamics to biological systems. The Principal Investigator will work with faculty from the Borough of Manhattan Community College (an Hispanic serving institution) to increase research opportunities for their faculty and students, providing access to state-of-the-art equipment and research guidance when appropriate. By participating in the research project, high school teachers and community college faculty will increase their knowledge of current research techniques and their abilities to convey to their students the excitement of science.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Organic farming systems enhance soil quality and biodiversity, but data on their impact on environmental outcomes are lacking. Here we propose to fill this knowledge gap by evaluating the impact of a novel combination of no-till, multi-functional cover crops, and organic amendments as tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O) and NH3 volatilization, increase carbon sequestration and N and P accumulation, reduce nutrient losses by soil erosion and leaching, increase soil food web structural and functional diversity, increase energy flow in soil ecosystems, decrease weed and insect pressure, and enhance natural biocontrol activity in a corn-soybeans-spelt rotation on long-term organic farms and transitioning experimental plots fully equipped with run-off and leaching facilities. Multi-functional cover crops will include winter pea and crimson clover (N-fixers), oats and cereal rye (weed suppressors) and oilseed radish (reactive N and P recycler, compaction alleviator, and disease minimizer) and organic amendment will be the mined Zeolite (reactive N trapper).

Data collected by the author (Shaik, S 2007a) from historical census of agriculture and the National Agricultural Statistical Services reveals that the number of farms in North Dakota has declined from 74,400 in 1910 to 30,300 in 2006. The corresponding acreage amount of farms in North Dakota increased from 28,427 thousand acres to 39,400 thousand acres leading to an increase in farm size from 382 acres to 1,300 acres. A century ago, North Dakota was overwhelmingly a wheat state; today the leading crops are oil crops. According to North Dakota Agricultural Statistical Service publication, the state ranks first in the production of barley, durum wheat, spring wheat, all dry edible beans, pinto beans, navy beans, sunflower, canola, flaxseed, oats, dry edible peas. It ranks second in all wheat, lentils and honey, third in sugar beets and rye; fourth in potatoes, and tenth in soybeans.

Research is focused on genetic variation in both the host cereals and their rust pathogens that determine the resistance/susceptible phenotype of the interaction. Isolates of rust fungi obtained from annual surveys of the wheat, barley, and oat crops are used to inform the breeding process. Successful control of cereal rusts with host resistance cannot be achieved without knowledge of variation in cereal rust populations. Studies of virulence and molecular variation in cereal rust populations can answer questions that range from the applied, such as which host resistance genes are effective against the current rust population and what resistance genes are in current cereal cultivars, to more basic questions like what are the origins of new races and how do they spread. Discovery of the molecular  Approach: Cereal rust fungi are dynamic leading to constant changes in the U.S. population which leads to the erosion of effective rust resistance in cereal crops. In addition, the introduction of foreign isolates, such as Ug99, further threaten cereal production. Development of cereal cultivars with effective rust resistance and management strategies of these diseases will depend on the monitoring and characterization, virulence phenotypes and molecular genotypes, of cereal rust pathogen populations.

94,"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on providing the proof of concept that a gamma-valerolactone (GVL) based reaction system can deliver yield and cost advantages to convert real biomass feedstocks to useful biorenewable chemicals. Glucan Biorenewables envisions developing a scalable furan-based chemical platform using GVL, a biomass-derived solvent, for both the sugar separation and reaction system.  Bench-scale evidence shows GVL delivers significant improvement in dehydration selectivity and conversion of C5 and C6 sugars to biorenewable chemicals like furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).  The GVL-based reaction system provides important advantages over current biomass dehydration processes. These include increased reactivity of homogeneous acids for hydrolysis and dehydration, improvements in the use of solid catalysts, increased yields through minimizing degradation, and the solubilization and recovery of lignin/humins. These advantages translate to the potential to improve biomass conversion with higher yields and lower energy and capital cost than commercially available processes. The technology has been demonstrated to be effective using pure xylose and glucose however this project will prove the commercial viability by demonstrating efficient conversion and solvent recycling using real feedstocks such as corn cob, corn stover, bagasse, oat hulls.The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a cost competitive process to deliver biorenewable chemicals produced from waste biomass. These intermediate furan derivatives, furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), have multiple uses with enormous opportunities to replace petroleum-based chemicals in applications ranging from packaging to insulation.  The processing and logistical costs that have long hindered large-scale biorenewable chemical production of furfural and HMF are addressed with GlucanBio?s novel solvent system.

95,"Numerous studies support that increased intake of dietary fiber plays a protective role against obesity. It has been demonstrated that corn bran is an ideal dietary fiber ingredient for body weight control. However, the gritty taste and corny flavor limits its uses in food formulations. Bread is frequently enriched with various cereal brans. However, adding a high level of brans to bread is severely detrimental to sensory attributes of the supplemented bread. The overall goal of this project is to develop palatable high-fiber wheat bread enriched with microfluidized corn and oat brans. The microfluidization process will be used to treat corn bran to remove its corny flavor and soften the bran material, and to treat oat bran to liberate &beta;-glucan which is a quality improver for producing bread. The optimal bread formulation and baking process conditions will be determined through experimental design and response surface methodology. The mechanism of formulating this bread, i.e., interactions between corn bran, &beta;-glucan, and gluten in the dough and the resultant bread will also be investigated to provide valuable information for developing high-fiber bakery products. Improved sensory attributes of high-fiber bread should help promote the intake of dietary fiber, and thus help combat the increasing prevalence of obesity in the United States.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
96,"There is a continual need to develop wheat and oat lines that have genes that confer improvements in various important plant characters including host resistance to important diseases and insects, production potential, and utilization qualities. The successful genetic manipulation of any trait in a crop improvement program requires 1) a thorough understanding of the expression of the trait and its genetic control, and 2) efficient selection. Genes that condition highly effective resistance against specific virulence genotypes of certain pathogens including Puccinia ssp and insects such as Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor), have been identified and deployed effectively in cultivars. However, repeatedly these hypersensitive resistance genes have proven to be overcome by new virulence genes, necessitating identification and deployment in new cultivars with new effective resistance genes (Singh et al., 2006; Jin et al., 2009). Effectiveness of genes that condition quantitative resistance, such as resistance to FHB, SNB, and slow rusting (Leonard and Szabo, 2005) has been shown to be more durable, but it has proven difficult and time consuming to breed for quantitative resistance, if one relies solely on phenotype selection (Singh et al., 2006; Crossa et al., 2007). Selection for resistance to certain pathogens or viruses, such as BYDV and CYDV in segregating populations is laborious because the procedure involves management of the aphid vector, and specific virus strains, in addition to carrying out infection of the plants and the test assay, ELISA (Crasta et al., 2000). Similarly, selection at the phenotype level for agronomic performance traits, which are typically inherited quantitatively, is often confounded by environmental effects and involves laborious and replicated testing to minimize selection error so that genotypic differences can be evaluated and genetic gain realized. Thus, identification of DNA markers that co-segregate with the specific genes that condition the traits of interest greatly enhances breeding efficiency for new cultivars that have multiple hypersensitive and quantitative resistance, and agronomic performance combined (Somers et al., 2004). Marker assisted selection is at the genetic level and circumvents confounding effects of the environment on the phenotype. As more markers that are linked to important genes are identified, efficiency of selection for combinations of desired characters will greatly increase. Thus, marker assisted selection is an invaluable and integral part of cultivar development. YDV, crown rust and stem rust are globally the most devastating diseases of oat. A. strigosa accession 6688 has highly effective resistance to these three diseases, and the resistance is present and highly effective in the selected lines derived after three backcrosses to elite A. sativa lines and cultivars.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
97,"Each year more than 5 million acres of small grains are grown in Texas, and approximately 700,000 are grown in the Blacklands and north east Texas. The grain yields of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have increased 10 bushels per acre from the 1960's to the 2000's (Texas Agricultural Statistics Service). These increases are due to a combination of both the development of improved cultivars through breeding and enhanced cultural practices. The cultivars being grown today have a higher yield potential, better utilization of available nutrients, and better disease and insect resistance. However, there still is a large gap between yield potential and realized yield in farmers' fields. Because these cultivars are more efficient users of inputs and require less fungicide and insecticide applications, wheat production has remained profitable even with higher input cost and average prices. It has been estimated that there is a 30 to 60 percent annual return on plant breeding investments. The goal of the Texas A&M AgriLife Research wheat breeding program is to develop hard red winter (HRW) and soft red winter (SRW) wheat cultivars for specific adaptation areas and management programs in Texas. The statewide wheat improvement program is organized into two  centers of excellence  in Amarillo/Vernon and College Station/Commerce. The SRW class will be the primary focus for the program based in Commerce, but some research will be done on HRW and oats (Avena sativa).",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
98,"Field crops are an important foundation for the Montana agricultural industry and revenue totaled $2.4 billion in 2011. The most significant crop in Montana was wheat (5.4 million acres, $1.4 billion) followed by barley (760k acres, $159 million). Our grain goes not only to support the livestock industry in Montana, but also for the export market. Plant diseases occur on every crop, and many threaten plant yield, quality, and sometimes human health. My project seeks to provide practical disease management options for crops grown in Montana. I will focus on the use of fungicides to control foliar pathogens and the role of viruses in our cropping systems. In 2011 the results of my research were used to save farmers in Montana $100 million in crop losses due to stripe rust throughout the state, and $500,000 in crop losses in Pondera County due to wheat viruses. Fungicides are very useful tools for disease control, but recent marketing for plant health benefit applications without disease in cereal crops may cause the development of disease organisms that cannot be killed by these chemicals (fungicide resistance), as has been seen in Europe. In addition, the economic benefit of spraying fungicides in an arid environment such as Montana is questionable when significant moisture is required for most fungal diseases to grow and infect plants. In the last 5 years I have rarely seen a yield benefit to fungicide application. We will likely see an increase in the number of acres to which a fungicide is applied where the economic benefit of that application is questionable. This project will continue on-farm fungicide trials, measuring disease and resulting yields. The information I provide growers and agricultural professionals via my extension activities including fact sheets, AgAlerts, presentations, field days, and media appearances will be used on farms and contribute to the economic viability of Montana cropping systems. I will also focus my efforts on include wheat viruses. Cereal viruses represent a growing and complex threat to the sustainability of the cereal cropping system. The wheat curl mite vectors multiple viruses among grassy weeds and cereal crops. Moreover, although wheat, barley, corn, oats, rye are all susceptible to viruses including Wheat streak mosaic virus, the impact of the more recently identified Wheat mosaic virus and Triticum mosaic virus are unknown. Understanding the spread of cereal viruses is critical as no effective chemical (acaracide) or genetics-based (plant breeding) management options exist. This project will result in a greater understanding of the susceptibility of wheat varieties to WSMV strains from across the Great Plains of the United States. This will assist wheat breeders in variety selection for resistance against WSMV. Farmers at high risk for WSMV may choose varieties with resistance to viruses to reduce disease losses. This is particularly relevant in southern states, where early planting and grazing of winter wheat facilitates the pathogen survival in green plant material.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
99,"Barley, oat, and wheat are small grains crops commonly grown in South Dakota. Wheat is the most important crop and cultivated on large acreages in the state. Many diseases occur on wheat in the region. Tan spot, Stagonospora leaf blotch, spot blotch, bacterial leaf streak, rusts, and Fusarium head blight are the most important diseases that have serious impact on wheat production in the South Dakota. Losses due to these diseases vary from year to year depending on the conditions suitable for disease development, pathogen virulence and cultivar used; however, 5 to 7% yield losses are common in every growing season. Recently, a new race (Ug99) has been identified in Puccinia graminis, causes stem rust of wheat and barley, which has the ability to incite disease in most of the wheat cultivars, resistant to previously identified races, grown worldwide. Host resistance and chemicals applications are considered to be the most effective disease management strategies. However, development of durable resistant cultivars to a particular disease requires a continuous search of new sources of resistance due to potential virulence changes in the pathogen population. Excessive use of fungicides, especially with a single site mode of action could lose their effectiveness quickly due to acquiring resistance due to single point mutation the pathogen population. Additionally, use of frequent fungicides as a disease management strategy provides opportunity to weak pathogens to thrive and becomes major problem and eliminate beneficial microflora. Multiple races have been reported in Pyrenopohra tritici-repentis (Ptr), causes tan spot of wheat based on their ability to incite different symptoms (necrosis and chlorosis) in susceptible wheat. The fungus also produces host-selective toxins (effectors) responsible for either chlorosis or necrosis symptom and considered to be the pathogenicity and/or virulence factor in wheat-tan spot host-pathogen system. Some Ptr isolates have been identified which lacks in producing any toxin (effector) but equally virulent on toxin sensitive and insensitive wheat genotypes. Similarly, some wheat genotypes have shown sensitivity to Ptr ToxA but resistant to its producer race. Multiple host selective effectors have been identified in Stagonospora nodorum, one of the important wheat and barley pathogens causes stagonospora nodorum leaf blotch, and play a significant role in the disease development. Knowledge of genetic variation in the pathogens population, disease epidemiology, pathogen physiology, and sources of resistance in the host plant is very essential in the development of integrated disease management strategies (IDMS). The improved IDMS would make small grains production more profitable that would ultimately improve the lives of their producers in South Dakota and help in eliminating hunger globally.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
100,"Michigan is the third most diverse agricultural production system in the U.S. Field crops are the most important commodity group in the state in terms of total crop acreage (at 6.5 million acres, 97% of the total), number of growers, and farm income, contributing over $4 billion in production value. Eight of the top ten commodities in Michigan are field crops, or dependent on field crops (livestock, egg production). Corn is the leading crop in the state in acreage (2.5 million acres) and cash value, followed by soybean (1.9 million acres). Unlike neighboring corn-belt states driven by corn and beans, Michigan grows a diversity of field crops, ranking first in several types of dry beans and fourth in sugarbeets. Other field crops include alfalfa, pasture, and other forages; small grains such as wheat, barley, oats, and rye. With the global demand for grain for direct consumption and livestock feed, as well as for biofuels, crop prices are at a high and field crop acreage is expanding in the state. Invasive species were and continue to be a major problem in the U.S. Michigan is a potential hot-spot for insect introductions, home to Great Lakes shipping ports, airports in Detroit and Chicago with non-stop flights to Asia, and a diverse crop base vulnerable to colonization by many species. Other invaders, foreign and native, are expanding in their range into Michigan. Thus producers are presented with new challenges from both foreign-invasive and native-invasive species that increase in pest status or range. Established and new insect invaders are now responsible for the majority of insect-caused yield and quality loss in Michigan field crops, influencing pest management decisions, driving insecticide use and reducing profitability. Tied in with invasive species is the issue of climate change. For some field crop insect pests, damage is getting worse and the damage period is growing longer during the season. A reality in field crop production is the use of biotechnology, specifically genetically modified crops with herbicide resistance or Bt insecticide toxin. According to the USDA Economic Research Service, 86% of the corn, and 91% of the soybean, acres in Michigan were transgenic in the 2012 planting season. Because universities have little role in the development of this technology, land grant entomologists are viewed as neutral observers and thus have an important role to play in education and making public statements. A by-product of the introduction of Bt crops is overuse. Growers plant hybrids expressing insecticides that they don't need, exposing insect populations to traits year-after-year. This is antithetical to the principles of integrated pest management, because it increases the chance for resistance. This project concentrates on understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive species, climate change and use of technology. The long term goal is to generate research and recommendations to producers that reduce unnecessary insecticide use, protecting growers profitability, the environment and human health.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The weed seed bank has proven to be an intractable barrier to long-term weed management. In this work we develop knowledge to help us understand how seeds resist decay organisms. Specifically we are determining the biochemical and molecular basis for seed defense responses to decay organisms. Methods: Biochemical defense responses will be determined by measuring induction of defense enzymes in dormant seeds by fungal pathogens; the potential mechanisms of induction will also be determined including measuring mRNA accumulation. These defense responses will be determined first in wild oat, our model weed, using a Fusarium avenaceum isolate that causes wild oat seed decay. Subsequent studies will utilize other fungi as well as seeds of other weed, crop, and native plant species. The potential for these fungi to induce defense responses and cause seed decay in wild oat will be determined in soil.

102,"The temperate grasses include economically important crops such as wheat, oat, rye, and barley. These grasses provide more than 20% of the caloric intake for the human population. The ability of these crops to flower at the appropriate time, is critical not only for the plant&#39;s reproductive success, but also to maximize grain production for human consumption. The plant&#39;s capacity to target flowering-time to the optimal seasonal window requires the coordination of two main environmental seasonal signals: day length (photoperiod), and long exposures to cold temperature (vernalization). Additional local environmental signals, such as drought and salinity stresses, or nutrient availability, also affect flowering-time. A precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the coordination of these seasonal and local environmental signals is required to engineer cereal varieties adapted to a changing environment - in particular global warming. This is exceptionally urgent in crop plants, where fundamental research into flower-time lags behind that of popular plant model systems (i.e. Arabidopsis). A direct translation of the information from model systems to the temperate grasses is not always possible because the vernalization and photoperiod responses in these two plant lineages evolved independently using different types of genes, resulting in very different flowering-time regulatory pathways. Thus, research efforts dedicated to investigating flowering-time in the temperate cereals must be carried out if we are to understand flowering-time in these crop plants. Recent studies in wheat have shown specific components of the flowering-time pathway to associate with a distinct family of proteins known as Nuclear Factor Y proteins (NF-Y). These proteins have been extensively studied in mammals and fungi where they exist as three individual gene subunits (NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC) that form a trimeric protein complex that regulates multiple genes. Interestingly, in plants, there has been an unprecedented expansion of these NF-Y gene families, where ~10 copies for each subunit are present. This increase in NF-Y gene number, together with their interactions with the flowering-time components, has the potential to generate a vast number of molecular combinations, providing a flexible system to integrate the many environmental signals involved in the regulation of flowering-time. However, the functional role of the different NF-Y genes in regulating flowering-time in the temperate cereals has not been studied so far. This is problematic because these genes play a central role in the integration of different environmental signals. This research uses a diploid temperate grass (barley) to elucidate the specific roles of the NF-YB proteins in the integration of photoperiod, vernalization and stress signals in the flowering-time pathway. The knowledge generated form this project is expected to accelerate the development of new barley and wheat varieties better adapted to a changing environment.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Objective 2: Identify and map key genes (quantitative trait loci or QTLs) for important traits, particularly race non-specific crown rust resistance, by developing and phenotyping mapping populations and employing new molecular markers (EST-SSR and DArT). Objective 3: Develop cultivated oat germplasm with introduced biotic and abiotic stress resistance and high-value traits through introgressing crown rust resistance from wild oat species, exploring heat stress and disease resistance from genes introduced by crosses with corn, and evaluating high-value trait sources through coordination of regional spring oat nurseries.Approach:   Monosomic (single chromosome deficient) oat plants needed to complete a full series of 21 lines each deficient for a different oat chromosome will be identified cytologically and with molecular markers among derivatives of oat x corn crosses. Molecular marker linkage groups will be assigned to chromosome using these monosomic lines to develop a comprehensive genomic map for cultivated oat. The QTL identification of race non-specific (partial) crown rust in oat germplasm MN841801-1 will be enhanced with additional field and molecular marker data including the use of new DArT markers, and the effectiveness of marker-assisted selection will be tested for efficiency and effectiveness in transfer of the resistance QTLs into other oat backgrounds. New oat crown rust resistance genes will be introgressed into cultivated oat from wild oat species.

More than 140,000 small grains accessions will be conserved. Each year 5-10 percent of National Small Grains Collection (NSGC) accessions will be regenerated. Seeds and associated information will be distributed on request to scientists. 2) Conduct genetic characterizations and phenotypic evaluations of wheat, barley, oats, rye, and other small grains and related wild species for priority genetic and agronomic traits. Apply the preceding knowledge to genetic resource acquisition and curation of selected taxa. Ploidy levels of wheat landraces and wild species of wheat, barley, and oats will be verified. Characterization data will be completed for key descriptors in wheat, barley, and oats. Kernel hardness will be determined for accessions of common bread wheat. 3) Identify and genetically characterize host-plant resistance to the virulent stem rust race Ug99 from NSGC wheat accessions.  Approach: Established procedures will be followed to maintain all NSGC germplasm accessions, with special attention to seed preparation and planting, plant pathogen monitoring, harvest, and laboratory processing. Seed of NSGC accessions are held in medium-term storage under controlled temperature (5-6 C) and relative humidity (25%). Inventory records, including quantity of seed on hand, viability, and date of last regeneration, are maintained in GRIN. Accessions will be scheduled for regeneration based on a priority matrix. Seed will be provided to the NCGRP for safety back up. Standard procedures for GRIN Order Processing will be followed. Distributions outside of the US will follow phytosanitary requirements of the recipient country, including import permits, phytosanitary certificates, and additional declarations. USDA-APHIS will be consulted regularly for the latest information on seed export. The ploidy analyses will be conducted with the Partec CyFlow Ploidy Analyser® following protocols from the manufacturer and modifications developed locally for more efficient analyses of small grains species. Descriptor data will primarily be collected from the voucher images, but direct field and laboratory observations will also be used. Kernel hardness analyses will be performed with the Perten® Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS 4100), which is the wheat industry standard and is supported by USDA-Federal Grain Inspection Service. To identify new sources of resistance to the Ug99 lineage of Pgt, winter habit wheat landraces from the NSGC will be screened. Because field testing capacity at Njoro, Kenya is limited, the accessions will first be tested for adult plant resistance to US races in field trials St. Paul, MN in cooperation with an ARS scientist at the USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory (CDL). Accessions with resistance to the US races will then be tested as adult plants in the field for resistance to Ug99 and its variants in the USDA nursery in Kenya.   Accessions showing resistance in one Kenya test will be re-tested to confirm results and tested for seedling resistance to race TTKSK at the CDL. To map resistance to the Ug99 lineage of Pgt in spring wheat landraces and ascertain the relationship to known sources of resistance, mapping populations will be developed from crosses previously made with the susceptible spring line LMPG-6. Mapping populations will be generated either through single seed descent to the F6 generation or through doubled haploid (DH) production.

Subobjective 1A: Improve productivity and quality of barley and oat germplasm, with emphasis on malting quality (barley) and food quality (oat). Subobjective 1B: Develop winter malting cultivars with improved quality and winter survival.  Subobjective 1C: Introgress resistance to barley stripe rust (BSR) into improved barley germplasm.   Objective 2:  Develop methods to facilitate accelerated breeding for adaptive traits and utilization of germplasm diversity in barley and oat.   Subobjective 2A: Identify SNP markers linked to resistance genes for BSR and oat crown rust (OCR) for use in marker-assisted selection (MAS). Subobjective 2B: Validation of SNP markers linked to ß-glucan content, malt extract, and diastatic power.  Objective 3: Develop novel biotechnological approaches for the production of genetically engineered barley and oat.    Subobjective 3A: Develop Ds-based and/or recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) gene delivery systems.  Subobjective 3B: Develop transgenic barley lines resistant to Fusarium infection and/or deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation  Approach: The three objectives are separate but complementary.  Objective 1: Germplasm improvement is based on modified pedigree breeding with single seed descent, multi-location in-house and collaborative test locations, off-site winter nurseries, and winter greenhouse facilities to minimize time for varietal development. Multiple breeding targets, corresponding to specific end uses, include: spring malting barley, spring barley, and oat for food and feed. The process is similar for barley and oat, except for the specific set of targeted characteristics. Procedures are based primarily on phenotypic measurements and laboratory analyses of grain quality. Markers are being developed for key traits to enable more efficient allelic selection for trait improvement and will be used as they are developed. Failure to make adequate progress will be corrected by incorporating alternative germplasm, increasing numbers of crosses, and by increasing test environment numbers and/or quality to increase the frequency of obtaining superior progeny.   Objective 2: Based on the hypothesis that SNP markers closely linked to genes for OCR and BSR resistance genes, and for malting quality, will exist. OCR resistance will be assessed and mapped within five oat populations with markers from the oat 6K SNP iSelect Illumina array. BSR resistance will be assessed and mapped within four barley populations, and malting quality in two barley populations, with markers from the barley 9K SNP iSelect Illumina array. Phenotyping will be based on multi-year, multi-location field and/or greenhouse trials. Markers identified will be validated as useful by examination of allelic effects in alternative existing or newly-created populations. Multiple genomic databases will be examined to assist the identification of candidate genes underlying QTLs. Failure to identify useful QTLs or candidate gene may require development and testing of additional populations, novel markers, or analysis of new genomic reces as they become available.   Objective 3: Based on the hypothesis that Ds-mediated transposition will produce plants with single-copy loci in regions suitable for high expression, the  goal is to produce  clean  transgenic plants without with intact, single-copy transgenes free of extraneous DNA derived from bacterial vectors or selectable markers genes. This system utilizes two very short (~600 bp in total length) sequences derived from another food crop, maize, that when flanking other sequences can transpose--along with the intervening sequences--to new location. Transposition is controlled by introducing the relevant enzymatic activity via crosses to Ac transposase--expressing plants. Vectors will be constructed and introduced via Agrobacterium-mediated delivery. Research will concentrate on commercial cultivars, and genes with activity against Fusarium head blight or that suppress mycotoxin production will be introduced. Failure of proper gene expression is guarded against by using. The use of Ds transposition to deliver genes tends to promote good expression, and multiple candidate genes are available, some of which have imparted useful levels of resistance in preliminary work.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
106,"Objective(s): Wheat improvement is a balancing act requiring simultaneous selection for multiple diverse traits, including resistance to a range of diseases, to develop superior new cultivars. One of the diseases that is a subject of investigation here (Fusarium head blight, FHB) continues to cause significant economic losses to the U.S. wheat crop, while the other (stem rust) has the potential to do so. The overall goal of this project is to identify and characterize genes that will improve resistance to these diseases in wheat. The proposed approaches for improving wheat disease resistance will generate novel strategies, tools, and knowledge for protecting wheat against both FHB and stem rust that complement current breeding efforts for both diseases. These research activities will be coupled with the coordination of a service activity that permits wheat breeders to evaluate advanced germplasm for agronomic quality and disease resistance. Combining basic and applied research in this manner will ensure that new wheat cultivars continue to retain high yield and quality while also being protected from current and potential disease threats. To achieve project goals, three objectives will be pursued:  Objective 1: Develop and evaluate hard red spring wheat with improved Fusarium head blight resistance by mapping and introgressing both a new resistance QTL and a novel genome deletion that increases resistance. Objective 2: Evaluate genotypic background effects on Fusarium head blight resistance expression by examining the genetic control of resistance suppression. Objective 3: Characterize and isolate genes for stem rust resistance from the model plant Brachypodium distachyon for introduction into wheat. Objective 4. Characterize non-host resistance to oat rust diseases in the model grass Brachypodium distachyon.  Approach: Wheat is the most widely grown crop in the world and is a major staple food for humans. Wheat is economically very important to the United States, which ranks third among all countries in wheat production and is the world’s largest wheat exporter. Both abiotic and biotic stresses can cause significant fluctuations in U.S. wheat production. Reducing current wheat losses associated with the fungal disease Fusarium head blight, and taking steps to protect the crop against the threat posed by stem rust, will increase both the stability and profitability of U.S. wheat production. This research project seeks to contribute to the goal of controlling these diseases by completing genetic, molecular genetic, and genomics research that will further our understanding of genes and molecular processes that are involved in resistance to these diseases. The results of this research will provide both new resources and new knowledge that can be used to increase resistance to Fusarium head blight and stem rust in wheat. This in turn will lead to improved wheat yields and yield stability for producers and will ensure that the U.S. wheat crop is protected against current and future disease threats.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Develop markers and populations for the fine-mapping and initiation of the map-based cloning of the Ug99 stem rust resistance gene Sr47. 2E. Develop molecular markers suitable for MAS of pre-harvest sprouting resistance QTL  Approach: Durum and hard red spring wheat (HRSW) varieties with improved end-use quality and resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses are needed to meet the nutritional demands of the world’s growing population. This challenge must be met through the discovery and deployment of genes for disease resistance and traits that effect quality such as kernel texture, protein content, flour yield, dough strength, and baking performance. In this project, we will identify new sources of resistance to diseases and pests, and improved quality. Molecular mapping populations will be generated and used to identify genes and quantitative trait loci governing resistance to Stagonospora nodorum blotch, stem rust, and pre-harvest sprouting. This work will yield knowledge of the genetic mechanisms controlling these traits, the development of markers for marker-assisted selection, and genetic stocks and germplasm useful forgene deployment. Additional work on the molecular characterization of the genes and genetic pathways associated with wheat-necrotrophic pathogen interactions will be conducted as part of this project and will yield basic knowledge useful for devising novel strategies for developing crops with resistance to necrotrophic pathogens.

Plant defense activators (PDA), agrichemicals that elicit a generalized defense response against pathogenic organisms, will be assessed to determine their efficacy in enhancing avenanthramide levels in the oat grain.  Preliminary experiments have shown that benzothiadiazole (BTH) effectively up-regulates avenanthramide production in greenhouse experiments.  These experiments will be expanded to include other PDAs and to evaluate their efficacy in field grown oats.  The volatile organic compounds elicited by PDA treatment will be captured and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine if any known volatile signaling molecules are elicited.  Additionally, oat plants will be subjected to light intensity stress and leaf avenanthramide levels analyzed to determine if this abiotic factor affects avenanthramide production.  Oat genomic DNA will be sequenced to determine the type of promoter regions present upstream of the coding region of the enzymes involved in avenanthramide production.  Objective 2.

112,"Weeds cause substantial detrimental effects including yield loss, reduced aesthetics, health problems, poor animal habitat, and harvest difficulties. Even with effective herbicide application, weeds persist in the crop environment because of several factors. Management of weeds for optimal control and maximum sustainable profit potential is imperative to the success of small grain cereal growers. Some specific examples include pervasive as well as new weed issues. Crop production with minimal use of tillage has encouraged the spread and entrenchment of downy brome in much of southwest North Dakota. Wild oat is a robust, aggressively competitive weed with several biotypes that make management difficult. And kochia, through biology and genetic changes, is adapting to production practices and becoming a more troublesome problem. This project will compare several weed control options in replicated and repeated trials to establish the most effective and most reliable methods to control these and other weeds that have been or are quickly becoming major pest problems in North Dakota crop production.

Although oat has this important health benefit, the understanding of how oat fiber develops is lacking. Genomic resources for oats have significantly lagged behind that for other grains. The fact that oat has a very large and complex polyploid genome compared to other crop plants has contributed to the challenges in identifying the gene networks that control fiber development and other economically important processes and pathways in oats. The goal of this project is to generate a draft genome sequence of cultivated oats by sequencing related wild oat genomes that are smaller in size to that of cultivated oats to assist in sequence assembly and annotation.      This project will utilize high throughput sequencing strategies, optical mapping and diploid genetic resources to facilitate the assembly and annotation of a functional hexaploid oat (Avena sativa) genome sequence. The specific objectives include: 1) finishing the sequencing of the A. ventricosa diploid CC-genome as well as creating an A. eriantha diploid CC-genome assembly; 2) generating physical optical maps for six hexaploid Avena genomes, two CC-diploid genomes, two AA-diploid genomes and a putative diploid DD-genome by using cutting edge BioNano optical mapping technology; 3) increasing GBS marker density across parental lines of a selected linkage mapping population to provide additional anchor points for assembled contigs that will be combined with short-read (HiSeq) and long-read (PacBio) sequencing to assemble and anchor the hexaploid oat genome (AADDCC); and, 4) annotating the sequenced genomes by generating RNA-seq data for each species in conjunction with ab initio prediction methods.

Birchler (University of Missouri-Columbia) and Jiming Jiang (University of Wisconsin-Madison)   All plant genomes contain centromeres, structural regions that ensure chromosomes segregate properly during cell division. Centromeres are a challenge to study because they contain repetitive DNA sequences and few genes. The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of how the sequences in centromeres relate to their function, and how changes in centromere size or changes in a key centromere binding protein (CENH3) can alter the behavior of centromeres.  In particular the project will study genetic crosses and mutants that can induce centromere failure and chromosome loss in hybrids. Chromosome loss induced by centromere modification can result in haploid plants, which are of great value to corn breeders, as they can rapidly accelerate the production of new inbred lines. It is anticipated that the information and technology generated will have direct applications to agriculture - not only in maize but all other crops that utilize haploids as a breeding tool. With regards to training and outreach, the project will provide research training for undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows in plant genomics and biotechnology.  In addition, a series of training workshops will be held to disseminate techniques and materials generated in this project. All project outcomes will be made available to the research community through a dedicated project web site and through dissemination by long-term repositories that include NCBI, MaizeGDB and Gramene.   The overall goals of the project are to understand the genetic and epigenetic components of maize centromeres and to reveal the role of centromere size in uniparental chromosome elimination which leads to haploid formation. The specific objectives are to: 1) determine whether common centromere repeat sequences are sufficient to induce centromere function using novel chromosome painting probes, chromosome visualization tools that dramatically improve the ability to detect changes in chromosome structure; 2) determine how a suite of chromatin markers are affected by changes in centromere size and location using maize chromosomes transferred into oat as well as B chromosomes that have undergone a cycle of inactivation and reactivation; 3) test whether centromere size disparity can cause uniparental genome elimination by screening lines with centromeres whose size have been modified by manipulating genome size, and by using cenh3 mutants with specialized transgenes; and 4) determine how maize centromeres behave in situations of uniparental genome elimination, particularly in wheat X maize and oat X maize crosses that are regularly used in haploid breeding schemes.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
117,"Trichothecenes areubiquitoustoxic secondary metabolites produced by pathogenic fungi in host plants such as wheat, barley, oats, and maize. Due to their natural occurrence in food and high toxicity, trichothecene contamination of food and livestock feed (&gt;78% toxin present) poses a great threat to food safety and human, animal, and planthealth.However, there is a critical gap in our knowledge about the way the toxin works in living cells leading to toxicity that endangersanimals and humans. Previous studies identified novel mechanisms for trichothecene-induced cell death involving themitochondria, an important component of thecell that functions to help produce energy. These studies have shown that the toxin-induced cell death involved mitochondria and genes involved in lipid metabolisms which mediated sensitivity to these toxins. Therefore, the proposed project will study the role oflipid signaling as a mitochondrial &#39;surveillance&#39; mechanism induced in response to trichothecene-mediated stress.Applying high-throughput methods in molecular biology and biochemistry, this research will identify lipids altered in response to toxin treatment and determine if lipid signaling is important for trichothecene-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation. It will also measure therecognition and degradation of trichothecene-damaged mitochondria by mitophagy, a selective degradation of damaged mitochondria. The research will identify critical components of the mitochondrial-nuclear signaling pathways using yeast (highly conserved between yeasts and animal cells) and then investigate them in more detail in animal cells. This research will leadto new insights into how these toxins modulate themitochondria and mitochondrial signaling and advance our understanding of mechanisms whereby environmental toxins derail the fate of mitochondria in the affected animals. The knowledge gained here will aid efforts to mitigate the impacts of trichothecene contamination in food and food safety; facilitating the development of safer practice and standards in human and animal consumption of contaminated products.Ultimately, the project will aid in promoting safer food, developing potential applications for animal health improvement, and reducing economic losses due to trichothecene contamination.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
118,"This project involves the study of a disease called Victoria blight which was originally identified on the host plant, oats. The disease is caused by the fungus, Cochliobolus victoriae which can only infect oats if it makes a peptide called  victorin  and interacts with oats carrying a gene called  Vb . Various analyses suggest that the Vb gene, which confers Victoria blight susceptibility and sensitivity to victorin, is identical to a gene called Pc2 which confers resistance to a different disease called  crown rust of oats  caused by the fungus Puccinia coronata. Consistent with this interpretation, molecular analyses reveal that victorin activates a resistance protein (NB-LRR) which leads to cell death and that C. victoriae exploits this defense response to cause disease. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that victorin sensitivity is conditioned by genes encoding resistance proteins across diverse crop species including barley, rice and bean. We hypothesize that these resistance proteins (NB-LRRs) are functionally, and perhaps structurally, related to the protein encoded by the Vb/Pc2 gene in oats.

120,"Oats are considered to be one of the healthiest cereal food and the consumer demand for oats and oat-based products have steadily increased over the years. This trend may be desirable in promoting public health. However, recent surveys conducted in the United States have found high levels and incidences of ochratoxin A (OTA), a possible human carcinogen, in oat-based cereal products particularly in infant cereals. Several toxigenic fungi in the genus Aspergillus and Penicillium are known to contaminate agricultural crops and produce OTA. This potent mycotoxin has been regulated in other countries but no regulation or guideline for OTA in foods has been set in the United States. Most of the infant cereals are processed by using either indirect- or direct-steam heating, or extrusion cooking processes. Although processing could help reduce OTA, knowledge about the chemical transformation and residual toxicity of OTA in infant cereals as affected by commonly-used processing technologies has not been established. We propose to investigate the fate of OTA during the processing of oats using chemical analysis and toxicological evaluation of OTA and the degradation products formed. The proposed research will provide important data on the threat of OTA contamination in oat-based infant cereals and effective control strategies.

Although Verticillium wilts are primarily managed through rotations with asymptomatic hosts, the efficacy of these rotations has been extremely inconsistent depending on the field and/or growing region. The research proposed here intends to be proof-of-concept that one mechanism by which an asymptomatic rotational crop such as oat can impact disease severity in a subsequent potato crop is through a change or shift in the pathogen population composition. This genotypic shift results from the endophytic interaction between the asymptomatic host and the pathogen. To address this hypothesis we will use a combination of field, microbiological and genetic analyses. Replicated field microplots will be infested with specific mixtures of V. dahliae genotypes and subjected to an oat-potato rotation. We will then monitor shifts in genotypic diversity due to the endophytic interaction of the fungus with the asymptomatic rotational crop oat.

In Oklahoma approximately 6 million acres of wheat are planted annually, and winter wheat is the most important agronomic crop produced. A common list of insect pests sporadically limits wheat yield and profitability. Losses to insect pests are difficult to predict annually due to the sporadic nature of these organisms, and adaptation of these species to management tactics ensure a constant source of emerging threats. Cereal aphids and Hessian fly remain important pests and comprehensive IPM programs continue to be refined. The greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) and Bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.; BCOA) are often the most important factors limiting profitable winter wheat production in Oklahoma, and much of the Southern Plains. Yearly losses caused by aphids in the Southern Plains have exceeded $100 million. The Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor Say) has re-emerged as a major threat to wheat producers in the Southern Plains. The sporadic nature of these insect pests justifies continued monitoring for new and virulent biotypes. Wheat producers in the region have moved towards rotational systems with winter canola which has expanded to over 250,000 acres in Oklahoma and is expanding annually. However, since the introduction of winter canola into Oklahoma, producers have battled devastating insect pest infestations (aphids, diamondback moth, cutworms, false chinch bugs). Insect pests remain the critical limiting factor for winter canola production in the Southern Plains and effective/sustainable management programs require continued monitoring programs and refinement of management tools. In Oklahoma and much of the South Central US, the effects of natural enemies on insect pests of wheat and canola have not been fully quantified. Critical information including spatial and temporal ecology of natural enemies, their nutritional requirements, the important tritrophic relationships among pests, plants, and natural enemies, and how these factors relate to pest population suppression are needed for a truly integrated management approach in wheat and canola systems. Field and laboratory studies are planned to refine pest management detection and sampling tools for wheat and canola, describe pest impact on crop productivity, investigate the role that natural enemies play in pest suppression, and evaluate how insecticides can be incorporated into holistic IPM programs for wheat and canola. Results from the proposed research are required to develop holistic, ecologically based, management programs for insect pests of wheat and canola.

We also will tackle more practical challenges in the use of the clays and layered double hydroxide in removing or inactivating the mycotoxins in vitro (fermentation) and in vivo. The specific objectives are to: 1) Modify smectites to ensure the nanominerals&#39; binding efficacy for aflatoxins in real corn fermentation solutions; 2) Modify smectites to improve the nanominerals&#39; catalytic functions in degrading adsorbed aflatoxins in corn fermentation solutions; 3) Engineer smectites to detoxify aflatoxins in vivo at realistic toxin levels in broiler chickens; and 4) explore and modify clays and layered double hydroxides for binding fumonisin, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone. Once implemented in practices, the adverse effects of the mycotoxins to animals and humans; and the economical losses of corn growers, biofuel industry, and animal industry can be minimized.Arsenic, zinc, lead, copper, nickel and many other heavy metals are the major concerns of acid mine drainage (AMD) resulting from the oxidation of sulfide minerals exposed to air. In theory, acid mine drainage and heavy metal contamination should not be problems in limestone areas due to the abundance of carbonate minerals that can neutralize the acidity. Poorly crystalline nanoparticles such as various iron oxides, silica, and the oxides of heavy metals are the most reactive compounds in regulating the heavy metals. Unfortunately, our knowledge on these reactive particles in the limestone environment or the liming reclamation areas is very limited due to the difficulties of characterization of these materials with common methods and instruments. The general objectives of our study are to: 1) characterize on an atomic scale low-crystallinity nanoparticles and colloids generated in AMD and examine their transformations in a limestone environment, 2) characterize As (the major focus), Zn, Cu, and Pb speciation in each associated solid phase and quantify the mobilization and transformation of As and the heavy metals associated with the mineral phase conversions, and 3) model the reactivity of the nanoparticles and the geochemistry of As and heavy metals in the limestone environment. This proposed study will characterize both representative field samples and simulation samples, combine several advanced spectroscopic and microscopic methods and geochemical modeling to address the speciation, composition, atomic scale structures and the influence of the heavy metals and metalloid on the nanoparticles. The results will offer more insight to the geochemistry of the nanoparticles AMD and offer more structural and thermodynamic parameters for modeling.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
128,"The 2014 Farm Bill (Agricultural Act of 2014) was passed into law in February of 2014. Farm bills define and authorize agricultural programs for the subsequent five or six years. The policy changes in the new farm bill are the most far reaching since the 1996 bill when policy changes were largely driven by efforts to comply with World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations that stipulate member nations must reduce their use of production-promoting and trade-distorting agricultural policies.As a result of a recent trade dispute brought before the World Trade Organization&#39;s dispute settlement panel, cotton was singled out for the first time in the 81 year history of field crop subsidy programs in the 2014 bill. Cotton is excluded from two new crop programs but is eligible to received payments under a new insurance program exclusive to cotton. While these unprecedented changes to the treatment of cotton in the new farm bill make significant progress towards reforming cotton subsidy programs, the question remains whether the new policies are less trade-distorting than the predecessor policies. In addition, it has yet to be determined whether or not the policies awarded to cotton are more or less distorting than policies awarded to other feed grains (referred to as  program crops  which include corn, wheat, oats, barley, soybeans, and rice). This research seeks to address these questions using USDA data and simulation analyses.Furthermore, cotton is now excluded from receiving payments from programs upon which payments are calculated based on historic production determined by crop specific acreage and yields during a specific previous time period. These historic acres are referred to as  base acres . While cotton producers are no longer entitled to payments calculated using base acres, cotton producers with historic base acres associated with cotton production now have the ability to reassign these cotton base acres, referred to as  generic base , each year to another planted program crop. For that year, those generic base acres are considered base acres for the program crop to which they were assigned for the purposes of calculating program payments. Thus, producers with generic base acres have an incentive to make planting decision based on expected support payments for the various supported commodities and market price expectations. This is likely to lead to production distortions. This research seeks to estimate the potential production distortions associated with producers reallocating their base acres using USDA data and simulation analyses.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
129,"Objective(s): Six objectives will be used to improve the efficiency of trout production by the development of alternative feeds and fish better able to use those feeds. Some ingredients are developed in-house and we have both laboratory and pilot scale production capabilities. Digestibility of nutrients from specific ingredients has traditionally been conducted with large fish. The effect of strain and size will be determined. A tank system is available to collect feces both by sedimentation and stripping. The effect of strain and size on protein and amino acid retention will be conducted to determine the need for strain or life stage specific diets. Most trout culture use water from one raceway to another up to 5 times. A 36 tank system located on a commercial farm that receives water from 1st, 3rd, or 5th use will be used to determine the effect of water quality as a stressor on specific mineral and fat soluble vitamins in the tissues. A strain of trout selected  to utilize plant-based diets is available and the effect of the gut microflora communities will be characterized. Fish oil has been the source of the heart/brain healthy fatty acids, EPA/DHA. This source is limited by supply and cost. Variability among trout in a specific strain for their ability to biosynthesize EPA/DHA has been identified. Trout with this trait will be bred to enhance the nutritional quality of the fillet for the benefit of the consumer.  Objective 1: Develop and evaluate new ingredients and ingredient processing methods to increase nutritional and economic value. 1.A: Develop an improved soybean processing method to simultaneously separate protein and oil and remove anti-nutrients. 1.B: Development of alternative methods for the concentration of protein from wheat, barley, and oats.  1.C: Determine the nutritional and economic value of new and modified ingredients.   Objective 2: Determine whether stage specific and strain specific diets are needed by evaluating nutrient digestibility at  Approach: Objective 1: 1.A: An improved aqueous processing method that results in high oil and protein recovery and removal of anti-nutrients will reduce the diarrheic effect of soybeans for trout. Experiments to optimize pretreatment and extraction conditions will be conducted.  1.B: Improved processing methods will increase the nutritional and economic value of protein concentrates from wheat, barley and oats. Trials will be conducted with wheat to optimize starting material and processing conditions to concentrate to 70% protein, and remove the binding effect. This effect of wheat gluten limits inclusion level in extruded feeds. Protein concentrates of barley and oats will be produced using another aqueous fractionation method that features alkaline extraction, centrifugation, and acid precipitation of supernatant.  1.C: A seven phase program will evaluate the nutritional value of alternative ingredients. Complete nutrient and anti-nutrient analysis, fry screening trials, effect on feed intake and extrusion, nutrient digestibility, growth trials, and effect on fecal size will be conducted.   Objective 2: 2.A: Nutrient digestibility is affected by either fish size or strain or both. The ADC’s for major nutrients and amino acids will be determined with four unique strains of trout at three sizes (15, 500, 1500 g, 12 trials).  2.B: Nutrient retention efficiency is affected by fish size or strain or both. The same strains and fish size will be used as in 2.A in 12 week growth studies to evaluate protein and amino acid retention. Four diets varying in protein (40/45%) and lipid (20/25%) will be fed.  Objective 3: 3.A: Improved diets containing elevated levels of stress-affected minerals and fat soluble vitamins will improve performance of rainbow trout raised in serial-reuse water. The effect of water source (1st, 3rd, & 5th use) as a stressor in three strains of rainbow trout on tissue concentrations of fat soluble vitamins and minerals will be determined. 3.B: Specific combinations of ingredients and prebiotics affect intestinal inflammation and the consistency of rainbow trout feces. To improve waste management dietary factors that affect fecal particle size will be determined.   Objective 4: 4.A: Intestinal microflora community structure in rainbow trout is affected by diet and host genotype. Microbial communities will be identified in two strains of trout, one susceptible to soy enteritis and the other resistant.  4.B: Transplantation of microbiota from selected trout fed plant-based feed into non-selected trout will reduce intestinal enteritis when fed plant-based feeds. A cross-over experimental design will be used to determine if different microbial communities can protect a trout from soy induced intestinal enteritis.   Objective 5: The ability to biosynthesize EPA and DHA in muscle tissue of rainbow trout fed diets containing plant oils can be selectively enhanced. To evaluate the potential to increase the ability of trout to biosynthesize EPA and DHA in their muscle, variation among individuals and families of rainbow trout will be determined. Individuals with known performance values for this trait will then be selectively bred.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

Objective 3: Identify and evaluate processing and intrinsic end-use quality traits of experimental lines of hard spring wheat, durum, and oat as part of a Congressionally-designed direct mission of service. - This Objective is EXEMPT from review because, by Legislative (Congressional) mandate, it is a direct mission of service guided and overseen by the Wheat Quality Council.  Sub-Objectives: 3.A. Identify and evaluate processing and intrinsic end-use quality traits of experimental hard spring and durum wheat lines. 3.B. Evaluate quality traits of experimental oat lines.  Approach: The Hard Red Spring and Durum Wheat Quality Laboratory will evaluate processing and end-use quality traits of breeders’ experimental lines of wheat relative to physical and biochemical attributes and genetic and environmental influences.  This research is important to identify wheat lines that are of superior milling, baking, and processing quality before they are considered for commercial release.  Ultimately, the value of this research lies in its potential to enhance international trade of U.S. wheat and reduce competition for overseas markets.  Quality evaluation also will be performed for oat lines to increase market value of U.S. oats.   Recently, demand for whole-wheat-based foods has been increasing due to well-known beneficial health effects.  However, poor end-use quality of whole wheat flour is acknowledged as a problem in the baking industry. Research will be conducted to develop laboratory methods to evaluate whole wheat milling and bread-making quality, and will contribute to the rapid assessment of whole wheat bread-making quality. Research will be conducted to evaluate variation in proteins, arabinoxylans, phenolics, and antioxidant potential in hard spring wheat lines and to develop methods to rapidly predict these components.  The role of these components in dough and bread-making properties will also be investigated.  This research is important since these components are present in whole grains, mainly in the bran.  The benefits of this research will be in the production of wheat germplasm that contains high levels of healthy components, as well as improved end-use quality for the production of whole wheat-based products.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
131,"Storage of carbon in soil is of high interest to ecosystem scientists because it enhances soil fertility and potentially decreases the production of gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Plant roots provide the major input of soil carbon, transferring carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere into the soil system. Microorganisms in the soil are the primary consumers and decomposers of this carbon, and can transform it back into carbon dioxide, or into methane. It follows that the part of the soil where microorganisms come in contact with plant roots is a hotspot for carbon transformation. This graduate student research research project will follow the fate of root-derived carbon in soil, examining the role of soil microbial communities and associated soil minerals in carbon stabilization. The project will involve collaboration with scientists at national laboratories and promote participation of students from under-represented groups in the research. While carbon (C) association with soil minerals is thought to be a critical step in soil C stabilization, the underlying mechanisms - particularly in the persistence of mineral-carbon associations - are poorly understood. The student will grow the common annual grass, Avena barbata, (wild oat) under a 13CO2 atmosphere in soil microcosms, thus enabling her to follow the fate of the root-derived C. Using a technique called stable isotope probing (SIP), she will trace the 13C derived from the plant into soil microbes and on to soil minerals. In this project, the researchers will investigate how the longer term fate of C, present on minerals or in soil microorganisms is effected by the presence or absence of A. barbata. The research will examine (1) the fate of mineral-associated C, (2) the influence of mineralogy, (3) the influence of the rhizosphere, the zone of plant root influence, and (4) the role of the microbial community. By constraining both the mechanisms of mineral-C association and persistence, the researchers can begin to understand and quantify the importance of these associations in C cycling and environmental change models.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We will investigate most aspects of nutrient cycling throughout the dairy-farm system with a variety of methods and at different scales, including replicated field plots, field-scale paired watersheds, feeding trials with replicated pens of heifers, and computer modeling. We will also examine pathogen transport and viability at different points in the dairy farm system. Some experiments will investigate only one or two nutrient or pathogen pathways, while others will be more comprehensive, including, for example, surface runoff, gaseous emission, and plant removal. Computer modeling will investigate the whole-farm system. Our research team also has a longer-term goal, which is to integrate information across experiments to more completely describe, quantify, model, and manage the entire dairy-farm for improved efficiency and sustainability.

134,"Summary:Meat and meat products are highly nutritious and constitute the central part of the American diet. Consumption of fat and red meat has been of public health concern since the late 1950s, when the American Heart Association first recommended that dietary cholesterol, saturated fat, and total fat be reduced for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Goat meat is classified as the other red meat. It is lower in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol than traditional meats, and there are few, if any, religious or cultural taboos limiting the consumption of goat meat. Consumers are demanding healthy meat and meat products and have now recognized that there is a good match between goat meat and their preferences for lower risk and more healthy meat options. To increase the productivity and profitability of Louisiana small-scale farmers, and provide healthier meat options to Louisiana residents, Southern University investigators utilized non-traditional agriculturally based value-added products such as goat, rabbit, and oat products in the formulation of traditional meat products like patties, hams, nuggets, frankfurters and sausages. Formulated products were found to be nutritionally sound (low-fat, low cholesterol, and high protein), texturally-enhanced (increased juiciness and tenderness), and rated highly by consumer panels. Consumers have also indicated their willingness to try this meat. The major research focus of this project is to measure and evaluate the marketability of the value-added goat products to combat and prevent obesity in Louisiana. A patent will be sought for the formulated goat products that have been developed. Oat bran and oatrim will be utilized in formulations and the development of goat sausages, hams, and nuggets, and assessed for microbial and oxidative stability. The research team will leverage the power of visual social media platforms Pinterest and Instagram (along with Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Twitter) to disseminate information concerning the health benefits of value-added goat products to the broader, diverse, and targeted constituents of interest for this project. Investigators will also use the results from previous research on the acceptability of the value-added goat products to conduct this marketability research focused on profitability and customer satisfaction by conducting customer analytics. The investigators envision a beneficial outcome for all involved, where customers will improve their health and goat producers will become economically viable.",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
135,"We can contribute to stable, environmentally responsible small grains production in North Carolina through the development of wheat, oat and triticale varieties and germplasms with superior agronomic traits, disease and insect resistance, and end-use quality. The average acreage planted to winter wheat and oats in North Carolina is approximately 830,000 acres with a production value of around $245m. Wheat is the most important small grain in the state. Triticale occupies a negligible acreaget present but its potential as a hog and poultry feed warrants research in cultivar development. Three public institutions and two private companies have wheat cultivar development efforts in the southeastern United States, in addition to NCSU. Many southeastern seed retailers are licensing public developed wheat and oat cultivars on an exclusive basis. To better meet these needs, small grains programs at state universities in NC, SC, GA, FL, and LA formed a cooperative effort (SUNGRAINS) to coordinate cultivar development research and share in royalties. The average life of a wheat variety in North Carolina is five seasons. The demise of a typical cultivar results from changes in virulence patterns of the powdery mildew and /or leaf rust fungi. There is a continuous need to provide wheat breeders with new sources of resistance to these pathogens.Two additional pathogens, Fusarium head blight and Stagonospora blotch have threatened, or caused serious economic impact, to wheat production during the past five years. We can provide new and potentially more stable resistances to these fungi by 1) mapping resistance to the pathogens and pyramiding QTL for resistance using molecular marker approaches, and 2) initiate Genomic Selection strategies to improve resistance to these pathogens and generally improve agronomic performance and end-use quality. A major constraint in winter oat production is winterkilling due to extreme temperatures. We can improve winterhardiness in oat by building on recent work whereby we determined the genetics and associate molecular markers with QTL&#39;s for freezing tolerance.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
136,"In 2015, South Dakota was ranked 6th harvested soybean acres (5,120,000),6th for harvested wheat acres (2,236,000), and 2nd for harvested sunflower acres (662,000) (NASS 2016). During 2015 South Dakota was ranked 7th in the U.S. for soybeanproduction (235,520,000 bushels), 6th for wheat production (103,406,000 bushels), and 1st forsunflower production (1,230,040,000 lbs). When the annual production of these crops is compared between 2013 and 2015 there was a 12% increase for soybean, a 9.7% increase for wheat, and a 21% increase for sunflower (NASS 2016). As the harvested acres and observed yields of soybean, wheat, and sunflower continue to increase, there is also an increased need for improved management recommendations for the insect pests of these crops. One strategy that has been employed is the use of insecticide seed treatments, and as a result their use in South Dakota has been steadily increasing (USGS 2016). Soybean, wheat, and sunflower productivity is often negatively affected by early season soil dwelling and also foliar feeding insect pests. Due to a limited selection of products available for management of these insect pests, and the systemic nature and ease of use associated with insecticide seed treatments, they are often used for insectmanagement. The insecticide active ingredients used for seed treatments for soybean, wheat, andsunflower are exclusively neonicotinoids.Insecticide seed treatments are used on approximately 31% of soybean acres across the U.S., however, it is believed that in areas of the Midwest they are used on as much as 73% of the planted soybean acres (Douglas and Tooker 2015). Although these insecticide products are applied to seed that is planted on millions of acres of cropland there are limited use recommendations available, and as a result they are often used prophylactically (Douglas and Tooker 2015). Concerns regarding the value of insecticide seed treatments for soybean in the Midwest have been a topic of discussion since 2014 when a report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was released. The Biological and Economic Analysis Division (BEAD) of the EPA determined that the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments in soybean most likely provided farmers with a $0/acre benefit, and at most $6/acre benefit (EPA 2014). However, an analysis of the same data by AgInformatics, LLC determined that the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments provide a net yield benefit of 2.8%(approximately $10.60/acre) when compared to untreated soybean (Mitchell 2014). In their report, the EPA BEAD also stated that according to surveys of soybean farmers the insect pests that were being managed through the use of insecticide seed treatments included soybean aphids and bean leaf beetles (EPA 2014). Although they are major commodities, there is limited data available regarding the use of insecticide seed treatments for wheat and sunflower production.Identifying early season above-ground insect pests is relatively easy, and relies on observing the insect or signs of defoliation. However, identification of belowground insect pests can be difficult and as a result they are often overlooked and ignored. The early season insect pests associated with soybean include wireworm, seedcorn maggots, white grubs, and bean leaf beetles (Bailey et al. 2015). Early season pests of both spring and winter wheat include bird cherry oat aphid, English grain aphid, greenbug, Hessian fly, and wireworms (Dyer at al. 2012, Hunger et al. 2012). An additional concern, aside from yield losses due to direct feeding is that the three aphid species that feed on wheat are also competent vectors of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). Exploration of the impact of insecticide seed treatments on the incidence of BYDV in wheat is necessary. For sunflower, early season insect pests include wireworms, seedcorn maggots, striped flea beetle, and sunflower beetle (Knodel and Charlet 2007). While this list does account for bean leaf beetles as an early season pest, it does not account for soybean aphids due to their late season arrival in soybean. The contradiction between the EPA&#39;s survey data and the known early season insect pests of soybean are likely due to a lack of extension and outreach from state universities. Also, if this discrepancy exists for one crop such as soybean, it likely exists for other crops including wheat and sunflower. Although insecticide seed treatments are labeled for wheat and sunflower there is limited data available regarding their efficacy and benefit to farmers in the U.S., and especially in South Dakota.Therefore, it is critical that the use of insecticide seed treatments is explored in soybean, wheat and sunflower in South Dakota to determine their benefit for farmers. In addition, for each crop itwill also be imperative to explore factors (e.g., planting date, seeding density, soil type, weatherconditions) to determine when insecticide seed treatments provide the greatest economic benefit to farmers. Through these efforts, management recommendations for insecticideuse on soybean, wheat, and sunflower will be developed.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
137,"BP reported global crude oil proven reserves in 2014 of 1,700 billion barrels which represented an increase of 24% over the2004 figure (http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/). This was however,0.92 billion barrels lower compared to the previous year. The industrialization and population growth in underdevelopedcountries where large quantities of fossil fuel reserves are located will lead to increased future demand and price of crude oil.The expected future increase in demand and consequent rise in prices of the finite fossil fuel reserves (in spite of replenishmentby successful exploration or reserves growth) will result in volatility in the fossil fuels market and political instability in thedeveloping countries and energy insecurity in developed countries if world-wide demand outstrips supply. In addition, increasingthe use of fossil fuels will exacerbate catastrophic climate change that results from the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) intothe atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. Biofuels and specialty chemicals from renewable agricultural feedstocks providean alternative green chemistry CO2 neutral production to traditional fossil fuels routes and will also significantly reduce theNation&#39;s future dependence on foreign oil. The proposed research builds on the search for renewable agro-based feedstocksthat do not compete with food which can be economically exploited for production of biofuels and specialty chemicals. Tubers ofyellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) a persistent weed in many vegetable, potatoes, corn and oats fields have beenselected for exploitation of their triglyceride content.

139,"Dynamics of plant pathogen populations are less understood than those of animals, partly due to a lack of funding and declining rates of graduates in agriculture-related fields. However, at a time when crop yields are threatened by a changing global climate and geographic shifts in plant pathogen populations more investment is needed inagricultural sciences. Oat crown rust caused by Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca) is one of the most destructive pathogens affecting grain production. The high level of variability in Pca makes this species ideal to study the relationship between the ability of plant pathogens to cause disease (a.k.a virulence) and their population diversity. This is particularly relevant for oat since domestic oat production cannot keep pace with US demand. This project will employ modern population genomics methods in a large collection of crown rust from across the US in 1990 and 2015.

In light of this, many farmers have interest to incorporate cover cropping into their cropping system for the various agronomic and potential economic benefits, but one of the primary challenges of cover crop integration is timely establishment. Using soybean and cereal rye/oat as a model, we propose a novel cropping system that could optimize the agronomic and economic benefits of a corn/soybean rotation with cover cropping. To optimize our proposed cropping system, we will test the yield potential of four soybean maturity groups and four varieties within each maturity group. As each maturity group reaches harvest maturity, a mixture of cereal rye and oat will be planted. Our hypothesis is that soybean yield trade-offs from shorter-season maturity groups could be offset by the increased cover crop/forage production providing an agronomic and benefit to the entire cropping system. Research objectives include: Objective 1: Identify differences in soybean yield potential across maturity group cultivars for different environments in the North-Central Midwest and Northern Midsouth; Objective 2: Characterize impacts of an integrated soybean/cover crop system on weed management, forage production, soybean seedling pathogens, soybean cyst nematode, and arthropod interactions; Objective 3: Determine the role of beneficial/antagonistic microbial communities impact on soil health, yield, and disease through metagenomics analysis; Objective 4: Substantiate economic efficiency of integrating cover crops into different soybean maturity groups. Research will be conducted over two years at seven unique sites across Nebraska (4 sites), Ohio (2 sites), and Kentucky (1 site). Our proposed research directly addresses two of the USDA AFRI Foundational Knowledge of Agricultural Production System program priorities. First, by incorporating multiple management components such as soybean maturity group selection and cover cropping we intend to enhance plant (cropping system) resilience to resistant weeds, nematodes, soil-borne pathogens, and arthropods. Further, we will investigate how this influences productivity through economic analysis and cropping system modeling. Second, proposed research will investigate how changes to production system management or optimizing soybean maturity groups with cover cropping will influence soil microbial communities impacting soil health through metagenomics analysis.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
141,"Major agricultural production systems lack crop diversity and organic amendments. Sustainability of low diversity systems is threatened by lower yields, increased weed and disease pressure, poorer soil health and detrimental environmental impacts. Cropping systems utilizing extended rotations and organic amendments can reduce threats from pests and crop diseases. However, an understanding of the key factors and mechanisms that drive these benefits is critically lacking. The long-term goal of this project is to generate a comprehensive, systems-level understanding of how specific agricultural practices can yield environmentally and economically sustainable agricultural benefits. Our research will be based on a long-term, field experiment where acorn-soybean system with increased crop diversity andorganic amendments has been shown to increase crop productivity, improve soil health, and suppress an importantdisease, soybeansudden death syndrome. We will utilize a novel combination of molecular analyses, in-field measurements, and bioassays, to assess how oats and manure amendments influence the soil and plant microbial communities, pathogen density, and disease suppression. We will compare soil and root microbial communities and soil physical-chemical properties among the different cropping systems and analyze their contribution to the beneficial effects of the different cropping systems. In addition, we will conduct smaller scale experiments to isolate the effects of oat crops and composted manure amendments on the changes observed. We will also conduct an economic analysis to compare the profitability of the diversified systems with the conventional system used in combination with a seed treatment. Upon completion of our project we will have: i) identified the shifts in microbial communities associated with disease suppression and overall crop health; ii) advanced understanding of the key crop management components that contribute to enhanced crop productivity and increased crop resilience to disease, and iii) furthered understanding of the economic sustainability of this cropping system approach.

Research is focused on genetic variation in both the host cereals and their rust pathogens that determine the resistance/susceptible phenotype of the interaction. Isolates of rust fungi obtained from annual surveys of the wheat, barley, and oat crops are used to inform the breeding process. Successful control of cereal rusts with host resistance cannot be achieved without knowledge of variation in cereal rust populations. Studies of virulence and molecular variation in cereal rust populations can answer questions that range from the applied, such as which host resistance genes are effective against the current rust population and what resistance genes are in current cereal cultivars, to more basic questions like what are the origins of new races and how do they spread. Discovery of the molecular determinants of pathogenesis and obligate biotrophy in cereal rust fungi via genomic approaches offers intriguing leads in the development of novel resistance mechanisms.

146," Objective(s): Wheat improvement is a balancing act requiring simultaneous selection for multiple diverse traits, including resistance to a range of diseases, to develop superior new cultivars. One of the diseases that is a subject of investigation here (Fusarium head blight, FHB) continues to cause significant economic losses to the U.S. wheat crop, while the other (stem rust) has the potential to do so.

The proposed approaches for improving wheat disease resistance will generate novel strategies, tools, and knowledge for protecting wheat against both FHB and stem rust that complement current breeding efforts for both diseases. These research activities will be coupled with the coordination of a service activity that permits wheat breeders to evaluate advanced germplasm for agronomic quality and disease resistance.

The European Union Scientific Panel onContaminants in the Food Chain concluded that a consistent relationship between the alkaloidconcentration in the sclerotia and total ergot alkaloid concentration could not be established(EFSA 2005). No country has limits for individual ergot alkaloids in food or feed. Several recentfactors have increased ergot invasion in crops, including no-till farming practices leaving thevegetation and ergot sclerotia on the soil surface for increased infection rates, the move toorganic farming and avoiding fungicides, and the dramatic weather patterns with huge rainfallsthat enhance increased Claviceps purpurea invasion of cereals and grasses in thespring/summer.No US veterinary diagnostic laboratory is providing a validated ergot alkaloid analysis of cerealgrains and grasses by LC/MS/MS for the main Claviceps ergot alkaloids, the ergopeptines (-ines, biologically active) include ergotamine, ergosine, ergocristine, ergocryptine, andergocornine, and their diastereomers the ergopeptinines (-inines, biologically inactive). Innature, ergopeptinines always accompany ergopeptines, and during storage of raw materialsover time or improper storage, more ergopeptinines may form. The conversion of -ines to -ininescan be rapid under certain laboratory conditions and -inines can be reactivated to -ines undercertain conditions. Therefore, both epimers have to be determined for ergot alkaloidcontamination of foods and feeds (Krska and Crews).This proposal is to develop and validate a sensitive LC/MS/MS method for ergpopeptines,ergotamine, ergosine, ergocristine, ergocryptine and ergocornine, and their -inines in cerealgrains of wheat, barley, rye and grasses. The inclusion of a grass matrix for ergot alkaloidanalysis by LC/MS/MS is not commonly addressed in any method but is extremely important forveterinary livestock exposures. The analytical range of detection chosen for the assay, 20 to8000 ug/kg, represents veterinary toxicological important data for interpretation of animal feedand food contamination.RELEVANCEThe LC/MS/MS analytical method for ergopeptines and ergopeptinines in small cereals andgrasses will provide chemical analysis of potentially contaminated feed to be used for foodanimals or sold into the food chain. The current US Official Grain Standards of determiningpercentage contamination by ergot sclerotia in cereal grains is often inaccurate and ignores thegreat variation of alkaloid content in individual sclerotia. The increased use of no-till farmingand leaving vegetation and sclerotia on the soil surface for the successive crops, consumerdesire to utilize organic foods without chemicals, and dramatic weather events will tend toincrease the incidence of Claviceps purpurea in cereal crops and grasses and exposure to ergotalkaloids.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
158,"Like all species, grasses such as maize, rice, wheat, oats and barley contain genes encoding information that determines the amino acid sequence of all the proteins that plant synthesizes to germinate, grow and reproduce. All genes in an organism use a simple, four-letter alphabet (A, C, G, T) to make three-letter words (codons) to specify each amino acid of a protein. There is redundancy in this genetic code with multiple, similar codons often coding for the same amino acid. In the DNA, the overall G+C content of genes within any given species is often very similar. However, in grass species there are high-GC and low-GC genes, and there is evidence that high-GC and low-GC genes may be transcribed from DNA into RNA and translated from RNA into protein differently. This project will test whether proteins from high-GC and low-GC genes are transcribed and translated with equal efficiency and, specifically, whether that differential regulation is used when responding to heat, cold and drought stress. This work will also discover rules about codon usage and protein synthesis that can be used to design transgenes for efficient protein production. Finally, current gene prediction software does not account for the high-GC and low-GC genes found in grasses. This project will create a new gene prediction program that will more accurately predict genes in grasses. Better gene prediction will benefit the larger community of plant researchers, including those who work with economically important grasses such as maize, rice, wheat, oats and barley.Grass genes have a bimodal GC distribution and a significant 5' to 3' GC gradient. Little is known about the consequence of such variation on gene and protein expression. High gene GC content and strong negative 5' to 3' gradients in grasses strongly affect codon usage bias. It is possible that both GC biased gene conversion and codon usage bias are important in shaping the unusual GC features that are found in grass genes. GC biased gene conversion may help to move gene mutation towards a particular codon usage program, and then selection on that codon bias may maintain a gene's GC content and gradient. GC biased gene conversion in rice will be examined. Transcriptional and translational characteristics of native and transgenes that differ only in their GC content will also be studied in rice. Translational efficiency may also be affected by regulation of tRNAs in a tissue or condition-specific manner. Therefore, regulation of tRNAs will be examined to determine if changes in tRNA abundances affect protein translational efficiency. Recent published data indicate that due to the variation of GC content in grass genes, a notable number of genes in grasses have been missed or mis-annotated by existing gene finders. A new gene prediction tool that accounts for grass bimodal GC distribution will be designed to improve gene annotation in grasses. The results from this project will provide novel insights into gene evolution in grasses as well as important guidance for crop improvement via genetic modification.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
159,"The initiation of flowering is a key transition in the plant life cycle. In many plant species, particularly those adapted to temperate climates, flowering occurs at a particular time of year in response to the sensing of seasonal cues such as changes in day-length and temperature. The objective of the research is to further the understanding of the genes and biochemical pathways that control the timing of flowering in response to seasonal cues in grasses, a group of plants that includes many important crops such as wheat, oats, rice, and corn. Much of the research will utilize the model grass Brachypodium distachyon because working in this species facilitates identifying the genes underlying flowering in response to seasonal cues. The data generated will help to lay the groundwork for tailoring the flowering of crop species, and will advance the basic understanding of how organisms have evolved systems to perceive environmental cues and translate those cues into developmental programs such as the initiation of flowering. This project will result in the training of graduate students and postdocs, and provide undergraduates with an opportunity to learn about research in genetics, molecular biology, and plant development while exploring their interests in a STEM career. The project will also involve development of a classroom module to provide K-12 students with an opportunity to explore how plants grow and develop and respond to seasonal signals such as the cold of winter.A major goal is to advance the understanding of how perception of winter cold as well as the short days of winter are translated into stable, epigenetic changes in gene expression that enable grasses that are adapted to temperate climates to become competent to flower in the spring when conditions are most favorable for reproduction. The process is known as vernalization. The project will involve studying certain recently discovered key genes involved in both cold-mediated and short-day-mediated flowering in grasses. These genes had not previously been known to play a role in flowering. One group of genes encodes proteins that may be part of a novel, plant-specific gene regulatory complex; another represents a new role for a member of the florigen gene family. A combination of genetics and biochemistry will be employed to explore the role of the proteins encoded by these genes with the goal of better understanding the molecular basis of how flowering is regulated in response to seasonal cues in grasses. The flowering pathways under study evolved independently in different groups of plants; thus, this research is also a model for studying how convergent evolutionary pathways can lead to a solution to the common problem of ensuring that flowering only occurs after winter has ended.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

166," Objective(s): Crop improvement is a balancing act requiring simultaneous selection for multiple diverse traits, including resistance to a range of diseases, to develop superior new cultivars. One of the diseases that is a subject of investigation here (Fusarium head blight) continues to cause significant economic losses to the U.S. wheat crop, while another (stem rust) has the potential to do so. Similarly, crown rust continues to be a significant disease of oat. The overall goal of this project is to use genetic engineering technologies to develop novel molecular variants of specific genes and validate that they, as well as a previously identified spontaneous mutation, improve resistance to these particular diseases in wheat and oat. The approaches for improving disease resistance will generate novel resources and knowledge for protecting wheat against both FHB and stem rust, and oat against crown rust, in a manner that complements current breeding efforts for both diseases. These research activities will be coupled with the coordination of a service activity that provides a conduit for Midwestern hard red spring wheat breeders to evaluate jointly their advanced germplasm for agronomic quality and disease resistance at multiple locations.

Some ingredients are developed in-house and we have both laboratory and pilot scale production capabilities. Digestibility of nutrients from specific ingredients has traditionally been conducted with large fish. The effect of strain and size will be determined. A tank system is available to collect feces both by sedimentation and stripping. The effect of strain and size on protein and amino acid retention will be conducted to determine the need for strain or life stage specific diets.

174,"Crop improvement is a balancing act requiring simultaneous selection for multiple diverse traits, including resistance to a range of diseases, to develop superior new cultivars. One of the diseases that is a subject of investigation here (Fusarium head blight) continues to cause significant economic losses to the U.S. wheat crop, while another (stem rust) has the potential to do so. Similarly, crown rust continues to be a significant disease of oat. The overall goal of this project is to use genetic engineering technologies to develop novel molecular variants of specific genes and validate that they, as well as a previously identified spontaneous mutation, improve resistance to these particular diseases in wheat and oat. The approaches for improving disease resistance will generate novel resources and knowledge for protecting wheat against both FHB and stem rust, and oat against crown rust, in a manner that complements current breeding efforts for both diseases. These research activities will be coupled with the coordination of a service activity that provides a conduit for Midwestern hard red spring wheat breeders to evaluate jointly their advanced germplasm for agronomic quality and disease resistance at multiple locations. Combining basic and applied research in this manner will ensure that new wheat and oat cultivars retain high yield and quality while also being protected from current and potential disease threats.
