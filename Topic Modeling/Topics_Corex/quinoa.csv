0,"Almost all crops and other flowering plants produce red or purple pigments some time during their life. The vast majority of plants from corn and rice to apples and broccoli produce anthocyanin pigments derived from the amino acid phenylalanine. The chemistry and molecular biology of the anthocyanins has been extensively studied and is well known. However, a single related group of flowering plants do not produce anthocyanins, but instead produce red pigments based on the amino acid tyrosine. These pigments are called betacyanins or betalains after the beet genus, Beta. Besides beets, this betalain producing group includes, spinach, swiss chard, Amaranthus, Quinoa, portulaca, and cactus. Almost nothing is known about the genes and enzymes for the steps in this pathway, or how the pathway is genetically regulated. In addition, it is not understood how or why this pathway may have evolved in the middle of the flowering plants. This project is aimed at discovering the genes that encode steps in the betalain pathway and understanding the pathway regulation. New libraries of expressed genes will be constructed from betalain plants and genes will be randomly sequenced. Potential betalain genes will be identified by similarity to genes encoding proteins with predicted functions. These potential genes will be tested for their abilities to complement betalain mutants when expressed in these plants. The overarching goals are to understand how betalains are made from tyrosine, how the pathway is genetically regulated, how the pathway evolved and possibly how the pathway can be engineered into other species.

1,"This U.S. - South America proposal will support one junior and three senior researchers from the U.S., under the direction of Dr. Peter Maughan, to participate in a set of planning visits to Bolivia, Chile, Peru, and Ecuador. The objective of these planning visits is to identify priorities for the utilization and development of genomic tools for the major New World orphaned crops species [e.g., quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus and A. cadatus), tarwi (Lupinus mutabilis), yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus), cañahua (Chenopodium pallidacule), oca (Oxalis tuberosa), and mashwa (Tropaeolum tuberosum)].  Genetic resources, such as DNA sequence-based genetic markers, genetic linkage maps, and gene libraries are essential tools for understanding and improving the genetic basis of agriculturally important traits in crop plants.  The use of DNA markers and gene manipulation (including genetic modification and transgenics) are now commonly used in combination with traditional breeding methods to accelerate and enhance varietal development of the major food staples.  Unfortunately, many regionally important crop species (commonly referred to as orphan crops) lag far behind the major commodity crops (maize, soybean, wheat, rice, etc.) in terms of the development of these advanced genetic tools due to their status as minor crops in the U.S and Europe.  In addition to their regional importance as food and feed crops, these species are also of interest to the broader community of plant scientists due to their remarkable adaptation to severe environments and exceptional nutritional qualities.  The work will be done in collaboration with Jorge Rojas-Beltran of the Fundación PROINPA, Cochabamba, Bolivia; Ivan Maureira Butler of the National Agriculture Research Institute, Carillanca, Chile; Luz Gomez Pando of the National Agricultural University La Molina, Lima, Peru; and Eduardo Peralta of the Instituto Nacional Autónomo de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, Quito, Ecuador.     U.S. scientists will benefit from the interaction with these Latin American colleagues who will provide important lessons in applied research and agricultural practices and needs in developing countries.  From these planning visits, a framework will be developed for future research proposals and a genomics workshop proposal.

2,"Intellectual merit:   Beets and roses are red for completely different reasons. Virtually all flowering plants contain one of two mutually exclusive red/purple pigment pathways, anthocyanins or betalains. The anthocyanin biosynthetic / regulatory network has been heavily studied and occurs in the vast majority of taxa including the major crop families: Poaceae (grasses), Brassicaceae (canola, mustards, cole crops), and Rosaceae (apples, pears, cherries). Betalains on the other hand are restricted to certain families of a single order, the Caryophyllales, where they assume the role of anthocyanin pigments in all biological contexts. These roles include attracting pollinators and seed dispersal agents, and as protective pigments during stress and aging. The betalain families contain crop species and ornamentals that are grown worldwide and form important staples in many agricultural economic systems, including Beets, Spinach, Amaranthus, Quinoa, and Prickly Pear cactus. This project is aimed at understanding the betalain biosynthetic and regulatory network at the molecular level and how pigment emergent properties are generated.     While anthocyanins are based on the amino acid phenylalanine, while betalains derive from the animo acid tyrosine. Prior to the start of this project, the investigators identified a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme and a MYB-type transcription factor regulator that function in the betalain network. In particular, hypotheses will be tested regarding the identity of the last unknown betalain ring structure biosynthetic enzyme by silencing genes in beet to test their functions and beet gene expression in yeast to test function. One hypothesis is that betalains are regulated by the same set of interacting proteins that regulate the anthocyanin pigment pathway in other plants. The investigators will test this hypothesis using gene silencing and overexpression in beet. Anthocyanin pigments are regulated by well-characterized environmental signals. The hypothesis that betalains are regulated by these same signaling pathways will be tested. In order to ask the question about whether environmental signals work through increasing gene expression of the MYB regulator, plants will be treated with known elicitors and plant hormones, or nutrient deprivation (e.g. phosphate), and expression of all know betalain network genes will be measured. The hypothesis that the MYB regulator directly binds to cis regions of the betalain biosynthetic genes will be tested through protein-DNA binding assays.Broader impacts:   This research will enhance our basic understanding of the control of plant secondary metabolic networks. Betalains are important dietary antioxidants with high human availability and this project will lead to an ability to manipulate this network and to move the pathway into heterologous systems. Eventual impacts include the ability to create crops that are more nutritious for humans and livestock. The project will provide excellent training for all levels of students. Integral to this project is a new inquiry-based Freshman Research Initiative stream for 30+ students that emphasizes creative and critical thinking within science. Students receive lecture-based training in hypothesis building and testing, data collection, record-keeping, statistical analysis, and ethical research standards. In the spring, students enter the stream for two semesters of hands-on self-directed research.  For the past ten years, all lab members, including undergrad and grad students, have participated in judging yearly science fairs at local elementary schools, including interactive interviews of the elementary students. For the past six years, the PI and his graduate students have conducted prefair outreach workshops at the schools. This past year, 3 graduate students, about 180 4th and 5th graders, and 6 teachers participated in the workshop on hypothesis driven scientific method, project conception, and project execution. This outreach activity will continue throughout the period of this project.

3,"Objective(s): Objective 1. Fractionate fiber, water-soluble, alcohol-soluble and lipid-soluble fractions from the increasingly large amounts of fruit and vegetable byproducts including pomace of olives, grapes, and pomegranates and the bran of cereal grains in order to identify, condense, and test bioactive compounds in animal models of obesity related diseases. Sub-Objective 1.1. Separate different fruit tissues (skin, pulp, juice) and cereal brans (germ, aleurone, fat) using physical processes, and fractionate followed by extraction with food approved solvent methods. Sub-Objective 1.2. Assess bioactivity of extracts and residues of 1.1 by feeding mice or hamsters hypercholesterolemic diets and determining physiologic characteristics of obesity related metabolic syndrome. Objective 2. Develop processing methods that disrupt food matrices or cell barriers in order to increase accessibility to cellular contents and increase the bioavailability of phytonutrients from fractions of fruit and vegetable based byproducts including pomace of olives, grapes, and pomegranates, as well as grain byproducts from Obj. 1.1 that contain complex mixtures of phenolic compounds that may help to prevent obesity related diseases and add value. Sub-Objective 2.1. Evaluate processes such as enzymatic treatment (cellulase, esterase, phytase), sonication, ethanol extraction, and high pressure to increase bioavailability of phytochemicals and fiber, and to improve consistency of composition and bioavailability of samples for in vivo studies. Subobjective 2.2. Test samples identified as bioactive in 1.2 as well as those further processed in 2.1 for their bioavailability. Also characterize phytochemical composition of bioavailable fractions by HPLC. Objective 3. Evaluate a variety of viscous and gelling soluble dietary fibers to produce breads and other cereal products that are high in fiber and micronutrients. Sub-Objective 3.1. Breads and other baked products will be developed from non-gluten whole grains and bran such as corn, rice, oat, barley, rye, quinoa, amaranth in order to increase the diversity of whole grain products available to consumers. Viscous soluble dietary fibers are necessary to replace gluten, but also reduce postprandial glycemic response and plasma cholesterol. Sub-Objective 3.2. Preliminary studies indicate difference in hepatic nutrient metabolism between wheat and barley flours was not accounted for by soluble fiber content. We propose to evaluate a variety of cereal grains and seeds for bioactivity by analyzing expression of hepatic genes representative of metabolism of sterols, bile acids, and fat, and indicators of inflammation.Approach:   Food processing technologies will be applied to release the high concentration of polyphenolic components from the matrices of the skin and bran byproducts of juice, wine, oil and flour production. Polyphenolics will be extracted from these processed matrices by systematic application of food grade solvents into broad classes and a fiber fraction. Mice and hamster models of obesity related diseases will be used to determine the potential of the polyphenolic or fiber fractions to reduce or prevent the characteristics of metabolic diseases. Mechanisms will be investigated through gene expression pathway analysis. Of particular interest is the ability of polyphenolics or fiber to reduce the absorption of lipopolysaccharides that trigger adipose inflammatory responses. Viscous soluble fibers will be used to develop breads from nontraditional whole grains and seeds to determine if they have potential to reduce metabolic syndrome in animal models. 6-Phytase; absorption; Accounting; Adipose tissue; Alcohols; Animal Model; Avena sativa; base; Bile Acids; Bioavailable; Biological Availability; Bread; Cells; cellulase; Cellulases; Cereals; Characteristics; Cholesterol; Complex Mixtures; Dental Pulp; Diet; Dietary Fiber; esterase; Ethanol; Fatty acid glycerol esters; feeding; Fiber; Flour; Food; Food Processing; Fruit; fruits and vegetables; Gel; Gene Expression; Genes; Germ; Gluten; Grapes; Hamsters; Hepatic; High Pressure Liquid Chromatography; improved; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory Response; interest; Juice; Lipids; Lipopolysaccharides; Metabolic Diseases; Metabolic syndrome; Metabolism; Methods; Micronutrients; Modeling; Mus; nutrient metabolism; Oats; Obesity; Obesity associated disease; Oils; Olives - dietary; Pathway Analysis; physical process; Physiological; Phytochemical; Plasma; pressure; prevent; Process; Production; Quinoa; response; Rice; Rye cereal; Sampling; Seeds; Skin; Skin Tissue; soluble fiber; Solvents; Sonication; Sterols; Technology; Testing; Water; Weight Gain; Wheat; WinePROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES TO PREVENT WEIGHT GAIN AND OBESITY RELATED METABOLIC DISEASES",1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06
4,"Quinoa is a broadly adapted grain crop in huge demand in the US because it is highly nutritious, with excellent protein quality and quantity. The current organic quinoa supply from the quinoa producing Andean countries is insufficient to meet the existing and growing demand in the US, driving distributors, wholesalers, and retailers to seek out domestic, reliable sources of quinoa. Domestic supply is essentially nonexistent for several reasons, primarily due to the lack of information regarding regionally adapted varieties, best management practices for organic farms, or marketing options for quinoa. This project will provide the information urgently needed by farmers wanting to capitalize on the rapidly expanding quinoa market. Organic growers and quinoa distributors have been instrumental in the development of all stages of this proposal. Our goals are to 1) identify and quantify domestic demand and future marketing opportunities for domestically grown organic quinoa; 2) evaluate and select quinoa varieties and breeding lines in organic systems for critical traits of interest; 3) develop best management practices for organic quinoa production; 4) evaluate the end-use quality traits and nutritional value of quinoa varieties and breeding lines; and 5) disseminate information about, and develop farmer/distributor relationships for, organic quinoa production and marketing. A Stakeholder Advisory Committee has been formed, consisting of representative growers, wholesalers, retailers, and end-users. The results of the project will contribute to OREIs legislatively-defined goals 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 by generating research information and educating different clientele on quinoa production and marketing.

5,"During the  Neolithic Revolution  - the domestication of plants and animals - a fundamental change occurred in the relationship  between humans and the environment in which they lived. A central goal of this research is to gain insight into the forces which underlie this process.Under athe direction of Dr. Gayle Fritz, Natalie Mueller will conduct doctoral dissertation research. From c. 1000 BCE - 1400 CE, a suite of native seed crops known as the Eastern Agricultural Complex (EAC) was cultivated in Eastern North America (ENA).  Previous studies have demonstrated that several of these crops were domesticated based on morphological changes such as seed shape, size, seed or fruit coat thickness, and texture. Two members of the EAC, sunflower (Helianthus annuus var. macrocarpus) and acorn squash (Cucurbita pepo ssp. pepo var. ovifera), are still familiar foods, but the other members of the crop complex have not been cultivated for several hundred years.  These lost crops include two domesticated plants: Chenopodium berlandieri  ssp. jonesianum, which is a native relative of quinoa; and a species of marshelder (Iva annua var. macrocarpa). For one important ancient crop, knotweed (Polygonum sp.), complex and variable seed morphology has so far stymied efforts to establish criteria for domestication. This case study will develop new morphometric methods to examine changes in the morphology of knotweed and determine whether or not it was domesticated.   Morphological changes in domesticated plants are the result of human selection and ecosystem engineering.  Past agricultural practices can be inferred from the modifications they caused in plants and animals. This study will use multivariate and spatial techniques to uncover correlations between morphological changes in knotweed and environmental, archaeological, and temporal factors. These correlations will be used to reconstruct forgotten agricultural practices.  Recovering the details of agricultural economies in ENA is particularly interesting because early farmers in this region, while developing a highly productive agricultural system, did not follow the archetypal Neolithic Revolution trajectory towards institutionalized social stratification and urbanism.  This project uses a case study of one important crop to gain new insights into the development of this unique agricultural economy, while enhancing understanding of a plant that was once an important crop in ENA.  In an era when new seed crops are rapidly being developed, this study is a first step to assessing its potential usefulness to modern society.This research will also provide several concrete benefits to professional archaeologists and students.  This project will generate a web database of integrated archaeological and botanical data from publications and collections that are currently scattered in inaccessible reports. The methods developed in the course of this project will also be used as teaching tools.  Opportunities to participate in this research will be built into a new multidisciplinary course: Historical Ecology of North America. The new methods developed for using digital photography and morphometrics to study domestication will enrich Washington University's Paleoethnobotany Laboratory, where students and faculty are involved in studying the origins of agriculture around the world.  This methodology will also be integrated into a course on microscopy for archaeologists.  The proposed research is part of a larger movement to historicize pre-Columbian America.  The dissemination of this research will be directed towards the goal of increasing public and academic awareness of ENA as a region with a long and rich pre-colonial history that is relevant to an understanding of global processes.

6,"There are four primary objectives in the project which address the use of fiber as a nutritional enhancement for meat products, an analytical development method for determining alginate in meat products, the effect of fermentation on the gelation of alginate binders in restructured meat products, and the optimum ratio of quinoa to chickpea flour n pasta. All of the trials relate to measurement of chemical, physical and biological characteristics of meat or food products in the context of developing newer items to satisfy growing needs to provide safe, high quality, and nutritious foods in an economical manner. For example, meat products with added fiber do not appear in the current marketplace yet recommendations for American consumers to increase fiber consumption abound. The use of alginate as a binder for restructured meats has been well documented by the principal investigator, yet application to some raw materials derived from fresh carp or beef in combination with fermentation has never been reported. The analytical methods developed by the investigator 20 years ago are targeted for further study and updating so that quality assurance and regulatory compliance with restrictions on the alginate can be improved. Recent efforts to reduced fat in bakery products has led to an interest in developing a modified pasta product with high quality protein as an eventual companion to the restructured products belonging at the center of a consumer diet.

7,"Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) has been increasingly popular in the United States, Europe, China, and Japan because of its high quality and gluten-free property. The aim of this project is to evaluate quinoa to improve our knowledge on this multi-purpose crop, learn whether the crop can be grown for its full growth potential in Wyoming, and finally to develop best production and management strategies. In recent years in Wyoming, especially in Southeast Wyoming, there is an increasing interest to learn and grow this important crop. Recently, two producers in Wheatland and Guernsey areas have started to grow this crop on a very small scale, but this year, they want to grow on a large scale. There is a great risk associated with their desire because of production cost (e.g., high seed price) and lack of knowledge of adaptation, production, and management. Current investigations suggest that very limited information is available on growth, yield, cultivars, cultivation, and management practices on quinoa in Wyoming. This proposed project will investigate quinoa crops in environments of Wyoming. Quinoa will be planted in replicated trial plots at the James C. Hageman Sustainable Agriculture Research and Extension Center near Lingle under irrigated conditions. The treatments will include: two available and promising cultivars of quinoa, three planting times (mid-April, early May, and early June), and three fertility managements [control (no fertilization), half of the recommended dose, and recommended dose (based on soil test results)]. The study will also be planted at two producers&#39; fields at Guernsey and Wheatland with one cultivar, one planting time (based on producers&#39; preference), and one recommended fertilization dose. The study will be repeated for three years. Data on emergence, growth, seed production, 1000-seed weight, duration, and management will be collected and analyzed and summary of the results will be disseminated to the producers and agricultural professionals. It is anticipated that the completion of the proposed project will generate useful information on production and management of quinoa crop so as to benefit and provide additional income to producers in Wyoming and perhaps, neighboring states.

8,"Quinoa is a nutritious and broadly adapted seed crop in high demand in the U.S. and around the world. However, information regarding the optimal varieties, best management practices, and marketing options for quinoa across diverse regions in the U.S. is lacking. To further develop the domestic organic quinoa market, stakeholders have identified several high priority research needs, including (1) breeding of quinoa varieties with heat tolerance; (2) breeding of quinoa varieties with insect and pathogen resistance; and (3) the development of agronomic systems and tools that promote weed control. Our project addresses these stakeholder needs by developing new quinoa varieties and best management practices for growing organic quinoa across multiple regions in the U.S. Our long-term goal is to develop a vibrant and strong organic quinoa supply chain across the U.S., which would allow organic farms to diversify their operations and increase their profitability by incorporating quinoa.This project will provide urgently needed information regarding organic quinoa production as an alternative crop. Our research and extension objectives are designed to create economic and ecological opportunities for quinoa production across a diversity of regions in the U.S. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that U.S. growers will have new technology and information for growing organic quinoa successfully and profitably. The results of the project will contribute the facilitation of organic agricultural production by generating research information, and educating clientele on a range of topics related to quinoa production and marketing. We expect our project to increase the number of organic quinoa growers in suitable growing regions across the U.S. Additionally, we expect to provide a sound on-farm research-based platform for existing farmers and emerging quinoa growers to diversify their current cropping rotations and marketing options.Critical needs of quinoa distributors, wholesalers, and retailers focus on the need for reliable sources of domestic, organic, high-quality quinoa. Imports of quinoa have increased from 4 million pounds in 2007 to over 93 million pounds in 2015 (Nunez de Arco, personal communication). Evaluating the potential for quinoa production across diverse regions in the U.S. is important to consumers and distributors and could prove profitable for domestic farmers. Identification of varieties with specific and consistent quality traits across variable environments is critical to the successful establishment of a domestic quinoa market. Approximately 65 to 70% of annual U.S. imports of quinoa is organic (Nunez de Arco, personal communication), and the development of a strong, resilient organic and domestically grown quinoa supply is necessary to fill this need.In the U.S., quinoa is a relatively new crop to the farmer and a relatively new food to the consumer, thus we must improve our knowledge of quinoa market potential and supply-chain challenges. This research will determine the economicsof crop enterprises, including that of quinoa, in organic grain production systems. Economic findings will provide valuable information for growers in designing their own cropping systems. For example, our financial analyses will provide immediately useful information to growers about how their management practices related to pests and soil quality impact the economic returns of their operations and steps that can be used to reduce their costs and improve sustainability.Farmers seeking to diversify their production systems and marketing options, and U.S. distributors currently experiencing severe supply shortages of quinoa, stand to benefit significantly from this research. Potential economic metrics will be measured through documented changes in quinoa growing acreage in the target regions, and in the ability of quinoa distributors to meet the growing consumer demand by sourcing and supplying domestically grown, organic quinoa. Evaluation of program impact will occur through discussions with the advisory panel and by a mail survey of current and potential organic quinoa growers in WA, UT, MN, and MD in years 1 and 4 of the project. Questions will probe production practices, economics, perceptions of opportunities and constraints, and future research and Extension needs.Farmers and quinoa distributors have been instrumental in the development of this project. To identify and prioritize critical research and extension objectives for this project, we gathered input from farmers and other stakeholders through numerous field days, demonstrations and roundtables. Moreover, our preliminary variety trials have all been conducted in farmers&#39; fields across various regions of the U.S. One trial in Beltsville, MD, for example, is located on the Firebird Research Farm, which is part of University of District of Columbia (UDC). The UDC is a historically black serving college (HBSC) that has the unique position of being the only urban 1860s land grant university in the U.S. The farm holds numerous field days throughout the year attended by urban/suburban residents of the region, and between the Firebird Farm and the urban agriculture activities around the campus in DC, the university conducts agricultural outreach for over 30,000 people a year. A Stakeholder Advisory Committee, of which Firebird Farm is represented, was formed for this current proposed project in the winter/spring of 2016, consisting of representative growers, processors, wholesalers, retailers, and end-users.We will use a broad array of extension and outreach tools to reach a range of stakeholders. These include multiple field days across all target regions of this project, several webinars, Extension bulletins, workshops, participatory research with farmers, yearly reports on our proposed project website, talks and posters at farmer and academic conferences, and papers in peer-reviewed journals. The goals of the Communication/Outreach Plan are to: (1) increase awareness of challenges andopportunities for production of organic quinoa, and (2) disseminate information generated in research and demonstration trials to growers and processors.

9,"In March 2013, we established an entirely certified organic research project on a commercial grain farm in the Palouse region of eastern Washington. We are conducting this replicated study on a 1.2-ha parcel with 8 rotation trials to measure the sustainability of various organic grain rotations with and without quinoa. Our goal of this systems study is to improve the competitiveness and adoption by growers of organic quinoa and grains in mainstream conventional grain-producing regions of the Northwest. Supporting objectives include measuring the following agroecosystem components of our 3-year grain sequence treatments in our on-farm trials: crop yield and quality; insect pests and their natural enemies; weed populations and management; soil quality and fertility; interaction with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; and economic performance. Objectives also include developing outreach materials and venues for growers and stakeholders, including field days, conference workshops and presentations, and peer-reviewed journal and extension publications. By conducting integrated on-farm cropping systems research and extension efforts, this project will fill critical knowledge gaps for dryland organic crop rotations in general, and for intorudcing quinoa in particular. The systems perspective of this project, in measuring agroecological parameters that directly and indirectly affect the sustainability of organic cropping systems, demonstrates that it is aligned with the AFRI Foundational area  Agricultural Systems and Technology  and the  Food Security  Challenge Area.

10,"This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. This award supports a collaboration between an anthropologist and a soil and crop scientist to investigate several lost crops - plants that were cultivated by Indigenous people in Eastern North America (ENA) for several thousand years, but which fell out of use hundreds of years ago. When the indigenous foods of ENA are invoked, most people imagine maize, beans, and squash - the bountiful harvest spilling out of the archetypal Thanksgiving cornucopia. These crops, also known as the Three Sisters, were historically grown together by Indigenous people across ENA by the time European colonization began. But maize, beans, and many squash varieties (including pumpkins and closely related varieties) were not domesticated in ENA, nor were they a part of its earliest agricultural system. These plants were obtained through trade from Mexico then adapted by eastern farmers to local conditions by around AD 1000 (later for beans). For thousands of years before, beginning in the Late Archaic period around 3800 years ago, ancient farmers in ENA cultivated a group of native seed crops. These pre-maize crops are referred to as the Eastern Agricultural Complex (EAC). They are a botanically diverse group that includes familiar crops that are still widely grown, such as sunflower and acorn squash, as well as lost crops that are native North American relatives of barley, quinoa, and canary grass, among others. Most of the EAC crops fell out of cultivation before the arrival of European chroniclers and are not recalled in the oral traditions of Indigenous descendent communities, leaving many questions about how they were cultivated. The objective of this research is to study the living progenitors of these crops in the wild and under cultivation in order to better understand the deep history of North America and the dynamics of human-plant co-evolution in general. In addition to these research goals, this project expands the Lost Crops Garden Network, a collaboration among several anthropologists using experimental gardens as tools for experiential learning and research. Several of the EAC crops are now endangered by increased herbicide use and invasive weeds. This project documents the locations of remaining populations of lost crops, an important first step towards conserving a group of plants that have the potential to be re-domesticated and commercialized. One of the key activities funded by this award is the creation of a seed bank, which will facilitate further experimental studies by providing correctly sourced and viable seed to other researchers. These plants were important crops for millennia. With further study and improvement, they have the potential to enhance the food and economic security of contemporary farmers.This project 1) establishes the current range and habitat of EAC crop progenitors and assesses their conservation needs; 2) creates an institutionalized seed bank for EAC crop seeds; 3) studies the effects of different cultivation techniques and environmental factors on plant phenotypes and yield; 4) investigates the role of developmental plasticity and epigenetics in plant domestication; and 5) establishes an accurate range of yield estimates for each crop. This research creates interpretative links between morphologies and/or ancient DNA attributes of archaeobotanical specimens and the agricultural practices that created and maintained them. By doing so, it also 1) helps bridge the gap between historically and ethnographically recorded maize-based agriculture, and the unknown EAC agricultural system that preceded and gave rise to it; and 2) contributes to the study of social change in the eventful last 500 years prior to European colonization, an era which saw the rise of maize agriculture, structural inequality, and regional political confederacies. Globally, this project contributes to an emerging body of research on the role of developmental plasticity and epigenetics in domestication, in particular, and in evolutionary biology in general. Growth experiments will measure the effects of the agroecosystem on plants' development and reproduction, allowing the construction of more accurate optimal foraging models that take into account the immediate effects of cultivation and environmental engineering. This project also explores the epigenetic effects of DNA methylation on crop morphology. Comparative methylome sequencing of control and experimental plants can be used to identify epigenetic signals underpinning phenotypic effects. DNA methylation survives in ancient tissues, so the ancient DNA of archaeobotanical specimens can be used to assess the influence of epigenetics in the domestication process. This research requires an interdisciplinary effort, while also providing training that will enable its recipient to make an experimental approach to the study of ancient agriculture central to her future research and teaching.

11,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Plants exhibit a diverse array of breeding strategies, but the genetic changes and environmental conditions that lead to this diversity are poorly known. Pinpointing these genetic mutations and understanding the environmental conditions that favor changes in breeding system are of great interest to both evolutionary biologists and plant breeders. The plant genus Schiedea (carnation family, Caryophyllaceae) is only found on the Hawaiian Islands and is a model to better understand the evolution of breeding strategies in plants. Among the 32 species of Schiedea, some only breed with other individuals of the same species, others only self-fertilize, and others still are transitional between the two. Additionally, different outbreeding species of Schiedea use different pollinators, including a recently discovered moth found only in Hawaii. This project will apply cutting-edge DNA sequencing and analysis methods to reconstruct the genealogy of Scheidea and investigate the evolution of plant breeding strategies within the group. Data from this project will provide new insights into the evolution of plant breeding strategies that could be applied to crop species in the carnation family, including amaranth, rhubarb, quinoa and spinach. The project incorporates extensive opportunities for education and training at multiple levels, including high school teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher. The project will produce educational videos about Hawaiian plants for posting on the internet to inform the public. Researchers will also offer public seminars about Schiedea highlighting their research findings about the group.The primary aim of this project is to reconstruct the pattern of breeding system evolution in Schiedea (Caryophyllaceae) through an integrated program of field, laboratory, and genomic studies. Nuclear genome sequencing, targeted sequence capture, and Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) methods will be used to reconstruct a highly resolved phylogenetic tree of Schiedea, identify sources of phylogenetic conflict, and investigate patterns of introgression among taxa. The phylogenetic hypotheses developed will be used to interpret the evolution of breeding systems including transitions from hermaphroditism to dioecy, shifts from biotic to abiotic pollination, and traits associated with pollination biology (including scent and nectar production). Field studies and densely distributed Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) markers generated by GBS will be used to test hypotheses concerning the influence of reproductive systems on gene flow, hybridization, and population genetic structure. Data obtained during this project will be applied directly to land management in Hawaii, including the establishment of wild populations of different Schiedea species.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
